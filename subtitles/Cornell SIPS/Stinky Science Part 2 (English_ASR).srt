1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,359
University it's so so so chamber flowers

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,320
like this I should say have evolved all

4
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,840
over the world this is weird enough and

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,439
it would be worth it if this was the

6
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,118
only one but the but the thing that that

7
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:28,599
strikes me as a as an evolutionary

8
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:32,519
biologist as really interesting is that

9
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:34,719
you know Southeast Asia has these and

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,800
the genus amorphofalis as Paul knows is

11
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,200
found across the African Tropics as well

12
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,359
as the Asian Tropics so it's a large

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,039
genus that's gotten around but there's

14
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:46,039
also arisal loius okay this is a very

15
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:49,359
ancient group of vines 200 300 species

16
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:51,840
of them around the world a very ancient

17
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,479
pan tropical distribution they make trap

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,879
flowers also they just hang them up in

19
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:58,718
trees they look like pieces of dead meat

20
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,399
they're not appealing but they're

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:05,200
fantastic okay they also trap their

22
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:08,478
pollinators um the other plants in the

23
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,159
um uh in the skunk cabbage family that

24
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,679
you're familiar with all form trap

25
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,159
flowers okay there are some really funky

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,640
U milkweeds from South Africa including

27
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,159
hoodia the plant that several of you

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,640
know as a kind of appetite suppressant

29
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,680
um you know uh growth industry these are

30
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,840
succulents that look like cacti but

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,320
they're actually

32
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,320
milkweeds you know so so the compounds

33
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:34,039
that that we studied last time um in

34
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,438
this plant that we were able to identify

35
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,118
using you know analytical chemistry are

36
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:39,438
actually relatively simple I'll I'll

37
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:41,599
pass this around and you can look at it

38
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,000
this is a Time course with clocks to

39
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,438
show you what time of day we were

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,718
collecting scent and then I've basically

41
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:51,000
tracked five molecules in here um ones

42
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:53,478
that are highly indicative of carryon

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,319
mimicry or dung mimicry in plants and

44
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:57,840
the point I wanted to make was that this

45
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,599
happens around the world every continent

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,478
has a carry in flow they're just not

47
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:05,478
always is this big okay but what they're

48
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:07,879
tapping into with volatile sulfides with

49
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:11,159
phenol and crol and indol things that

50
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:14,199
you smell in in in feces of dogs or cats

51
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:18,479
or or or or or herbivores like cows and

52
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:20,679
horses um those are Universal signals or

53
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,719
cues rather they that are highly

54
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,560
reliable indicators of the presence of

55
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:27,959
rotting meat or a feces and so all

56
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,400
across the planet there are animals that

57
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,479
use those resources as dist as they are

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,560
to us as places to lay their eggs and

59
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:39,158
grow their young okay and so those guys

60
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,959
are trapped we call it a sensory trap

61
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:45,120
for them to be good mothers blowflies

62
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:47,439
have to find rotting meat or feces they

63
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,120
have to find it at just the right time

64
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:53,079
before the yeasts and molds take it over

65
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,120
um and not too early so that it's not

66
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,120
ready to be digested yet by their their

67
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,039
grubs and maggots so that's why forensic

68
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,759
entomologists are so important that that

69
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:05,959
they can track you know how long a body

70
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:08,079
has been dead by you know the stage of

71
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:09,759
development of the blowfly larae because

72
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,959
the females always make the right choice

73
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,199
as to when exactly to lay the eggs and

74
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,840
at that exact moment there's a signature

75
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:19,560
of heat of carbon dioxide and these five

76
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,280
molecules that I'm going to show you um

77
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,400
and those are her template that's how

78
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,840
females choose the plants have have

79
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,000
picked that lock they've broken the code

80
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,959
okay and what what Paul will show you is

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,560
that you know these plants whether

82
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:35,080
they're in poinsettia family whether

83
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,759
they're in the Rokia family whether

84
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,360
they're in the the arum family whether

85
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:41,359
they're in the milkweed family they've

86
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,720
all converged on the same chemistry now

87
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,439
there's other aspects of these that are

88
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:48,799
really interesting why are they blotchy

89
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:51,120
red patches of red and green why are

90
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,239
some of them really hairy I mean you can

91
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,438
speculate as to you know a really choosy

92
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,840
blowfly female would want you know a

93
00:03:56,438 --> 00:04:00,680
hairy dead body to to overos it into

94
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,840
right and a lot of the flowers are

95
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,439
chambers with holes just as an orifice

96
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,640
like an ear would be a great place to

97
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,840
lay eggs in a dead body if you were a

98
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:13,479
blowfly female or a burying Beetle or

99
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,560
something okay but but beyond the gothic

100
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:18,879
horror of this what's really interesting

101
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,000
is that it's a way of life okay there's

102
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:25,519
the decomposers of the planet that keep

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,600
that keep the ecosystem cycling use cues

104
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,399
chemical cues like this to make their

105
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,360
choices and what these plants are doing

106
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:33,198
is

107
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,319
they're code Breakers okay they found a

108
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,080
code that can't be faked except they're

109
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:39,879
faking it and the pollinators have to

110
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,680
come because if they

111
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:44,879
ignore chemistry that good they're going

112
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,560
to miss out potentially that it's not a

113
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,839
cognitive Choice they're making but but

114
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,120
they have been selected to respond to

115
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:53,478
big dead meat and that's what this is

116
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,639
this is a dead elephant

117
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:59,519
okay that's the way we see it at the

118
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,519
moment now there's other

119
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:07,839
this has been a production of Cornell

120
