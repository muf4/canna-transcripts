1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,760
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,480
University okay so I'm going to be

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:16,920
talking about the pushpull systems um

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,800
which are in in subsaharan Africa um and

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,000
it's I think this is a really

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,359
interesting example of ecological

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,960
intensification as an approach to

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:30,400
solving um the challenges of production

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,160
and so many of you know that um this

10
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:35,920
really is my first time being involved

11
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:39,039
in research in a developing country in

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,280
small holder subsistence farming systems

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:44,799
I've traveled to you know many countries

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,558
for workshops but um this is what I

15
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:51,399
decided would be really interesting to

16
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:53,119
become involved in for my um yeah so I'm

17
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:55,480
going to just speak briefly about

18
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,519
ecological intensification as a as a

19
00:00:55,479 --> 00:01:00,038
framework and an alternative path for

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,879
addressing some of the challenges and I

21
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:06,200
culture an introduction and a a tour of

22
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:08,200
push poool systems um some of my

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,960
preliminary research results so This

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,040
research is so far being conducted on

25
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:15,039
full bright funding which is you know

26
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,000
rather limited for actual data analysis

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,000
and then some future directions and and

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,280
the collaborations that have have come

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,118
out of this so we know we' facing some

30
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,680
big challenges in agriculture and I

31
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:29,280
really don't have to go over them for

32
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,880
this group um and there are many

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,040
solutions that are being proposed and we

34
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,478
can sort of you know think of them as a

35
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,399
Continuum starting with a more crop per

36
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:41,438
drop so the idea that we continue on our

37
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:43,478
current path um and improve the

38
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:46,798
efficiency of the resources that we're

39
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:49,200
using um another alternative that's

40
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,840
proposed is ecological intensification

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,799
so this idea of restoring ecological

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,880
Integrity as a way to address some of

43
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,439
the problems and and there's many sort

44
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:59,199
of a Continuum in the middle and in

45
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,158
reality we're going to need to draw from

46
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,600
both of these approaches so I don't see

47
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:07,079
them as mutually exclusive so I'm I'm an

48
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:09,478
ecologist so I'm particularly interested

49
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:11,560
in looking at ecological intensification

50
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,879
and trying to learn more about you know

51
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,439
how far can we push these

52
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:19,280
approaches and the central hypothesis of

53
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:22,039
this approach is that we could use

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,519
biodiversity um to enhance and restore

55
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:27,400
some of the ecological processes that

56
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:29,920
that support yields and productivity and

57
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,360
be be able to reduce the fossil fuel

58
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,479
based inputs that we're using so address

59
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,160
some of these issues of environmental

60
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:39,079
degradation and also food security at

61
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:42,039
the same

62
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,920
time so there is some evidence that you

63
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:46,560
know in going in this to in the

64
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,799
trajectory towards intensification and

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,479
the you know amazing increases in yields

66
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,319
that have been achieved that there have

67
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:55,158
been reductions in in biodiversity

68
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:57,318
talking mostly about plant diversity

69
00:02:55,158 --> 00:03:00,000
which then has these cascading effects

70
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:02,560
on arthropods and the below ground

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,318
communities so one graph is from the

72
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,439
midwestern us the Corn soyan Belt over a

73
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:08,878
number of

74
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:11,079
decades and then another is some work

75
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,679
that was done in Germany looking at

76
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,280
plant diversity on a somewhat smaller

77
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,480
scale um and this trend can be found in

78
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,039
many other Landscapes that as you

79
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,119
intensify you increase the tendency

80
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,400
towards monocultures either you know

81
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,799
continuous monocultures or maybe

82
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,680
alternating to crops but you have

83
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:33,120
extensive landscapes in mostly in the

84
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,959
same species or one or two

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,560
species and this kind of intensification

86
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,360
was enabled by replacing the ecosystem

87
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,959
services that were once delivered by

88
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,680
plants for example nitrogen fixation or

89
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:49,519
weed control so as perennials and other

90
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,120
species are removed we can use um

91
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,039
fertilizers we can use herbicides to

92
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,120
actually increase yields even in that

93
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:59,120
you know without using that plant

94
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,719
diversity for those outcomes and so the

95
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,840
question is can we go in the opposite

96
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,280
direction can we increase plant

97
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,479
diversity and have an impact on how much

98
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,400
energy and I'm using it as a proxy for

99
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:12,438
inputs on the inputs that we're using

100
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,920
can we can we go in this direction can

101
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:17,918
we get tangible benefits by managing

102
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:21,199
plant diversity at multiple scales So

103
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,319
within the field the farm and across

104
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,040
Landscapes and there are some evidence

105
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:28,599
that's L that links biodiversity both in

106
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,720
in space and time to improvements in

107
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,919
yield they a few studies that have

108
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,360
actually looked at some energy

109
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,918
biodiversity relationships I'm just

110
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,840
going to put up three examples here

111
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:41,279
one's in um in Africa in the same sort

112
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:42,719
of region um where they were looking at

113
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,879
biodiversity both in terms of

114
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,600
intercropping and rotation and its

115
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:51,519
impact on

116
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:53,720
yields and um another study is that came

117
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,399
out it mainly focuses on pollination and

118
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,160
I would say that pollination as an

119
00:04:55,399 --> 00:05:00,560
ecosystem service and the impact on

120
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,240
those crops that require pollinators is

121
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:07,319
probably the best example and the most

122
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,639
studied um case where we can link

123
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:12,719
biodiversity across Landscapes and at

124
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:14,439
Farm scale to concrete benefits in

125
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,039
yields and you know we can go in either

126
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:19,600
direction some people study Landscapes

127
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,439
and look at you know how homogeneous

128
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,840
does a landscape need to become before

129
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,759
it impacts yield negatively they find as

130
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,758
you get to Landscapes that have fewer

131
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,319
and fewer kinds of species plants and

132
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,800
habitats you

133
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,720
um reduced abundance and um numbers of

134
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,000
pollinators and reduced yields in the

135
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,000
pollination dependent crops these are

136
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,120
going the opp Opposite Direction and

137
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,759
then the most recent study which was

138
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,319
carried out across many regions um on

139
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:52,038
you know multiple continents found this

140
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:54,879
very um strong relationship between

141
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:57,399
plant biodiversity pollinator diversity

142
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,959
and abundance and yields and it did vary

143
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,879
depending on the size of the farm so

144
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,359
there's some intricacies in here that

145
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:06,439
the entomologists care about U but this

146
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,038
is just suggesting that we need to

147
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:11,038
understand more about these processes

148
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,680
and look at how far can we push it and

149
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,680
how can we use these methods to

150
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,160
complicate to complement the inputs that

151
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,360
we're using and this is particularly

152
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,000
important for those small holder systems

153
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,319
where you know they don't have the

154
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,279
resources at this point to purchase all

155
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,879
of these

156
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:31,559
inputs so um I have been aware of the

157
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:33,800
push pool intercropping system for a

158
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,038
long time I used it in my agricology

159
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:40,319
course as an example of um where

160
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:43,560
multiple ecological mechanisms are used

161
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,759
to manage pests and this is uh Zar Khan

162
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,639
who's the scientist who's been working

163
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,400
on the system for 20 years and he

164
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,759
developed it along with a number of

165
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:55,120
collaborators some at rothamstead in

166
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,759
particular and um this this system was

167
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,519
developed by the by CPE which is a small

168
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,639
NGO that's based in Kenya Works in this

169
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:06,240
the region of subsaharan Africa so he's

170
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:10,160
my sippi is my host institution in Kenya

171
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:13,319
and zaran is my main

172
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,680
collaborator so just a little geography

173
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,840
here's Kenya straddling the equator i'

174
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,840
had never been there before I went to

175
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:24,359
actually start working and visiting

176
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:27,119
these Farms um aipe is located over in

177
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:30,319
Western Kenya with the red X's right on

178
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,240
Lake uh the shores of Lake Victoria

179
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,840
and that that's their second research

180
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,400
campus they also have an office in

181
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:39,119
Nairobi and then the area where they

182
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:42,959
work is this this region of Western

183
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,199
Kenya which is a a humid a semihumid

184
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:48,318
tropical climate there's there's quite a

185
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,400
lot of variation in the the rainfall um

186
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,800
that actually occurs there anywhere from

187
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:56,399
800 to 1600 millimeters and in most

188
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,319
locations it's a bodal distribution so

189
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,560
there's two growing Seasons however very

190
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,598
far up north there's one long rainy

191
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,000
season up near um catali in the sort of

192
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:10,519
their Northern most border of the area

193
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,560
they work in so um there are uh Farmers

194
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:15,478
using push pool systems in other parts

195
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,720
of Kenya and also in in other subsaharan

196
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:21,519
countries but the the most of them are

197
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,479
concentrated in that um let see if I can

198
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:28,399
go back in this this region of Western

199
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:31,560
Kenya okay so what are the challenges

200
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:34,759
that these farmers are facing stemborers

201
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,000
are a big uh problem and there are many

202
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:39,200
different species of stemborers I forget

203
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,559
there's there's more than a hundred I

204
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,240
forget exactly how many um there are so

205
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:47,119
that that's the major arthropod pests

206
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,200
there are others but that one is the the

207
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,440
biggest one that has the be the largest

208
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,440
impact on yields and then the other

209
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,480
serious problem is striga which is a

210
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,920
parasitic

211
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:03,639
plant um and striga

212
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:05,879
actually um in addition to you know

213
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:09,759
taking nutrients and carbon from The

214
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:12,360
Maze plant striga is is pathogenic so it

215
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:14,519
it actually injects compounds into the

216
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,000
plant that CA that disrupt its

217
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,600
metabolism so the stunting of growth

218
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,679
that happens so here's the Str that

219
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:25,278
actually attaches right to the maze root

220
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:28,519
are largely due to this disruption of

221
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:30,519
metabolism and sort of you know actual

222
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,480
disease

223
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:35,560
develops stria has a huge impact on

224
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,440
yields I mean it just can decimate

225
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:39,599
yields once it gets into a field it

226
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,279
produces lots of seeds and it can just

227
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,480
keep spreading so these are the

228
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:47,439
challenges and the the push pull system

229
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,039
is is basically the the idea is to

230
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,720
manipulate the plants both in the field

231
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:55,439
and sort of on the borders of the field

232
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,759
to address these um constraints that

233
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,200
that are impairing yields and the work

234
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:03,039
began in the 1990s and at that point the

235
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,519
focus was on the stem boards and it

236
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,719
began with screening a bunch of

237
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,240
especially grass species to look for

238
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,200
plants that would serve as trap crops so

239
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,320
that would attract the pests and plants

240
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,200
that would repel the arthropods they

241
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,959
were looking for both of these and this

242
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,759
is why it's called a push pool is sort

243
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:23,119
of named after the the main focus of

244
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:25,480
managing the insects and this idea of

245
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,440
push pull systems has been around for

246
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,879
you know before the 1990s and there was

247
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,079
some work done in Australia um so this

248
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,320
is not the only case where this approach

249
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:37,919
is being used but it is an example of an

250
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:43,000
extremely effective um

251
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:44,919
case so by accident um zeran discovered

252
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,879
desmodium he he was just you know

253
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:49,479
collecting seeds he got some seeds for

254
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,838
it and he would screen you know whatever

255
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:56,120
plant species he was Finding and it

256
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:59,079
turned out that desmodium not only had

257
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,519
um a a sort of a repelling effect

258
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:03,958
towards the stemborers but it also

259
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,759
helped to control the striga and and

260
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:09,759
this was a huge Discovery because when

261
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:12,720
they first began promoting the system to

262
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:15,159
Farmers as a as a way of managing

263
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,320
stemborers the far and it it is a

264
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:19,719
ecologically it is a somewhat complex

265
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,720
system to manage so Growers need to

266
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,720
learn how to how to actually manage it

267
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,399
and they do and they also have

268
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,600
contributed to some of the Innovations

269
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:30,839
and I'll talk about that later um they

270
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,680
the farm said look this is great that it

271
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,120
controls stor but you know if you can

272
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:36,359
get rid of the striga then we'll

273
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,399
consider intercropping and you know

274
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,759
doing this so it it's really a good

275
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:44,519
thing that he found a plant that could

276
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,879
actually effectively control the striga

277
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,200
because it by far is the you know

278
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,720
greater has a greater impact on yields

279
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,399
and is of more concern to the farmers

280
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,639
and of course desmodium is a legum it's

281
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:57,679
a perennial legume so it has the added

282
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:59,600
benefit of fixing

283
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,799
nitrogen and there's been a lot of

284
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,800
improvements over time um to the system

285
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:07,399
from you know the beginning so there's

286
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,958
now multiple species that can be used

287
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:10,879
and the farmers have pushed some of this

288
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,119
Innovation by giving feedback on what

289
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:15,240
they

290
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,919
need so here's just a diagram of how the

291
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,560
system works and there's been a huge

292
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:22,759
amount of work on the chemical ecology

293
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:26,958
the entomology in the system and and

294
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:29,519
very little work on on the soils um so

295
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:31,679
the desmodium is planted in between the

296
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,879
maze rows they plant their maze fairly

297
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,319
far apart so you don't they don't have

298
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:38,439
to adjust the spacing in order to

299
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,879
intercrop they normally intercrop um

300
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,800
food legumes commonly so common Bean for

301
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:46,078
example or groundnut um so they they

302
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:48,719
plant the desmodium in the middle this

303
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:51,439
to the arthropod smells like a damaged

304
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,160
maze plant so that's I mean there been

305
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,320
like 11 to 13 chemicals that are have

306
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,879
been identified that mediate these um

307
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,040
exchanges between the plants and the

308
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:05,799
arthopods

309
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:07,759
so those act as the repelling plants the

310
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:09,879
stemborers when they go out of the field

311
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:13,919
find the napor grass which is planted as

312
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:16,639
a border around the field that is a trap

313
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,799
crop that attracts the stem bers they

314
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,799
lay their eggs in it it's a super duper

315
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:23,120
trap crop because it actually ends up

316
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:27,278
killing 95% of the larvae when the

317
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:30,360
larvae hatch out on a Napier grass plant

318
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:32,439
they get stuck in some of the the um the

319
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,600
Honeydew that that the plant secretes

320
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,480
it's got like some sticky goo that it

321
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,720
secretes near the base of its leaves so

322
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,199
many of them end up dying um so it

323
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,040
reduces the the population and then the

324
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:48,639
desmodium also releases some root exat

325
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:50,278
that stimulate germination of the striga

326
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,839
however it's a suicide germination the

327
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:55,919
striga germinates but it cannot elongate

328
00:13:52,839 --> 00:14:00,399
to connect to the maze Roots so it ends

329
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:02,479
up dying and why can it not elong

330
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,278
why can't it elongate the seed tube I

331
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,920
forget the technical name of it well the

332
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:08,879
chemical that's produced by the

333
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,838
desmodium is for some reason stimulates

334
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:14,000
to germinate but then there's not the

335
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:16,199
next step that allows it to elongate and

336
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,559
I I don't that's about as far as I know

337
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:20,198
because it there are a lot of um

338
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:23,319
mechanisms that are involved I have a

339
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:23,319
slide of that but I left it

340
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:29,638
out so yes um so that's the main part of

341
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:32,799
the blowr work that's done though is on

342
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,959
the the disodium control of the striga

343
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,519
so these are just I'm going to show you

344
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,479
some pictures this is at the research

345
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,959
station there's several long-term

346
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,680
experiments there you can see the maze

347
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,078
with the desmodium which is quite a

348
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:47,039
vigorous grower and it's managed in ways

349
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:48,799
that reduce the competition with the

350
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,958
maze in terms of the timing of cutting

351
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,719
this is also a forage Napier grass also

352
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,758
serves as a forage and you can see that

353
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,879
it's also susceptible to the striga the

354
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,759
purple flowers of the striga and what's

355
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:01,958
amazing is these this is only like about

356
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,360
a you know 5T and there's there's

357
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:06,679
absolutely no striga in this field the

358
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,240
desmodium is incredibly effective at

359
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:09,679
controlling the stri this is one thing

360
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,839
we're wondering about is will there be

361
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:15,319
some over time some adaptation in the

362
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,959
striga to be able to overcome the

363
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,720
desmodium but so far there is no

364
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:22,719
evidence for that and I want you to

365
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,079
notice the size of this Napier grass

366
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,120
because it's rarely on a farm do you see

367
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:29,198
the grass get to this this size this is

368
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,360
one of the issues that the farmer are

369
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:34,639
harvesting Napier grass and the

370
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,639
desmodium to feed their

371
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,440
livestock so early in the season so the

372
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:41,600
the desmodium is cut back quite

373
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,279
drastically when the maze is planted so

374
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,278
it's it's very small when the plants are

375
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:46,879
small and then as the maze starts

376
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,879
growing it it begins to cover but you

377
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,559
can see it's much smaller than was under

378
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:53,399
the large plants and then by the you

379
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:56,278
know the time the maze is large it can

380
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,600
be a very thick carpet and sometime

381
00:15:56,278 --> 00:15:59,120
sometimes even grow

382
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,159
upright

383
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,159
and this is out in one of the Farms so I

384
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,919
want you to notice here's the you know

385
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:07,919
very highly harvested border that's

386
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:10,479
almost

387
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:12,439
unrecognizable and many farmers are over

388
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,759
harvesting these accessory plants so

389
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,480
this is one question that we want to

390
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,240
look at is how much harvesting pressure

391
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:21,800
can these systems bear and still Garner

392
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,959
the benefits of the the um desmodium and

393
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:25,919
the grass borders and then this is an

394
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:27,879
adjacent field is another one of those

395
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:31,240
Farmers fields that she hasn't um

396
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:33,480
transitioned to pushpull and you can see

397
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,360
the difference there

398
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:39,399
so the benefits have been documented

399
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,120
extensively by work out in farms um in

400
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:44,958
terms of yield

401
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,440
increases um the control of striga and

402
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,958
simor and and very a little bit of work

403
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,680
on soil fertility most of the

404
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,599
conclusions about soil fertility are

405
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:54,359
sort of anecdotal or indirect and based

406
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,079
on yield improvements and the plants

407
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,680
look more vigorous and we know nitrogen

408
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:00,799
fixation is going on and that's why one

409
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:03,758
area I'm very interested in trying to

410
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,759
actually document um there are

411
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,279
significant improvements in livestock

412
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,879
production because now there's better

413
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:13,038
quality fodder for them and and also

414
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,240
more of it so both of these plants serve

415
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:17,480
as fod and this is a very important

416
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,000
outcome and benefit and one reason why

417
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,360
farmers are interested in adopting this

418
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,720
system um and as a result um there are

419
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,719
some economic benefits usually the

420
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,640
yields go up sufficiently so there's

421
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,319
extra maze for selling and there's work

422
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,919
going on now looking at how this all

423
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:35,918
pans out in terms of human

424
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,960
nutrition so at this point about 96,000

425
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:44,079
Farmers have adopted the system mostly

426
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:47,519
in Western Kenya but also in Uganda

427
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:49,839
Malawi and uh Tanzania particularly in

428
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,798
areas where strike is a problem that's

429
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,519
that's you know and also some of the the

430
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:56,759
areas that are a little drier where

431
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:59,319
there's there's other challenges um and

432
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:01,440
zipe has been instrumental in um

433
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:03,759
disseminating this they have a

434
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,759
demonstration garden at the farm where

435
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,119
they have the system at different stages

436
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:09,960
and this is I thought some of the

437
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:12,678
extension folks might be interested in

438
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,519
this because this is a complex system to

439
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:17,200
manage and um they can bring Farmers

440
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,279
there for intensive trainings and they

441
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,080
can show them you know at this stage you

442
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,158
need to do this and at this stage you

443
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:24,798
need to trim this is when you trim the

444
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:27,760
desmodium and they can actually get

445
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:30,599
practice doing some of these things um

446
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:32,519
so they they um plant they have

447
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:34,519
irrigation so they have at least sort of

448
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:35,720
six plots that are at different stages

449
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:37,319
when you would carry out different

450
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,798
management and they have a whole other

451
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:45,119
sort of system of Educators and

452
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:47,639
materials however beyond their efforts

453
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,519
Farmers have played an incredible role

454
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,759
in disseminating this technology which

455
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:55,319
is probably important in the case of

456
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:58,079
something that is this you know complex

457
00:18:55,319 --> 00:19:00,678
to to manage and one of the most famous

458
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:01,879
Farm Farmers is Sarah Obama who I met I

459
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:02,960
thought they were kidding me when they

460
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,159
said they were going to have me meet

461
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,038
Sarah Obama thought oh they probably

462
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:08,360
have a grandmother all over the country

463
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,079
and they tell Americans you're going to

464
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:12,678
meet Sarah

465
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,599
Obama but then I got there and I saw the

466
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:18,280
sign so I and I saw the military

467
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:20,279
guarding her farm so she she was active

468
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:22,440
at one point in in um some of the you

469
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:25,119
know the pushpull dissemination efforts

470
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,960
but she's pretty low-key right at this

471
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:30,839
point um yeah so uh I want to show you

472
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,519
some I think this is where yeah I want

473
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:34,959
to show you uh just if the video works

474
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:38,000
we didn't get to test it because of all

475
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,200
the technical issues so now so you're

476
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,159
going to see two farmers and these these

477
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,600
two farmers Have Been instrumental in

478
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:46,480
disseminating the system um one of them

479
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:49,599
organize Mary first one you're going to

480
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,279
see is organized um groups where they

481
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:52,719
you know meet periodically talk about

482
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:55,158
what's working talk about what they need

483
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,759
to improve they bounce you know ideas

484
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:58,760
and problems off of each other she's

485
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:01,519
going to talk briefly briefly about

486
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:03,679
striga and then the next farmer is

487
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:06,639
called the grandmother of pushpo by many

488
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,240
of the um farmers in the region because

489
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,159
she adopted a bunch of farmers were

490
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,919
invited to this meeting and she was the

491
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,840
only one that came none of the men came

492
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:20,038
so she got trained in pushpo and she's

493
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:22,480
been um you know training farmers in her

494
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:24,640
community so the pushp farmers tend to

495
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,319
be in clusters she's going to talk in

496
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,720
her own language uh about the push pool

497
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:32,599
and just but I

498
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,400
can't um but show you two of she's got

499
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:37,519
two Fields a push pull and a non- push

500
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,159
pull I'm going to have

501
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:43,000
to

502
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,880
yes five is

503
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,319
local

504
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:52,400
yes and did you have strier here before

505
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:52,399
yes that was strier huh

506
00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:00,320
hey to be beautiful with I don't yellow

507
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:03,960
pink pink flowers flowers

508
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:03,960
flowers yes

509
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,759
okay and how long

510
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:23,899
[Music]

511
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:30,038
has

512
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:36,678
I know I know she is and you know how

513
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:40,759
much she put

514
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:40,759
on amazingly small

515
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:49,640
amount yes so she has had pushpull

516
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,440
Fields since 1999 she took out one and

517
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:55,080
and S and you know rearranged her fields

518
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:59,200
and that field has been Push Pull since

519
00:21:55,079 --> 00:22:01,678
I think 2004 2005 and you know sometimes

520
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,519
they try to do experiments so she did an

521
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,720
experiment she put fertilizer on her

522
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:07,839
push pool and she's convinced that that

523
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:12,079
helped her yields that's what she said

524
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:13,519
was however she put like five kilograms

525
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,158
on the whole

526
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:18,599
field at least that's what we can

527
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:22,240
understand so this is the challenge of

528
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:23,719
doing un on farm work because um we

529
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,359
suggested well what if you you put

530
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,519
fertilizer on both of your Fields

531
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:30,759
because many in many many cases we see

532
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:33,278
Fields where they are putting fertilizer

533
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:35,079
on all of their fields and on the field

534
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:37,919
station they put fertilizer on Push Pull

535
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:41,480
and non-push Pull and it seems like the

536
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:44,840
striga is the main one of the main

537
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,839
issues okay so um I'm working with

538
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:49,079
pretty much all enologists in this

539
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:50,720
system I'm very interested in what's

540
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:53,439
going on with the desmodium it's a

541
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,679
perennial legum there's a lot of

542
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,558
questions about how the nitrogen is

543
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,480
being delivered to the maze there's two

544
00:22:57,558 --> 00:23:00,839
possible

545
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,278
Pathways and the entomologists are

546
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:05,439
convinced that this is the important

547
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:07,880
pathway um just because they know that

548
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:12,600
legumes can you know transfer nitrogen

549
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:14,360
to non- legumes um but I you know I

550
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:16,278
actually think this this may be

551
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:18,038
important early on but this probably is

552
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:20,240
the major pathway later on because we

553
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:21,839
know that you know nitrogen's going to

554
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,319
contribute to building organic matter

555
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:25,399
and that's another mechanism for

556
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:28,720
delivering nitrogen so these are the

557
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:31,278
kinds of questions um that started out

558
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,720
with I was really interested in looking

559
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:36,200
at how the disodium in crop defects the

560
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,880
flows of nitrogen and building organic

561
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,080
matter and then also looking at some of

562
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,360
the other related benefits of building

563
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:45,839
of the organic matter and then

564
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:48,119
understanding some of the sort of the

565
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,759
Ecology of nitrogen fixation in the

566
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:52,038
system there's several desmodium species

567
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:54,400
there's a lot of variation in

568
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:57,960
environment and also in management

569
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,400
history um and if we can understand this

570
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,278
then we could actually make

571
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,120
recommendations to the farmers about

572
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:05,079
when they might need nitrogen fertilizer

573
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:07,000
and when they may not need it um what

574
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:09,599
the evidence is that farmers are

575
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,240
applying nitrogen fertilizers sometimes

576
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:15,000
at high rates mostly at very low rates

577
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,278
and that they're they're you know

578
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,720
they're not really discriminating

579
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:20,400
between their pushpull and their non-

580
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,919
pushpull field so they may put just as

581
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,120
much fertilizer on the push pull Fields

582
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,640
where the legume is when there other

583
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,959
fields really might be nitrogen starved

584
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,038
and in we were seeing some evidence that

585
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,880
adding nitrogen suppresses nitrogen

586
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:36,398
fixation when we look at the desmodium

587
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,679
in fields where they put on a fair

588
00:24:36,398 --> 00:24:41,918
amount of nitrogen we would just find

589
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:44,919
very few nodules and not you know

590
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:47,000
active um and then some questions about

591
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:49,640
how they use their land and how much how

592
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,079
heavily they harvest these um crops

593
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,840
especially the desmodium and when can

594
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:56,960
they start harvesting it

595
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:59,359
heavily um so I'm going to go into some

596
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,000
preliminary result results um I started

597
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,479
with sampling on the field station and

598
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,319
these are just results from three of

599
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,798
their long-term experiments showing

600
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:10,398
about a 30% increase in soil nitrogen

601
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:11,720
this is from the 20 cm dep so basically

602
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:14,479
the tillage

603
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,440
layer the kind of a surprising finding

604
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,120
was this difference in extractable

605
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,320
phosphorus so both the pushpull and the

606
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:23,798
non-p pushpull systems it's a tongue

607
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:24,918
twister have received the same amount of

608
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:28,000
phosphorus

609
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:30,200
fertilizer um but when you do

610
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,599
extractable phosphorus there's this

611
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,120
significant difference between the

612
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:36,359
pushpull and non- pushpull soils and we

613
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:37,959
haven't looked at the fractions and

614
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:39,359
exactly where the phosphorus is but

615
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,640
that's something we're very interested

616
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:43,158
in following up on did you look at

617
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:47,200
differences in

618
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:49,559
PH uh um there I've measured

619
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,720
P when I got there there had been

620
00:25:49,558 --> 00:25:55,558
absolutely no soil measurements done

621
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,960
even on the experiment station so the pH

622
00:25:55,558 --> 00:26:00,278
um does not show a significant shift sh

623
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,399
from Push Pull to non- pushpull except

624
00:26:00,278 --> 00:26:05,038
for in one experiment which is the

625
00:26:02,398 --> 00:26:06,398
non-replicated experiment the oldest one

626
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:08,359
and in that one I think it's because

627
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:11,798
some of the manure they added probably

628
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:16,719
has some calcium carbonate in it um but

629
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:19,038
it's very patchy patchily distributed um

630
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,759
and then you know we would expect these

631
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:22,839
differences in the organic matter pools

632
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:24,720
to show up most significantly in the

633
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:26,759
active pools so the particular organic

634
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,159
matter and these are very important to

635
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:32,000
look at because they do have the

636
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:34,960
greatest impact on soil structure um and

637
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,558
on uh nutrient flows so the particularly

638
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:41,278
the uded particular organic matter could

639
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:43,200
be an important source of nutrients and

640
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:46,919
for people that like to see this so this

641
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,200
is from the top 5 to six CM just the the

642
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:52,120
sort of the difference in the amount of

643
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,399
residue going into these soils um this

644
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:57,398
is from the longest experiment so that's

645
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:58,798
the the free particulate organic matter

646
00:26:57,398 --> 00:27:00,798
and and we took these pictures for

647
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:03,038
extension purposes and then the uded

648
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:04,879
particulate organic matter which this is

649
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:08,398
a you know a big difference to be able

650
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,799
to see differences in these fractions is

651
00:27:08,398 --> 00:27:13,199
is just a sort of a testament to how

652
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:15,359
profound the you know the impact is of

653
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,880
having this perennial

654
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:20,678
legume so um I was very interested in

655
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,080
collaborating with them to do some work

656
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:25,559
out on farms and see how this this

657
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:28,398
practice actually affects the the um the

658
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:30,319
farmer soils

659
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:32,479
um because their practices I mean on the

660
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:35,960
field station we could make critique

661
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,278
these are optimally managed they are not

662
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,399
aggressively harvesting the supporting

663
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:42,200
plants I mean they are harvesting them

664
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:43,319
and they are using them for fodder

665
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,798
they're harvesting them in the

666
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:49,000
recommended way um which is not nearly

667
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:51,639
as as aggressive as some of the farmers

668
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,759
who have small land Holdings and really

669
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:57,759
need fodder for their for their um

670
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:59,480
livestock are doing so um the first the

671
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,158
the cluster that I've been focusing on

672
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,519
in this initial work is located near the

673
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,278
village of Bea and this just gives you

674
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:09,558
an idea of the landscape and this area

675
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:12,200
um has a rainfall that's sort of in the

676
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:15,678
you know higher to medium in of 1,00 to

677
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:19,360
1200 millimeters it is is

678
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:21,320
bodal um and this in this region Farmers

679
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:24,158
have some very small Holdings fractions

680
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:26,480
of hectare so the the size of the Farms

681
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,278
varies with the region some of the

682
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,679
farmers in this region have a tenth of

683
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:34,679
an acre or so

684
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:37,640
um but on the plus side this is an early

685
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:39,640
adopting region meant to say that um and

686
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,278
that's partly because striga was a very

687
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,840
severe problem in this in this area so

688
00:28:42,278 --> 00:28:46,119
and you can still see you can see lots

689
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:48,558
of striga and non- pushpull Fields out

690
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:50,319
in this in this region and there's some

691
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:54,079
you know Fields a lot of fields started

692
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:56,960
in two between 2002 and 2005 so to do

693
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:59,319
this on Farm research um we took fields

694
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,240
and div divided them into at least three

695
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:03,720
replicates and sometimes if it was a

696
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,000
large field we would divide it in half

697
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,759
and then divide those into three

698
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,038
replicates so the design because there's

699
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:12,200
some rolling topography and there are

700
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:14,599
some changes in soil types that are you

701
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,319
know occur on a fairly small scale our

702
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:17,319
first priority was to try to match the

703
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:21,480
soil

704
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:23,319
types um and so the analyses will be you

705
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,558
know viewing them we'll use them as

706
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:28,359
pairs um in order to compare Push Pull

707
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:30,918
and non-push pull effect so I have some

708
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:33,079
of the data from the Farms but not all

709
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:34,759
of the the non you know sort of the

710
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:37,199
background texture and all of that

711
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:38,759
information I don't have that yet so um

712
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,640
we went out divided them into these

713
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:43,359
replicates and and collected soil

714
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,440
samples from 20 cmers usually and made

715
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:49,639
composite samples at least you know six

716
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:52,159
to 12 cores depending on the size um we

717
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,919
interviewed the farmers briefly and I

718
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,799
was really dependent on the extensionist

719
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:59,080
to help me because a lot of the farmers

720
00:29:55,798 --> 00:30:03,119
do not speak English Mary is one of the

721
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:05,119
exceptions um and so our findings on the

722
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:06,798
farms are similar they're they're

723
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:09,158
similar to what we found on the

724
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:11,519
experiment station but much more

725
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:14,080
variable as you would expect given the

726
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:16,798
the differences so five out of eight

727
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:20,398
pairs showed an increase in the soil

728
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:24,000
nitrogen and or organic matter um in one

729
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:25,639
case it's it's reversed and and what we

730
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,759
hope to do is to look at how

731
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,038
environmental variation and also

732
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:31,558
management practices so the you know

733
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:33,798
severity of the harvesting how much is

734
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:35,558
being harvested relative to you know

735
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:38,720
remaining in the fields and how that

736
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:41,000
impacts um these

737
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,880
Dynamics um we also found the same

738
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,798
result with the extractable phosphorus

739
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,720
and I do know that in this pair because

740
00:30:45,798 --> 00:30:50,639
these farmers are neighbors that she

741
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:53,880
applied phosphorus fertilizer and she

742
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,880
did not um and the others it is very

743
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,880
hard to get accurate fertilizer

744
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,960
information

745
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,679
from Farmers and I think we've finally

746
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,240
figured out a way to do it I won't tell

747
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,960
you what it is but we've had better

748
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,000
success when I went back um this past

749
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,600
June at getting information that we feel

750
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
more confident so that's kind of where

751
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:14,719
we're going with that and the last thing

752
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,919
I'll show you with these preliminary

753
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,278
results and this is some of the early

754
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:21,200
work to look at nitrogen fixation

755
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:22,599
Dynamics and I'm in the process of

756
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,200
trying to find funding because it's

757
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:26,959
pretty expensive proposition to do the

758
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,798
isotope analyses that are needed for

759
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,159
this but I did do a survey and just

760
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:34,558
looking at the Delta n shift so this is

761
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:37,200
the Delta n and as it gets to be more

762
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:40,119
positive in the desmodium so in the

763
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,639
nitrogen fixing plant we can conclude

764
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:44,199
that nitrogen fixation is being reduced

765
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:45,798
so it's it's the you know A reduced

766
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,240
proportion of nitrogen is coming from

767
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:50,359
the atmosphere that's the interpretation

768
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,200
and we do see this positive relationship

769
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:55,879
the longer the farm or the soil is under

770
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,319
pushp we know the nitrogen fertility

771
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,720
goes up and we would predict that that

772
00:31:57,319 --> 00:32:02,079
that would suppress nitrogen fixation

773
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,200
the legum down regulates and we we see

774
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,278
evidence for this um a pretty good

775
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,319
relationship there's some outliers and

776
00:32:06,278 --> 00:32:09,880
this would this is where you know we we

777
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:12,798
would assume uh oh my Line's in the

778
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:15,159
wrong place if it was at zero that would

779
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:18,918
be 100% nitrogen fixation which we you

780
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:22,880
know don't normally see how' that line

781
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:25,559
move a mystery all right do I still have

782
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,639
five minutes is that it okay now I'm

783
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:30,038
going to talk even faster no

784
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:31,678
so future directions I'm going to talk a

785
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:33,038
little bit about the challenges because

786
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,399
the farmers are playing a really

787
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:38,839
essential role in overcoming some of the

788
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:41,558
challenges um and one of the major um

789
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:43,558
challenges is access to the seeds or to

790
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:45,638
the materials for these accessory plants

791
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:48,278
and I'm talking about the the Napier

792
00:32:45,638 --> 00:32:50,519
grass the braia braulia grass which is

793
00:32:48,278 --> 00:32:53,159
the other grass and the desmodium in

794
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:57,159
particular the green desmodium which is

795
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:59,000
a more drought resistant um species if

796
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:00,960
had a very difficult time getting it to

797
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,519
produce seeds in the you know in the

798
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,558
climate in Kenya they're you know sort

799
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:06,759
of a problem that they've been wrestling

800
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:09,480
with and here again the farmers have

801
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:13,038
been playing a crucial role in this this

802
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:16,639
is Elizabeth Elizabeth um oh dear I'm

803
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:21,038
forgetting her last name oh well um I

804
00:33:16,638 --> 00:33:24,359
have it written down um and so she has a

805
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:27,879
um a nursery for the bararia grass so

806
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:30,439
she's been propagating this and you know

807
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,000
as part of her Outreach work um

808
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,200
disseminating this so some of the

809
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,798
farmers are actually hired they receive

810
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,759
a stapen from aipe to perform these

811
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:41,038
roles of Outreach and they occasionally

812
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:42,638
take it further and actually do problem

813
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:44,278
solving such as this she realized a

814
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:47,798
major issue is the Farmers can't get a

815
00:33:44,278 --> 00:33:51,319
hold of the of the material and I'm

816
00:33:47,798 --> 00:33:55,079
going to try to play one more video of

817
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:58,398
uh oh I'll show you her picture of Ura

818
00:33:55,079 --> 00:34:02,119
Ura metho and um her Farm is pretty

819
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:04,599
amazing um and when you're watching this

820
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:07,039
video you might want to just watch her

821
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:09,878
expression while the extensionist is

822
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:13,000
translating because um she's

823
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:17,118
barely hanging on to not cracking

824
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:21,918
up farm so here's her farm

825
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:24,480
and and we're I'm at the lower push pool

826
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:27,759
field and they've

827
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,039
planted a lot of green doz moing

828
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,040
at the bottom of this field which is

829
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:39,398
overgrown the braulia

830
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:39,398
grass and it is full of flowers and

831
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:46,720
seeds and we took some pictures of the

832
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:49,519
seeds but um I think they're having some

833
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:51,480
very successful seed

834
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:53,039
production yes so we don't know if it's

835
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,719
the material they started with or

836
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:55,719
something about the

837
00:34:55,878 --> 00:34:58,878
environment

838
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:11,519
this is Rachel

839
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:15,838
who is okay yeah so these are SE

840
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:19,079
for from her the SM Feld she's trying to

841
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:21,960
B to see if she can get seeds out of the

842
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:25,920
gra of so this is the seeds that she has

843
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:28,400
been able to harvest from um just a

844
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:32,200
small part of her Farm where she's

845
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:36,039
trying out this and um this is just part

846
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:37,719
of it she's going to uh Harvest more

847
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:40,358
from her field so this one she's going

848
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:43,199
to put it to dry up before she can try

849
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:44,960
to extract the seeds out of it yeah and

850
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:47,078
that was Rachel um she's the

851
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,480
extensionist from aipe that I work with

852
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:50,839
most of the time and she was also my

853
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,960
translator she did a lot of the

854
00:35:50,838 --> 00:35:56,119
interviewing she engages in the social

855
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:59,159
science research that they they carry

856
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:02,920
out and um extension

857
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:04,480
Outreach okay so future research

858
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,960
directions I promise I'll cover it in

859
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,920
two minutes um so in in terms of the

860
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,400
work that I'm pursuing I'm very

861
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,000
interested in trying to do some more

862
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,760
detailed work on nitrogen cycling in

863
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
these systems to try to understand the

864
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:21,680
flows and and and um transfer of

865
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,280
nitrogen to the maze um and I'm also

866
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:26,239
working with some collaborators to to

867
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,480
look at some broader questions relating

868
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:31,000
the below ground changes that take place

869
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,639
in push pushpull and how those affect

870
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,199
the arthropods that are interacting with

871
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,239
the plants so particularly Andre

872
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:38,239
Kessler's interested in how plant

873
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:41,279
secondary compounds might shift and that

874
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:43,639
may impact these interactions and then

875
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,119
um we there there's a group of us that

876
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:47,920
have been formulating an idea to do some

877
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:50,160
research on the long-term

878
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,280
sustainability um in the pushpull

879
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:52,559
systems because there's a lot of

880
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,680
questions that come up about the

881
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:56,400
longevity and how affect you know how

882
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:59,639
these systems can continue to be

883
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,960
effective Ive over time um and these are

884
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:03,920
so this is sort of the core

885
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,760
collaborators there's um Kata peda and

886
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,480
Andre Kesler who are the two Cornell

887
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,800
faculty they're both entomologists that

888
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,039
I'm working with and then the folks at

889
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:15,039
aipe there's Professor KH um who some of

890
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:17,480
you may have he's sort of periodically

891
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:21,719
had appointments at Cornell um Dr

892
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:25,000
Charles modega and um Charlie um oh

893
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:27,159
shoot P pitar what Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy

894
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,800
pitar me and my name

895
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:32,480
and so um and he's the carries out the

896
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,280
social science research so looking at um

897
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,480
the sort of dissemination of knowledge

898
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,599
and how this impacts things like labor

899
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,639
demands and they're sort of getting into

900
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:42,640
collaborating with some nutritionists so

901
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:45,519
we're especially concerned about two

902
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:47,400
issues one is over time as you increase

903
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:49,960
the proportion of the landscape that's

904
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,720
in these systems how will that possibly

905
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,960
impact the herbivores are these

906
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:55,719
arthropods going to become resistant you

907
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,559
know are you're just going to overuse a

908
00:37:55,719 --> 00:38:00,879
mechanism and they'll adapt um there's

909
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:03,159
many questions with that and um and also

910
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,960
climate change and how that's going to

911
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:06,838
impact them over time and the climate

912
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,760
change issue is tied into this this

913
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:10,400
question about harvesting how much

914
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,319
pressure can you put on the system and

915
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,280
have it still function um and and so

916
00:38:13,318 --> 00:38:18,400
those those are are tied together we see

917
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,480
those as sort of the key pieces of the

918
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,480
sustainability issue and so I'll stop

919
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:27,039
and say thank you and be happy to answer

920
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,039
any questions or listen to comments you

921
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,039
have

922
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,519
thank no they're they're all rainfed

923
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,920
yeah they for the most part there's not

924
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:40,599
a means to irrigate so in some cases

925
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,079
they may you know have water for

926
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:43,838
irrigation that they'll preferentially

927
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,240
put on their home gardens some of the

928
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:49,639
Intensive vegetable crops right near the

929
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:52,799
house but not

930
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:55,519
maze Sor fascinating story I just have a

931
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:59,519
comment try to Gras if your sanal

932
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:59,519
hypothesis mhm

933
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:06,800
more likely get higher

934
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,839
right higher yields and what well I mean

935
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,920
the central hypothesis is sort of tied

936
00:39:08,838 --> 00:39:15,920
to energy and inputs yeah oh okay but um

937
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,200
it seems to me is the diversity is not

938
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,920
in diversity it's a managing diversity

939
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:23,719
oh right yeah yeah we should reflect

940
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:26,639
that that should be reflected in the

941
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:29,159
right and I yeah so um this idea that

942
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:31,358
just any old diversity will be good and

943
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:33,118
you know is is not that's not really the

944
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:34,880
way we view it so there's a whole

945
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,838
literature and and this you know the

946
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,680
hypothesis comes out of the natural

947
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:41,239
ecosystems or unmanaged ecosystems work

948
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:42,960
so there's different metrics that we can

949
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:44,838
use for diversity and so functional

950
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,960
diversity and philogenetic diversity

951
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:49,960
those are two they're sort of replacing

952
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:53,318
species richness you know just simple

953
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:56,039
number of species so good point thank

954
00:39:53,318 --> 00:39:58,920
you well I concur with they Ling that

955
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:02,800
there was fascinating presentation both

956
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:05,960
about drink water history and push pole

957
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,400
system um my question is have you given

958
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,400
any thought to the applicability of this

959
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,160
Push Pull system to American or North

960
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,559
American

961
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:17,519
agriculture well actually you know I

962
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:20,679
asked the entomologists about that and

963
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:22,358
so from The Pest Control angle and if

964
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:24,719
there's an entomologist here who wants

965
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:27,598
to add to this or correct me I I think

966
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:30,598
that it's probably not an option right

967
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:33,039
now mainly because of the the maze

968
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:36,599
genetics the material we have that we're

969
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:38,800
growing for you know corn because let's

970
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:41,160
see the um the signaling and the

971
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,039
communication between the stemborers and

972
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:46,559
the Maze has been

973
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:48,199
lost so the stemborers from what I can

974
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:50,119
understand from katata the stemborers in

975
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:53,679
the United States do not recognize the

976
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:57,760
signal of hey I'm a damaged corn plant

977
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:59,799
anymore at least the same yeah with the

978
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,720
so the specific

979
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,720
could right well the specific system you

980
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:07,118
know and then there's other issues it is

981
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:09,919
you know with trying to add a perennial

982
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:12,760
in between the maze rows and how that

983
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,358
would work so we have genetic material

984
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,440
here that we're using that's really

985
00:41:14,358 --> 00:41:18,279
adapted for the system that's in place

986
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,358
which which is you know has these

987
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,680
cascading effects on the structure and

988
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:24,559
I'm not going to kind of go anymore go

989
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:27,399
into that anymore but the broader

990
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:30,279
question of using plant species I think

991
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:33,519
is definitely an option that we will

992
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:35,440
want to consider in in um you know even

993
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:37,599
in int intensified High yielding

994
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,000
agricultural systems there there are

995
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,480
some you know problems that we're

996
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
running to like especially in the

997
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,960
pollination dependent crops where even

998
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,920
under high input intensive agriculture

999
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,400
yields are being impacted by the lack of

1000
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,639
diversity in the landscape and the lack

1001
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,559
of pollinators and it can't really be

1002
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:56,799
overcome just by moving honeybees around

1003
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:58,519
and and you know it doesn't seem to be

1004
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,599
and I think that if we want to try to

1005
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:04,000
expand the ecosystem services that we're

1006
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,079
going to get from agricultural lands

1007
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,440
that this is is one approach that we

1008
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,359
want to consider and we want to think

1009
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,318
about you know where do we really want

1010
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:14,400
to use nitrogen fertilizer because we we

1011
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:16,440
do need it but we could be strategic

1012
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,559
because there's definitely systems where

1013
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,079
there's enough rainfall enough of a

1014
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:22,078
growing season to grow some of our

1015
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,960
nitrogen and then we would acrw these

1016
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,318
you know these other benefits so

1017
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,599
thinking about how do we you know I

1018
00:42:25,318 --> 00:42:30,639
think we just have to be strategic about

1019
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:33,000
where we you know how we blend ecology

1020
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:36,679
with the inputs that have been

1021
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:41,079
developed thank you yes one more

1022
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:44,519
question uh two really quick ones one um

1023
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:47,240
the the desmodium perennial but is there

1024
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:50,920
any sort of uh resal inoculation that

1025
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:50,919
happens or is it

1026
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,240
just yeah so far they haven't really

1027
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:59,118
been using an ulation I don't know if

1028
00:42:57,239 --> 00:43:01,318
that's because it's you know

1029
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:04,280
promiscuous um there are some native

1030
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:06,519
desmodium species that are are in Kenya

1031
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,400
and actually now so the two they're

1032
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:11,280
using are from elsewhere the most

1033
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,358
prevalent silver and green leaf there's

1034
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:17,480
two pardon

1035
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:19,279
thatum yeah so there's two desmodium

1036
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,559
species that are are native of of

1037
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,920
subsaharan Africa that they're

1038
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:24,640
evaluating right now and and I think

1039
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,639
that you know taking advantage of these

1040
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:28,239
different ecotypes in Des modium and

1041
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:30,679
also the different species of grasses

1042
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:32,558
that can fulfill this function is a good

1043
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:36,440
strategy that was actually my second

1044
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:36,440
question in terms of the diversity

1045
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:45,640
of is there variation for the

1046
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:47,599
am down regulation

1047
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:48,920
mod yeah that's a good question and

1048
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,838
that's something I'm very interested in

1049
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,680
we don't really know so you know we

1050
00:43:50,838 --> 00:43:55,440
would the right now the desmo green desm

1051
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:56,838
moting is being heavily favored because

1052
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,000
it's um

1053
00:43:56,838 --> 00:44:00,558
resistant and you know we don't really

1054
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,119
know enough about the Ecology of these

1055
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:04,760
species to know when might be beneficial

1056
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,640
to have the silver relief like what is

1057
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:10,200
the what is the difference in these in

1058
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:11,519
terms of how they perform in an in crop

1059
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:13,919
some farmers are ending up with a

1060
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:17,119
mixture which I think is probably a good

1061
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,079
way to capitalize and you know U because

1062
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:21,079
they've lost some of their silad modium

1063
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:22,640
because of drought and they've replanted

1064
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:24,880
with green but they've left the silver

1065
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:26,519
that's there so I think that'll be

1066
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,680
interesting to see how that

1067
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:33,800
pans out so we're over time but I want

1068
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:33,799
to thank Lori and

1069
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:41,480
great this has been a production of
