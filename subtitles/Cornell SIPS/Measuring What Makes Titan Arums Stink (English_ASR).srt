1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:15,759
University so we we're really fortunate

3
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:18,038
uh Kyle and I and our students are

4
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,000
fortunate to have a chance to um get a

5
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:23,400
second look at the floral behavior of we

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,198
stingy 2 and 1/ half years ago we had a

7
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:29,358
chance to study around o clock for 2 and

8
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:31,840
1/2 days its production of the stinky

9
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:35,679
volatiles Vis its name and for which

10
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:38,920
it's justly known so uh during that time

11
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:40,878
there was a a Blog on Cornell site and

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,120
people from all over the world rode in

13
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:44,718
and asked what are those strings what

14
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:48,038
are those wires what are you people

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,359
doing to our flower and and I we

16
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,800
responded that we were actually

17
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,920
collecting data from it so we thought

18
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,399
we'd take a few um minutes to talk about

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,039
what T me all right so when when we

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,239
stinky starts when the Spade begins to

21
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:04,000
open and The Show Goes On we're going to

22
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:07,640
have a fishing line dangling from the

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,400
gers above the plant uh to support this

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,680
little battery Opera vacuum pump here's

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,240
a 9V battery operated um pump that'll

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,759
allow us to collect volatiles from the

27
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,199
flow what's really interesting about

28
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,400
this is that usually we enclose a flower

29
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,960
they're always always smaller than this

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,000
in what we call a headspace bag an oven

31
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,039
bag say that you big turkey and that

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,840
doesn't have volatiles of its own we let

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,520
the volatiles accum accumulate and then

34
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,799
we collect them over a little trap like

35
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:37,158
a cigarette filter but much smaller and

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,000
so uh what we have here is the is the

37
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,079
battery pump that we're going to put a

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,840
little filter on and and then hang it

39
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:46,359
suspend it into the floral chamber where

40
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,320
a lot of the volatiles are be produced

41
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:52,718
and we're going to take snapshots every

42
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:55,519
2 hours of how the odors change as the

43
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:56,759
plant as as the as the infloresence

44
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,200
we're doing this in two different ways

45
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,280
this one is cumulative okay the B the

46
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,640
pump is just going run it's going to

47
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,640
collect volatiles over time this little

48
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,159
syringe here we call it a solid phase

49
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,919
micro extraction fiber or speing it has

50
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:15,199
a little piece of of essentially fishing

51
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:18,919
line that also gets exposed in the

52
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:21,518
chamber of the infloresence and absorbs

53
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:24,719
the volatiles onto it then we can use

54
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,200
chemical analysis to um to strip those

55
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,519
volatiles off and separate them into

56
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:30,919
their component Peaks and we'll be

57
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,439
posting those data on the on the Corel

58
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:35,119
site for everybody to

59
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:36,878
see then what we're going to do as we're

60
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,200
taking these chemical measurements we're

61
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:39,799
also going to be taking measurements of

62
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:42,359
temperature of carbon

63
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:46,000
dioxide so we've noticed from previous

64
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:50,120
research and also um two years ago was

65
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,800
last that um there are rhythmic um

66
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,920
thermal blasts and we also want to

67
00:02:53,800 --> 00:03:00,080
measure um possible carbon dioxide um

68
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:02,799
blast so what we have here is a a

69
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,920
digital temperature go and what we'll be

70
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,560
doing

71
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:09,919
is sticking it into the tissue at

72
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,640
various um Heights of the spadex um to

73
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,399
test the temperature over time we also

74
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,839
have syringes that will be taking air

75
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,519
samples from inside the J um to

76
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,598
calculate the CO2

77
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,000
concentration um and we have our CO2

78
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:26,919
analyzer behind us and we'll be

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,199
injecting samples into that test that

80
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:31,039
concentration right and so what reason

81
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:34,399
for being that we know from the thermal

82
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:36,840
imagery that these things really heat up

83
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,360
just as they're producing um the the

84
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,479
largest release of volatiles but the the

85
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,720
insects that are attracted to these

86
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:45,158
flowers um experience all of that at

87
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,280
once the heat inside the chamber the

88
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:50,560
carbon di side is the planet respiring

89
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,479
like a sprinter um and these uh very

90
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,120
strong information Rich volatiles that

91
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:57,078
that flies and and beetles that are

92
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,280
attracted to this plant um have a lot of

93
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:02,239
meaning because um they are simul

94
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,158
the the the cues that needed from a

95
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,759
rotting corpse so we'll be doing that

96
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,840
around the clock as the flower opens and

97
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,598
as people come in and trying to

98
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,319
surreptitiously sneak into the corner

99
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:15,119
and collect our data and we'll be

100
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:15,119
posting these data as we as we collect

101
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,478
them this has been a production of

102
