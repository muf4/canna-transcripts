1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,759
University okay so today I'll be talking

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,679
about uh genomics and high througho

4
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:17,320
phenotyping of Cava bronck viruses they

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,240
told me if I need to point I need to

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:24,000
move so I'll keep moving right so today

7
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:26,239
we're talking about casava so the

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,480
outline today will be talking about Caba

9
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:31,719
Bron stri disease phenotyping which I'll

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,878
refer to as cbsd in the presentation and

11
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:37,200
we'll also be talking about Tru necrosis

12
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:39,878
image analysis uh cbsd virti

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,440
quantification and also just a summary

14
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:45,280
from the findings of This research so

15
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:48,079
Cava is a is an outbreeding species it's

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,799
a bushy shrub that's grown for its roots

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,079
mainly so but in eastern central Africa

18
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:56,198
they grow it for also the leaves because

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,480
they use the leaves to make like stews

20
00:00:56,198 --> 00:01:02,000
and pests so it feeds over 800 million

21
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:05,000
people in the the world and as of 2022

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,478
the value of casava was $4.9 billion in

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,118
treade around the world it's propagated

24
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:12,039
by Stam cuttings that's what farmers do

25
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:14,759
mainly but breeders we could generate

26
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:18,040
seeds which are always very difficult to

27
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:20,759
generate so despite the importance of

28
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,560
Cava in easn central Africa there's Cava

29
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,799
BR strike disease so this is a viral

30
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,200
disease that's very unique in how it

31
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,079
expresses its symptoms that you know you

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,799
could see a healthy plant but when you

33
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:36,438
uproot The Roots that's like after 12 to

34
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:40,280
15 months after planting you will see

35
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:43,279
the okay you will see these patchy

36
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,519
necrotic lesions so this is always very

37
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,200
difficult to eat such Cava because it's

38
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,280
the necrosis is hard and you can't boil

39
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,640
the cassa and you can't also feed it to

40
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,359
animals so Caba Bron chake disease is a

41
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,799
positive s single stranded RNA virus

42
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:01,560
it's in the genus iomo virus and the

43
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,600
family poort virid you know potato virus

44
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,079
Y which is a very common virus so these

45
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,840
are common plant viruses but there are

46
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:11,759
two species of this virus the Uganda

47
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,878
Cava Brown streke virus and which I'll

48
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,959
refer to as cbsv in the

49
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,000
presentation the casava Bron streak

50
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,598
virus and the Uganda Cava Bron strike

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,680
virus both viruses cause 70 to 100%

52
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:27,878
healed losses in suceptible varieties so

53
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,120
when we think about the genomics of Cava

54
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:32,479
Bron stre virus just like any other

55
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,200
poort virus it's recorded as one big

56
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:37,799
polyprotein that tends to be cut into

57
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:40,359
different pieces depending on the need

58
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,680
you know how the plant interacts with

59
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:46,080
how the virus interacts with the plant

60
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,840
so the big difference with cbsd which is

61
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,879
down this is the Genome of cbsd the

62
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,479
biggest difference between cbsd and

63
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:57,359
other viruses in the eomo virus genus is

64
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,919
this H one protein so this is a protein

65
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,760
that is not encoded by all the other

66
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:06,798
viruses in the eomo virus genus and we

67
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:08,919
think that it's because of this uh frin

68
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:11,560
that it's possible for casaba Brown stri

69
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:14,280
viruses to be transmitted by white flies

70
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,479
and not AIDS so most of the virus in

71
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,080
this genome for Vector biology they

72
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:22,238
encod the HC pro protein that helps with

73
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,640
Aid transmission so that's the only

74
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,680
difference but most times the proteins

75
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,438
are the same so when we look at the

76
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,719
distribution of casaba bran chake

77
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:32,878
disease this is a very old map from far

78
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:36,359
but I could tell you what's happening so

79
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:38,158
C Brown St disease in the 1930s was

80
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,560
discovered in the coastal regions of

81
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:43,719
East Africa so the virus would only

82
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,360
survive at uh altitude at very low

83
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:49,840
altitudes that's below 1,000 MERS below

84
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:53,400
sea level above sea level so but as of

85
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,799
2000 the virus moved up to higher

86
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,959
altitudes that has never been reported

87
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,040
and that's why we have the Uganda Cava

88
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,479
Bron virus because that's where where it

89
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:04,798
was discovered in Uganda while Cava

90
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:07,359
brownst virus was the original virus

91
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,360
that was at the coast of East Africa so

92
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,760
as of last year we have confirmed cases

93
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,640
in the Democratic Republic of Congo

94
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:17,839
Zambia and the Central African Republic

95
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:20,319
so you would wonder why breeders in East

96
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,519
Africa are very interested in West

97
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:24,879
Africa so if you look at the Food

98
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:26,959
Systems across Africa West Africa is

99
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,879
highly dependent on casava In Their Food

100
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,758
Systems they don't have Alternatives

101
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,478
right so the alternative could be yum

102
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,680
but everything is largely casava so you

103
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:37,879
imagine if casava Brown strike virus

104
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,680
moves from East Africa to Central to

105
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:42,038
Western Africa then we're going to for

106
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,240
we are going to face a lot of food

107
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:45,879
scarcity on the continent so that's why

108
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,560
we're trying to make sure that we breed

109
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:51,719
for it within East Africa and not get it

110
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,800
moved to West Africa so this virus as I

111
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,840
have mentioned is transmitted by white

112
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,400
flies there are many white fly

113
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:01,000
populations across Africa but also the

114
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,879
greatest transmitters of the disease are

115
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,199
farmers because they tend to carry

116
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,399
infected planting material from one

117
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,680
place to another so that's how the virus

118
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:13,198
has moved and also evolved to different

119
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,759
isolates and different species so to

120
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,400
find Cava Bron stri disease in the field

121
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,520
it's its sympt its folar symptoms are

122
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:24,198
not very threatening so you see fosis

123
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:27,038
along the secondary Leaf margins it's

124
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:30,199
never on the main Leaf margin it's the

125
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:33,038
secondary margins it's easy to confuse

126
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:36,080
it for you know just normal chosis cenis

127
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:38,000
but with a a trained eye someone could

128
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:41,519
see the LIF patterns and know that this

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,199
is cbsd so you also see brown strikes on

130
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,918
the stem if you take a good look but

131
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:49,080
also these also tend to happen on the

132
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:51,198
Botanical seeds so that's a sign of cbsd

133
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:53,800
so when you appro the root this is

134
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,240
always about 12 to 15 months after

135
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,840
planting you see the contriction in The

136
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,160
Roots but also when you cut there the

137
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:05,000
dark Necro patches in the road so those

138
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,000
are those are symptoms of Cava Bron stri

139
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,399
disease and they cause up to 100 million

140
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,759
dollar in economic losses in East Africa

141
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,719
so when we are scoring Cava brownst

142
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,000
disease we have this one to five scoring

143
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,400
method that was originally developed for

144
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,918
Caba Mosaic disease but also works

145
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,560
efficiently for Caba Bron stri disease

146
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:28,318
so a score of one means no observable

147
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,800
symptoms while a score of five is the

148
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,720
highest severity that you can observe

149
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,918
either both on the leaves or on the road

150
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,120
so we tend to score these at 3 months

151
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,560
and 6 months after planting for the fure

152
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,598
because that time the root has not

153
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,639
developed once you approach Cava you can

154
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:47,240
not you know you destroy the plants so

155
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,199
we have to wait 12 months to look at the

156
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,918
root so for nearly 10 decades because I

157
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,038
mentioned Cava Bron stri disease has

158
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:57,519
been around since the 1930s so if we

159
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,598
count we've done a lot of breeding for

160
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:01,519
casava Bron disease but we've not

161
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,639
identified markers that have been vly

162
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:06,478
debed in any population so to my work we

163
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,840
wanted to understand the genetic

164
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:11,399
architecture of casava Bron stri disease

165
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:13,478
conduct genome wide Association studies

166
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:14,758
for Cava Bron stri disease and explain

167
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:17,000
these results from a breeding

168
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,598
perspective so we studying a pathogen

169
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,120
but we are also breeders so we need to

170
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:23,478
explain it from a breeding context so as

171
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,280
John Luke mentioned the last 10 years

172
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:28,478
the next gen Cava has Cava project has

173
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,598
been founding Cava research in Africa

174
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:34,800
and genomic sele ction was one uh tool

175
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,319
that you know to that they promoted for

176
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,120
you know rapid selection and

177
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,520
accelerating of breeding so we have this

178
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,800
genomic selection population that was

179
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,519
developed in the first years of the next

180
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,199
gen project and you know we have it it's

181
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:52,318
a s population it had

182
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,680
471 clones that were evaluated in the

183
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,360
clonal evaluation trials so when you

184
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,439
think about casava breeding we have a

185
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,800
Seedling trial we have a clono

186
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:03,000
evaluation trial Advanced field trial

187
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,319
then the farmer trial so a clone

188
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,360
evaluation trial is as much diverse as

189
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,479
you know the seedling trial but we have

190
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,800
replication in this case that we don't

191
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,639
get ining trials so we planted these

192
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,400
trials in two locations that have

193
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,918
varying cbsd pressure there cbsd but the

194
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:24,918
pressure varies then out of these 471

195
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:27,079
clones only 3002 clone 20 clones were

196
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:29,719
genotyped we planted this in an

197
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:31,680
augmented block design with three checks

198
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,320
and we use spread AR row within the

199
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,440
field to aument the disease pressure so

200
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,640
once we had the population we had we had

201
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,479
different hypothesis that we wanted to

202
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,319
test out how you know the population

203
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,278
performed best on the one toi scoring

204
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,519
method then we took root necrosis images

205
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,000
because we were curious is this necrosis

206
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,679
due to environmental factors or is it

207
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,480
genetic and also we did viral titer

208
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:58,120
quantification or viral Lo

209
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,000
quantification and that's how we

210
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,440
phenotyped the C2 population so moving

211
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,559
ahead I will talk about definitions

212
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,959
because as someone who works with both

213
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:09,759
breeders and Pathologists is important

214
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:12,199
to define the context of things that

215
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:14,600
I'll be talking about so if I talk about

216
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,839
tolerance it means that uh this is the

217
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,240
ability or the capacity of a clone to be

218
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:21,720
infected but still give you know

219
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,120
satisfactory yield to breeders when I

220
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,040
talk about susceptibility this clone has

221
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,799
the ability to get cbsd but you know the

222
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,958
disease varies or the expression of

223
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:35,039
symptom varies when I mention enhancers

224
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:37,759
of susceptibility this is the likelihood

225
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:41,439
and the severity of the infection based

226
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:43,399
on the symptoms right so it's when when

227
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,480
it's time to think about viruses I'll

228
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:47,000
mention that this is based on the virus

229
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,519
but if I mention it anywhere in the

230
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,879
presentation it's due to the symptoms

231
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,078
then incidence again is how frequent

232
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:57,120
these symptoms occur in the population

233
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:59,439
so let's go to the one to five scoring

234
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,000
method this paper has been published so

235
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,320
we had the C2 population we wanted to

236
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,399
find out you know just understand the

237
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,879
population based on the one to5 squaring

238
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,958
method so the research objective is we

239
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,759
wanted to evaluate the cbsd trait

240
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:16,759
variability based on the one to five

241
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:19,039
scoring method within this population uh

242
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:21,240
establish phenotypic and genotypic

243
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:24,120
correlations then conduct Jas both

244
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,240
univariate and M VAR Jas to identify

245
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,240
genomic regions that were associated to

246
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,680
these traits and also provide

247
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,200
information on functional and atted gen

248
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:35,958
within those regions so when we talk

249
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,040
about J using the one to5 scoring method

250
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:41,399
forava Brown disease a few Studies have

251
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:45,599
been conducted it's important to mention

252
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:48,278
that uh kuchi kao's population and

253
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,360
kondo's population are grandparents of

254
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:55,320
the C2 population so they did CH studies

255
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,480
and they form kondo phone that cbsd at 3

256
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,600
months uh Snips on chromosome 11 were

257
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,720
associated to cbsd at 3 months after

258
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,879
planting while at 6 months after

259
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,399
planting we only had Snips on chromosome

260
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:10,799
4 and chromosome 11 no associations were

261
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,399
discovered with the cbsd at 12 months

262
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,359
after planting that's on the road so the

263
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:18,679
same thing was observed with kaoi that

264
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,519
he only picked out uh cbsd at 6 months

265
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:23,638
after planting Snips on chromosome 11 so

266
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,679
other studies within East Africa these

267
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:28,560
are mainly best in Tanzania and Kenya

268
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:31,679
have done qtl studies with uh this

269
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,719
population namikonga and choba just to

270
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:37,278
give you a brief introduction in the

271
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:40,879
1930s when cbsd happened breeders did

272
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:43,278
cross uh uh noral casava domesticated

273
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:45,838
casava clones with the wild relatives

274
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:49,320
and this namikonga like a clone like

275
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:53,519
namikonga Ora is is from that breing

276
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:56,320
program in the 1930s so two Studies have

277
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,078
been done using qtl studies and you can

278
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,360
again see that they pick out different

279
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,919
genomic regions Associated to the

280
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,480
different severity scores either on the

281
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:07,439
Folia or in the root symptoms so that

282
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,360
tells you that you know some work has

283
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,440
been done but it's really difficult to

284
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,720
pinpoint which region in the genome is

285
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,880
actually uh controlling cbsd severity

286
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,639
scor so back to my work we did want to

287
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:22,720
ask were what we were observing in the C

288
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,000
population due to genetics environment

289
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,360
or genotype by environment interactions

290
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,440
so we did partition the variance and you

291
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,879
can see that for the C2 population uh

292
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,800
most of the traits that we measured cbsd

293
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,198
incidence and severity were highly

294
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,919
genetic while when it comes to genotype

295
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:43,278
by environmental interaction you can see

296
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:45,838
for root uh sority scores that G by E is

297
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:48,639
zero right so what we see is due to

298
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,320
genetic or the environment so we also

299
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,600
looked at uh variation in Broad sense

300
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,120
and narrow sense heritability estimates

301
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,040
for Broad St heritability this is data

302
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,360
from the combined data data from the

303
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:00,799
different locations

304
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,519
you could see that the estimates

305
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,919
generally range from moderate to high

306
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,919
and this is the same with published

307
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,599
previous published papers for cbsd and

308
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:12,679
also the same trend is observed with

309
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,159
Naros sensor ability estimate that they

310
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:17,759
tend to be low to moderate depending on

311
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:20,759
the Trad and this is again the same as

312
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:24,000
it's been observed in other studies so

313
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:26,919
we went ahead to do Univar G analysis

314
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,039
and for our Univar GS analysis you could

315
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:31,799
see that we only picked out Association

316
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:34,120
for cbsd at 3 months after planting on

317
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:36,559
chromosome 1 chromosome 13 and

318
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,560
chromosome 18 so as I mentioned that the

319
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:41,319
ancestors of the C2 population they

320
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:43,599
picked out Snips on either chromosome 4

321
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,160
or chromosome 11 in our population we do

322
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,720
not pick out chromosome 4 or chromosome

323
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:51,519
11 so we went ahead to do multivariate

324
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,399
gas but it's important to note that on

325
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,679
chromosome 1 and chromosome 18 there's

326
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:59,039
an ingression that from the 1930

327
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:01,039
populations that were developed so so we

328
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:04,240
have ingressions on chromosome 1 and

329
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:06,919
chromosome 18 so when we did multivar

330
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,159
Jas we wanted to find out which regions

331
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:11,039
which Snips we identified in the univ

332
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:13,198
Jas were shared among these traits would

333
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,919
show up among these traits so we again

334
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,879
saw that some of these Snips are shared

335
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:20,000
across you know different trait

336
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:22,198
combinations and because of this we had

337
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,278
confidence to search for candidate genes

338
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:27,479
within this regions to see what type of

339
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:30,000
function do these genes do so we

340
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,759
characterized gene on ologies which may

341
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,958
not be very informative now but we

342
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,039
wanted to claster them so based on

343
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:38,439
molecular function you could see that we

344
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:41,240
have you know cataly uh genes in those

345
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:44,480
regions that control catalytic activity

346
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:47,519
binding you know cellular processes uh

347
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,600
cellular anatomic entities so the

348
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,120
conclusion from this is you know the

349
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,519
genes that we received in this case

350
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:58,720
would be enhancers of symptom severity

351
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,360
so if symptom severity because when you

352
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,519
look at you know the virus how the virus

353
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,519
proteins work viruses tend to depend on

354
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:09,039
the host for their replication so all

355
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:11,440
these help the virus reproduce within

356
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:13,719
the host and that's how we get the

357
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,480
diverse severity scores within the

358
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,839
population so to summarize this section

359
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,720
cbsd incidence in the C2 population

360
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,399
symptom incidence was at

361
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,240
44% so that shows that while genomic

362
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,240
selection you know they've been genetic

363
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,039
gains from a breeding from a disease

364
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,639
perspective the disease is still

365
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:34,318
occurring in the population and we also

366
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:37,000
had a moderate to high broad sense

367
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:39,838
heritability estimates that's good are

368
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,198
low to moderate narens heritability

369
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,800
estimates 77 functional genes potential

370
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:49,399
C genes were found the activities again

371
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:51,719
help in symptom uh severity within the

372
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:55,120
plant so I will go to my second

373
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:57,759
objective which was done with uh with in

374
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,560
collaboration with Chris uh who used to

375
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,879
work for breed in

376
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,958
Cornell uh so this is the genetic

377
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:08,278
architecture the genetic analysis of

378
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:10,919
Caba Bron root necrosis using image

379
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:13,078
analysis and genom Association studies

380
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:14,719
so when we think about root necrosis if

381
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:16,838
you remember the picture that I showed

382
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,600
you of the one to five scoring method we

383
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:21,639
score the fure symptoms twice in our

384
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,079
breeding cycle while root necrosis can

385
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:26,440
only be scored once so we wanted to

386
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:29,399
expand you know how we could uh

387
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,639
characterize a phenotype cbsd necrosis

388
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,318
so image analysis was the best option

389
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:36,799
that we T about so we know that brute

390
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:38,599
necrosis is the most devastating cbsd

391
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:41,198
symptoms because once you have R

392
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,000
necrosis you cannot eat that Cava and

393
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:44,958
then we thought that image analysis

394
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,958
could expand this R necrosis the

395
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:49,599
question that we had is we've observed

396
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:51,518
these variations in R necrosis patterns

397
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,319
but were these variations due to

398
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,639
genetics or due to environmental factors

399
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:58,799
that was yet to be found out so I'll

400
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,240
show you what led to our hypoth thesis

401
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,519
of studying root necrosis you can see

402
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,318
that you know there are different

403
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:07,838
expression patterns of rot necrosis we

404
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:10,000
agree that you know this could be due to

405
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:12,078
you know environmental factors it could

406
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,679
also be due to the isolates within the

407
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:17,240
field so there are so many factors that

408
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:20,640
you know lead to these necrotic pattern

409
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,720
so we collected uh different images and

410
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,720
used them for analysis to study Ro

411
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:29,038
necrosis so we use plant CV which is an

412
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,558
open source you know software for

413
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:34,319
segmentation of areas of interest in an

414
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:36,160
image this is the python best method you

415
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,519
know we have the ability to extract

416
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:42,440
Futures based on size shape color

417
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:45,240
texture and so we inputed images in uh

418
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:48,200
PL CV and then we got an output file

419
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,279
that we use for Downstream data analysis

420
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,798
so the experiment of Designing this Cas

421
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:55,079
is we collected five roots from a plant

422
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:58,038
from each plant in a plot a plot is made

423
00:17:55,079 --> 00:18:00,720
up of 10 plants so each plant five roots

424
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:03,679
imag were captured at the proximal end

425
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,360
of the route the middle and the distal

426
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,880
end images were collected in both

427
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:12,199
locations across both years we use

428
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,159
tablets with f field book to ensure like

429
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,360
it was a way of controlling the data we

430
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:18,840
got that if we say this is a plot then

431
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:21,240
it's an actual plot and an actual image

432
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:23,359
of that plot then it's also important to

433
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,319
notice that to mention that numerous

434
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:29,038
people capture these images so Styles in

435
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:31,439
how they held you know the tablets

436
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,640
affected our Downstream data analysis

437
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,200
since we had to take out some images

438
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:40,400
since they were they didn't meet uh the

439
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,120
the plant CV criteria so we took out

440
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,000
numerous images again the research

441
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,959
objectives we wanted to characterize

442
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,960
root necrosis image traits uh determine

443
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,840
phenotypic and genotypic correlations

444
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,798
best with the one to five scoring

445
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:56,879
methods and also conduct GS and also

446
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:59,798
identify you know the genes in those

447
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,799
regions so how this happened in image

448
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:06,599
analysis just to give you we would input

449
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:09,279
a raow image in IM in plant CV then we

450
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:11,119
use different color spaces for Segment

451
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,399
for segmentation so we ended up using

452
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:15,839
the lightness the green the magenta the

453
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,080
blue and yellow because this was better

454
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,038
for us in the segmentation process then

455
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,639
we would extract the morphological

456
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:25,640
features of the root dis like in this

457
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,720
case and also in another step extract

458
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,520
the image the morphological features of

459
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:34,038
the necrosis itself and we had an output

460
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:35,480
file so we ended up collecting data like

461
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:37,798
the TR that we studied were the

462
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,360
percentage of necrosis so the area of

463
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:43,558
necrosis over the whole area of the root

464
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:46,279
dis times 100 uh the necrotic area

465
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:48,639
fraction the necrotic W fraction the

466
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:51,158
solidity of necrosis you know and

467
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,280
numerous other trats that we studied so

468
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:55,280
we were curious what these trats you

469
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,599
know what's the heritability of these

470
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,639
threats so looking at these trats all

471
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,558
the image and analysis St the BR

472
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,480
heritability was generally low to

473
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:05,678
moderate you can see the percentage of

474
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,839
necrosis had

475
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,640
42 uh you know uh heritability while you

476
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:15,038
know like the solidity of necrosis or

477
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,480
the C area of necrosis had very low

478
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:20,440
heritability the lowest heritability

479
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:23,079
estimates again we see the the trend you

480
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,038
know very low heritability Nar

481
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:27,480
heritability estimates associated with

482
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:29,640
these image traits so we also wanted to

483
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,480
find out how these threats really

484
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,159
perform against the one to five scoring

485
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,679
method because that's those are scores

486
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:37,600
that we used to and understand best as

487
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,720
breeders so you could see that some

488
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:42,719
traits were highly clustered together so

489
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,319
those are highly correlated traits while

490
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,880
other traits like the solidity of

491
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:49,480
necrosis and the eclipse eccentricity of

492
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,280
necrosis were negatively correlated with

493
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,960
all the other word necrosis image traits

494
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:56,720
when we compare it to the one to five

495
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:59,720
scoring method you can see that uh cbsd

496
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,400
at 12 months after planting is has good

497
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,720
correlations with you know all these rud

498
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,559
necrosis traits that are highly

499
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,038
correlated with each other while the

500
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:10,639
fure symptoms are not really that

501
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:14,440
correlated with all these other traits

502
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:17,360
so we also looked at genotype by uh

503
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,600
environment uh effect on our population

504
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,719
on our image population and you can see

505
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:25,798
that the

506
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:28,400
S the Ser 2020 and Dong uh in both years

507
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:30,278
were highly correlated right images from

508
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,278
populations from these locations were

509
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:34,558
highly correlated well for the S 2019

510
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:37,319
has you know a very different

511
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,798
correlation from this this is because in

512
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:42,200
the S 2019 we had a drought at this

513
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:44,519
experiment and lost most of the plants

514
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,440
that we had in that field so the images

515
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:48,200
that we colle we collected were much

516
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,640
less and if you plot this out you could

517
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,759
see that the environment was different

518
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:55,038
from all the other environments so we

519
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:57,480
went ahead to look at the variations in

520
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:59,640
phenotypic correlations and you can see

521
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,400
again their traits just like you saw in

522
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,559
the biplot for the genotype uh for the

523
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,840
genotype by tra interactions you could

524
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,079
see that there are some trats that are

525
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,199
highly correlated with each other and

526
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:11,839
then we have this bunch of traits that

527
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,798
you know have moderate to low

528
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:17,319
correlations and then when we look at

529
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:19,158
cbsd severity cause they have you know

530
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:22,720
very poor correlations with all the

531
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:24,840
image analysis traits except for a few

532
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,400
with cbsd at 12 months after planting

533
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:29,199
but it's still you know very little cor

534
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,159
correlations like the correlation

535
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,679
between the percentage of necrosis and

536
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:35,720
cbsd are 12 months after planting it's.

537
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,720
three so that's a low correlation but

538
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,960
still good so the same Trends were

539
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,640
observed with uh the genotypic

540
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,720
correlations that you could see that

541
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,000
there are bunches that you know these

542
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,558
are highly correlated these have low to

543
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,519
moderate correlations and then again we

544
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:53,158
have very poor correlations but

545
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:55,679
following the same Trend like with the

546
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:58,480
phenotypic correlations so we went ahead

547
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,960
to do Univar Jus and only two two Snips

548
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,558
we found associations with two Snips uh

549
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,038
with two traits the eclipse eccentricity

550
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:08,440
of necrosis with found Snips on

551
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:12,000
chromosome uh seven and 11 which didn't

552
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,679
show up when we did uh the univarate GS

553
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,200
analysis with the one to five scoring

554
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,360
method but has showed up in the

555
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,360
ancestors of the C2 population and then

556
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:24,079
again we see the percentage of necrosis

557
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:26,479
having Snips on chromosome are one so we

558
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:28,558
did multivar Jas and we did not the

559
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,798
different tra combinations we not find

560
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,399
any significant Snips with the multivar

561
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:35,679
Jus so again we looked at the gene

562
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,000
functions and you see again the same

563
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,840
Trend that follows that you see

564
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,839
catalytic activity you would see binding

565
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:45,319
and all these Gene functions again help

566
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:47,359
in the suscep in enhancing the

567
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:49,759
susceptability or the expression of the

568
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,959
symptoms within the roots so to

569
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:54,158
summarize this chapter we know that

570
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,679
heritability estimates were much lower

571
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,520
than the the ones of the one to five

572
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:01,600
scoring method because with thought you

573
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:03,918
know using images would take away biases

574
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:06,079
that the one to5 scoring method tends to

575
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,960
capture but that didn't happen we saw

576
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:11,720
similar Trends in genotypic and

577
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:14,798
phenotypic correlations again Snips only

578
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,960
Associated to two traits were identified

579
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:21,319
and the genes in those regions again

580
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,840
enhanc symptom expression in cbsd so

581
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:27,200
that was my objective two going to the

582
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:30,119
objective three this was done uh so we

583
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,038
collaborate with the dsmz which is a

584
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:35,239
virus Research Institute in Germany so

585
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:38,200
this is the genetic complexity of casaba

586
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,960
brri disease Insight from Q PCR best

587
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,759
virti quantification and genome wide

588
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,720
Association studies this work was done

589
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:48,200
in collaboration with Dr winter and Dr

590
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:51,798
summer who work at the dsmz so when we

591
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:53,360
talk about cbsd titer the spelling of TI

592
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:55,278
depends on whether you're trained with

593
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:58,278
British English or American English but

594
00:24:55,278 --> 00:25:00,319
it's the same thing or viral Lord you

595
00:24:58,278 --> 00:25:04,079
know it's just the concentration of the

596
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:06,398
virus within a a biological sample so it

597
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:09,398
depends on you know the method that you

598
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:12,439
use so since we use qpcr you know we got

599
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:15,359
CT values that we use to calculate uh

600
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,519
relative uh amounts of TI within a plant

601
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:19,678
because we had a reference uh a

602
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:22,000
reference that we used and used that to

603
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,120
detect the amount of virus in our plants

604
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,599
so how this was done is we collected

605
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:30,158
root diss that we compile together for a

606
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:32,558
plot like a it sample and then those

607
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,278
brute discs were dried and shipped to

608
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:38,918
the dsmz and then the QP shs were done

609
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:43,240
at the dsmd and we got the results back

610
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:46,159
so again our objectives for this uh

611
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,079
section was to assess a cbsv these are

612
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,200
the two virus species of the disease

613
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:54,439
that we are studying CC disease cbsv and

614
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,240
UC cbsc within that two uh within the C2

615
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,798
population we wanted to establish

616
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,919
phenotypic and genotypic cor relations

617
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:06,158
again do Js univ Js and provide insights

618
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:08,840
into these gyms so when we look at both

619
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,200
viruses in both locations you could see

620
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:13,720
when we look at the presence this is uh

621
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,080
plus his presence minus is absence when

622
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:19,399
we look at the presence absence of cbsd

623
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:21,798
we see that cbsv is more prevalent

624
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:25,158
across you know the locations and also

625
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:28,839
in the combined data set uh compared to

626
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:32,840
ucbsv but we know that you know as as we

627
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:35,079
trans as we planted you know from one

628
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:38,480
year to another there's an increase of

629
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:41,240
cbsd so to explain what's happening why

630
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:44,440
cbsv is more predominant than new uh

631
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:47,399
than new cbsv is because uh some Studies

632
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:50,440
have shown that ucbs cbsv really gets

633
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:52,558
much faster than ucbsv plants have a

634
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,679
mechanism of stopping the replication of

635
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:57,038
cbsv so it may be in the plan but it

636
00:26:54,679 --> 00:27:00,278
just doesn't increase at a fast rate

637
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:02,919
like CBS ESV does we also know that uh

638
00:27:00,278 --> 00:27:04,759
the increase from one year to another

639
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:06,720
could be because we replant planting

640
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:08,960
materials so you imagine if the

641
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,880
infection happened in the first year and

642
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,960
then you're replanting that you know

643
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,320
that clone you're still passing the

644
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,399
virus over to the next Generation giving

645
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:22,079
it more time to replicate and the virus

646
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:24,439
to increase so we also wanted to find

647
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,398
out is virus tighter due to genetics

648
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,919
environment or genotype by environment

649
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:32,000
interactions so you could see for CB for

650
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:34,559
UC cbsv despite not being very PR valent

651
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,599
in the population it's highly due to

652
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:41,240
genetics but cbsv which is more

653
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:43,000
predominant is due to uh very little of

654
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,159
it is due to genetics what we are

655
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,839
observing but when we look at genotype

656
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:51,200
by environment interaction you can see

657
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:54,720
cbsv has G high G by E while ucbsv has

658
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:57,038
low G by E this could be explained by

659
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,278
again this is a limitation of our study

660
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:02,480
we did not test the different isolates

661
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:05,200
and strains within our location where we

662
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,480
planted these CA varieties so we think

663
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,840
that those isolates have different

664
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,759
interactions with the genotypes and

665
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:14,959
that's why we saw high G by E so moving

666
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:16,759
forward we recommend that breeders you

667
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,000
know should periodically test for

668
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:22,759
isolates in this experimental uh in this

669
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,319
experimental areas to account for those

670
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:27,480
in the analysis so when we looked at

671
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:29,439
genotype when we looked at genotypic

672
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,640
phenotypic correlations again we see

673
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,519
that there are very poor correlations

674
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,120
with the one to five scoring methods

675
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:39,120
both phenotypic and uh and uh genotypic

676
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:41,518
correlations it's important to also

677
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,199
mention that cbsv and new cbsv were not

678
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,558
correlated so that brings it to the

679
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,080
notion that these are two different

680
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:50,158
viruses acting differently despite both

681
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:52,839
of them being Cava Bron viruses so we

682
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:56,600
did gas and we found some regions that

683
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:58,119
were associated to uh cbsv titer this

684
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:00,759
was done in gap

685
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:03,839
that you see chromosome 10 chromosome 13

686
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:06,879
chromosome 17 and 18 were associated uh

687
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:11,158
to cbsv TI while numerous regions in a

688
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,039
gome were picked out with the ucbsv tier

689
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:15,320
some of these snps that we picked really

690
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:17,079
explained you know reasonable

691
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:19,558
proportions of variance when we compare

692
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:22,158
it to the one to5 soring method so this

693
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:24,639
that was a good thing again we looked at

694
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,600
the proportion the genes in those

695
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,600
regions of interest and again we see

696
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:32,519
these are enhancers of you know disease

697
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:34,158
symptoms as has been observed with all

698
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:37,038
the other phenotypes that we were

699
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:41,399
studying so we also curious if we

700
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:43,440
included uh ucbsv and cbsv TI Viro TI as

701
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:45,678
a coar for the one to five scoring

702
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,120
method when we wanted to improve the

703
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,720
Precision but also there's the concept

704
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:52,719
of Tolerance right where if if you

705
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,960
account for tighter then you could pick

706
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,038
out regions that control tolerance so

707
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,000
the plant has the virus but then it

708
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:03,038
gives you good you know yield so we did

709
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,440
not pick anything when we used cbsv

710
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:08,839
vartia as a coar for the one to5 scoring

711
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:12,278
method and also the same Trend was for

712
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:16,720
ucbs virusa as a CO nothing interesting

713
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:18,359
came up so summarizing this uh both cbsv

714
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,278
and UC cbsv are present in the

715
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:25,278
population you know so while we say that

716
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:27,880
uh the incidence was at 44% this is

717
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:30,038
confirmed by the qpcr result

718
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,919
we know that cbsv despite being

719
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:35,319
predominant is is highly controlled by

720
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:36,919
genotype by environment interactions and

721
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:39,720
that comes to our recommendation that

722
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:41,679
you know sampling and characterizing of

723
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,798
isolates within location should be part

724
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,360
of routine breeding uh activities we

725
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:48,558
know we identify that there are no

726
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:50,839
correlations between cbsv and new cbsv

727
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:52,639
titer so that's the implication is

728
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:54,759
Breeders moving forward should treat

729
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,559
these as two different diseases and

730
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:57,839
develop strategies that are different

731
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:00,678
from each other

732
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:02,759
so we also noticed that again different

733
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:04,840
genomic regions are associated to the

734
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:06,519
trade that again drives to the point

735
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:08,240
that these are two different viruses

736
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:12,278
that should have two different breeding

737
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:14,638
strategies so to conclude uh this talk

738
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:17,519
we had research der variables our aim

739
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:19,879
was to characterize the C2 population uh

740
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,720
we wanted to expand phenotyping in

741
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,480
addition to the one five soring method

742
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,919
introduced root necrosis image analysis

743
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,519
and large scale virus TI quantification

744
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:31,399
which we did so but based on this

745
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,159
there's no clearcut method based on the

746
00:31:31,398 --> 00:31:35,398
one to five scoring method that we could

747
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:38,000
recommend for breeders breeders have to

748
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:40,119
do a cost benefit analysis to choose

749
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
either to do you know virus tit

750
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:45,239
quantification or image necrosis but

751
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,599
again more research is needed before

752
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,240
they could you know make those decisions

753
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:53,199
and we expanded our knowledge on cbsd

754
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,399
tile quantification so moving forward as

755
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,480
we were talking you notice different

756
00:31:55,398 --> 00:31:59,759
groups tend to identify different ecomic

757
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,000
regions based on the you know the

758
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:04,278
population that they use right so we are

759
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,038
proposing that if you know the casava

760
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:09,319
community could do a meta study for all

761
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:11,679
these uh published papers and have like

762
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:13,558
a baseline right that breeders could

763
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:17,600
follow rather than everybody have their

764
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:20,158
own thing own population we also uh

765
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:22,038
recently the Latin American lines they

766
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,960
are lines that were characterized for

767
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:26,398
cbsd in the greenhouse and these lines

768
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,720
don't you know they have differential

769
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:30,638
responses to cbsv but the most important

770
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,679
thing is they don't get infected by

771
00:32:30,638 --> 00:32:35,759
either you know so you could find a line

772
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:38,360
that's not infected by cbsv but is

773
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:40,440
highly susceptible to use cbsv so

774
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:42,439
breeders could integrate this in their

775
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,399
breeding populations and you know

776
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,159
develop resistance since we've

777
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:50,319
recommended a different breeding

778
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:52,480
strategy for both viruses so that brings

779
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:54,638
me to an end I would like to acknowledge

780
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,639
you know my committee that that was John

781
00:32:54,638 --> 00:33:00,959
L Michelle he and Keith

782
00:32:57,638 --> 00:33:04,199
the NRI team in Uganda the John Lani

783
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:07,519
club we have the people from dsmz The

784
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:10,880
Next Gen project and the M lab yeah

785
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,880
thank you I'll take any

786
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:18,359
questions so for the differ the Snips

787
00:33:14,638 --> 00:33:20,479
that we used were about 37,000 Snips uh

788
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:22,240
that se gave us fewer Snips but there's

789
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,240
this imputation work that had been done

790
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,599
by man so we combined you know the

791
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:30,399
former GBS Snips with the dat to improve

792
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:32,918
the number to get them to 30 37,000

793
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:36,439
about that if I have it right off head

794
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:38,440
uh for most like the to5 scoring method

795
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,960
and the virus titer quantification we

796
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,880
use the bueron threshold for the gas

797
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:47,079
which is very conservative but it was

798
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:49,760
good uh the root necrosis image analysis

799
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:52,000
so we did the modified bueron correction

800
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,798
threshold where you calculate for you

801
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,159
calculate a correlation Matrix for the

802
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:58,319
number of snips on each chromosome and

803
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,039
then you use that in calculating the

804
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:03,638
threshold so it was a more conserve uh

805
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:08,960
it was a more flexible so it's between

806
00:34:03,638 --> 00:34:11,639
it's not the FDR it's not uh as uh less

807
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,760
stringent like the false Discovery red

808
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:16,119
but it's also not very stringent like

809
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,399
the buffoni correction threshold so it's

810
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:18,399
in the

811
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:25,358
middle

812
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:27,838
yes yeah it's so I I tried out again

813
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:30,279
this is not like uh hacking a method I

814
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:34,199
tried out the FDR and I was getting

815
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:36,440
again too many sniffs that you know just

816
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:38,719
because it's a low threshold you get so

817
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,480
much that you could not explain or

818
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:43,439
interpret so I decided to go with the

819
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,320
stringent one that I'm very sure that

820
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,639
you know if a snip passes that threshold

821
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,639
then it something has to be happening in

822
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:57,559
it so again I think it's um because when

823
00:34:55,239 --> 00:35:00,159
we're calculating Naros sensoril we use

824
00:34:57,559 --> 00:35:03,039
the markers so if we have markers that

825
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:04,679
don't have like high density markers so

826
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:08,320
that could be a limitation to why we're

827
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:11,399
getting low Nance heritability

828
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:15,440
estimates so it's it's still a rough one

829
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:17,200
in my head but we want uh to because

830
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,559
through the next gen we've generated all

831
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:22,480
this data so the program at Morag we

832
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:25,719
have all this data in casava base so we

833
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:28,000
want to rerun the gws analysis as a with

834
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:31,039
all these cons that what done and

835
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,559
published and then uh from that we could

836
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:36,079
you know start talking about what we're

837
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:38,358
seeing any differences or any similar

838
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,720
any similarities that you know could be

839
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:45,319
used as a baseline for the population so

840
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:49,118
it's still uh a rough idea but I think

841
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:51,800
standardizing uh what people use for you

842
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:55,400
know determining What's significant in

843
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,400
relation with cbsd is

844
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,800
important

845
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:05,680
so the one 125 scoring method has been

846
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,679
used so we have data from since cbsd

847
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:10,639
breeding started so I apologize for

848
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:12,358
thinking that's the everybody knows

849
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:13,679
that's the method but across East Africa

850
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:15,358
and central Africa the one to five

851
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:18,000
scoring method is the standard method

852
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:20,159
that's using that's used so we will do

853
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,679
that based on the symptom severity

854
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:24,679
scores from the one to five scoring

855
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:27,480
method image analysis should be uh

856
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:29,399
should come in if a breeder feels

857
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,400
it would add value to their breeding

858
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,720
program but we're not recommending it

859
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,880
for all breeding programs because one

860
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:39,279
someone needs to know how to extract the

861
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,358
images from plant CV you know the

862
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,880
analysis part of it is also something

863
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:46,759
that I don't think every breeding

864
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:49,480
program has capacity on so the one to

865
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:52,319
five scoring method is understood and

866
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:56,039
will be used yeah

867
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:58,119
yes so the three we took uh images at

868
00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:00,440
the top part of the root so that's one

869
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:03,119
image the middle part and the bottom

870
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,838
part of the root just the same format

871
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,559
that they use when they're scoring C

872
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:09,679
Bron stke disase so they will cut the

873
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:11,480
root I think three times and then uh

874
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:13,838
three times not I think three times then

875
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:16,599
they'll give an average score of you

876
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:18,599
know the score that the cbsd score that

877
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:20,880
they saw at the different places in the

878
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:25,079
road so that's the same method we use so

879
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:30,800
each roote had uh three images uh we had

880
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:34,000
I think 150 IM measures per plot yeah so

881
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,359
we did not look at that specifically but

882
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,719
we have the data to answer that question

883
00:37:36,358 --> 00:37:40,440
if there's variability within the

884
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:43,000
different parts of the plant and does

885
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:46,358
this vary within the plot and between

886
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:51,039
plots so that's we didn't look at but we

887
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:51,039
have the data to look at it in future

888
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:54,679
yeah yes or

889
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,599
not

890
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:09,560
so there is a whole project on uh White

891
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:14,279
fly Behavior with C Bron St disease I've

892
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:16,838
not seen any research any ql research

893
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,560
from that group but if they do you know

894
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:21,039
identify those regions then it would be

895
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:23,838
possible to look at those regions and

896
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:25,440
see how they you know uh correlate or

897
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:27,799
are the same with the regions that we're

898
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,400
picking out so that's also a limitation

899
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,440
of the study we did not account for

900
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:35,519
white flies but we know that white flies

901
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:39,960
did transmit the infection for us

902
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:41,440
yeah okay so I think uh this is Richard

903
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,119
uh

904
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:47,760
Ricky uh so for the collection of the

905
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:51,400
categorical disease SC was the data

906
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,920
labored and who collected the data Ricky

907
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:57,160
the data was labeled so we used a field

908
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:00,480
book to collect this data so we know

909
00:38:57,159 --> 00:39:03,199
uh we know exactly what the Clone is we

910
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,559
also have uh backward scanners in the

911
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:08,639
field to help us identify which plot

912
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:10,679
which plant is that then the second part

913
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:14,199
of the question is uh do you think

914
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:16,559
accounting for R effects in your models

915
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:20,239
would improve the results the answer is

916
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:22,400
yes we know that uh breeders have you

917
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:24,118
know depending on who's who's scoring

918
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,599
and their experience they would give a

919
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:29,200
different score to the same plant so we

920
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:31,359
not account for R biases but we know

921
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:34,078
that that bias exists and that's why we

922
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:36,159
try to use image analysis to eliminate

923
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,960
that bias but we did not get great

924
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:42,598
results with the image analysis so Ricky

925
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,599
I hope that has answered your

926
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:54,239
question
