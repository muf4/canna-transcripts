1
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,359
okay

2
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:14,359
we're going to shift now to the

3
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:14,359
presentation for our first speaker

4
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:22,259
Dr Tracy Lasky reserved her PhD in

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,240
entomology from the University of

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,980
Massachusetts at Amherst

7
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:29,278
has been employed as a research

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,140
entomologist for USDA ARS at the

9
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,899
Appalachian fruit research station in

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,659
Kearneysville West Virginia since 2010.

11
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,820
her research focuses on behavioral and

12
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:40,799
chemical Ecology of economically

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,600
important tree fruit pests and

14
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,819
specifically on developing behaviorally

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,500
based monitoring tools and management

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,500
strategies for the brown marmorated

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,719
stink bug Plum croculio apple maggot fly

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,219
and Dogwood bore

19
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,840
Tracy

20
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,840
yes can you hear me Kathy

21
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:03,000
yes okay okay I'll go ahead then yes so

22
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,700
today I am going to talk about Brown

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,099
marmorated stink bug and its emergence

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,840
as a serious Pest of Agriculture here in

25
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:12,899
the Mid-Atlantic

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,439
uh to begin with brown marmorated stink

27
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,799
bug is considered an invasive species

28
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:22,258
and it is native to China Japan Korea

29
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,240
and Taiwan it's defined as an invasive

30
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,359
species because it has been introduced

31
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,819
into an area for which it naturally does

32
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,200
not occur in this case North America and

33
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:34,199
also because it threatens both

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,359
environmental and economic resources due

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,118
to the damage it causes in this case to

36
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:40,859
agricultural crops

37
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,078
now a little bit about the

38
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:45,359
identification of brown marmorated stink

39
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:49,679
bug if you haven't seen these insects

40
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:51,420
yet the adults you'll see on the right

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,939
hand side of the screen the lower right

42
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,340
with the male and the female they have

43
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:58,438
very prominent white stripes on their

44
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,079
antennae you can see the small Arrow

45
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:04,919
that's pointing at the left antenna of

46
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:07,258
the male Plum or male uh stink bug on

47
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,479
the outer edges of the abdomen there are

48
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,459
alternating patterns of white and dark

49
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,920
markings and this is actually why it is

50
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:17,098
referred to as the marmorated stink bug

51
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,859
it's another terminal term for

52
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:22,079
describing that appearance the underside

53
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,900
is generally pale with some gray or

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,760
black markings and of course they emit a

55
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,319
very pungent odor when Disturbed hence

56
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:30,359
they're called stink bugs and I can tell

57
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,219
you if you haven't smelled it previously

58
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,980
it smells very different than our native

59
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:37,259
species and some people often detect an

60
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:39,959
odor of cilantro when they when they

61
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:41,878
handle this bug although it it is much

62
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,400
more pungent than just the odor of

63
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:46,739
cilantro now the eggs in the upper right

64
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,879
hand corner are Barrel straight and when

65
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:50,219
they're first laid they're kind of

66
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:51,719
bright green but they turn white in

67
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:54,719
general they're laid on the undersides

68
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:57,359
of leaves in masses and there are

69
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:00,080
typically 28 eggs per mask the female

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,360
lays eggs in

71
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,519
intervals of seven typically the nymphs

72
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,739
you see the first instar nymphs there

73
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,900
just below the eggs the nymphs typically

74
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,519
the first in Stars will be near the

75
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,560
hatch tags and they will remain there

76
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,300
the seconds through the fifths are very

77
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,860
mobile and in fact they've been

78
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,540
described as sort of tick-like when

79
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,400
they're climbing around on foliage but

80
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:22,318
you can see that they typically also

81
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,599
have that those white stripes on the

82
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:27,238
antennae and again that's a good way to

83
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:29,878
define if these are brown marmorated

84
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,739
stink bug nymphs

85
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:33,719
now a little bit about the history of

86
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,239
brown marmorated stink bug and these

87
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:37,859
comments are related uh principally to

88
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,719
tree fruit because this is where we've

89
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,879
seen the most injury at least that we're

90
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,340
most familiar with this insect is

91
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:46,018
thought to have been introduced into the

92
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,140
United States somewhere between the mid

93
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:53,640
to late 1990s it showed up in Allentown

94
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:55,979
Pennsylvania in 1998 but the first

95
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:59,339
properly identified specimen didn't

96
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:01,738
occur until 2001 when specimens were

97
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,539
sent by Karen Bernhard who was this who

98
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,459
is with Penn State Cooperative Extension

99
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:07,439
she sent those to Cornell to Rick hoback

100
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,438
who confirmed they were indeed Brown

101
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,598
marmorated the following year in 2002

102
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,158
they were confirmed in New Jersey and

103
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:17,099
then we confirmed their presence in

104
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:19,319
Maryland and Hagerstown in 2003 we found

105
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,479
them in West Virginia in 2004 and they

106
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,219
continued to spread now there was a bit

107
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:26,099
of a lag period between those

108
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,320
introductions and and detections and

109
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,300
serious injury and in the Eastern

110
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,779
panhandle of West Virginia we actually

111
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,639
did not see injury until 2008 when the

112
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:37,379
first reports of late season injury

113
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,740
appeared

114
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:43,680
uh then in 2009 we began to see both

115
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,240
nymphs and adults in Orchards uh

116
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,579
throughout the middle of the season and

117
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,100
there was very serious injury in 2009

118
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:52,198
and then of course in 2010 this was

119
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,120
really a watershed year where we saw

120
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,100
injury in tree fruit small fruit

121
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,959
vegetables row crops and in Vineyards

122
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,540
and throughout the Mid-Atlantic States

123
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,918
including West Virginia Maryland New

124
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,660
Jersey Delaware Virginia and

125
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:06,120
Pennsylvania

126
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:09,139
now this is a distribution map of brown

127
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:12,180
marmorated stink bug throughout the 48

128
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:14,639
continental United States so the red

129
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,400
indicates states where we have seen both

130
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,340
severe agricultural problems as well as

131
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:23,219
nuisance problems from the fall

132
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:25,619
immigration of bugs from host plants to

133
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,479
potential overwintering sites the yellow

134
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,939
states are highlighted in that they have

135
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:32,219
had reports of nuisance problems in the

136
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:35,879
fall with homeowners but no agricultural

137
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,500
injury reported yet however when you see

138
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:39,959
these yellow States what that is

139
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,000
indicative of indicative of is

140
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,099
establishing populations where the

141
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,560
populations are beginning to increase

142
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,560
and then of course the green States mean

143
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,199
that we've had specimens detected but no

144
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,300
injury reported and no nuisance problems

145
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,639
reported and so at this point Brown

146
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,038
marmorated stink bug has been detected

147
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,840
officially in 33 States and the District

148
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,240
of Columbia

149
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,099
now the reason we were very interested

150
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,620
in brown marmorated and when I found the

151
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,960
first specimen back in 2003 we began

152
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,418
tracking it was because we were seeing

153
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,519
increasing injury from our native

154
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:17,459
species and in the Mid-Atlantic we have

155
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:19,620
three the brown and Dusky stink bug you

156
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:21,418
just disservice and tristigmas and the

157
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,120
great green stink bug Acro sternum

158
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:26,159
Hilary and in tree fruit this is the

159
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,620
typical injury that we find from native

160
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,900
stink bugs where on peaches we see the

161
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,120
cat facing and gamosas early in the

162
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:34,978
season and then on Apple which was

163
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,139
typically late season injury we see

164
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:39,240
these quirky indented depressions again

165
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:41,759
this is with our native species

166
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,740
and really the reason for that injury

167
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,780
has to do with the changes in our

168
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,960
Management Programs over the years after

169
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:50,399
the Advent of fqpa where we began to

170
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,500
shift from our broader Spectrum

171
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,379
materials to more specific chemistries

172
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,478
that were softer on beneficials and that

173
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:59,279
sort of thing so we were really removing

174
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:01,079
those broad spectrum materials from the

175
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,359
system and what this did was really

176
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:05,879
allowed increased injury from secondary

177
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,300
pests like native stink bugs

178
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:10,978
so during that time we were developing

179
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,199
monitoring tools for Native stink bugs

180
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:15,599
to determine the need for and timing of

181
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,340
insecticide applications and here you

182
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,319
can see the yellow ground deployed

183
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:21,899
pyramid trap that we had developed over

184
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,120
a number of years we also were working

185
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:26,698
on attract and kill strategies for

186
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,500
Native stink bugs as well and so for a

187
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:30,060
number of years we weren't seeing any

188
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,620
injury as I mentioned from Brown

189
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:36,598
marmorated however in late 2008 and 2009

190
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,300
this is what we began to observe in

191
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:41,579
commercial Orchards you see on the upper

192
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,500
part of the slide a mature peach with

193
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:45,478
adult Brown marmorated stink bugs

194
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,579
feeding and if you peel that skin away

195
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:50,219
this is the typical injury we would see

196
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:51,959
this Corky dry tissue beneath and blow

197
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,819
us an apple with the large indented

198
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:55,978
depressions again from Brown marmorated

199
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:58,979
stink bug feeding

200
00:07:55,978 --> 00:08:00,899
so in 2009 we were actually having quite

201
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,699
a bit of economic injury here in the

202
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:05,698
Eastern Panhandle this is just one

203
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:07,379
example of a commercial apple orchard a

204
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:10,080
family run operation they have about

205
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:12,839
1100 Acres they produce about a half

206
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,579
million bushels annually and by 2009

207
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,038
Brown marmorated stink bug was their

208
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:18,598
number one Pest and nearly 10 percent of

209
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,418
all the fruit they harvested in this

210
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:23,639
case 45 000 bushels of apples had to be

211
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:25,500
redirected from Fresh Market to

212
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,900
processing due to Brown marmorated stink

213
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,300
bug injury and certainly for commercial

214
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:32,278
Growers the loss of value are somewhere

215
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,979
between 80 and 90 percent so again

216
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:38,639
already a tremendous pest

217
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:40,560
in 2009 the other thing that we observed

218
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,718
was a tremendously large overwintering

219
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,119
population these photographs were taken

220
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,560
on the our building here at the lab at

221
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,139
the Appalachian fruit research station

222
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:51,299
so you can see the adults aggregating on

223
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:54,480
the sides of the building on the lower

224
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:56,159
left you can see the um the bumper of

225
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,320
someone's vehicle with brown marmorated

226
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,458
stink bugs and this really highlights

227
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,440
the fact that they are excellent

228
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:04,199
hitchhikers and can be taken to new

229
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,120
areas just because of this this Behavior

230
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,920
we see in the fall where they aggregate

231
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,839
in uh in tight quarters including

232
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:15,299
vehicles and then we also had problems

233
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:16,920
with them actually uh clogging our air

234
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:18,240
intake vent which you see in the upper

235
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:20,399
right

236
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,839
so what I'm going to do now is sort of

237
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,440
take you through what we learned in

238
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,880
terms of 2010 and the field season in

239
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,800
terms of the different hosts that were

240
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:32,278
attacked and the types of injury that we

241
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,899
observed in the winter of 2010 we had a

242
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:35,580
tremendous snowfall here in the

243
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:37,799
Mid-Atlantic something we are not very

244
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,139
familiar with but

245
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:42,179
um so there was a lot of snow cover and

246
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:44,338
the question is did that snow cover in

247
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:46,979
some way help Brown marmorated stink bug

248
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:49,320
over winter more effectively in other

249
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,820
words we had higher survivorship the

250
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,680
answer is we don't know at this point

251
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,740
but certainly it's a question we have to

252
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:59,219
address and so what we learned next was

253
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,620
by April 2010 much earlier than we had

254
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,139
ever observed before we began to spot

255
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,940
Brown marmorated stink bugs in some of

256
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:08,699
our experimental Orchards here on the

257
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:11,220
farm but also out in commercial Orchards

258
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,379
as well and so we began photographing

259
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,440
them just to sort of document that early

260
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:19,259
season activity but we presumed because

261
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,420
many Orchard covers sprays are going on

262
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:23,220
at this time this would protect the

263
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:25,559
fruit from any injury from Brown

264
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,480
marmorated so here you can see it's May

265
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:28,919
5th and they're feeding on Montmorency

266
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,560
cherry

267
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:33,299
here they are on May 10th feeding on a

268
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:35,099
lowering Peach it's about 20 millimeters

269
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:38,278
in diameter

270
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:41,820
Granny Smith apple on June 10th

271
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:43,379
and second pair also on June 10th and so

272
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,180
you're starting to get an idea of the

273
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:47,759
number of different hosts this insect

274
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:49,439
will feed upon and so again we were

275
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,539
hoping the cover sprays would be

276
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,019
controlling this insect but indeed that

277
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:57,000
was not the case so by late June we were

278
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:59,278
starting to see the first evidence of

279
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,679
this early season activity in commercial

280
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:04,078
Orchards and in this case it was very

281
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,799
specific to stone fruit

282
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,819
um

283
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:10,319
this is a a peach that is immature and

284
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,240
what you're seeing on the surface is a

285
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,220
bit of gamosis on the left but when you

286
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,019
cut that open this is something that's

287
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,079
very unique to Brown marmorated stink

288
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:21,839
bug we saw these pockets of dead and

289
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:24,059
sort of gummy dry tissue internally in

290
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:28,500
the fruit because of that early season

291
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:30,359
feeding and and it appears to us as the

292
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,919
fruit expanded these Pockets also

293
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,200
expanded as well

294
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,578
we also began to observe something that

295
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,740
was very different from our native

296
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:39,778
species which is not only was it adult

297
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,000
feeding but also nymphal feeding

298
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:44,338
typically from our native species we

299
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,379
really only worried about the adults and

300
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:47,820
then the final major difference was that

301
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:50,159
we were learning that in fact Brown

302
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,200
marmorated stink bug could reproduce in

303
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:54,179
commercial Orchards with our native

304
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,160
species they typically would reproduce

305
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:57,899
on broadleaf weeds and then move into

306
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:59,458
Orchards but this was not the case with

307
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:02,578
brown marmorated

308
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:05,039
so here we are on July 21st and you can

309
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:07,078
see both adults and nymphs feeding on

310
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,419
peaches immature peaches in commercial

311
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:11,778
Orchards and you can see the gamosas in

312
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:11,778
injury

313
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,800
then by The Late July we began to really

314
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,019
see the devastation from this insect

315
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:21,539
these are some photographs taken from

316
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:23,639
commercial Orchards that had total

317
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:26,278
losses of their early season Peach

318
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:28,740
varieties in this case the grower made

319
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:30,539
the decision to strip those trees and

320
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,159
allow the fruit to rot on the ground

321
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:34,439
because it was essentially a hundred

322
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,360
percent loss and you can look up through

323
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,459
this Orchard and just every fruit that's

324
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,039
on the ground had just extensive Brown

325
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:43,619
marmorated stink bug injury from that

326
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,899
early season feeding

327
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,578
then we began to see the other hosts

328
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,919
that this insect would attack in this

329
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:52,259
case this is field corn and so you can

330
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,599
see both adults and nymphs feeding

331
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:56,519
through the husk on the kernels and what

332
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,040
happens is the kernels do not develop

333
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:01,578
properly they also feed on sweet corn

334
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:04,019
and when they do the kernels turn brown

335
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:06,359
because of brown marmorated stink bug

336
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,100
feeding on silk they were inter they

337
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,740
were implicated in interfering with

338
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,259
pollination and then we had a number of

339
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,419
farmers as they were cutting the corn

340
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:17,659
for silage the brown marmorated stink

341
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:19,740
bugs in the

342
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:21,059
fields were so thick at that time

343
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,659
literally they had to turn on their

344
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:27,119
windshield wipers and so from that then

345
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:29,458
the question is that silage that was

346
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,320
created would this deter a cattle from

347
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:33,059
feeding on it because of the presence of

348
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,639
the brown marmorated stink bugs and if

349
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:37,138
it did not could it in fact taint the

350
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,299
milk because of those defensive

351
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:42,060
compounds from the insect so this is an

352
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:44,699
open question as well

353
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:47,699
now we also saw extensive injury on

354
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:50,220
raspberries where they were feeding on

355
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,800
the fruit and this was both again nymphs

356
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,300
and adults and severe feeding leads to

357
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,479
the fruit not coming free of the

358
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:59,819
receptacle and also we started to see

359
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,620
sort of die back at the tips of the

360
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,060
shoots which again we think may have

361
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,980
something to do either with their

362
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:07,199
salivary enzymes or perhaps they're

363
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:10,379
introducing something into the plant

364
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:13,200
that could again be causing this die

365
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:15,240
back at the tips that we're seeing

366
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,519
they also attack a number of vegetable

367
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,079
crops including Tomatoes you can see the

368
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,759
injury on the surface on that ripe

369
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:24,539
tomato and you can see the numbers they

370
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:26,458
really do like tomatoes as well as well

371
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:28,379
as bell peppers we saw a lot of injury

372
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:30,778
on bell peppers and you can see the

373
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:32,220
injury the dry Corky tissue beneath the

374
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:35,899
surface

375
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:38,579
it wasn't limited to

376
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:41,120
vegetables in this case this is row

377
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:43,500
crops and so in the center where you see

378
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,440
the part of the field that is referred

379
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,240
to as unaffected where the the soybean

380
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,980
plants are starting to dry and finesse

381
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,839
this is typically what we would see but

382
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,539
around the edges of fields where you see

383
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,300
that green area that is from Brown

384
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:59,578
marmorated stink bug feeding and the

385
00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:01,439
plants do not Nest properly there's sort

386
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:03,838
of a vegetative response they remain

387
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,459
green and so the pods do not develop

388
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,320
properly the beans do not develop

389
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:09,299
properly and this was a major issue for

390
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,060
soy green soybean Growers here in the

391
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:14,359
Mid-Atlantic and so the the soybeans

392
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:17,039
could not be developed or sorry

393
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,899
harvested correctly and of course there

394
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,899
was losses as well

395
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:24,480
they also at late August we see this

396
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:26,220
intense late season Fury feeding period

397
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,560
just prior to them entering

398
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,720
overwintering and so on Apple what we

399
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,778
began to see was really serious injury

400
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,940
and so this is a Pink Lady apple just

401
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:37,919
about six to eight weeks before Harvest

402
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,079
you see the fruit is quite deep in the

403
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,599
the injury is quite deep in the fruits

404
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,759
flesh and so obviously this is

405
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,100
unacceptable for Fresh Market and again

406
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:49,860
if it's redirected to processing the

407
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,019
loss of value can be up to 90 percent we

408
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,539
have a number of Growers that were in

409
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:56,278
this position and so now the question is

410
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:58,860
what are the processors going to be

411
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:00,480
doing in 2011 because this injury is

412
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,220
very deep it's very difficult for them

413
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,740
to peel out and so there may be new

414
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:07,440
requirements also due to the extensive

415
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,899
feeding there may have been questions of

416
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,820
premature drop of the fruit

417
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:13,860
now we also saw them feeding an

418
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,839
ornamental Nursery crops here they are

419
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,519
feeding on Norway maple on the left and

420
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,440
a newly planted Peach Tree on the right

421
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,240
and we don't really know what impact

422
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,680
that feeding may have but certainly with

423
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,940
the numbers that were out there we were

424
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,159
concerned

425
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,380
we also saw them feeding on Grape late

426
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,000
in the season this became an issue for a

427
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:32,458
number of Vineyards who had to get them

428
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,620
out of the Clusters or the lugs because

429
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,899
of issues potentially with taint to the

430
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,179
wine of course the feeding themselves

431
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:41,820
causes collapse of the berries and there

432
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:45,359
were also a presence of increased rots

433
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,920
despite the fact it was a very dry year

434
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,800
um so those are the those are the issues

435
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:51,539
in grape we also saw them in nut crops

436
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:53,519
these are pictures of hazelnuts with

437
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:55,980
feeding injury as well so you can see

438
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,139
The Host range is extremely broad so

439
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,959
that took us to harvest but in fact the

440
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:02,879
injury did not end there because in

441
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,918
throughout the Mid-Atlantic Growers have

442
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,318
put fruit into storage at Harvest

443
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,880
seemingly clean

444
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:11,039
um four to five weeks later we're

445
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,020
starting to see injury emerge from this

446
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,779
late season feeding that occurred during

447
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:17,759
that pre-harvest interval late in the

448
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:19,980
season just prior to harvest and so it's

449
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,140
not visible when the injury first occurs

450
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,058
but several weeks later it it appears

451
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,400
and so in the Mid-Atlantic we've had

452
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:28,379
there's been some surveys done by U.S

453
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,240
apple with Growers reporting or some of

454
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,160
these storage facilities reporting up to

455
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,038
60 percent of the fruit coming out of

456
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,900
Cold Storage having injury so serious

457
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,058
serious problems

458
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,038
so what's been going on well at the

459
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:43,440
national level one of the issues was

460
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:45,240
just getting the word out and so back in

461
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,460
September we held a meeting at two

462
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,440
commercial orchards in Maryland Catoctin

463
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,940
mountain and garden hour and this really

464
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,460
brought together both the leadership

465
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,740
from USDA as well as other government

466
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,960
agencies State Departments of Ag and the

467
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:01,019
research and extension Community to look

468
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,298
at this problem and really get people

469
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:04,918
talking about the issues and so this was

470
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:08,759
one of the events that really has been

471
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:10,740
useful another has been uh the press and

472
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:13,319
interestingly the Press really started

473
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:16,019
to pick up on the crop injury at the

474
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:17,220
same time when the homeowner issues

475
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:19,440
begin in the fall when the brown

476
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,940
marmorated stink bugs moved to homeowner

477
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,340
sites and probably one of the best

478
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,558
issues or best photographs that appeared

479
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:27,000
was in the New York Times and so you can

480
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:29,160
see the headline of the article move

481
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,480
over bed bugs stink bugs have landed and

482
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,940
certainly if you're competing with bed

483
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,679
bugs for press you know it's a serious

484
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,240
problem but you can see these folks this

485
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:38,280
is about a half an hour from our lab

486
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,440
they are lit literally sweeping up brown

487
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:43,200
marmorated stink bugs into five gallon

488
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,640
bucket so tremendous numbers of insects

489
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,819
out there

490
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,980
the other group that's been very useful

491
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:52,019
is the brown marmorated stink bug group

492
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,940
working group that's led by myself and

493
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:55,379
George Hamilton and this group is

494
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,259
designed to bring the research and

495
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,179
extension Community together and so what

496
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:02,339
we have been able to do is to develop

497
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:04,860
priorities for research and extension

498
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:07,079
and Regulatory and in looking at this

499
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:09,899
list you'll probably be able to see that

500
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:12,480
really are um we are at the beginning in

501
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:15,120
terms of understanding this insect

502
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,220
so this really leads into the research

503
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:18,599
that we've been conducting and so one of

504
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,759
the things we've been working on is

505
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:22,379
developing a monitoring tool for Growers

506
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:24,058
that essentially will allow them to

507
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,799
detect the presence abundance and

508
00:19:24,058 --> 00:19:28,319
seasonal activity of brown marmorated

509
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:30,179
stink bug and then ultimately to design

510
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,939
behaviorally based strategies like

511
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:34,679
attract and kill or mass trapping so let

512
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,660
me quickly take you through some of the

513
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,419
work that we've done toward a monitoring

514
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:41,580
tool looking for visual cues that can be

515
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:44,400
incorporated into a track a trap design

516
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:46,500
or factory cues the lures we use a

517
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,480
capture mechanism that is compatible

518
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,058
with their um

519
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,980
uh movement patterns and then a

520
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:55,379
deployment strategy where and when do we

521
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,259
deploy these traps and so what we have

522
00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:00,419
done so far is look at visual cues

523
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:02,160
associated with a pyramid trap one that

524
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:04,140
we had used for our native stink bugs

525
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,019
and we evaluated these five different

526
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:10,380
visual stimuli sources with baited and

527
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:12,298
unbated traps over a two-year period and

528
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,640
so we were able to capture a lot of

529
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:17,940
stink bugs obviously and what we found

530
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,520
was that for both nymphs and adults a

531
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:23,220
darker pyramid that has baited with a

532
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:25,440
known attractant is by far superior so

533
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:28,740
here you see adult captures in 2009

534
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,360
abated Black Pyramid trap 2010 there was

535
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,640
no difference between our dark green and

536
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:35,459
black but with the nymphs as well we're

537
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,940
seeing a baited Black Pyramid trap being

538
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,679
Superior so that's the first piece the

539
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,779
second is what we're doing right now is

540
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,059
the fact that brown marmorated stink bug

541
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:47,819
interestingly respond to wavelengths and

542
00:20:45,058 --> 00:20:49,859
intensities of light and so in this case

543
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:51,839
what we've been doing is trying to

544
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:53,639
discern what are those wavelengths and

545
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,678
intensity so we can incorporate it into

546
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,960
a trap design this picture by the way

547
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,820
was taken at a bank in Spring Mills West

548
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,798
Virginia and the size of the aggregation

549
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:04,500
around this light was estimated to be

550
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:06,240
about a million individuals so we have a

551
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,579
light bioassay right now that's trying

552
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,319
to capture that information and so you

553
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:12,298
can see where we're releasing insects

554
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,439
into this Arena and tracking their

555
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:15,960
movement and determining those

556
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,120
wavelengths and intensities

557
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,038
we also are trying to identify the true

558
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:23,099
pheromone these are headspace collection

559
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:25,079
chambers that allow us to identify uh

560
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:27,839
the headspace volatiles being released

561
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:30,240
by in this case adult male bugs and so

562
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,740
we hope in collaboration with Dr ijin

563
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,659
Zhang who's leading this part of the

564
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,700
project will have a better attractant

565
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:38,159
that we can use with our traps to really

566
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,860
lure these insects in so that's another

567
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,960
piece of this puzzle

568
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:44,639
in terms of capture mechanisms and

569
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,259
deployment strategies interestingly

570
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,419
there are a few commercially available

571
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:50,519
traps from Asia that we were able to get

572
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:52,559
our hands on and compare with our

573
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:55,139
prototype Black Pyramid trap which you

574
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,940
see on the right so in this case the

575
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,980
pier the traps that were available from

576
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,840
Japan

577
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:03,120
they were different in that on the left

578
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:04,798
you see this clear sort of pyramid trap

579
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,379
you deploy in the canopy of trees

580
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:09,599
compared with the ground the center is

581
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,460
this yellow water trap that considered

582
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,980
to be visually stimulating to the insect

583
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,779
and again deployed in the tree so we

584
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,179
were able to compare these at our farm

585
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:21,839
and what we saw was in this case that

586
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:23,759
our Black Pyramid trap was Superior in

587
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:25,500
terms of capturing both adults and

588
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,538
nymphs and so compared with these

589
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,519
commercially available traps so again

590
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:31,619
this is where we are right now in terms

591
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:34,139
of being able to monitor adult popular

592
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:37,139
and nymphal populations

593
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:39,480
so just to wrap up this portion we are

594
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,580
using this dark visual stimulus as our

595
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,798
part of our trap design it's a ground

596
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:45,899
deployed pyramid because both adults and

597
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:47,819
nymphs have a tendency to walk up

598
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,340
surfaces that's their natural behavior

599
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:52,139
we have a known attractant it is

600
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:54,298
particularly good for the nymph season

601
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,460
long but the adults really don't respond

602
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:58,740
strongly until later in the season so

603
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,079
identification of a pheromone is really

604
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,058
critical and then we hope to augment

605
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:05,699
these trap designs with light based on

606
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:07,859
optimal wavelengths and intensities

607
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,080
now the last piece I want to talk about

608
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:11,699
with you today before I wrap up is just

609
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,038
the challenges we've observed in

610
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:17,038
managing Brown marmorated stink bug in

611
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:18,900
commercial plantings because one of the

612
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:20,700
issues is that brown marmorated stink

613
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,280
bug has an incredibly broad Host range

614
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,319
they feed on over 300 different plants

615
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:27,178
and what this means is tremendous

616
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:29,639
season-long pressure from populations

617
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:32,400
moving from Wild hosts into cultivated

618
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,960
crops like our commercial Orchards in

619
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,759
terms of managing them we've seen

620
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,679
greatest efficacy when adults have

621
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,140
direct contact with finished Wet Spray

622
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,538
material however because they're

623
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:46,559
constantly immigrating into plot only a

624
00:23:42,538 --> 00:23:49,440
small population have contact with that

625
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:51,298
material and so that's a problem also

626
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,038
they have incredible avoidance behaviors

627
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:55,980
that allow them to potentially Escape

628
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:58,319
treatments and finally insecticides that

629
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,659
are labeled as excellent against native

630
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:03,599
species have not shown the same efficacy

631
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:05,400
against Brown marm rated in fact we have

632
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,199
seen knockdown in recovery from a number

633
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,419
of compounds and other compounds being

634
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,100
completely ineffective so let me show

635
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:13,740
you this knockdown and Recovery

636
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:16,259
phenomenon so what we did was to treat

637
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:19,019
one acre plots with Tombstone which is a

638
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:21,960
pyrethroid or vidate a carbamate we

639
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:24,538
recover these bugs from these um

640
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,700
plots and followed their mortality over

641
00:24:24,538 --> 00:24:28,558
time and the reason we did this is

642
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,480
because in grower Orchards where we saw

643
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:33,298
them spraying pyrethroids particularly

644
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:36,058
like Warrior and Asana literally 80

645
00:24:33,298 --> 00:24:38,519
percent of the bugs recovered within 24

646
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:40,319
to 48 hours and we were climbing back up

647
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:42,418
into the trees as incredible as that

648
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:44,460
sounds that's what happened so in this

649
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:46,440
case from this small bioassay that we

650
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,319
did what you can see is we tracked

651
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:52,080
mortality over

652
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:53,819
five days and so at the time of

653
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:56,038
collection all of the bugs were more

654
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:58,980
abund meaning they were unable to move

655
00:24:56,038 --> 00:25:00,720
but they were still alive their antenna

656
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,779
or leg might be twitching but they could

657
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,480
not climb vertical surfaces or move on

658
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:08,460
horizontal surfaces so red is dead and

659
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,319
alive means they are capable of moving

660
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:14,159
once again and so you can see that with

661
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:16,439
Tombstone by uh by the end of the the

662
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,720
trial about a third of them had

663
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,419
recovered from that exposure and so this

664
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,159
was the issue so what we did was to

665
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:25,140
think about that in designing an

666
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:27,299
insecticide evaluation that we conducted

667
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:30,299
over the winter months where we really

668
00:25:27,298 --> 00:25:32,579
needed to deal with what we consider to

669
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:35,038
be the primary threat those insects that

670
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:36,599
come in after the spray residue is dry

671
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:37,259
so

672
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:39,658
um

673
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:41,759
in this case what we believe is control

674
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:43,380
will depend on residual Effectiveness

675
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,480
and likelihood of uptake so our

676
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:47,580
laboratory bioassay was designed to be

677
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,679
biologically relevant based on that

678
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:51,538
primary threat and so all of the

679
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,059
compounds that we evaluate evaluated

680
00:25:51,538 --> 00:25:56,278
through this three-part trial required

681
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:58,500
about 24 person hours

682
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:02,759
so this is the list of materials we have

683
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:04,759
evaluated we evaluated both carbamates

684
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:06,720
organophosphates pyrethroids

685
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:08,759
neonicotinoids we looked at the

686
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,579
organochlorine material thiodin or

687
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:14,099
endosoften as well as other classes in

688
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:16,918
newer chemistries and this three-part

689
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:19,439
bioassay included first of all using

690
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:23,159
ethovision which is a software package

691
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:26,278
that allows us to track their movements

692
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:28,320
on insecticide treated dishes in a

693
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:30,240
horizontal plane so it tracks horizontal

694
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,678
mobility and we would conduct these

695
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,778
trials over a four and a half hour

696
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,880
period where they were exposed to these

697
00:26:33,778 --> 00:26:38,339
dry residues that had been cured for 18

698
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,740
hours then we would remove them from

699
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:42,778
these dishes and then look at their

700
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,460
capacity for vertical movements to sort

701
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:46,619
of mimic what may happen if they were

702
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,259
climbing back up into the trees and then

703
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:51,298
we were tracked mortality for seven days

704
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:52,980
so I can't go into all of these results

705
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:55,139
but what I want to show you is the type

706
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,640
of tracks that emerged from first of all

707
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,460
the horizontal mobility

708
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,679
where you can see on the top with water

709
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,240
as a control the bugs kind of behandered

710
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,659
around the dishes there wasn't really

711
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:08,759
any impact but with Warrior a pyrethroid

712
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:12,059
you can see at zero hours they appear to

713
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:13,740
be very stimulated within one hour you

714
00:27:12,058 --> 00:27:15,720
can see the track becomes more irregular

715
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,400
they're succumbing and within two hours

716
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,440
you can see it looks like the bug's just

717
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,720
about dead and that's what we would have

718
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,360
interpreted but in fact because of that

719
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,940
knock down in recovery the all of those

720
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:28,798
bugs 100 of those tested recovered in

721
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:31,320
fact they could even reproduce

722
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:33,538
so we tracked bug mortality for seven

723
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:35,519
days and this provided us with this

724
00:27:33,538 --> 00:27:37,740
lethality index and I know this is a

725
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:40,500
long list of materials but what I wanted

726
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:43,380
to point out is that we basically

727
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:45,480
we ranked each of these materials based

728
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,820
on how quickly they succumbed to the

729
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,460
material and also the overall rate of

730
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:52,259
mortality and so you can see that a lot

731
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,940
of the materials are older broad

732
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:56,940
spectrum materials that were most

733
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:59,159
effective so to wrap this part up in

734
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,440
terms of the insecticide work broad

735
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:04,200
spectrum materials including dimethylate

736
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,120
malathione bifenthrin methadathione and

737
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,120
a sulf and a methanol provided the

738
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:10,979
greatest levels of contact lethality now

739
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:12,899
certainly within each class the patterns

740
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,000
of lethality are similar but there's a

741
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,740
substantial amount of variation between

742
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,778
active ingredients in terms of the

743
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,859
intensity of effects on mobility and

744
00:28:18,778 --> 00:28:22,019
mortality

745
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:25,259
based on the activity of registered and

746
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:27,778
unregistered compounds um a section 18

747
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:29,400
for dinotaphiran also known as Safari or

748
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:31,440
Venom is being pursued for tree fruit

749
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,259
with Virginia as the lead State this is

750
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,538
a Mid-Atlantic Regional application and

751
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:38,339
in terms of tree fruit and other crops

752
00:28:36,538 --> 00:28:40,259
recommendations are being put together

753
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:41,879
based on what we have in the

754
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:43,679
Mid-Atlantic which is a season-long

755
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,720
threat now I know in other areas it'll

756
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,240
probably still be more of a late season

757
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,538
threat and in other areas obviously it

758
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,579
isn't well established

759
00:28:50,538 --> 00:28:55,440
so in terms of where we are right now we

760
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:57,418
have formed a nationwide team of 50

761
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,159
research and extension Personnel

762
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:02,520
throughout the US representing 14

763
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:04,200
institutions in 10 states we've put in a

764
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:06,240
very large specialty crop research

765
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,860
initiative proposal entitled biology

766
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,900
ecology and management of brown

767
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:11,459
marmorated stink bug and Orchard crops

768
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,580
small fruit grapes vegetables and

769
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:16,200
ornamentals and in terms of my lab's

770
00:29:14,579 --> 00:29:17,879
work we're going to continue to work on

771
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,679
the monitoring tools and behaviorally

772
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,899
based management strategies but the

773
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,759
bottom line for brown marmorated is that

774
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:25,619
it's going to require a sustained

775
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:27,658
Cooperative collaborative and integrated

776
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:30,239
approach for research and extension on a

777
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:32,278
national scale and I will tell you that

778
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,019
certainly within the strawberry industry

779
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:36,419
folks are going to be looking for brown

780
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:39,058
marmorated in 2011 and trying to

781
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:40,799
document any problems so far none have

782
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:43,558
been reported but with the broad Host

783
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:46,558
range we have to be extremely cautious

784
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:49,440
and and certainly document the host that

785
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:51,418
this insect May attack so this is my lab

786
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,740
group that worked with me on all of the

787
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:54,960
projects that we're conducting and

788
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:57,659
they're a great bunch of folks and then

789
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,278
finally my colleagues and Growers and

790
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:00,960
others throughout the Mid-Atlantic and

791
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,179
the US who have worked with me on this

792
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,860
project so I would be happy to get any

793
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:06,860
questions Kathy if there are any

794
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:13,398
thanks a lot Tracy are there any

795
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:13,398
questions

796
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:22,859
okay we'll give you a chance to think

797
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:27,019
about that and Tracy will be back with

798
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:27,019

00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:45,599
some questions about the stink but did

833
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,778
you want to take those or should I just

834
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:50,099
go ahead oh okay I didn't see those uh

835
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:51,960
let me see

836
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:54,000
I'd be glad to wait if you want to do

837
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,899
this yeah we could do that for just a

838
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,819
second

839
00:31:54,898 --> 00:31:59,819
okay Laura McDermott would like to know

840
00:31:56,819 --> 00:32:01,740
Tracy if Brown marmorated stink bug is a

841
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:03,298
pest of blueberries

842
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:06,419
so um

843
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:09,619
Rutgers did document them feeding on the

844
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:12,419
late season variety Elliott in 2010

845
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:14,158
other than that there hasn't been I mean

846
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:16,080
they're going to be doing season long

847
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,380
monitoring this year so that's what I

848
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:21,178
can tell you at this point

849
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:24,200
okay Pam Fisher would like to know how

850
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:26,640
it moves to new areas

851
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:30,419
generally we think that first of all

852
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,880
they are spread in some cases by their

853
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:34,679
um their fall overwintering behaviors in

854
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,778
that they end up in people's belongings

855
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:38,820
and they move them to a new location but

856
00:32:36,778 --> 00:32:40,319
certainly we've also seen as they

857
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:42,658
established here in the Mid-Atlantic

858
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:44,460
that they move themselves you know that

859
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:46,260
Leading Edge of the population has

860
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:50,038
continued to move through our region and

861
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:53,579
head south so both of those are sort of

862
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:54,558
providing the spread I would say

863
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:57,359
foreign

864
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:58,980
would like to know if your pyramid traps

865
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,719
or patterns thereof are available for

866
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:03,179
other collaborators

867
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,399
they are we have a blueprint that's

868
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:07,919
available and also we there is a

869
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:10,619
commercial provider that is making them

870
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,538
this year uh AG bio which I can provide

871
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:14,459
that to you Kathy if you want to pass

872
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:16,200
both the blueprint and that information

873
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:19,200
on

874
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:21,419
yes that would be great Bob Martin is

875
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,159
wondering where they overwinter and can

876
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:25,399
they be targeted at the overwintering

877
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:25,399
site

878
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,100
we know that they at least some portion

879
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,558
portions up in structures and homes and

880
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:36,178
things like that but in nature it's a

881
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:38,038
it's a big question what are the

882
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:40,860
preferred overwintering sites we've done

883
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:43,019
scouting and found them under sort of uh

884
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:44,939
bark on trees as well as sort of in

885
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:46,500
Rocky crevices and things like that and

886
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,798
that's where they've been reported in

887
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,419
Asia as overwintering but again we we

888
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:53,099
don't know and so we have some

889
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:55,320
experiments designed this year to sort

890
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:58,619
of set up both understanding where they

891
00:33:55,319 --> 00:34:01,500
overwinter most effectively in in in

892
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:03,119
terms of survivorship but also trying to

893
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:06,419
trying to track their movements to

894
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:08,579
potential overwintering sites

895
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:10,440
Carla is wondering if there's any

896
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:13,159
influence of temperature or weather on

897
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,159
insect movement

898
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,320
what those thresholds are but at lower

899
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:25,740
temperatures we see them more than

900
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,599
likely just walking around you know so

901
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:29,338
definitely I don't know what that

902
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,019
threshold is and even at higher

903
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:33,659
temperatures on some of our hotter days

904
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:36,358
these bugs would hunker down and sort of

905
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:39,119
just rest but again we have to Define

906
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:42,299
what those are

907
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,159
okay and and the last one for now Bob is

908
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,859
wondering if they have parasitoids for

909
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:50,760
these insects in Asia uh yes they do

910
00:34:46,858 --> 00:34:53,519
there is a species of uh wasp in the in

911
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:56,280
the Family seleniana Day genus trisulcus

912
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:58,619
that has been reported to parasitize up

913
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,960
to 80 percent of the eggs and in fact

914
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:03,900
those have been collected and are in

915
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,838
quarantine at our sister facility in

916
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,760
Newark Delaware Dr Kim Homer has been

917
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:10,980
screening these potentially four release

918
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:17,839
within the U.S but again we're still

919
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:17,838
very early in that um uh in that process

920
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,460
laughs

921
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:27,139
Pam Fisher commented Bob would probably

922
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,139
like to go on a collecting trip okay

923
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,500
they'll be trying to ask more questions

924
00:35:28,858 --> 00:35:34,019
of Tracy at the end Steve

925
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,539
okay thank you uh well first I want to

926
00:35:34,019 --> 00:35:38,280
thank Kathy and the organizers of the

927
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:40,259
webinar for inviting me to participate

928
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,640
and I appreciate the chance to share

929
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,280
some things that are happening out here

930
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:46,019
West in California but first of all I

931
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,000
want to say I really enjoyed Tracy's

932
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:49,440
presentation I learned a lot and it

933
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,820
makes me glad I'm a plant pathologist

934
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,338
because some of those pictures are

935
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,780
creeping me out I don't think I would

936
00:35:53,338 --> 00:35:57,420
like to see all those bugs around my

937
00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:00,660
house or my vents either so a very

938
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:02,880
interesting Tracy and I think my talk is

939
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:04,559
a very consistent and very appropriate

940
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,500
to put with Tracy because I'll be

941
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:09,779
talking about uh some recent uh

942
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,539
challenges to Strawberry out west here

943
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:14,880
which also involved new problems and

944
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:16,858
perhaps recent introductions so some of

945
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,160
the principles and things might uh you

946
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:22,519
know really mesh well with what Tracy

947
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:22,519
talked about

948
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,599
so first I I think the audience here is

949
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,338
probably very experienced but just to

950
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,380
pull us all together I'm going to be

951
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:34,019
talking about some soil born issues some

952
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,820
new starborn issues on strawberry and so

953
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:37,559
here's a picture just showing us to

954
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,200
remind us that solving problems by

955
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:43,019
definition are plant pathogens that are

956
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:45,838
in the soil so at the top left you can

957
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:48,239
see uh what's called lettuce dieback

958
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:49,799
disease on lettuce it's a actually a

959
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:52,259
very strange pathogen this is a

960
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,140
soil-borne virus the viruses in the soil

961
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:57,300
it's spread in the soil on the water and

962
00:36:55,139 --> 00:36:59,039
it is very aggressive and causes

963
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,260
significant problems on certain types of

964
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:04,199
lettuce like this Romaine picture here

965
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:07,020
and the bottom left here's a sole one

966
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:08,939
problem on onion this is a white rot a

967
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:11,880
very destructive disease on that group

968
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,980
of plants and then to the right vertic

969
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,019
sodium weld on strawberry probably very

970
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:18,240
familiar disease to many of you and

971
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:20,159
again a soil worm problem so we're just

972
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:22,259
going to be talking about these new

973
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:24,838
issues that are soil borne issues in

974
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:27,300
California and on strong sorry

975
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:29,578
and just to pull together the basics of

976
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,900
this type of issue again I think a lot

977
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:33,359
of you in the audience already know this

978
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,519
but there are some very distinctive

979
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:38,098
features of these challenges that are in

980
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:40,440
the soil first of all they often survive

981
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:43,200
for a very long time these pathogens in

982
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,599
the soil sometimes can actually survive

983
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:47,759
for decades without a host plant there

984
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,440
and as you might guess that is a

985
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,180
tremendous headache for a producer for a

986
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,099
grower or farmer because even if you're

987
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:55,879
not growing the crop the fungus or the

988
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:59,160
pathogen is still there so the very

989
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,780
long-term survivors in the soil and

990
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:02,338
they're often difficult to detect that's

991
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,260
not always the case we have some good

992
00:38:02,338 --> 00:38:06,659
tools for some of these but in terms of

993
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:08,880
trying to know whether your field has

994
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:11,460
one or more of these problems it's not

995
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,380
always that easy to find out before you

996
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:15,539
plant the crop and before you see the

997
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,400
problem occur so sometimes difficult to

998
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:18,779
detect and find them and I probably

999
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,119
would add to the slide they're also

1000
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,980
difficult to diagnose I'll touch on that

1001
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:26,160
later in the presentation but sometimes

1002
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,179
knowing which one you have is often not

1003
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:28,618
easy

1004
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:30,539
as I mentioned these would be very

1005
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:33,838
damaging uh you're talking about plant

1006
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:36,779
death or on the on the brighter side

1007
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:38,219
just crop loss in terms of yields these

1008
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,980
problems again a very significant

1009
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:43,019
economic factors in agriculture

1010
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,699
and part of the reason why they're so

1011
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:46,259
important and damaging is that they're

1012
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:48,358
easily spread

1013
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:50,400
um not quite like stink bugs but we

1014
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:52,619
spread these ourselves meaning we as

1015
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,599
farmers and Growers and people for the

1016
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:57,300
most part these are primarily spread as

1017
00:38:54,599 --> 00:39:00,599
contaminants in dirt or mud and on

1018
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:02,160
equipment on tractors on trucks so uh

1019
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:04,440
probably The Growers and the pest

1020
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:06,838
control advisors and field Walkers and

1021
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,659
our all these people who are moving

1022
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:11,699
equipment and vehicles around that's how

1023
00:39:09,659 --> 00:39:14,699
we spread a lot of these we can also

1024
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:17,219
spread them in propagation material so

1025
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:19,379
that's another Factor but most of the

1026
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:20,838
time we're spreading them in the dirt in

1027
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,099
which they're found

1028
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:26,759
one problem in terms of managing

1029
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:28,559
Sovereign problems or pathogens for the

1030
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,680
most part fungicides are not very

1031
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:33,000
effective we could probably find

1032
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:35,159
exceptions if we look around but for the

1033
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,039
most part your fusariums your

1034
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:40,559
verticilliums all these uh many soil and

1035
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:43,199
problems don't respond well and are not

1036
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:45,659
really controlled well by fungicides

1037
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:48,059
and then often these pathogens have a

1038
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:51,358
white Host range so you may be growing

1039
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:53,400
strawberry or crop X you'll say well I

1040
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:55,199
have too much of a problem the sobering

1041
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,720
problem on strawberry I'll plant

1042
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,519
something else often that other crop can

1043
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:01,799
also be a host and will prolong that

1044
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:04,320
problem so it's a complicated set of

1045
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,839
factors here but this one slide kind of

1046
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,019
summarizes these features of silver and

1047
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:11,338
pathogens

1048
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:13,500
so the issue that's happening out in

1049
00:40:11,338 --> 00:40:15,659
Californians are fairly recent one and

1050
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,338
uh I'd like to walk you through what's

1051
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:19,799
happening out here West regarding this

1052
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:22,078
but I would say that even if you're not

1053
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,640
out west here and you uh are strawberry

1054
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,440
Growers somewhere else in the country or

1055
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:27,420
you grow some other crop and you don't

1056
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,800
have these issues I still would argue

1057
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:32,639
this might be of interest to you because

1058
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,680
it kind of possibly mirrors or acts as a

1059
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:37,139
model for what happens when new

1060
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:38,879
pathogens are introduced to an area and

1061
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:40,618
when new problems occur and how you

1062
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,200
approach it how you diagnose these

1063
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:45,480
things so I think again even if you're

1064
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:48,419
not sharing our issue particularly at

1065
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:50,760
the moment with Californians the

1066
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,858
information and the history that I'll

1067
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,599
show here certainly can reproduce in

1068
00:40:52,858 --> 00:40:55,980
your area with a different crop or a

1069
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:58,500
different pathogen

1070
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:00,539
and by recent what I mean is the die

1071
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:03,599
back and collapse issues on strawberry

1072
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:07,679
that are new we first began to see in

1073
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:10,380
2005 and unfortunately from 2005 through

1074
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:11,940
the present we've seen an increasing

1075
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,858
incidence meaning we've seen these

1076
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:16,740
problems spread throughout the state of

1077
00:41:13,858 --> 00:41:20,159
California if in one County we had two

1078
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:23,159
fields that had the problem in 2005 by

1079
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:24,539
2010 there were 12 Fields so we're

1080
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:26,819
seeing more and more Growers and more

1081
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:29,759
and more ranches affected by that

1082
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:31,440
very important to point out these new

1083
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,020
die back and collapse problems which

1084
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,420
I'll show you are not associated with

1085
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:38,280
and have never been associated with the

1086
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:40,320
other well-known pathogens that already

1087
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,300
occur in Strawberry so if you're a

1088
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,859
strawberry person you know that there's

1089
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,560
phytophthora issues and there's

1090
00:41:43,858 --> 00:41:49,319
verticillium and there's rhizoctonia you

1091
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:51,299
know there are some well-documented uh

1092
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,320
historical soil when pathogens on

1093
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,359
strawberries

1094
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:56,519
these new problems I'm showing you today

1095
00:41:54,358 --> 00:41:57,779
have never been associated with these

1096
00:41:56,519 --> 00:42:00,239
other problems

1097
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:02,820
and the other important Association here

1098
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:04,799
almost without exception these are

1099
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:06,480
occurring in fields that no longer

1100
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,240
receive the traditional fumigation

1101
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,820
treatments so in California of course

1102
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:14,939
you know our industry has really relied

1103
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:17,220
on methyl bromide and chlorpicrin flat

1104
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:19,800
fumigation meaning we're applying that

1105
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:22,980
fumigation to the entire field not just

1106
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,720
to the beds and that practice has really

1107
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:28,019
made it successful in terms of yields

1108
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:30,419
and and dollar value these new problems

1109
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:32,338
are occurring in these fields that no

1110
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:35,280
longer receive that traditional fat

1111
00:42:32,338 --> 00:42:37,619
fumigation either because of cost or of

1112
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,019
course the change in the regulations and

1113
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:43,320
with methyl bromide leaving on its way

1114
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:45,119
out so those factors not associated with

1115
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:47,940
previous pathogens that are known to

1116
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,559
occur and occurring where we no longer

1117
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,780
fumigate in the same traditional way

1118
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:53,279
these are really Hallmarks of these new

1119
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,680
problems

1120
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,599
now today we know that there are two

1121
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:00,779
major pathogens associated with these

1122
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:03,539
problems macrophobina phaseolina which

1123
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:06,000
causes a disease called charcoal rot and

1124
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:07,920
a strain a fusarium oxysprum which

1125
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,318
causes fusarium Wilt on strawberry

1126
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,880
neither of these were known to occur on

1127
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:14,880
strawberry in California prior to 2005.

1128
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:21,059
in terms of the the history again what's

1129
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,280
happening initially I'll show you some

1130
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:25,739
maps but initially we only saw these

1131
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,720
problems in Southern California where we

1132
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:28,979
have our Southern crop and now it's

1133
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:31,439
occurring in other parts of California

1134
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,760
and I'll illustrate that for you and

1135
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,960
then in a second here I'm going to show

1136
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,060
you what it looks like if you're not

1137
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,099
familiar with these diseases but the

1138
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:40,980
symptoms are very much characterized

1139
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:43,440
here by this list you see the wilting of

1140
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,579
plants there's overall poor growth and

1141
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,679
performance

1142
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:48,900
and then as the disease progresses and

1143
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:51,000
as you go into the season eventually the

1144
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:53,460
plants will actually collapse and die

1145
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,199
and then when you examine these plants

1146
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:56,880
it's very important to dig them up out

1147
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,799
of the ground and cut them up and look

1148
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,960
inside the plant you'll see a very

1149
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,960
distinctive discoloration of the inner

1150
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,760
tissues primarily the crown

1151
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,740
so let's take a look at these problems

1152
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,980
this is the first one this is charcoal

1153
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:12,659
rot caused by the fungus macrophobia and

1154
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:15,300
this is a soil-borne fungus that's known

1155
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:16,799
to occur in soil and I believe you would

1156
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,960
share in my opinion that this is a

1157
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,940
significant problem if you see this type

1158
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,599
of photograph or if this is your field

1159
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:26,338
we have distinct areas where a large

1160
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:29,599
percentage of the plants collapse and

1161
00:44:26,338 --> 00:44:29,599
die as pictured here

1162
00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:35,279
just a little closer up look to show you

1163
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:38,639
again macro famina or charcoal rot

1164
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,319
occurring on strawberry and uh plants

1165
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:42,960
especially the one in the bottom center

1166
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:44,519
photo showing advanced cases where

1167
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,980
they're collapsing

1168
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:48,000
the photo in the upper right and let me

1169
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:51,440
try

1170
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,579
Kathy's train me on this Arrow here

1171
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,858
hopefully you can see that the photo on

1172
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:57,539
the upper right this is a collapsed plan

1173
00:44:55,858 --> 00:44:59,460
and I pointed out to you now because

1174
00:44:57,539 --> 00:45:02,460
later I'll talk about diagnosing and

1175
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:05,159
trying to identify these problems and

1176
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:07,920
here I would argue and debate with you

1177
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:09,659
the fact that this type of symptom looks

1178
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,059
very much like it could be infected with

1179
00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:14,759
verticillium so again if you're looking

1180
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:18,179
to say identify this just based on the

1181
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:19,859
picture or on a visual of the plant I

1182
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:22,259
think that's a dangerous assumption

1183
00:45:19,858 --> 00:45:25,199
because this is macro femina and not

1184
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:28,500
verticillium

1185
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:30,118
as I mentioned to you to diagnosis or to

1186
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:33,239
assist in diagnosing it you need to dig

1187
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:35,460
up these plants and cut them open and

1188
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:38,639
the macro Familia always shows a very

1189
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:41,579
distinctive discoloration in the crown

1190
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:43,318
here you know already that the healthy

1191
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:45,900
plant tissue will be cream colored or

1192
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:48,119
light colored like this but the infected

1193
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,940
plant with macro firmino will have these

1194
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:52,680
very distinctly dark

1195
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:56,059
discolored sections of the crown and

1196
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:56,059
here are three examples of that

1197
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,460
now what we do here in California of

1198
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:05,338
course in all states we have plant

1199
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,659
Pathologists like myself you give these

1200
00:46:05,338 --> 00:46:08,460
plants to a plant pathologist and

1201
00:46:06,659 --> 00:46:10,559
they'll take out through sterile

1202
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:12,599
procedures they'll take out small bits

1203
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,880
of that Crown tissue and put it in a

1204
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:16,140
Petri plate with appropriate media and

1205
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,079
that's what you see in the upper left

1206
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:20,759
here and that black speckly Colony

1207
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:23,460
growing off from those strawberry pieces

1208
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,680
that is the macro famina and this is the

1209
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,780
way you confirm the presence of this

1210
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:30,539
pathogen in Strawberry crowns

1211
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:32,819
and then I mentioned earlier one reason

1212
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:35,579
why these pathogens like Mac or femina

1213
00:46:32,818 --> 00:46:37,739
are so dangerous and bothersome they

1214
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:40,079
last in the soil for a long time and

1215
00:46:37,739 --> 00:46:41,578
here in the large photo in the front you

1216
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,920
could see why

1217
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:46,619
every one of these little black specks

1218
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:49,260
is one survival structure this is called

1219
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:51,358
a micro sclerosium and every single one

1220
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:54,060
of these little black specks is a it's

1221
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:56,940
like a seed for the fungus it is uh very

1222
00:46:54,059 --> 00:46:59,519
hard it's black which means it's able to

1223
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:01,740
resist ultraviolet light and it's able

1224
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:03,838
to survive and persist in the soil for a

1225
00:47:01,739 --> 00:47:06,479
prolonged period of time and this is

1226
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:07,980
what the fungus makes to enable it to

1227
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,420
survive to the next crop to the next

1228
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:11,280
strawberry crop

1229
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:13,500
this particular photograph shows the

1230
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,920
size too there's my trusty penny at the

1231
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:20,300
bottom and uh this is grown in a sand

1232
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:22,619
and cornmeal medium so here you can see

1233
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:25,019
these little crystalline pieces here

1234
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:27,059
these are little grains of sand so this

1235
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:29,639
gives you an idea of the size of the

1236
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:32,400
micro sclerosis how they're very small

1237
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:34,259
and how if the fungus is making these

1238
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,119
These are easily transported in

1239
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:38,760
contaminated soil these can be in the

1240
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:41,099
soil in just a clot of mud on a tractor

1241
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,839
or disk and when you move that disc to a

1242
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:45,359
clean field you've moved these micro

1243
00:47:42,838 --> 00:47:47,940
sclerosis so this shows again why that's

1244
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:50,039
a problem for our Growers and people in

1245
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:52,740
ag

1246
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:55,079
okay so that's the first problem the

1247
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:57,539
second one is fusarium Wilt and it's

1248
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:59,280
basically following the same uh pattern

1249
00:47:57,539 --> 00:48:02,400
here recently introduced to California

1250
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,800
not seen before in California soil born

1251
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,420
problem spreading the soil and we began

1252
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,400
by seeing it in small patches the

1253
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:10,519
photograph at the top shows what we

1254
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,260
began to see in I think 2006 actually

1255
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:15,000
where uh these small areas in our

1256
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:17,520
Strawberry Fields began to collapse and

1257
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,338
die and over time these patches got

1258
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:22,440
larger the photograph in the bottom on

1259
00:48:20,338 --> 00:48:24,480
the front shows a couple years later

1260
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:27,179
where these patch these patches gotten

1261
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,619
much larger more plants are affected and

1262
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:32,539
we're beginning to be very concerned

1263
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:32,539
about spread to new areas

1264
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:36,839
here's a close-up of that this is

1265
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:39,599
fusarium Wilt on strawberry again it's

1266
00:48:36,838 --> 00:48:40,858
our second new development in fields

1267
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:45,059
that are no longer receiving the

1268
00:48:40,858 --> 00:48:46,559
traditional flat fume treatment and in a

1269
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:49,318
second I'll talk about diagnosing these

1270
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:52,739
but again I would argue that you and I

1271
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:54,480
we cannot separate this photograph from

1272
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:57,479
the macro formida ones the plant

1273
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:00,679
symptoms are identical and also resemble

1274
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,679
verticillium wilt

1275
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:08,699
again you need to dig up these plants

1276
00:49:06,539 --> 00:49:10,858
and look at them and cut them open and

1277
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:13,318
again just like the macro femina the

1278
00:49:10,858 --> 00:49:16,078
fusarium wilt causes a very distinctive

1279
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:18,259
dark discoloration in the inner Crown

1280
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:21,000
tissue and so again

1281
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:22,859
one cannot diagnosis strictly by looking

1282
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,719
at the outer collapse you have to dig up

1283
00:49:22,858 --> 00:49:27,420
the plant cut open the crown and look

1284
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:28,679
for this type of symptom inside now as

1285
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:31,019
I've just shown you with macro famina

1286
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:32,460
I'm telling you this is fusarium so how

1287
00:49:31,019 --> 00:49:34,559
you say well how can you separate these

1288
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:37,199
well you cannot separate again based on

1289
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,880
the symptoms so you take these plants to

1290
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:41,699
your friendly neighborhood neighborhood

1291
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,980
plant pathologist and we will again

1292
00:49:41,699 --> 00:49:46,199
plate pieces of that strawberry tissue

1293
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,880
on the appropriate medium and look for

1294
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:50,159
what grows out and in this case this is

1295
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,980
the fusarium which has a different look

1296
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:55,980
to it it's has a very pinkish color in

1297
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:57,480
this medium and we can diagnose it based

1298
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:00,659
on this recovery

1299
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:03,179
the photograph in the lower left shows

1300
00:50:00,659 --> 00:50:05,338
you the survival structures for this

1301
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:07,559
fungus these are called chlamidospores

1302
00:50:05,338 --> 00:50:10,318
it functions very much the same as those

1303
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:12,119
black specks of the macrophilamina it

1304
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:14,460
survives in the soil for a prolonged

1305
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:16,140
period of time it resists weathering and

1306
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:19,579
this is how the fungus survives between

1307
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:19,578
crops and from year to year

1308
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:26,400
so to show you um our dilemma or our

1309
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:29,460
issue and concern uh here are two

1310
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:33,300
snapshots in time as you will for our

1311
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:36,599
state regarding macro femina in 2005 we

1312
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:39,079
began to see detect and confirm the

1313
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:42,000
macrophomina on strawberry in California

1314
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:44,160
and it was only in two counties we have

1315
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,619
a significant strawberry industry in

1316
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:48,420
Ventura County and Orange County so

1317
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:51,660
those are the two orange I'm sorry those

1318
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:53,220
are the two pink stars there so 2005 we

1319
00:50:51,659 --> 00:50:54,779
began to get concern for our Southern

1320
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:55,980
California Growers because of this

1321
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,500
problem

1322
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:00,960
unfortunately when we fast forward now

1323
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:04,619
to 2010

1324
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:07,260
2010 we have a number of other counties

1325
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:09,500
that also report and have confirmed this

1326
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:13,380
same macro for me on strawberry

1327
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:15,179
as you probably know our major area of

1328
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:18,000
strawberry production California is is

1329
00:51:15,179 --> 00:51:20,219
the central part of the state all the

1330
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,480
way down through the South so this is

1331
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:23,578
Monterey County actually where I'm

1332
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:25,800
located here in Salinas this is Monterey

1333
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:27,359
County from Monterey County South we

1334
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:30,240
have the majority of the state's

1335
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:32,699
strawberries and you can see that four

1336
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:35,098
out of the major five counties

1337
00:51:32,699 --> 00:51:36,358
for strawberry in this area have the

1338
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:38,880
macrophobina

1339
00:51:36,358 --> 00:51:40,558
the four counties to the north have

1340
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,380
smaller more limited strawberry

1341
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:45,059
Industries so the acreage is limited but

1342
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:46,619
they also have the problem so you could

1343
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:49,079
see why we're concerned about the future

1344
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:51,660
when you have this spread and increasing

1345
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:54,119
incidents throughout our state

1346
00:51:51,659 --> 00:51:55,799
so that's macro formida

1347
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:58,460
and then here I want to show you a

1348
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:02,280
similar pattern although at this point

1349
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:05,460
fewer Stars thankfully for fusarium Wilt

1350
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:07,440
on strawberry 2006 was the first year we

1351
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:09,900
confirmed fusarium on strawberry in

1352
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:12,179
California and you could see that the

1353
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:16,619
only place we found it was in Ventura

1354
00:52:12,179 --> 00:52:19,379
and then we fast forward to 2010 we have

1355
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:21,539
two sites two counties with the fusarium

1356
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:24,838
that's good news bad news the good news

1357
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:28,139
is it has not spread to say 10 or 8

1358
00:52:24,838 --> 00:52:29,880
counties the bad news is however the

1359
00:52:28,139 --> 00:52:32,039
fusion has been found in one of our

1360
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,858
major strawberry producing areas and

1361
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:36,619
that's my home base in Monterey County

1362
00:52:33,858 --> 00:52:38,880
here in the Central Coast of California

1363
00:52:36,619 --> 00:52:40,920
so even though there are only two

1364
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:45,000
counties affected these two counties

1365
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:47,039
probably account for I would estimate 65

1366
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,900
to 70 percent of our state's strawberry

1367
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:51,539
production so even though it's not

1368
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:57,019
Statewide yet the fusarium has touched

1369
00:52:51,539 --> 00:52:57,019
down in our two major producing counties

1370
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:02,839
in terms of the distribution as of last

1371
00:53:00,838 --> 00:53:06,838
year just for background information

1372
00:53:02,838 --> 00:53:08,940
macro flaming is not a new disease uh in

1373
00:53:06,838 --> 00:53:11,460
California only it's also occurring in

1374
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:13,139
other parts of the world and I might add

1375
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:14,460
it's very interesting to note that for

1376
00:53:13,139 --> 00:53:17,098
all these other parts of the world

1377
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:20,039
reporting macro femina it's primarily

1378
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:22,440
showing up again in locations where they

1379
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:25,679
no longer use methyl bromide so Egypt

1380
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:27,539
France India Israel and Spain these

1381
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:29,818
places are reporting macro femina on

1382
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:31,199
strawberry and these are places where

1383
00:53:29,818 --> 00:53:33,659
they are not using the traditional

1384
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:35,639
fumigation practice anymore for

1385
00:53:33,659 --> 00:53:37,500
macrophobia we need to add Australia

1386
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:40,039
Australia is another country that has

1387
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:43,318
macro femina on its strawberry

1388
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:45,300
in the USA maybe some of you know about

1389
00:53:43,318 --> 00:53:47,940
this I don't know where you all are from

1390
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:49,380
but right now in Strawberry it's been

1391
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:51,780
confirmed I've reported in California

1392
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:53,700
Florida and Illinois

1393
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:56,339
and then I talked to you earlier about

1394
00:53:53,699 --> 00:53:57,539
the counties in my own state with that

1395
00:53:56,338 --> 00:54:00,179
map

1396
00:53:57,539 --> 00:54:01,440
for the distribution of fusarium if you

1397
00:54:00,179 --> 00:54:03,659
zoom slightly different than macro

1398
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:06,000
formula macro forming is a new worldwide

1399
00:54:03,659 --> 00:54:09,118
development and what I mean by new is

1400
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,099
you know in the year 2000 and Counting

1401
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:13,740
that's when macro femina began to be

1402
00:54:11,099 --> 00:54:16,318
reported on strawberry Fusion is a

1403
00:54:13,739 --> 00:54:18,899
little bit different fusarium is not a

1404
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:21,019
brand new disease because the beliefs

1405
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:24,960
the Japanese and maybe the Koreans

1406
00:54:21,019 --> 00:54:27,358
reported fusarium back in the 1960s and

1407
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,880
19 early 1970s and I think Australia

1408
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:31,980
also has had it a long time so a few

1409
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:34,920
zero mode on strawberry has been in the

1410
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:37,079
world a longer time and unfortunately

1411
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:39,619
now we in the USA are just added to that

1412
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:42,200
list of infested countries

1413
00:54:39,619 --> 00:54:45,300
but for us it's brand new in California

1414
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:47,578
for whatever reason the fusarium wilt

1415
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:49,680
disease on strawberry has been reported

1416
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:53,000
in California and South Carolina in

1417
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:53,000
terms of USA states

1418
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:57,780
so let's talk a minute here about

1419
00:54:56,219 --> 00:54:59,519
something that I think is extremely

1420
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:02,220
practical for almost all of you probably

1421
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:05,460
uh participating and listening in today

1422
00:55:02,219 --> 00:55:07,318
and that is uh diagnosing you know if

1423
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:10,019
you're a grower or a pest control

1424
00:55:07,318 --> 00:55:11,940
advisor or you walk fields and make a

1425
00:55:10,019 --> 00:55:14,400
recommendations or you're a sales person

1426
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:15,800
selling products to Farmers and people

1427
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,358
in ag

1428
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:21,300
you know that it's extremely important

1429
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:23,039
and critical actually to identify and

1430
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:25,440
know what the problems are I mean if you

1431
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:27,179
see a stink bug on your crop you better

1432
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,800
call Tracy to find out which one it is

1433
00:55:27,179 --> 00:55:30,299
right you need to know what what the

1434
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,940
problem is and have a precise

1435
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:35,460
identification of the problem and for

1436
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:37,619
pathogens that originate in the soil

1437
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:40,800
that's very much a challenge and as this

1438
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:43,140
Photograph here illustrates I'd be glad

1439
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:46,500
to bet with you your lunch money about

1440
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:48,960
which pathogen or pathogens might be

1441
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:51,000
responsible for these symptoms the point

1442
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,619
is you can't tell and I as a

1443
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,838
professional who work with these 12

1444
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:56,700
months of the year I cannot tell which

1445
00:55:54,838 --> 00:55:58,799
pathogens are responsible for these

1446
00:55:56,699 --> 00:56:01,679
dieback problems because it could be one

1447
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:04,800
of our new issues that macro famina or

1448
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:07,139
fusarium or it could be one of the old

1449
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:09,900
time favorites verticillium phytophthora

1450
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:11,940
we do not know and I want to use just a

1451
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:13,740
couple minutes here to illustrate why

1452
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:16,260
this is a very big Challenge and why

1453
00:56:13,739 --> 00:56:17,639
it's important to recognize the issue so

1454
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:19,920
the first challenge is with our new

1455
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:22,500
issues here our new problems the macro

1456
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,599
for a minute and fusarium in my mind are

1457
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:27,719
virtually identical in terms of the

1458
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:30,900
symptoms poor growth stunting die back

1459
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:33,539
plant collapse discardation of that

1460
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:34,858
Crown which I showed you and also I

1461
00:56:33,539 --> 00:56:37,318
haven't talked about this too much but

1462
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:40,799
very much stress related both of these

1463
00:56:37,318 --> 00:56:42,539
pathogens can really cause the most

1464
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,400
severe damage when the crop is stressed

1465
00:56:42,539 --> 00:56:47,039
and that is either through environmental

1466
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,960
extremes when it's very hot and dry or

1467
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:50,519
there's a little bit of water stress if

1468
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,079
you're a grower and you're half a day or

1469
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:53,699
a day late watering and the plant's a

1470
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:56,940
little bit under stress because of that

1471
00:56:53,699 --> 00:56:58,318
water shortage the these pathogens are

1472
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:00,358
very aggressive and cause much more

1473
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:03,659
damage and much more rapid development

1474
00:57:00,358 --> 00:57:07,619
of problems under stress so for macro

1475
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:09,480
ferment and fusarium both of these act

1476
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:11,099
the same they look the same you and I

1477
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,318
cannot separate them readily without a

1478
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:15,000
Laboratory test so diagnosing these are

1479
00:57:13,318 --> 00:57:16,858
going to be a problem for you they're a

1480
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,679
problem for me

1481
00:57:16,858 --> 00:57:20,940
and then to expand this a little bit I

1482
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:23,460
mentioned the old-time favorites

1483
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:26,940
vertical and phytophthora for the most

1484
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:28,740
part these symptoms and features are

1485
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:32,159
shared by all four of these problems the

1486
00:57:28,739 --> 00:57:34,019
two new ones macro femina infuserium and

1487
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:37,399
the old one spiritual and phytophthora

1488
00:57:34,019 --> 00:57:39,420
so if you have these types of symptoms

1489
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:41,099
in general it's going to be very

1490
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:43,440
difficult for you to know what's going

1491
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:45,359
on without the support and help of a

1492
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,579
laboratory or an extension pathologist

1493
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:49,799
or someone who can actually have things

1494
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:52,380
tested

1495
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,940
um the one exception here is phytophthus

1496
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:55,858
are really not considered a stress

1497
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:57,179
organism you can have

1498
00:57:55,858 --> 00:57:58,619
um if I talk through issues on

1499
00:57:57,179 --> 00:58:00,838
strawberries that are growing quite well

1500
00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:03,119
and in fact as you know being a water

1501
00:58:00,838 --> 00:58:05,338
mold it likes lots of moisture in the

1502
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:07,818
soil so the stress thing is it's not

1503
00:58:05,338 --> 00:58:09,960
quite relevant here

1504
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:11,338
there's some good questions here if it's

1505
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,139
I think it would be a good chance to

1506
00:58:11,338 --> 00:58:15,179
take these right now

1507
00:58:13,139 --> 00:58:18,480
are these problems worse under plastic

1508
00:58:15,179 --> 00:58:20,098
culture uh maybe Teresa can send me a

1509
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,659
follow-up question

1510
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:23,640
I'm wondering if you need plastic

1511
00:58:21,659 --> 00:58:26,940
culture meaning large hoop houses that

1512
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:29,159
cover the whole planted area or plastic

1513
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:30,420
covered beds that the plastic is just

1514
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:33,598
covering the beds and the plants are

1515
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:35,338
planted into that so I need that

1516
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,920
um have these diseases ever been

1517
00:58:35,338 --> 00:58:40,318
observed in fumigated Fields

1518
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:43,079
um we have seen them in fumigated Fields

1519
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:45,358
again we need to qualify this here in

1520
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:47,940
California our experience is primarily

1521
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:49,619
with the production Fields these

1522
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:52,858
production Fields have been fumigated

1523
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:55,680
with Alternatives not the methyl bromide

1524
00:58:52,858 --> 00:58:57,480
chloropicarine they have been um

1525
00:58:55,679 --> 00:59:00,058
fumigated with these new replacement

1526
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:02,639
materials we are seeing these diseases

1527
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:04,559
in those situations if it's fumigated

1528
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:06,179
with methyl brolic chloropicarine at the

1529
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:09,059
appropriate rate and that's the

1530
00:59:06,179 --> 00:59:11,399
traditional treatment we do not see and

1531
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:13,319
have not seen those problems so yes we

1532
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,880
are seeing them in fumigated fields and

1533
00:59:13,318 --> 00:59:16,679
these are ones that again are in the New

1534
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,440
World being treated with alternative

1535
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:21,779
materials

1536
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:24,420
uh okay and then finally the question

1537
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:26,760
about Nursery stock as of right now and

1538
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:29,099
uh I think we need more information from

1539
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:31,920
the nursery producers in our state we

1540
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:34,559
have not heard of significant problems

1541
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:37,559
of these two new pathogens in the

1542
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:40,440
nursery production uh Counties have not

1543
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:42,660
seen that and we do receive materials

1544
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:45,240
from them for testing for other things

1545
00:59:42,659 --> 00:59:48,480
and so far I've never isolated

1546
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:50,578
macrophobia or fusarium from transplants

1547
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:53,000
coming from those areas we do get those

1548
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:56,339
standards the vertices

1549
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,679
but no we have not seen these new ones

1550
00:59:56,338 --> 01:00:02,159
from transplants yet

1551
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:03,779
okay Teresa got back to me see

1552
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:05,699
the question is

1553
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:08,339
um

1554
01:00:05,699 --> 01:00:11,460
uh okay so I think she's asking do we

1555
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:13,739
see these problems or are they worse in

1556
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:15,780
fields where the beds are covered with

1557
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:18,419
plastic and then the plants are planted

1558
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:20,940
into the plastic as opposed to the use

1559
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:24,119
of straw or mulch as a covering of the

1560
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:26,400
bed for us in California you may know

1561
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:29,940
this we do not use anything except

1562
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:33,240
plastic we don't use straw or mulch

1563
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:35,400
covers for strawberry production so we

1564
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:37,318
only see it in in the beds with the

1565
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,880
plastic but that's because all

1566
01:00:37,318 --> 01:00:41,279
strawberries are planted into plastic

1567
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,920
covered beds so as of right now I don't

1568
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,660
know the how that might how that Dynamic

1569
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,920
might play out for other types of bed

1570
01:00:45,659 --> 01:00:48,598
covering

1571
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:50,700
and then the last question then I move

1572
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:52,619
on for a second here

1573
01:00:50,699 --> 01:00:53,939
the question is has Macro for me to

1574
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:56,700
let's see

1575
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:58,559
question is can macro Familia be a

1576
01:00:56,699 --> 01:01:00,419
problem in temperate in a temperate

1577
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,619
climate zone

1578
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:03,780
um

1579
01:01:01,619 --> 01:01:06,298
and I I'm only a mere plant pathologist

1580
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:08,400
so I you need to Define for me exactly

1581
01:01:06,298 --> 01:01:10,858
what temperate climate means does

1582
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,838
temperate mean me here in central

1583
01:01:10,858 --> 01:01:13,818
California

1584
01:01:12,838 --> 01:01:17,400
um

1585
01:01:13,818 --> 01:01:19,858
Mediterranean type climates uh I'll look

1586
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:22,680
for the reply on that I'll go ahead here

1587
01:01:19,858 --> 01:01:25,259
and get to that question in a second

1588
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:27,838
okay so we in California have these

1589
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:29,400
problems uh hopefully you won't but the

1590
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:30,900
way things move in the world and with

1591
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:33,539
these new developments perhaps you will

1592
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:36,660
so uh what are we collectively going to

1593
01:01:33,539 --> 01:01:39,239
do about dealing with these problems

1594
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:41,279
again I think an audience like uh this

1595
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:44,039
today you're probably very experienced

1596
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:46,619
so uh you could do this slide you could

1597
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:49,259
put this together you would approach the

1598
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:51,960
macro formula or fusarium issues the

1599
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:54,240
same as you would any other cyborg issue

1600
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:55,858
that's nothing novel about that when

1601
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:58,318
it's novel is the fact we have new

1602
01:01:55,858 --> 01:02:00,539
pathogens on strawberry in California

1603
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:03,298
and what's novel is we're in an era

1604
01:02:00,539 --> 01:02:05,759
where we're losing the main tool methyl

1605
01:02:03,298 --> 01:02:09,059
bromide that has been used in years past

1606
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:11,400
to to defeat these these challenges so

1607
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:12,540
that's what's novel what is not novel is

1608
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:15,539
how you deal with it it's going to be

1609
01:02:12,539 --> 01:02:16,980
the same as with other sobern issues so

1610
01:02:15,539 --> 01:02:19,079
first of all

1611
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:21,119
um select the appropriate site I mean if

1612
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:24,240
you have the flexibility and the ability

1613
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:26,700
to just move off site don't plant in an

1614
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:29,159
area that reports a history of this

1615
01:02:26,699 --> 01:02:32,039
problem if you know that this field over

1616
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:34,739
here down the road has macro femina then

1617
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:36,179
you would not be well advised to lease

1618
01:02:34,739 --> 01:02:40,019
that ground and plant strawberry next

1619
01:02:36,179 --> 01:02:42,480
year stay away from known infested sites

1620
01:02:40,019 --> 01:02:44,280
very important is crop rotation if

1621
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,039
you're a diversified grower and you grow

1622
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:49,079
things more than strawberry just don't

1623
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:51,539
plan something that's a host don't plant

1624
01:02:49,079 --> 01:02:54,000
strawberry don't have time to go into

1625
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:56,400
this today but we know or feel that this

1626
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,219
fungus will affect other crops that are

1627
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:02,220
known to be hosts of macrofreaminas so

1628
01:02:59,219 --> 01:03:04,500
example is pepper so if you have a

1629
01:03:02,219 --> 01:03:06,358
disease strawberry in a field don't

1630
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:08,219
plant pepper there either and don't

1631
01:03:06,358 --> 01:03:10,318
plant strawberry anymore try rotate

1632
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:13,558
crops you know plant lettuce plant

1633
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:15,659
broccoli plant petunias plant things

1634
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:18,420
that are not a host rotate away from

1635
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:20,399
that problem rotate away from Strawberry

1636
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:23,280
for conventional Growers fumigation

1637
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,900
remains a tool a management tool but the

1638
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:27,119
question is which materials I'll show

1639
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:29,818
you a slide near the end here that shows

1640
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:33,180
our work in California that indicates

1641
01:03:29,818 --> 01:03:35,460
some of the Alternatives do control the

1642
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:38,519
macrophobia and fusarium but it's not

1643
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:41,519
100 and we are getting uh escapes and

1644
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:42,960
we're getting a reinfestation of these

1645
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:45,119
problems so that's not the answer in

1646
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,980
itself we do have fumigation that will

1647
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:48,480
help but it will not eradicate the

1648
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:51,240
problem because it's not as good as

1649
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:53,460
methyl bromide chlorpicrine

1650
01:03:51,239 --> 01:03:55,979
if you have access to resistant

1651
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:58,260
strawberry cultivars that is obviously a

1652
01:03:55,980 --> 01:04:00,119
good management tool for for solvent

1653
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:02,099
problems I'll again show you at the end

1654
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:05,579
some of our work we show that there are

1655
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:07,859
differences in the varieties and so

1656
01:04:05,579 --> 01:04:09,359
um we have the ability to maybe in the

1657
01:04:07,858 --> 01:04:11,400
future breed for some resistant

1658
01:04:09,358 --> 01:04:12,838
varieties as of right now we don't have

1659
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,760
true resistance but we have varieties

1660
01:04:12,838 --> 01:04:16,679
that are more tolerant plant those if

1661
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,980
those are available if they fit your um

1662
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:21,179
your your situation

1663
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:23,280
as I mentioned to you both the new

1664
01:04:21,179 --> 01:04:25,139
problems uh are definitely stress

1665
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,720
related plants that are stressed from

1666
01:04:25,139 --> 01:04:29,818
environmental extremes and I think I

1667
01:04:27,719 --> 01:04:31,500
forgot to mention fruit load plants are

1668
01:04:29,818 --> 01:04:33,900
distressed with a very very heavy fruit

1669
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:36,298
load that's good for you the grower

1670
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:38,760
that's bad for a strawberry plant that's

1671
01:04:36,298 --> 01:04:40,739
already infected with Mac or famina a

1672
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:42,900
heavy fruit load puts a physiological

1673
01:04:40,739 --> 01:04:45,659
stress on plants and that will

1674
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:47,579
definitely create the onset of very

1675
01:04:45,659 --> 01:04:50,578
severe and fast developing symptoms for

1676
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:53,099
these problems and finally of course we

1677
01:04:50,579 --> 01:04:55,920
talked about soil if you are moving

1678
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:57,780
dirty soil infested soil from place to

1679
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,599
place between Fields you are going to

1680
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:02,579
move these pathogens so stop that don't

1681
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:05,160
do that we're having more and more

1682
01:05:02,579 --> 01:05:07,140
Growers actually wash off equipment it's

1683
01:05:05,159 --> 01:05:08,879
a big pain in the neck but it's

1684
01:05:07,139 --> 01:05:11,818
something that is extremely important if

1685
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,019
you want a safeguard clean fields in the

1686
01:05:11,818 --> 01:05:15,179
long run

1687
01:05:13,019 --> 01:05:17,219
okay let me uh quickly take a couple

1688
01:05:15,179 --> 01:05:18,298
more questions here

1689
01:05:17,219 --> 01:05:20,399
um

1690
01:05:18,298 --> 01:05:22,920
okay oh great question uh there's a

1691
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:25,500
question about whether you can have uh

1692
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:28,858
this problem show up in cooler climates

1693
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:32,039
like northern Europe uh Poland Germany

1694
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:34,318
um very good question and um I would say

1695
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:37,440
of course uh we never want to say never

1696
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:40,019
so we can't say that but we can say that

1697
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:43,559
macrophobia entries area are both well

1698
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:45,838
known as warmer temperature pathogens so

1699
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:48,720
both of these pathogens prefer warmer

1700
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:50,880
soils and I think I won't go back here

1701
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:52,980
but you can see from the slides in

1702
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:55,380
general a lot of those countries that

1703
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:58,260
report the problem tend to have areas

1704
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:59,700
where the climate's very warm so as of

1705
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:03,180
right now we haven't had any of these

1706
01:05:59,699 --> 01:06:05,279
reports from say Norway so I would think

1707
01:06:03,179 --> 01:06:08,098
that the equivalent climates would

1708
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:10,980
either not have an issue with these on

1709
01:06:08,099 --> 01:06:13,318
strawberry or if you eventually have the

1710
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:15,179
issue the severity of the problem may be

1711
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:17,279
lessened because of the cooler climate

1712
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:19,558
both these pathogens like warmer

1713
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:23,400
temperatures and I know that's relevant

1714
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:25,619
relative but still I think uh northern

1715
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:27,298
European uh production might not have

1716
01:06:25,619 --> 01:06:28,798
the same issue

1717
01:06:27,298 --> 01:06:30,838
uh

1718
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:32,038
uh okay and I can't remember if Tracy if

1719
01:06:30,838 --> 01:06:34,139
we

1720
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:36,180
I think we got Tracy's question she's

1721
01:06:34,139 --> 01:06:38,038
going to be leaving us soon uh question

1722
01:06:36,179 --> 01:06:42,058
from Bob

1723
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:44,400
um oh does this uh prom occur in soybean

1724
01:06:42,059 --> 01:06:47,519
Illinois or in soybean anywhere I guess

1725
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:50,400
where plants are under stress uh and yes

1726
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:52,739
the answer is uh yes macro firmina is a

1727
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,559
well-known pathogen of soybean so

1728
01:06:52,739 --> 01:06:57,419
soybean has been a known host of Macro

1729
01:06:55,559 --> 01:06:59,640
femina for for a decade or longer

1730
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:01,680
probably a long time and so that's very

1731
01:06:59,639 --> 01:07:04,019
much a known part of the problems for

1732
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:05,399
soybean and I don't know about the

1733
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:07,380
stress thing for soybean but I imagine

1734
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:09,680
the profile is similar if the soybeans

1735
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:12,240
are under water stress or other issues

1736
01:07:09,679 --> 01:07:14,699
we do tend to see macrophilia to develop

1737
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:18,000
faster on any crop under stress so

1738
01:07:14,699 --> 01:07:19,739
definitely yes to that good question

1739
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,179
so in the time I have left with you just

1740
01:07:19,739 --> 01:07:24,179
a little bit about our research to

1741
01:07:21,179 --> 01:07:26,159
highlight what we discussed earlier so

1742
01:07:24,179 --> 01:07:28,558
um there are differences in Strawberry

1743
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:30,358
varieties in terms of susceptibility to

1744
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:32,940
the macrophobina and we're doing similar

1745
01:07:30,358 --> 01:07:33,838
work with this on fusarium as well just

1746
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:36,659
want to show you a little bit of

1747
01:07:33,838 --> 01:07:40,318
information here so for example in this

1748
01:07:36,659 --> 01:07:44,179
scale a bigger number is bad so Diamante

1749
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:48,058
here at the bottom the maximum is five

1750
01:07:44,179 --> 01:07:51,719
Diamante has the 4.9 disease severity

1751
01:07:48,059 --> 01:07:54,240
ranking that means that it's a extremely

1752
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:58,139
decimated by the macro femina when you

1753
01:07:54,239 --> 01:08:00,899
infect it however the Seascape has a 2.9

1754
01:07:58,139 --> 01:08:03,358
it is significantly more tolerant to the

1755
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:06,358
fusaria sorry to the macrophobia it

1756
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:09,239
holds up much better but I hasten to add

1757
01:08:06,358 --> 01:08:12,838
that it has a 2.9 we would like to see a

1758
01:08:09,239 --> 01:08:14,939
1.0 there a 1.0 means basically no

1759
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:17,640
symptoms the plant is not affected by

1760
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:20,039
the macroflamina and we are looking at a

1761
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:22,440
resistant plant Seascape is not

1762
01:08:20,039 --> 01:08:24,838
resistant but it is more tolerant so it

1763
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:27,178
holds up better but it is still diseased

1764
01:08:24,838 --> 01:08:29,579
but this shows you that our hope is to

1765
01:08:27,179 --> 01:08:32,100
develop varieties that are resistant and

1766
01:08:29,579 --> 01:08:34,140
so that we would have a chance to

1767
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:35,480
develop that and replace the ones that

1768
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:39,119
are very sensitive

1769
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:41,399
uh Bob is asking are these numbers the

1770
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:43,318
severity index numbers here related to

1771
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:44,698
crop load in this particular experiment

1772
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:46,620
No in fact I'll show you the next

1773
01:08:44,698 --> 01:08:48,539
photograph this is a controlled

1774
01:08:46,619 --> 01:08:50,818
experiment in a shade house we

1775
01:08:48,539 --> 01:08:54,359
inoculated potted strawberry plants just

1776
01:08:50,819 --> 01:08:56,160
to see the basic reaction to the fungus

1777
01:08:54,359 --> 01:08:59,460
and this does not have anything to do

1778
01:08:56,159 --> 01:09:01,619
with Harvest fruit load or just the

1779
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:03,480
fruit load of the plant itself so no it

1780
01:09:01,619 --> 01:09:05,698
is strictly susceptibility of the plant

1781
01:09:03,479 --> 01:09:07,198
to the fungus

1782
01:09:05,698 --> 01:09:10,439
and this is what I'm talking about Bob

1783
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:13,619
uh so here is our Seascape on the far

1784
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:15,358
right it has been uh injected with the

1785
01:09:13,619 --> 01:09:17,338
macro for me that just like the other

1786
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:19,440
varieties but you can see that even

1787
01:09:17,338 --> 01:09:22,619
though they're inoculated at the same

1788
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:24,899
time the Ambiance Ventana are much more

1789
01:09:22,619 --> 01:09:27,539
sensitive to the macro femina the

1790
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:29,338
Seascape holds up much better however if

1791
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:31,619
I gave you the Seascape plant and you

1792
01:09:29,338 --> 01:09:33,960
cut it open you could see slight

1793
01:09:31,619 --> 01:09:36,119
discoloration in the crown meaning that

1794
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:37,619
it has been infected and if you wait

1795
01:09:36,119 --> 01:09:39,238
long enough the Seascape will start to

1796
01:09:37,619 --> 01:09:43,698
show collapse problems as well but it'll

1797
01:09:39,238 --> 01:09:43,698
take a much longer time to develop

1798
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:48,960
and this is kind of summarizing the work

1799
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:50,338
overall in terms of some of the

1800
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,619
resistant variety so let's look at the

1801
01:09:50,338 --> 01:09:54,479
column here for macro fomina I just

1802
01:09:52,619 --> 01:09:56,519
showed you Seascape Seascape and

1803
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:58,439
Chandler are two strawberry varieties

1804
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:01,260
that are we're calling it resistant

1805
01:09:58,439 --> 01:10:02,759
resistant does not mean immune immune

1806
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:04,800
means you don't even get infection but

1807
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:06,600
they are infected but Chandler and

1808
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,300
Seascape hold up much better to macro

1809
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:11,280
femita than say the varieties Monterey

1810
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:14,820
San Andreas and Fontana which are

1811
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:16,738
extremely susceptible or sensitive

1812
01:10:14,819 --> 01:10:18,840
and the other column under fusarium

1813
01:10:16,738 --> 01:10:20,939
however the Chandler and Seascape

1814
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:22,500
unfortunately are very susceptible so if

1815
01:10:20,939 --> 01:10:24,599
you have both of these problems in your

1816
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:26,100
field one or the other is going to get

1817
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:28,500
you unfortunately

1818
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:31,199
if you inject these plants with fusarium

1819
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:33,238
the Monterey San Andreas and fentana are

1820
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:34,799
resistant so that's good news but of

1821
01:10:33,238 --> 01:10:37,439
course as I mentioned they are

1822
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:39,060
susceptible to the macro femina so we

1823
01:10:37,439 --> 01:10:41,519
have the unfortunate situation where

1824
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:43,440
there's not yet one variety that will

1825
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,620
withstand both of the new challenges in

1826
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:45,619
California

1827
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:54,179
okay then finally just to talk about

1828
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:56,400
chemicals so the the deal is as I

1829
01:10:54,179 --> 01:10:58,640
mentioned we're losing the best of

1830
01:10:56,399 --> 01:11:02,460
bromide chloropicrin the the standard

1831
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:05,280
methylprylic grin at a high rate used as

1832
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:07,560
a flat fume application in California to

1833
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:09,899
treat the whole field that is going out

1834
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:12,780
and we strongly believe that is why

1835
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:14,579
these new problems are coming in the old

1836
01:11:12,779 --> 01:11:17,759
traditional meter controllers going out

1837
01:11:14,579 --> 01:11:20,519
so the new pathogens are coming in so we

1838
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:22,980
have looked at alternative treatments uh

1839
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:24,600
the list is here to see if there's

1840
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:27,178
something else that can really help us

1841
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,739
in combating these problems and two

1842
01:11:27,179 --> 01:11:30,239
things to note here one there's a lot of

1843
01:11:28,738 --> 01:11:31,738
different treatments I won't take the

1844
01:11:30,238 --> 01:11:33,419
time to go through this but a lot of

1845
01:11:31,738 --> 01:11:35,698
different treatments this is one of

1846
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:37,440
several uh one of three experiments

1847
01:11:35,698 --> 01:11:39,839
we're doing in this type of research

1848
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:41,759
Define an answer to these sober problems

1849
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,779
so we have a lot of Alternatives we're

1850
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,420
looking at

1851
01:11:42,779 --> 01:11:47,579
secondly the photograph is important to

1852
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:50,100
remind me to tell you these are applied

1853
01:11:47,579 --> 01:11:52,519
to the bed in California we're getting

1854
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:56,760
away from applying it to the whole field

1855
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:59,159
the public opinion The Regulators the

1856
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:01,199
general direction of the world is away

1857
01:11:59,158 --> 01:12:03,899
from using all these chemicals at high

1858
01:12:01,198 --> 01:12:05,698
rates and high volumes so one way to

1859
01:12:03,899 --> 01:12:08,279
address that is just to apply it to the

1860
01:12:05,698 --> 01:12:11,219
beds the beds are pre-formed they're

1861
01:12:08,279 --> 01:12:13,259
almost ready to plant the the fumigation

1862
01:12:11,219 --> 01:12:15,179
material or the fumigant material is

1863
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:17,219
then injected or applied to the beds

1864
01:12:15,179 --> 01:12:19,319
sometimes applied through the drips drip

1865
01:12:17,219 --> 01:12:21,899
irrigation that's in the bed already and

1866
01:12:19,319 --> 01:12:23,759
then later after time has elapsed the

1867
01:12:21,899 --> 01:12:25,979
plants are put into the beds that's bed

1868
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:27,840
fumigation so we're applying these

1869
01:12:25,979 --> 01:12:29,879
materials in this system in this bed

1870
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:32,760
fumigation method

1871
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:34,380
and again time will allow me to do this

1872
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:36,119
or go through this individually nor do

1873
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:38,640
you want me to do that the bottom line

1874
01:12:36,119 --> 01:12:40,319
is if we saw something that was

1875
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:43,020
um equivalent to a methyl bromide

1876
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:45,960
chloropicrin traditional fumigation the

1877
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:48,239
bar would reach the number one here but

1878
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:51,179
go no further we are looking at trying

1879
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:53,819
to get something equivalent to a level

1880
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:55,500
one in terms of disease severity

1881
01:12:53,819 --> 01:12:57,299
you can see the good news here the good

1882
01:12:55,500 --> 01:13:00,600
news is a lot of these Alternatives the

1883
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:03,600
first nine or so control the problem

1884
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:05,820
quite well and so they're doing a good

1885
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:08,640
job at controlling or at least knocking

1886
01:13:05,819 --> 01:13:10,319
down populations the bad news is they

1887
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:13,380
are not comparable to that level one

1888
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:15,359
they all allow some macro formida and

1889
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:16,859
some fusarium to creep through and

1890
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:18,539
that's what we're continuing to see in

1891
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:21,299
these fields we do see die back and

1892
01:13:18,539 --> 01:13:23,399
collapse even though the the field the

1893
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:25,800
plots have been applied with these

1894
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:28,738
materials and you can see uh controls

1895
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:30,659
number 10 so over here way on the right

1896
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:32,579
that's something that is not acceptable

1897
01:13:30,658 --> 01:13:34,500
and we have three treatments that are

1898
01:13:32,579 --> 01:13:37,559
about the same as a control so our

1899
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:39,238
situation in California we say none of

1900
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:41,219
the New Alternatives some of which can

1901
01:13:39,238 --> 01:13:43,198
already be used will give you the same

1902
01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:44,760
level of control and we are seeing

1903
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:46,619
breakthrough in some disease occurring

1904
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:48,420
despite the use of those new alternative

1905
01:13:46,619 --> 01:13:50,519
materials

1906
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:53,100
so I think I'm about done here in

1907
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:55,560
summary uh I've walked you through two

1908
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:57,480
new soil borne issues in California for

1909
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:59,580
our strawberry producers these are

1910
01:13:57,479 --> 01:14:01,439
fairly recent developments uh we're not

1911
01:13:59,579 --> 01:14:02,760
unique we in California share these

1912
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:05,639
problems with other places in the world

1913
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:07,320
and the country but being the country's

1914
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:09,239
number one strawberry producing state

1915
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:11,819
we're quite concerned about these new

1916
01:14:09,238 --> 01:14:13,139
problems caused by macro famina and

1917
01:14:11,819 --> 01:14:16,679
fusarium

1918
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:19,560
uh hope I made my case to you a precise

1919
01:14:16,679 --> 01:14:21,539
field diagnosis is not possible so if

1920
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:24,360
you're in a different state and you

1921
01:14:21,539 --> 01:14:26,819
begin to see begin to see diabetic

1922
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:29,219
issues in your strawberries I encourage

1923
01:14:26,819 --> 01:14:30,899
you to again locate your friendly

1924
01:14:29,219 --> 01:14:33,060
neighborhood plant Pathologists or

1925
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:34,439
someone qualified to help you with

1926
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:36,719
diagnosis because it will take

1927
01:14:34,439 --> 01:14:38,158
Laboratory Testing to confirm what

1928
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:40,439
you've got there

1929
01:14:38,158 --> 01:14:42,719
and again the way things happen in our

1930
01:14:40,439 --> 01:14:44,698
country in our world with movement of

1931
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:46,560
materials and such you likely will see

1932
01:14:44,698 --> 01:14:48,658
some new disease at some point maybe not

1933
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:50,760
these two but something in the future

1934
01:14:48,658 --> 01:14:53,099
if they are something you'll see you'll

1935
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:54,840
be likely to be concerned like we are

1936
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:56,460
that these are going to be persistent

1937
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:58,980
problems that would need to be dealed

1938
01:14:56,460 --> 01:15:01,439
with in a long-term strategy

1939
01:14:58,979 --> 01:15:02,639
and again really excuse me there's

1940
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:04,139
really nothing new in terms of the

1941
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,820
strategies

1942
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:07,679
you'll be similar to what we do for

1943
01:15:05,819 --> 01:15:08,819
other soleborne problems and I went

1944
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:11,158
through that with you that's basically

1945
01:15:08,819 --> 01:15:13,259
nothing new there but uh something that

1946
01:15:11,158 --> 01:15:16,738
will have to be applied now to new

1947
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:17,579
issues at least for strawberry

1948
01:15:16,738 --> 01:15:19,559
okay

1949
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:21,119
um like Tracy before me I also want to

1950
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:23,280
acknowledge and thank a lot of people

1951
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:25,439
especially the strawberry growers in my

1952
01:15:23,279 --> 01:15:27,119
state of California and we have a very

1953
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:28,738
nice Industry Group the California

1954
01:15:27,119 --> 01:15:30,840
strawberry commission that's funded our

1955
01:15:28,738 --> 01:15:32,879
research and then there's lots of people

1956
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:34,800
who have helped us with the project as

1957
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:37,260
well as our research team really want to

1958
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:38,760
acknowledge all those people and again I

1959
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:40,560
really want to thank Kathy and the

1960
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:42,719
organizers for allowing me to share this

1961
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:45,739
with you today and with that I will pass

1962
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,739
this back to Kathy

1963
01:15:46,198 --> 01:15:49,559
thank you very much Stephen

1964
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:51,739
are there questions for either of our

1965
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,739
speakers

1966
01:15:53,158 --> 01:15:58,079
while you're thinking about that

1967
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,640
thank you for participating today I want

1968
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:01,738
