1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,240
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,359
University so today my topic is called

3
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:12,638
everything's coming up D is talking

4
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:14,919
about how not just I but a bunch of

5
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,759
other people in extension are starting

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:19,439
to create a system to support the Cut

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,480
Flower industry in New York city so how

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,518
many do you have any grower Cut Flower

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:28,118
Growers I can't okay so how many people

10
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:31,518
have flot flowers at a farmers

11
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:33,759
market that's a good start how many how

12
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:36,479
a flower

13
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:39,878
CSA well there's at least three that I

14
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,759
know of which one are you in sorry I

15
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:44,718
which one are you and they have posies

16
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,439
okay well I used to in Seattle okay and

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,280
so they have them there as well yeah so

18
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:53,519
I'm also playing how about roadside

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,399
stands and how about

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,079
dck okay and how about the vents so this

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,759
picture is to show that flowers either

22
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:02,359
even just growing fields of sunflowers

23
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:03,839
is a big deal for weddings now and

24
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,000
flowers getting your flowers look

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,240
flowers for weddings is a big deal too

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,519
so we're starting to see if you've done

27
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,519
any of those things you've seen that

28
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,118
there's a lot of cut flowers available

29
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,438
that didn't used to be there used used

30
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:17,118
to be Flor and maybe grocery stores but

31
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:20,798
we're making progress and where they're

32
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:24,040
getting sold so all right now let's

33
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,799
see so in New York state the wholesale

34
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,960
value of cupf flower sales increased one

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,680
and a half times between 2020 to 2021

36
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:33,839
that's pretty dramatic and now that's

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,040
only looking at operations of 100,000 or

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,240
more and I will guarantee you that we

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,000
have a lot of small cutf Flower Farms

40
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:43,839
that are not up at 100,000 in terms of

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,319
what they're bringing in a year so all

42
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,840
the numbers that I can find are

43
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:49,519
definitely going to be

44
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,280
underestimates if you look at the 2019

45
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:55,560
censes it said there are 122 operations

46
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,399
with it with two 2.7 million in sales if

47
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,280
you look at the association of specially

48
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:01,840
Cut Flower Growers that a lot of Growers

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,399
are members but not all you can find

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,520
about 130 in New York um so there's at

51
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,038
least that many let's say one of the

52
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,318
questions if you want to work with them

53
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,958
is how do you find them and what do they

54
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:15,518
need so just looking at what's been done

55
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:17,800
so far oh soor this is from one of the

56
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,879
cup flow Growers um actually had on

57
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,480
their website New York Flower Farms it's

58
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:24,878
called um so this is looking at the

59
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:27,318
major distribution methods for the ones

60
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,759
that we're looking at we have a lot that

61
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:31,119
are do selling to the individual

62
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:33,399
consumer so so that could be a CSA or

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,000
farmers market or roadside stand there

64
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,319
are some that are selling direct to

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,639
florists so you can sometimes get local

66
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:41,759
flowers at your florist and there are

67
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:44,878
some that are wholesaling and maybe

68
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:47,280
often in combination with selling direct

69
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,518
and possibly with selling to to Flores

70
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,800
one of the things that's amazing when

71
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,400
you talk to cut flower Growers is how

72
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,920
many different things they're doing to

73
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,400
sell their flowers and often they cycle

74
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:59,158
through a

75
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,599
variety of different sorry something

76
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:02,959
just happened over there they cycle

77
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:05,280
through a variety of of different uh

78
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,799
Marketing Systems to find out the one

79
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,878
that works best for them with their

80
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:11,319
production how big they want to be and

81
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,399
so forth uh one of the things that I

82
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:15,598
will say about cupflower Growers is they

83
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,439
tend to be pretty entrepreneurial and

84
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,199
I'm not sure whether that's by necessity

85
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,759
or just that's the people that that

86
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,280
start out trying to do cut flowers uh so

87
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,000
the floriculture industry is definitely

88
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,878
paying attention you can find lots of

89
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,360
articles about growing cut flowers in

90
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:32,039
the trade journals um Growers aren't

91
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,319
waiting for us to to get information to

92
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:36,120
them um so they're starting this is a

93
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:37,759
Facebook page for Central New York

94
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,319
flower Growers or Upstate New York

95
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,959
flower Growers where there's a lot of

96
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:44,238
conversation back and forth about not

97
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,000
just what's for sale or price is or how

98
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,920
to sale or does somebody have something

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,878
but P management information and some

100
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,518
other production information as

101
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:54,239
well and now you can become grown in New

102
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,519
York state grown and certified for cut

103
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,200
flowers and not all of those crops came

104
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,799
in at the same time so this is a more

105
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:01,560
recent one I haven't I would like to to

106
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,840
find out how many are on this list but I

107
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,280
haven't figured out how to do that

108
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,079
yet so working with cutf flower growers

109
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,438
in New York state is not completely new

110
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,159
um anyone who's been in this department

111
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:13,000
for a while knows that but if you look

112
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:18,238
at Cooperative Extension they've been

113
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,680
doing some um programming mostly uh on a

114
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,839
usually on a one-off basis often very

115
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,120
Regional and it may depend on if they

116
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:27,399
have Growers asking them questions or if

117
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,199
they have some background information so

118
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:31,799
Russ welser for example in Ontario

119
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,478
County grew pies so he had background

120
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,319
information so he knew the Cut Flower

121
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:38,680
Growers and he did some programming for

122
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:41,360
them we only have about five counties in

123
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,759
the state that actually have Educators

124
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,400
who have H commercial horiculture as

125
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,439
their specific stated responsibility but

126
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:50,120
that doesn't mean those are the only

127
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:52,399
extension Educators who are doing things

128
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,879
like this they all do things sort of its

129
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,839
duties as assigned or as you get

130
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:01,038
questions does does commercial

131
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:04,758
horiculture be horiculture or does it

132
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:06,719
mean it means not FL related no it means

133
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,479
cut flour could be uh could be

134
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,440
floriculture Greenhouse Flor culture

135
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:13,038
Christmas trees any of those things but

136
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:15,600
it's not um consumer Horticulture which

137
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,599
is Master Gardeners and those not apples

138
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,840
and vegetables tends not to be fruit or

139
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,039
vegetables okay so it's kind of depends

140
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:26,359
though floral culture more so kind of

141
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:28,318
yeah I mean if you can consider a

142
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,639
Christmas tree a floriculture crop and

143
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,919
nursery and other things so so yes thank

144
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,319
you that's a great question uh and so

145
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:36,399
then there has been some occasional

146
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,360
Statewide programming at the Empire

147
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,719
State producers Expo it's been done a

148
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,639
couple of times but nothing too

149
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,319
consistent now Dr wean who was here and

150
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:46,879
did a picked up also picked up cut

151
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:48,759
flowers I don't think anyone told him to

152
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,918
I think he just picked it up as a a

153
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,720
potential um population to work with and

154
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:56,000
did great research on cultiv our

155
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,240
evaluation cultural practices High

156
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,079
tunnel production and you can still find

157
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,478
his research which is all archive down

158
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:05,399
the high tunnels bum page um the one

159
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:07,560
thing about doing um cultivar evaluation

160
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:09,318
is of course cultivars keep changing so

161
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,560
while that information is great it may

162
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:13,000
not have the newest cultivars but other

163
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,959
things the prep the production

164
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,319
information is all Val valuable

165
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,120
still and then we have related research

166
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,639
so both Bill and Neil have done things

167
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,160
that relate to cut flowers um Bill we're

168
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,120
getting to got another I'm trying to

169
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,800
sign up another place for to you you to

170
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,918
use your bulb machine um and so it it is

171
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,199
and bulbs are becoming one of the major

172
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,038
cut flowers that we're seeing um also

173
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,960
with some winter

174
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:39,199
production and then there's people that

175
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:41,680
are doing Pest Management and

176
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,560
ornamentals so Dan gilrain Marjorie

177
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,120
dodre both on Long Island John Sanderson

178
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,720
here on campus and Andy senac down on

179
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,959
Long Island both Andy and John have sort

180
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,039
of retired but luckily they'll still

181
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,478
answer when we ask them questions and

182
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,680
appear for things so um that's a good

183
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:01,800
thing because we're starting to run out

184
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:05,360
of people to ask questions

185
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,918
unfortunately and then back in 2017 Lily

186
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,520
Calderwood was the extension educator

187
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:12,159
for the Capital Area extension team and

188
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,478
she had so many calls on cut flowers

189
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,319
that she decided to put together an

190
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:19,399
annual cutf flower conference so that

191
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,120
conference has been running since 2017

192
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:23,038
it's the longest running cutf flower

193
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,519
conference that we have in the state and

194
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,878
it's actually managed to go through

195
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:28,478
three Educators so Lily started it then

196
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,720
Lindsey Christensen carried it on and

197
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,959
Jing Jing in is doing it and that's a

198
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,000
regional program of five counties but

199
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,638
they'll but it but the the conference is

200
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,720
open to anyone it's it's gone online in

201
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,319
the last few years um which means it can

202
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,039
reach some additional people than it did

203
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,039
before and then small farms has an

204
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:49,639
online Cut Flower production class that

205
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:53,000
they started in 2021 I co-teach it with

206
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:56,639
Hannah uh Hannah vpy who runs foxy Flora

207
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,240
around um Trumansburg and so s in three

208
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,879
years we're in the middle of I'm

209
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,439
teaching the fourth one tonight um we've

210
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,560
had 235 students and that's not just New

211
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,560
York state that's International but

212
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,199
that's a good goodly number coming in

213
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,839
through just that one point just through

214
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,759
the small farms so they have good

215
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:16,119
advertising um but still it's a good

216
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,319
number coming in and we have people that

217
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,800
wish we would make an advanced level of

218
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,000
it also haven't done that yet um so we

219
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,520
do get it's advertised to be sort of

220
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,598
zero to three years in cut flowers um we

221
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,279
get some people who've had more um and

222
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,360
it's but because they're all a different

223
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,000
lels it's an interesting method of

224
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,680
teaching where you're trying to not bore

225
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,799
the ones who know stuff and keep the

226
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:39,359
ones who are just getting started from

227
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,038
having their heads blow up um so it is

228
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,519
really information overload because

229
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,278
we're only doing it in six one and a

230
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:46,440
half hour sessions and trying to cover

231
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:48,439
all of of pest of not just Pest

232
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,200
Management but all of Cut Flower

233
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,720
production so um for my observation of

234
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,440
the people that are coming to that class

235
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,000
and also going to other events um they

236
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,680
get into the business Cut Flower Growers

237
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,559
get into the business from the widest

238
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:02,599
variety of backgrounds you can imagine

239
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,879
we've got Bankers we've got tech tech

240
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,600
people we've got people who are growing

241
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,600
some other kind of crop maybe vegetables

242
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,480
or dairy farms where they're adding cut

243
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,519
flowers to their production people who

244
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,680
have no concept of how to grow anything

245
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,200
because they've not really done it

246
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,000
before and people who have lots of

247
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,600
experience and it doesn't mean that any

248
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,720
of those people can't be successful

249
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,079
because we find people from all of those

250
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,000
starting points who arecurrently

251
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:27,639
succcessful in the state um and so

252
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,919
that's kind of a fun group to work with

253
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:31,919
because they bring different things to

254
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:33,240
the to the mix and one of the things

255
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,240
we're always trying to do in something

256
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,560
like this class is they have them talk

257
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,320
to each other so that if you got

258
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,319
information and you may well have more

259
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,959
information than I have then let's you

260
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,800
know let's share it let's make sure that

261
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,759
everybody gets it and has a chance to to

262
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:50,039
share

263
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:52,039
that so this is actually a meme that um

264
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:53,838
Amara Dunn made up for us when we were

265
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:55,799
establishing the habitat for beneficial

266
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,040
insects but I have a feeling it's also

267
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:59,599
true for Cut Flower Growers it looks

268
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:00,879
like they're beautiful flow flowers all

269
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,159
you have to do is put seeds in the

270
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,600
ground and you have beautiful flowers

271
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:07,078
but you always forget that there's

272
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,639
weeding and there's whether your soils

273
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:11,359
doing what it's supposed to do and what

274
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,919
insects come in so that's often true

275
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,480
that they start out thinking okay this

276
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:17,199
is going to be easy I saw cut flowers at

277
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,399
the farmers market and I've grown a few

278
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,120
cut flowers in my yard and so production

279
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:22,519
is going to be just like that it's not

280
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,399
always but

281
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:27,759
sometimes so just based on that that's

282
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:29,839
sort of the the past history of what's

283
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,958
been going on uh in New York state with

284
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,920
produ with information for Cut Flower BS

285
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:39,078
but then starting in 2021 I got a call

286
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:42,120
from Dana Havis who was in courland CCE

287
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:46,039
courland Cornell community community

288
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:49,078
extension sorry CCE is I can't put

289
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:51,719
Courtland and community in there is the

290
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:53,278
Cornell um Cooperative Extension CCE

291
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,959
well I'll probably say CCE a bunch of

292
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,439
times but anyway so um out of courland

293
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:59,359
and she was getting so many questions

294
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,600
she was actually a fiber person that's

295
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,919
her background was in fiber um but she

296
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,959
Saidi getting so many questions and

297
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,439
before Lindsay Christensen left the

298
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,278
Capital District she told everybody

299
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,360
apparently if you have any questions on

300
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:12,559
cut flowers call Betsy even though Betsy

301
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,000
didn't know anything about cut flowers

302
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:18,638
but was interested um so we came up with

303
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,720
sort of a mission of what we'd like to

304
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:23,639
do what what the issue is the fact that

305
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,399
there's not much background for Cut

306
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:27,480
Flower growers in the state and could we

307
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:31,399
put something together that would help

308
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:34,159
them so we actually did we based on a

309
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,919
list serve that we have um we'll pop up

310
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,838
later we actually did some some

311
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,039
questions on grower needs and educator

312
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,880
needs and the educator needs kind of

313
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:45,559
look like we need everything we don't

314
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:48,320
have enough to do for anything we need

315
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:50,559
the industry we need speakers we need

316
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,079
programming we need all of it and The

317
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,439
Growers come across I need almost all of

318
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:57,638
it as well weed weed management how to

319
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,839
plant schedules how to price things is a

320
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:03,360
huge uh aspect how to use high tunnels

321
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,560
um what and then soil fertility so

322
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,720
there's a lot of places that information

323
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,439
could go in and also a lot of people who

324
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,360
are looking for information to help fill

325
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,800
those

326
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:16,680
gaps so this is sort of the initial

327
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:19,319
group uh that started talking so Sharon

328
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:21,679
Bachman is in Erie County uh Caroline is

329
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,639
in Yates county I believe Russ weler is

330
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,559
in Ontario County jingjing is for the

331
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:30,879
Capital District Carla crims in Delaware

332
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,879
and Lindsay Paso is in um

333
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:35,479
don't remember one of the northeastern

334
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,198
counties and so actually L both Lindsay

335
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,920
and Russ have grown cut flowers so they

336
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:40,838
come in with some background information

337
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:43,360
which is helpful but most of the other

338
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:45,360
people are just getting questions and so

339
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,278
are interested and trying to put

340
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,600
something together that works to help

341
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,559
support them uh in in the questions

342
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,800
they're getting and actually this group

343
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:56,399
has now created a cutf flower program

344
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:57,838
work team which makes sense if you're a

345
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,360
faculty member maybe and probably

346
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,880
doesn't make sense at all if if you're

347
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,959
if you're a student program work teams

348
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:07,039
are groupings of faculty and extension

349
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:09,039
faculty um who are interested in a

350
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:10,159
particular topic so this is now sort of

351
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,399
just gives it a certain amount of

352
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,399
formality for the

353
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,440
University so the first thing that that

354
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,959
we did Dana and I was put together this

355
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,440
list serve and just sort of send out

356
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,479
information who's interested I could do

357
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,079
it through the class a little bit um

358
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,480
this is an old picture but it does show

359
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:31,479
you at least that we have have people on

360
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,399
the list serve from all around the state

361
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,879
as well as outside of the state and the

362
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,958
biggest point for having a list serve is

363
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,919
how do we find and connect Growers and

364
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,198
Educators that's what we're looking for

365
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:44,719
and it is an

366
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:47,078
interesting system in that it is

367
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,879
definitely not hi we know what's going

368
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:51,879
on and we're here to tell you what how

369
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:54,078
to do things it is much more a we're

370
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:56,159
looking for help can you help us do what

371
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:57,919
needs to be done so that we can get this

372
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,759
information out to a broader range of

373
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:04,519
Growers so anyone can post on it um it's

374
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,240
not it's not wildly used at the moment

375
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:08,480
but it does get used somewhat probably

376
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,039
needs some organization um and every

377
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,278
once in a while if I'm working if I'm

378
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:12,679
doing what I should be I'll post a

379
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,078
question but I usually can get some

380
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:16,799
responses back um which is nice to know

381
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:19,239
that people are actually

382
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,278
reading and then we also created a web

383
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,440
page which is at blogs. cornell.edu

384
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:26,439
cutflowers and so uh that's another

385
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,160
place of gathering information and

386
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,360
posting it in one place so people can

387
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,120
find things

388
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,199
and then again we this should be

389
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,519
something where we're getting more

390
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:36,559
two-way information but it it's it's

391
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:39,240
getting but it's not there

392
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,958
yet um but then looking at the just the

393
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,519
programming that's going on based on the

394
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:46,399
fact that there are people that were

395
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,560
interested um it's definitely expanding

396
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,600
so this is a a riskmanagement for cutf

397
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:55,078
flower Growers grant that Carla Crim got

398
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,320
and she put on um a free series of

399
00:14:55,078 --> 00:15:00,919
webinars in 2022 and 2023 looking at

400
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,480
risk but risk in a broad sense so you

401
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:05,399
can see there's IPM there's crop

402
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,000
planting there's climate smart F farming

403
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,958
there's uh season extension all sorts of

404
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,240
topics that were in her series and well

405
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,879
this is just an example of she also had

406
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,399
not just Specialists talking about

407
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,799
things but Growers so this is Fran

408
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,919
Parish who her her operation is over in

409
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:23,679
Western New York and she does an

410
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,078
excellent job at putting on

411
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,719
presentations and Gathering informations

412
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:29,359
from the point of view of a grower which

413
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,680
is always nice to have it's one thing

414
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,879
for me to talk about IPM but I'm not

415
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:37,599
trying to make money doing it so having

416
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:40,360
a Grower's persective on it is also

417
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,800
nice and then that's difficult to read

418
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,440
in the back I'm sure but it's just a

419
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:45,078
list of the different speakers that they

420
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,519
had in the Capital District cupflower

421
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:49,479
conference for 2023 it was online then

422
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,759
it's also going to be online in 2024 I

423
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,920
think it's probably going to stay online

424
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:55,680
forever but again quite a range of

425
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:59,039
topics and bringing in both Growers and

426
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:00,198
uh faculty from uh Cornell and other

427
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,360
places as well there's somebody from the

428
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:05,559
University of

429
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,919
Utah they did uh they did the first uh

430
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:09,318
Cut Flower session at the Catskill Regal

431
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:13,120
Regional a conference and they're going

432
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:15,599
to do that again in 2024 again mixing uh

433
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,360
speakers from a a variety of different

434
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,879
places and then Long Island also added a

435
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,079
cut flower session to their egg Forum so

436
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:25,519
it's definitely popping up in a lot more

437
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:27,239
places we're seeing a lot more

438
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,240
programming it may or may not be very

439
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,198
organized compared from one to the next

440
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,759
but at least it's showing up so that the

441
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,879
Cut Flower Growers have something to go

442
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,240
and listen

443
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:38,720
to um this was a called A Cut Flower

444
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,399
intensive at bird song Farm CCE Delaware

445
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,120
has a um an association with this farm

446
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:46,720
and they actually put in cutf flower

447
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,879
beds to use for demonstrations and kind

448
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,759
of as U Community Gardens and so they

449
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:54,240
had speakers and then had people they

450
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:58,039
picked flowers for people and they had

451
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,799
them do sort of an Iron Chef U um

452
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:02,958
arrange ment competition they were make

453
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,519
this one was on the summer barbecue so

454
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,639
they it was amazing to see what people

455
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:08,359
did There's peppers in there there's

456
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,520
what they did in terms of creating

457
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:13,159
Arrangements on that

458
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:15,519
topic and I think they enjoyed doing

459
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,120
that I didn't I didn't get my fingers in

460
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:20,240
that one we're also looking at getting

461
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,078
some more on Farm programming of growers

462
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,880
in my estimation love hearing other

463
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,038
Growers talk about what they're doing

464
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,160
and it's a good way to get connections

465
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:31,240
and again um this was some soil Health

466
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,360
programming that Jing Jing Yin put on

467
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,000
she's on the far right and it's another

468
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:37,719
place you can see and it's hard maybe

469
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,119
tell something the picture but the

470
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,319
audience in cutf flower Growers tends to

471
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:44,918
be younger than the other audiences that

472
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:47,558
I serve in terms of ornamental

473
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:50,440
production um they tend to be more

474
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:52,720
female and they have they come in ready

475
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,200
to roll and with lots of great ideas and

476
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,839
that's kind of fun to go and talk to

477
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,400
them because and they'll correct you if

478
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,119
they think you're wrong which is also

479
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,600
good

480
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,439
so we're looking at doing some

481
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:04,918
additional getting some funding to help

482
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,480
support some of this so uh in the

483
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,600
Capital District they wrote the

484
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,000
Northeast Extension risk management

485
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:13,359
education fund Grant on cutf flower

486
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,440
pricing because pricing is a huge huge

487
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:19,519
issue um Jing Jing wrote one for FL Farm

488
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,600
viability on cover crops and field and

489
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,319
high tunnel for Cut Flower production

490
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,199
and we've put in an application for a

491
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:30,319
CCE intern this more this for this

492
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,319
summer um working in cut flowers in CCE

493
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,839
so I'm talking really fast and we'll see

494
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,000
where we go here so one of the questions

495
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:40,839
that I have for you is like why should

496
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,839
you care so I can see opportunities for

497
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:44,798
on Farm research because these Growers

498
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:47,678
are looking for information and help and

499
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:50,000
they're pretty willing to to let faculty

500
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,120
come on their farms and and work on them

501
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I see opposition I see potential for

502
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:57,079
positions for students either as Growers

503
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
or in extension and knowing more about

504
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:00,158
cut flowers but but I want to know what

505
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,400
potential you

506
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:05,640
see for in the horiculture section for

507
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,640
cut

508
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:10,240
flows where I get to stare at all of you

509
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,440
instead of you staring at me does

510
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,480
anybody have any ideas does anybody

511
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,440
online have any

512
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:21,480
ideas they're shy shy is everyone using

513
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,200
landscape fabric Betsy I'm curious so

514
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,599
it's interesting so because Brian's a

515
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,000
weed scientist he would ask a weed

516
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:29,119
science word a question so some people

517
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
do use landscape fabric and plant in

518
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,399
hole through holes in the landscape

519
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,759
fabric and for some of the things I've

520
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,960
seen dalas on it for sure I've seen pies

521
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:40,480
on it PES tend to stay there longer and

522
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,880
some people don't like it because you

523
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,679
get dirt on top of it and then you get

524
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,480
weeds on top of it and so they're using

525
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:48,880
all sorts of different things for weed

526
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,000
management I have not yet heard of too

527
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,039
many people complaining about um

528
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,359
herbicide resistant weeds in their

529
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,079
operations but it may just be that they

530
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:00,199
haven't figured out that that's really

531
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:02,599
happening yet um so there's been there

532
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,519
was a big debate in on one of the one of

533
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:07,480
the discussions we had was on do you use

534
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,319
I also say just to throw in to kind of

535
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,079
go with this conversation that a lot of

536
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:15,319
The Growers that I talk to either want

537
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:16,960
to be organic or are organic sometimes

538
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:18,119
wanting to be organic may or may not

539
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,798
mean that they actually know what it

540
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:21,719
means to be certified organic but they

541
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:23,240
would like to not use pesticides

542
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,319
including herbicides and they would like

543
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,440
to use something else so when you start

544
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:29,839
talking about just putting down uh

545
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,798
plastic mulch the question comes up

546
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:34,199
should you use biodegradable or

547
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:35,839
degradable plastic mulch and most of the

548
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,400
Growers who tried it said no because

549
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,959
what you end up with is a lot of pieces

550
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,000
of plastic you can actually remove the

551
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,038
non-biodegradable stuff much more easily

552
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,519
than the biodegradable stuff but that's

553
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:47,158
one of the things that seems to have

554
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:48,000
popped up multiple times in terms of

555
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:51,360
weed

556
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,720
management so I know why I'm interested

557
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,798
so I'll tell you why I'm interested and

558
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,558
why I think there's potential for this

559
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:59,000
so I just in terms of the IPM

560
00:20:57,558 --> 00:21:01,000
programming I read this is my fifth

561
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
presentation this year on cut flowers so

562
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,159
there's obviously interest and that's

563
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,279
not counting the class and there's

564
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:09,919
obviously people that are trying to get

565
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:12,240
that programming going it also looks to

566
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:16,080
me like um as I said the interest is in

567
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,079
organic or no or low pesticide inputs um

568
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:20,720
the understanding of Pest Management

569
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:22,599
varies dramatically and I don't see

570
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,558
through the association and other things

571
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:27,759
I don't see very much Pest management

572
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:29,519
information out there so it seems like

573
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:32,240
to me it's a perfect place for me to be

574
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,839
that that there's a need there's uh I

575
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,558
that's where my seep learning herf comes

576
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,599
in because I don't necessarily know the

577
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:39,038
answers but that there's that there's

578
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,839
someone who looking for the information

579
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:44,079
and are and they're willing to work in

580
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:45,639
two ways with me which I enjoy um so

581
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,158
what's different about Pest Management

582
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,480
for cut flowers the crop diversity is

583
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,960
immense between species and cultivars um

584
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,519
It's a combination of field and high

585
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,558
tunnel often they have sequential

586
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:58,918
planning and long Harvest periods which

587
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:00,798
I don't see and things like bedding

588
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:03,480
plants in the greenhouse production for

589
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:05,200
example um the aesthetic level means

590
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,480
because you're selling both the flowers

591
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,558
and the leaves often that the threshold

592
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:13,558
pest thresholds are really low so they

593
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:16,558
need good Pest Management um and can't

594
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:18,599
tolerate very much uh damage so how many

595
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,839
crops other crops do you know where they

596
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:23,519
would actually go B out and bag every

597
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:25,519
flower Bud that they're going to sell

598
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:28,599
which they do with dalas for a tarnish

599
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:29,960
plant bun damage so and interestingly

600
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:32,240
when the grower said oh yeah it's not

601
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,200
that not that big a problem I don't know

602
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,159
it just seems like it would take an

603
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,000
inordinate amount of time and it's also

604
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,200
a very high value crop so all those

605
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
things work together to mean that Pest

606
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,798
management information is really

607
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,640
essential in my mind um and sort of fun

608
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:49,759
to to learn about how to

609
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,840
do uh so just in looking at the kinds of

610
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:53,679
projects that I'm looking at um there's

611
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:56,639
Pest Management is strategic plan

612
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,600
funding from the Northeast IPM Center um

613
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,320
looking at identifying the major insect

614
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:02,278
and disease pests and what the

615
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:04,519
management methods current are currently

616
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:06,319
are so that you can use that information

617
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:09,400
to determine what to do next what

618
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:12,278
research could be done next and then um

619
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,519
some work looking at both augmentative

620
00:23:12,278 --> 00:23:16,880
and conservation biocontrol and and cut

621
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:18,240
flower beds conservation biocontrol

622
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,240
means using what's already there and

623
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,720
encouraging it augmentative really means

624
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,359
going out and adding it so you're buying

625
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,519
commercial sources um we don't that's

626
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:28,519
very there's very little information on

627
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:30,278
that the conservation one there's more

628
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:32,319
information on but it's very difficult

629
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:34,440
to me to measure and so figuring out how

630
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,439
to measure it is another

631
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,240
piece all right I think that's the end

632
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:42,240
of M and I maybe even came in sort of on

633
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:45,120
time or maybe too short but whatever

634
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,120
it's it's

635
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:53,720
lovely yes you have a question lots of

636
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:55,038
lots of questions I'm sure um how do so

637
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,919
so most of the cup flowers that

638
00:23:55,038 --> 00:24:00,679
Americans consume come from Colombian

639
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,360
Ecuador and places that have a favorable

640
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:05,360
climate year round and probably cheaper

641
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:08,479
labor and then airplane transportation

642
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:11,639
to get you money to me um so how do New

643
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,720
York Cut Flower Growers differentiate

644
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,919
themselves from those types of products

645
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,440
sometimes it's the crops they're growing

646
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,559
so ronculus is a big thing for spring

647
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,840
and it's interesting I was talking to a

648
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:27,000
grower that's in uh Clifton Springs

649
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:28,879
Phelps area and she said well she's not

650
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,519
emphasizing this summer flowers anymore

651
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,520
she's really pushing ranunculus and

652
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:34,918
she's got high tunnels um because at at

653
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:37,960
a farmers's market which is where she

654
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:40,360
sells and also through a CSA she said

655
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,000
people are dying for color in the spring

656
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:44,678
so you can sell a lot of verulus which

657
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,278
are

658
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:49,720
expensive and and so there's that piece

659
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:53,159
of differentiating by by crop by some

660
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,120
things that just don't ship well um

661
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:57,278
there's you know there's enough of a

662
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:59,678
local interest in local food and local

663
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,960
flowers and local everything that that

664
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,519
helps so they can promote themselves as

665
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,278
local um it is you know it's it's an

666
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:08,839
expensive product and it's one that's

667
00:25:06,278 --> 00:25:10,599
considered maybe a luxury by some people

668
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:13,319
and so that does perhaps limit the

669
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:17,398
potential sales through just looking at

670
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:20,158
the the whole population but um and so

671
00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:22,038
sometimes it's also the variety of

672
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,559
things that you can get but I do think

673
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:25,278
there's a certain amount of it it's like

674
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:27,038
it's nice to go to a farmers's market

675
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:29,119
and walk out with a bunch of Flowers in

676
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:30,599
Your Hands and so I think there's some

677
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,558
of that I think is just people's

678
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:35,839
interest in that whole um local

679
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:39,038
purchasing and and going and just doing

680
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:41,439
the whole sort of almost Agri tourism of

681
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:43,079
of a local of local

682
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,480
production

683
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:48,798
yepop these resources are there many

684
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,919
things you can pull from like

685
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:55,200
established resources in neighboring

686
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:59,159
states or are there not robust markets

687
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,600
in neor States so much more so than

688
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:02,360
that's a great question and one of the

689
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:03,879
things that the original this original

690
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:05,278
talk went to be giving it in

691
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,399
Pennsylvania because they're trying to

692
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,240
do the same thing so it's not that there

693
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:11,879
are none and there are some states that

694
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,798
have a lot California has quite a lot um

695
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,880
and and some states have more than most

696
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:18,440
states have more than we do but um

697
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,760
between actually talking to not falling

698
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,640
over the table and not standing with a

699
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:25,158
light in my but so we can find some but

700
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,960
there's doesn't seem to be like here's a

701
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:29,720
one here's one good place to go find

702
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,600
this and then some things are regionally

703
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,440
different so if you're talking about

704
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:35,558
producing ronculus in in New York it's

705
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,600
different than if you're talking about

706
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:39,440
producing ronculus in California and so

707
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:43,158
we need some of that as well updating

708
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:46,919
things to make them um relate

709
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:49,960
here y got a question might jve with one

710
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:52,640
that's showing up in the chat as well um

711
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:56,679
any research on the possibility of using

712
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:59,480
Cut Flower crops searching as potential

713
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:01,519
beneficial inet habitat that you could

714
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,960
crop along with other crops and Farms

715
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:06,720
maybe would want to give up space to

716
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,600
beneficial habitat labor but if you

717
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,440
break even make little money

718
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:13,199
on the two go together so I've actually

719
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,519
been working on installing beneficial

720
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,120
habitat that's not cut flowers

721
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:19,759
necessarily in and we've got a plot in

722
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:21,319
Christmas trees at the moment to see if

723
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:23,599
you can get the benefits of that

724
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:25,558
beneficial habitat on the insect pests

725
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:27,319
in the Christmas trees and you're right

726
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:29,000
that takes up land and so it's a little

727
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:32,158
bit hard to do that and I agree that if

728
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,240
you could do it and cut it and sell it

729
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,840
um then then you've got a then you've

730
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,359
got an advantage where it's not just

731
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:40,439
wasted land it's also additional labor

732
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:43,000
and some of these crops are pretty high

733
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,919
labor some things that people do are

734
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,798
like start with sunflowers because you

735
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:50,000
can seed in a row of sunflowers they're

736
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:52,158
pretty low maintenance in terms of of

737
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,278
getting them where you want them they're

738
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,840
not the highest value but people like

739
00:27:54,278 --> 00:27:58,640
them uh and and they'll still give you

740
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:02,278
some of those those environmental

741
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,880
benefits of bringing in beneficials um

742
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:07,278
and so potentially then also seeing but

743
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,760
then the question is can you measure the

744
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:13,278
effect of those beneficials on your

745
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:15,398
other crop is a hard piece but um you

746
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:16,798
know it yes it definitely can be done

747
00:28:15,398 --> 00:28:18,759
and the thing is always going to be

748
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:20,639
balancing you know if you're taking time

749
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:23,278
away from your main crop you need

750
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:26,480
something that's relatively low labor

751
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:29,440
and relatively high value per unit area

752
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,440
just to to break

753
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:35,000
did I cover the one that they

754
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,679
asked yeah so that kind of covers that

755
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,798
concept of co-cropping and there are

756
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:39,120
people that are starting who have been

757
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:41,038
growing vegetables are starting to put

758
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,119
cut flowers in especially if they mark

759
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:45,440
it in the same ways it's it's a fairly

760
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:48,639
obvious connection I think sorry Bill so

761
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,840
a perfect example not of that but of

762
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,840
co-cropping I guess this the ball

763
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:55,839
planter and planting you pick sorts of

764
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:59,278
things like

765
00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:02,319
daffodils in turf grass there's no

766
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:04,159
weeding there there's no problem and and

767
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:06,278
I I think it's finally starting to catch

768
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,360
on because there there's a importer here

769
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:12,519
in New York who brought in six machines

770
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:16,079
this fall wow and I know I I know they

771
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:17,720
sold three of them so far so and it's an

772
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,599
interesting thing because finally

773
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,079
starting to to come along upic is like

774
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:23,439
one of the things where you'd have to be

775
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:25,119
careful that people don't go in and

776
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,038
trash your plants when they're doing

777
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:30,158
upic but with tulips you actually want

778
00:29:28,038 --> 00:29:31,720
them to pull the bulbs out they can pull

779
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,519
the whole bulb out so if they take the

780
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,000
plant and and they don't actually cut it

781
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:36,640
they pull the whole bulb out that's

782
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,679
actually a good thing because tulips are

783
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,919
grown as an annual for cut flowers

784
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:44,240
definitely maybe even daffodils less so

785
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,360
but well yeah they would they optimally

786
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,960
they would be perennials but but they

787
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:50,199
tend not to give you as big flowers the

788
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:53,120
second generation the second year round

789
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,679
and so forth sometimes anyway but the

790
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:58,479
way that people feel about bulbs they

791
00:29:54,679 --> 00:30:01,320
often plant them as annuals yep

792
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,558
yep was interesting to hear about how um

793
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:03,798
the industry is growing over New York

794
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:05,960
State and how people are coming in from

795
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:08,558
a variety of different backgrounds um I

796
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,000
was wondering did you get a feel for uh

797
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:12,558
like why industry has been growing so

798
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,440
much and with people coming in from so

799
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:14,798
different backgrounds are they all

800
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,840
coming in for the same reasons when you

801
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:17,679
talk to these people well what do you

802
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:19,000
find about why they're so interested in

803
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,278
flowers one of the things is they're

804
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,278
like oh I'm so sick of a desk job I've

805
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:25,640
heard that many many times and um so

806
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:27,398
again it kind of goes to Neil's question

807
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,679
of like so you can buy flowers the

808
00:30:27,398 --> 00:30:30,278
grocery store you can buy flowers at a

809
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,440
florist why should you start growing

810
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:34,480
your own because of this interest in

811
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,440
local and because I think people go to

812
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,480
farmers markets and see Road SCI stands

813
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:41,720
and hear about you and csas and upix

814
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,880
they're like well I could do that and so

815
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,640
it's it is but it is interesting I don't

816
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,720
know another industry where they come

817
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,240
from like everywhere and you know just

818
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,919
the concept of I don't want to work on a

819
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,759
desk anymore I want to be out in the

820
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,840
dirt which I appreciate but it's like

821
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:58,278
okay but it's kind of like it doesn't

822
00:30:56,839 --> 00:31:00,959
and also maybe the thing with pet

823
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:03,079
flowers is you can start kind of small

824
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,200
and just grow a few rows of things and

825
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:08,240
sell them at a roadside stand without

826
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,159
too much infrastructure and therefore

827
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,839
you can kind of get into it that way

828
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,399
it's very interesting to see how people

829
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:14,480
adapt too once they get in they think

830
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:16,359
they're going to do these things and

831
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,759
they end up doing those things sometimes

832
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:21,439
too someone else had a question yep yeah

833
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:24,679
so I'm got to stud cup flowers and I'm

834
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,759
really interested in the local cut FL um

835
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:26,960
production market so I was just

836
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:31,240
wondering if you think that there might

837
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:34,319
need opportunities for careers extens I

838
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:38,558
think so because there looks like a huge

839
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:40,839
gap so yes I do think so um it is you

840
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:43,200
know one of the

841
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:44,839
things because one I think one of the

842
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,759
pieces that needs to fit in there is

843
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:48,319
identifying the number of growers in any

844
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:50,759
given area as I said with Lily

845
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:52,798
Calderwood she came in to do she was

846
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:54,798
doing floor culture but not cut flowers

847
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:56,918
but there were so many questions that

848
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:58,359
she started adding that I think if we

849
00:31:56,919 --> 00:31:59,960
actually looked at the industry and

850
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:02,319
started documenting where these Cut

851
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,079
Flower Growers are there would be you

852
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:06,200
know it would be worthwhile for an

853
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:08,199
extension office to say we need somebody

854
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,200
who has this background and this

855
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:13,440
information um and I think there's also

856
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,440
potential positions I actually know the

857
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,278
first maybe not the first I know I know

858
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,480
someone who's actually um a commercial

859
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:22,038
Scout for cutl Farm now and that that's

860
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,759
not something we don't have very many

861
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:25,919
commercial Scouts for ornamentals in the

862
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:28,119
state at all so the fact that this one

863
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,440
cut flower farm said we need somebody

864
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:30,678
from outside we're too busy you know

865
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,159
we're too busy doing other things we

866
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:34,360
need somebody from outside to actually

867
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,960
we'll pay you to come in and Scout for

868
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:38,678
it so but yeah I do think so so good

869
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,000
thank you I wonder if there's

870
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:45,919
opportunities for attractive

871
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,679
plants um to to get to get pests attract

872
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,600
oh trap crops trap that's exactly my

873
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:52,399
brain yeah trap crops they are

874
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:54,638
attractive but hopefully you want them

875
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:56,638
to be attractive so radishes for flea

876
00:32:54,638 --> 00:32:57,599
Beetles for is one that we actually you

877
00:32:56,638 --> 00:32:58,959
can use

878
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:01,398
and the reason one reason you use

879
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,960
radishes is flea beetles like them

880
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:05,479
better than some of the ornamentals but

881
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,240
they also the seeds cheap they grow fast

882
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,038
you can put in a row of radishes attract

883
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,440
the tra attract the flea beetles and

884
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:14,038
then you need to do something there you

885
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,399
need to either capture them which is you

886
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:17,599
know they do actually occasionally

887
00:33:15,398 --> 00:33:19,359
vacuum them um or treat them with a

888
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:21,558
pesticide on the Trap crop so that

889
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:24,759
you're not letting them go back out into

890
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:27,240
the crop yeah so yeah there is yeah do

891
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:29,919
you know what proportion of production

892
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,720
is perennial plants or is there like

893
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:35,720
interest in developing that for the

894
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:38,159
ecological services or mostly annuals

895
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,919
sticking I think there's a lot of people

896
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,278
who are doing both and I think people

897
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:45,038
start with annuals this is mostly

898
00:33:42,278 --> 00:33:47,519
anecdotal um but then they often will

899
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:49,398
start putting in some perennials I mean

900
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,798
pies is a good example because peonies

901
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:55,359
are really popular they're early they're

902
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:58,798
gorgeous you know you can sell a lot of

903
00:33:55,359 --> 00:34:00,119
pees um if you can grow them and so and

904
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:01,879
then the next thing that people move

905
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:03,678
into in terms of perennials is starting

906
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,480
putting in putting some Woodies in so

907
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,880
they've got them for foliage or they've

908
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,119
got them for large larger scale events

909
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:13,119
where you need big branches um there's

910
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:15,760
actually somebody from Cornell uh

911
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:19,039
who's a economist who's now down in

912
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,520
Maryland and their production is W UA

913
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:25,358
and their production is almost entirely

914
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:28,398
Woodies um and so and mostly dormant I

915
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:32,039
some dormant they do both but they'll do

916
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:33,440
yeah dormant branches as well yep so um

917
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:34,838
it is you know I think again when people

918
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,480
start out it's easy to start with

919
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:38,199
annuals because that's kind of the way

920
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,480
they've been thinking but then starting

921
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:41,559
to add in the other things and even the

922
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,599
concept then if you're going to put in

923
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:45,918
perennials if it's something like a pie

924
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,679
making sure that you have a plan for re

925
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,319
for renovating them or renewing them as

926
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,599
you go along you look like you're were

927
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,280
going to ask not so one of the things

928
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,039
that's striking is this diversity of

929
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,240
species and but then I was working along

930
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:59,679
side of Chris out there with the high

931
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:01,919
titles there's this whole other

932
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:04,078
component of genotype environment

933
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,760
interaction like he you know these

934
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,640
things just respond so differently same

935
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,640
genotype based on how they when they

936
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,679
were seated or what they're exposed to

937
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:15,000
whe they in a high tunnel oride High

938
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:18,559
tunnel so is there any group that's

939
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:22,880
thinking like strategically about what

940
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:25,559
our priorities and how down Focus areas

941
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,800
not just seems like a yeah not that I

942
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:29,599
know of and it

943
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,200
sometimes in term you mean in terms of

944
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,880
research or just in terms of

945
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:35,118
understanding that I I think both are

946
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,960
are not very well known and so yes so

947
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,720
when you're looking especially when

948
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,358
you're looking at repeated plantings of

949
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:41,879
things it's not the same each time even

950
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:43,639
in terms of how long it takes you to get

951
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,480
a flower and what the plants necessarily

952
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:48,118
look like so there's that piece from the

953
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,440
grower side but then there's also as far

954
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:54,358
as I can tell the research often is more

955
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,679
based on um like what's popular so or

956
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:56,960
what you're getting questions on so

957
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:59,239
there's lots of questions so the there

958
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,240
some on on lavender because lavender

959
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:03,559
lots of people want to grow lavender

960
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:05,078
it's a it's a nasty plant to gr I mean

961
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:06,480
it's if you can get if you're in a place

962
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,480
where you can grow it it's not a nasty

963
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,358
plant it's a lovely plant but it's very

964
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,159
picky so if you've got a place you can

965
00:36:10,358 --> 00:36:13,519
grow it it's great and so again we have

966
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:14,879
people go and say well look there's just

967
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:16,679
you just put that lavender out and then

968
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,240
we're all set but their soil is

969
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:20,279
different and so it doesn't work so that

970
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:22,838
gets a certain amount of work done on it

971
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,079
but it does I don't I have not seen even

972
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:25,679
in this group that we're just kind of

973
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,680
getting going there's a little bit more

974
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:30,039
discussion of okay should we write a

975
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:31,719
grant together and what should be on but

976
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:33,920
overall I haven't seen much of that

977
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:36,118
saying okay let's actually look at this

978
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,960
these crops in enough depth to have that

979
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,519
information to be able to say here's

980
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,639
kind of

981
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:45,239
a fact sheet cookbook whatever that says

982
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:46,920
okay if you're growing this and I think

983
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:48,879
there probably are some and a lot of

984
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,720
them um are if they are out there

985
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,240
they're they're actually probably

986
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:54,719
created by Growers you know here's how

987
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:56,838
you do sequential growth of this

988
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:58,199
particular species but then you get get

989
00:36:56,838 --> 00:37:00,159
different varieties and the varieties

990
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:02,039
change all the time and they don't

991
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:05,879
always necessarily act the same and

992
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:07,440
color is this big issue of so uh Carla

993
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,599
was doing a talk and she showed some of

994
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,639
the queen queen lime zenas which are

995
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:15,400
this sort of interesting combination of

996
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:19,159
pink and green and Peach and salmon and

997
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:23,079
green and chartu green and and then also

998
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:27,000
some um Lizzy anthus that are sort of

999
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:30,359
Dusty brownish pink which if you look at

1000
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,159
in on mass look dead to me but mixed in

1001
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:33,960
with with a bouquet they're very popular

1002
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:36,759
they color very popular but mixed in a

1003
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,119
bouquet I think so um and that's the

1004
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,359
other thing is they're trying to keep up

1005
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:40,880
with an annual it's easier with

1006
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:42,639
perennials like how do you keep up with

1007
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,200
what the next thing is

1008
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:47,239
always there's anybody else any other

1009
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:51,439
questions from Oh Thomas you have your

1010
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:54,078
hand up yeah we got a question for you

1011
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:58,119
it's basically how do things work around

1012
00:37:54,079 --> 00:38:00,240
here and for

1013
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:01,800
how much the college invests or

1014
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:03,559
Cooperative Extension invests in a

1015
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:08,720
particular industry how that gets

1016
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:10,358
decided when um you notify something or

1017
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:12,000
notice a new opportunity and I think

1018
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:15,000
that applies to everybody who's not in

1019
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,679
like dairy or corn or Sobe beans um you

1020
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,760
find I mean you've described a very

1021
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:21,078
organic process where you find that

1022
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,440
there's a need and find that there are

1023
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:25,039
other people who can help in various

1024
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,240
parts of serving that industry and then

1025
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:30,679
you get some money and resources

1026
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:32,519
and if it has legs it keeps

1027
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:35,639
growing have you found that there's

1028
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:37,119
other parts to the system that uh are

1029
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:40,358
helping determine how

1030
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:44,440
much um should be invested in a

1031
00:38:40,358 --> 00:38:49,000
new agricultural sector like this I have

1032
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,000
not I'm not sure I've asked

1033
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:55,279
um I don't know if I even know who to

1034
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:56,559
ask but and and so again you know I

1035
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,000
think sometimes it takes a little a

1036
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:59,400
little bit of information gathering I

1037
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,800
know I'm looking at your picture there

1038
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,960
look camera a little bit of information

1039
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,640
gathering and then putting it together

1040
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,440
and kind of presenting it to say you

1041
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:09,759
know we could use more help here or what

1042
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,400
else can we do with this or don't you

1043
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,400
think it'd be nice to have somebody

1044
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,880
doing it um whether or not that will fly

1045
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,680
at a university I don't know and then

1046
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,400
there's also more other universities and

1047
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:22,480
colleges than Cornell so someone else

1048
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,559
may pick it up um and and run with it

1049
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,760
too so they don't have a really good

1050
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:28,279
answer for that no no but than for the

1051
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,640
look under the

1052
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:34,960
hood moving along is most of the variety

1053
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:38,519
development done by like private

1054
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,240
companies or is there a lot in like

1055
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:43,759
public I would say the great majority is

1056
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:47,239
at is it is at seed companies okay um

1057
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,400
it's not that there's none anywhere else

1058
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:51,439
um and then there's some that's done by

1059
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,599
private individuals for certain cult for

1060
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,440
certain species there's there's some

1061
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,240
that people are actually some Cut Flower

1062
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,159
Growers are doing themselves but also

1063
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:01,799
other people that are interested are

1064
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:04,920
doing I'm glad to see what Bill's not

1065
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:08,000
well and some are ancient cultive Arts

1066
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:12,400
you know PES some of those PES forever

1067
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,119
right yeah we have a Cornell Mark Bri is

1068
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,920
BR three or four

1069
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:22,039
varieties I think those are the first

1070
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:25,119
ornamental plants atted by cor they

1071
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:27,358
could well be and now it' be interesting

1072
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,760
to promote those to flower Growers and I

1073
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,559
don't know whether they're if they're

1074
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,560
aimed at Garden varieties so their stems

1075
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:35,358
are not long enough they're they're long

1076
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:38,519
enough they're long enough yeah Blue

1077
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:41,480
Grass L were there some in Min Garden I

1078
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:43,519
have no idea were some I don't know but

1079
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,318
they're they're they're two and a half

1080
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:47,400
approaching three feet and sometimes

1081
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:49,119
it's it's getting the word out and like

1082
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,599
where do people go looking for their

1083
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,880
seed their seat usually seed but also

1084
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,440
plugs uh and so they do don't grow it

1085
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,160
off direct from seeding and so some of

1086
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,159
it's like okay how do you get that

1087
00:40:57,159 --> 00:41:02,000
connection between the breeder the

1088
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:04,078
producer and the grower and so sometimes

1089
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,838
again you do it backwards so you get the

1090
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:09,280
grower interested in get them to ask the

1091
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:09,279
things

1092
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,960
Flyers other questions thank you for the

1093
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:16,598
question I always like questions more

1094
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,358
than

1095
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:20,359
talking anybody else

1096
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,639
here thank

1097
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:28,239
you

1098
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:36,239
this has been a production of Cornell

1099
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,240
University on the web at cornell.edu
