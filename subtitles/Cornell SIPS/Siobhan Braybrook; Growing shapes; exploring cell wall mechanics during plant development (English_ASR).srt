1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,009
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,480
University so today I'm gonna focus on

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:07,980
one particular problem that we're

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,679
working on that has nothing to do with

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,839
seaweeds its plants which is useful I

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,490
think for this audience um and it's

7
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,198
talking about an isotropic growth and

8
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,760
what you'll see in particular is that

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,439
we're focusing on the hypocotyl as a

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,390
system to study this but obviously

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,518
there's lots of places within a plant

12
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,170
where an isotropy will occur so

13
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:26,250
extending these principles beyond that

14
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,900
will be something that we're interested

15
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:34,489
in doing next so let's see if I can

16
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:37,949
figure out how to use the pointers this

17
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:40,468
I'm just going to use this okay so our

18
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,440
general question in the lab is trying to

19
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,239
ask how shapes get grown in Walled

20
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,789
organisms and I say plants and algae

21
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,468
because I don't really look at East or

22
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,870
bacterial so I'm looking at

23
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,280
multicellular Walled organisms and it

24
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:55,709
presents a really interesting physical

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,689
challenge so you have a wall that's

26
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,520
surrounding each cell but also for the

27
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:01,229
most part connecting cells to each other

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,359
and connecting tissues to each other and

29
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:05,009
so physically speaking when you want to

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,350
have coordinated growth that gives you a

31
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,750
shape or a pattern you need to have

32
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:11,938
coordination of that physical process of

33
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,560
growth and in general as you'll see I

34
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:17,669
consider that as something that's really

35
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,740
mediated by the cell wall so here's an

36
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,840
example of some of the systems that we

37
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,579
look at and some of the organisms we'll

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,240
use but as I mentioned we're really

39
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:28,769
going to focus on maybe it just doesn't

40
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:30,629
have a battery that's okay I can dance

41
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:37,978
around we're gonna focus on the high

42
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:40,228
picado today so so when you want to

43
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:41,849
understand how shapes are grown oh thank

44
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:44,099
you whether you're talking about a cell

45
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:46,048
shape or the shape of the tissue or a

46
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:47,219
whole organ you need to do different

47
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,840
things so first of all you need to be

48
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:51,149
able to quantify shape so we did quite a

49
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,590
bit of differential geometry to look at

50
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,469
how shapes change in time and how you

51
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,850
can quantitatively describe them you're

52
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:59,188
going to talk about how you actually

53
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:01,078
think that change in shape comes about

54
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:02,699
and to do that we look at some physical

55
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:04,769
principles and also some material

56
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,259
science so the cell wall is material and

57
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:09,090
then we're going to look at how the cell

58
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,219
wall biochemistry relates to those

59
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,110
material changes and how the cell

60
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:13,590
biology underlies that change in the

61
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,660
material

62
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,519
and finally of course I'm a

63
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:20,310
developmental biologist at heart so I'm

64
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:22,349
really interested in how the signals

65
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,050
from the genetic program get translated

66
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:28,259
into this physical change in shape so

67
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,790
today what I'm going to focus on when I

68
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:33,419
start learning how to use the computer

69
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:35,128
is mostly these two here so what kind of

70
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:37,500
saw well changes are happening during an

71
00:02:35,128 --> 00:02:39,120
isotropic growth and what we think maybe

72
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,370
some of the regulatory mechanisms for

73
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,780
that might be but there'll be a little

74
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:48,090
bit of material science at the end so

75
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:52,318
this is my diagram of the cell wall just

76
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:54,509
don't freak out so it's an incredibly

77
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,949
stylized really simplified description

78
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:58,560
of what we think a cell wall looks like

79
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:59,639
and pointing out that of course as some

80
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,229
people in the audience will know we

81
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,000
don't really know what the cell wall

82
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:05,639
looks like so we know there are

83
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,009
cellulose fibers in there we know that

84
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:10,078
that's embedded somehow within a PEC

85
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:11,699
tenacious matrix and pectin is their

86
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:14,840
chemical I'm going to talk most about

87
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:16,768
but there's also you know cross links

88
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,930
hemicelluloses that can happen in

89
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:20,159
between fibers and we're starting to

90
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,049
learn a little bit more about the

91
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,479
architecture of the wall but it's an

92
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:27,480
incredibly difficult structural thing to

93
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,888
work with and so a lot of the things

94
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:30,719
that I'm gonna say about the mechanics

95
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:33,180
of the cell wall we're taking a lot of

96
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,129
assumptions into the structure as well

97
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,109
and hopefully we'll learn more about the

98
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:40,079
structure and link that to the mechanics

99
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:42,359
over time but with a big grain of salt

100
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:44,730
we think that the cell wall has these

101
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:47,700
strong rigid fibers whose orientation

102
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:49,649
can affect the material properties but

103
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:50,818
you also have the matrix within which

104
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,299
they're embedded which is what I'll

105
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:57,238
focus on today so our questions about

106
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,560
the mechanical cell wall is how does the

107
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,379
wall change during growth in shape

108
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,199
formation what component of the wall or

109
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:06,209
components might be important for cell

110
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:08,429
growth or shape growth and and how they

111
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,139
actually mediate that and actually also

112
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,480
how we can test the properties of the

113
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,310
wall in vivo and so as Adrian mentioned

114
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,469
they've been involved a lot in using

115
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,970
atomic force microscopy as a way to test

116
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,709
the material properties of the cell wall

117
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:23,400
and I'll go into that a little bit for

118
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:24,870
you so today what I'm going to do is

119
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:26,729
focus on the high picado we're going to

120
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,730
look at a role for pectin methylation

121
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:31,950
in hypo cuddling and isotropy then we're

122
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,480
gonna look at how maybe modulating an

123
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:35,370
isotropy could have some interesting

124
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,140
functional functional consequences for a

125
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,389
plant so instead of just saying oh

126
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,339
that's a cool microscopy picture why it

127
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:44,159
might actually be useful to change your

128
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:45,599
ant isotropy and then at the very end if

129
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,520
we have time I'll do a little bit of

130
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,650
what we're looking at to actually link

131
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,049
the back chemistry of pectin to the

132
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:56,129
material properties of gels and how we

133
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:59,370
can translate that back into a plant so

134
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:01,860
it's probably a little bit super phorus

135
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:05,430
for this audience but the hypocotyl is

136
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,439
an important organ it's located between

137
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:11,250
the root meristem and the shoot meristem

138
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,949
in a lot of dicotyledons plants and

139
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,050
what's going to happen is you need this

140
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:18,899
extreme anisotropic elongation of this

141
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,160
organ to get the apex out of the soil so

142
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:22,189
you can start getting photosynthetic

143
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:29,010
capacity happening and producing leaves

144
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:30,930
and so yes so this happens from the

145
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:32,789
point of germination you start getting

146
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,889
this massive and isotropic elongation of

147
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,180
this organ and so that's the study

148
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:39,060
system we're going to work with today

149
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,420
and obviously it's important for the

150
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,560
early success of plants and as crops you

151
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,240
know the first thing that happens in

152
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:51,569
their life is germination but after that

153
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:53,100
you've got to get out of the soil so one

154
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:56,879
of the ways that we watch this happening

155
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,530
is by simulating a continuous reach for

156
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,029
the surface so we grow things we grow

157
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:02,069
seedlings in the dark these are rabid

158
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:04,849
OPS's high picados growing in the dark

159
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:07,439
and visualized using infrared light and

160
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:09,000
so what we can do is essentially make it

161
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,500
so they never think they get out and

162
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,959
they're just gonna continue this

163
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,269
elongation until they run out of

164
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,729
resources and so what we can do from

165
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:19,649
that is we can monitor length over time

166
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,270
in really precise ways so we can get

167
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:24,419
quantitative descriptions of this

168
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:25,740
elongation as it happens so they start

169
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,090
doing some fun things at the end which

170
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:31,439
I'm not going to talk about but I like

171
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:34,739
these Wiggles as well they're dancing so

172
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:37,410
as far as anisotropic growth goes that

173
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,629
elongation more in one direction than

174
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,490
another we

175
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:43,850
but the direction for an isotropy but

176
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:45,560
also a magnitude so in this case it's

177
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,780
pretty easy the direction of the high

178
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,430
picado is pretty much always up so it's

179
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:50,569
not that it goes up and then it starts

180
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,550
getting fatter you're just it's a

181
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:54,800
continual direction for the an isotropy

182
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,480
but the magnitude actually changes in

183
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,040
time so what I'm going to show you in

184
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,319
the next slide is that you start off

185
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:03,250
relatively slow but then it gets faster

186
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,149
and that magnitude has to do with

187
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,220
differential regulation of the

188
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:09,289
elongation growth and the width growth

189
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:13,190
of cells which I'll also show you some

190
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:14,930
data for so if we take our movies and we

191
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:16,279
quantify the length of the hypocotyl

192
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,689
over time and you've probably seen this

193
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:20,449
before because this is a well-known

194
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:22,459
phenomenon you end up with what some

195
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:24,500
people call a sigmoidal growth curve so

196
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:25,789
it's sort of slow increase in length at

197
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,769
the beginning and then you get a

198
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,140
transition around 24 hours after

199
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:33,620
germination to this more rapid

200
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:36,860
elongation and so that's what we're sort

201
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:39,379
of tunneling down into one of the things

202
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:42,290
is what's controlling this transition to

203
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:44,449
the rapid elongation but also underlying

204
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,550
that is what's making sure that most of

205
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:48,319
the growth is going into length and not

206
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,900
a lot into width which would be a waste

207
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:55,459
of energy if your job is to get you up

208
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:57,649
out of the soil okay so this really is a

209
00:07:55,459 --> 00:08:00,919
change in growth magnitude and isotropy

210
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:03,229
magnitude so what we did is we looked at

211
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,400
the cellular level as well so we wanted

212
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,650
to know what cells were doing at this

213
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:09,109
point so this has been done once before

214
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:10,609
and it was with scanning electron

215
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,560
microscopy and they really just looked

216
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,629
at cell length over time but if you

217
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,970
think about it so lengths and widths

218
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:19,279
that ratio is what's important also for

219
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,750
an isotropy and if you only ever measure

220
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:23,029
length you may be losing some

221
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,680
information by not looking at width so

222
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:27,289
what's happening in this colorful slide

223
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,759
is mostly the elongation of the

224
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,650
hypocotyl happens by cell elongation

225
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:33,288
there's not a lot of division at least

226
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:36,439
in epidermis and so that allows us to

227
00:08:33,288 --> 00:08:39,679
track or pseudo track cells by position

228
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,930
so you have the 1 to 17 cells per file

229
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,159
and because these are growing in the

230
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:45,799
dark as soon as you take them out to

231
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:48,980
image them they stop growing so we're

232
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:51,500
pseudo time series by sampling at each

233
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,460
time and so then what we can do is we

234
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,799
can say well this is

235
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:57,350
one two three four and we can calculate

236
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,120
individual growth curbs and individual

237
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:03,050
growth rates by position that along that

238
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,339
file does that make sense so the first

239
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:05,659
thing that you'll see is if you just

240
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:08,300
look at the top of this there's that

241
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:09,588
transition to fast elongation and what

242
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:11,870
you may know already which is known in

243
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:13,959
the literature is that all the cell's

244
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,549
don't start elongating at the same time

245
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:18,889
instead you get this what we call an AK

246
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:20,899
Repetto wave of the elongation so the

247
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:22,580
cells at the base start along hitting

248
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:25,278
before the cells up near the top and

249
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,839
that happens in a wave you can see it

250
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,570
really nicely here these are still small

251
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:32,060
cells in length here whereas these are

252
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,680
elongating and that wave of elongation

253
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:36,708
actually travels up the length of the

254
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:39,229
hypercar so you have what looks like a

255
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:41,059
pretty simple behavior slow growth fast

256
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,889
growth for the whole organ but it's

257
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:44,479
underlaid by this interesting wave of

258
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:46,750
elongation that moves from the base to

259
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,159
the top and that allows us to look at

260
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,958
elongating and non elongating cells or

261
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:55,009
fast and slowly elongating cells at the

262
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:57,409
same time so what's over here is sort of

263
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:59,720
the first real measurements of widths

264
00:09:57,409 --> 00:10:02,028
that are happening at the same time and

265
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,490
what you can see is that the change in

266
00:10:02,028 --> 00:10:07,490
width doesn't show that back Repetto

267
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:09,589
waves and the cells are expanding in

268
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:12,169
width very slowly so this is a full

269
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:13,640
order of magnitude different scale so

270
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:16,219
you're really you're expanding and width

271
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:18,169
really slowly compared to length and

272
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,570
you're not having that position

273
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:23,120
dependent control of where that growth

274
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:25,010
in width is happening so you don't get

275
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,429
that sharp transition to a fast growth

276
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:30,080
either so this really is indicating that

277
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:32,208
the growth and width and the growth and

278
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,879
length are somehow being independently

279
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:38,000
regulated that's what we might say okay

280
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,620
this is the cellular level mechanism by

281
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,070
which that organ level behavior is

282
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:45,049
coming up but what we wanted to ask was

283
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:47,990
how that transition to rapid growth was

284
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:49,549
achieved and what that really means is

285
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,009
what's happening at the base where those

286
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:53,599
cells are elongated versus the top where

287
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:55,639
they haven't started quickly elongating

288
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,100
yet and then also how that direction

289
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:01,730
going more up than in width is actually

290
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:04,129
happening and so there's obvious roles

291
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,499
here for cellulose orientation which

292
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:05,999
ever

293
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:07,918
we'll know about and I'm gonna hope to

294
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:11,278
add to that a little bit today with a

295
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:12,899
pectin story so let's start with this

296
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:16,048
how do you get that transition in rapid

297
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:18,389
growth so if we go back to this data

298
00:11:16,048 --> 00:11:19,978
we're really interested in that sharp

299
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:22,019
transition where things start getting

300
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:23,609
really fast and it's because the cells

301
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:26,068
at the base are starting to elongate

302
00:11:23,609 --> 00:11:28,408
much more quickly and that allows us to

303
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:30,178
ask this question about the cell wall

304
00:11:28,408 --> 00:11:32,249
chemistry between the fast and slowly

305
00:11:30,178 --> 00:11:35,308
elongating cells at one point in time

306
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:38,519
and so because of some work that we've

307
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:41,098
done previously in Filat axis looking at

308
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:43,349
pectin chemistry we knew that there was

309
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:45,209
some link between pectin and where you

310
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:47,879
would get a new organ forming at a shoot

311
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:49,348
apex in Arabidopsis and so we wanted to

312
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:51,658
ask whether or not we could see similar

313
00:11:49,349 --> 00:11:53,369
changes impacting chemistry here along

314
00:11:51,658 --> 00:11:57,389
the high picado due to that expansion

315
00:11:53,369 --> 00:11:59,579
gradient so I'm going to introduce Homa

316
00:11:57,389 --> 00:12:01,619
collector on an to you this will be the

317
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:03,418
most biochemical this slide gets so

318
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:06,379
there are people in this room whose tree

319
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:09,899
is better than mine so I apologize but

320
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:12,449
basically in Rabbid OPS's the major cell

321
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:14,849
wall pectin is homo collector on ends so

322
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:18,478
it's a really simple chain of galactic

323
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:20,278
acid and when it comes out into the cell

324
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:21,749
wall its esterified so these little

325
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:24,658
orange balls are meant to be those

326
00:12:21,749 --> 00:12:27,329
methyl ester groups and what will happen

327
00:12:24,658 --> 00:12:28,859
once you're sort of in the cell wall is

328
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:31,769
that you can be selectively Dias

329
00:12:28,859 --> 00:12:35,429
terrified by pac-man or pectin methyl

330
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:38,038
esters this then takes off some of these

331
00:12:35,428 --> 00:12:40,288
methyl groups and then what can happen

332
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:42,178
there is that you can then cross link

333
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:44,788
with calcium so this is this really

334
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:47,970
canonical calcium chelation that will

335
00:12:44,788 --> 00:12:50,068
happen in pectin gels not it's analogous

336
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,928
to what happens in alginate whether the

337
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:53,759
the chemistry is different but you get

338
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:56,728
this calcium cross-linking get rigidify

339
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:59,308
patient of a gel so what I've got in

340
00:12:56,729 --> 00:13:02,339
this table is sort of what we predict

341
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:04,048
the mechanical character of gels made of

342
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:06,509
these different types of pectin should

343
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:08,129
be so when you can't calcium

344
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:11,009
cross-linked you should be generally

345
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:12,749
more soft as a material as soon as you

346
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:14,788
can calcium cross-linked you should be

347
00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:17,939
more rigid that makes sense it's like

348
00:13:14,788 --> 00:13:19,499
making Jam you're setting the jam and we

349
00:13:17,938 --> 00:13:22,379
some antibodies that actually let us

350
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:24,329
look at the presence of these different

351
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:26,129
epitopes within the cell wall which is

352
00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:28,019
what we're gonna look at next but we can

353
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:29,369
make some hypotheses about what we think

354
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,339
might be happening with respect to

355
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:34,319
growth so when the pectin is more

356
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:36,389
methylated it should be more soft maybe

357
00:13:34,318 --> 00:13:38,519
even more fluid growth should be easier

358
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:40,798
in that case the cell wall material

359
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,298
should deform more versus when you have

360
00:13:40,798 --> 00:13:43,678
calcium cross-linking things are a

361
00:13:42,298 --> 00:13:45,119
little bit tougher and it might be

362
00:13:43,678 --> 00:13:48,238
harder for the cell wall to actually

363
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:50,309
extend now the reason that this one in

364
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:52,229
the center says it's possibly rigid is

365
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:54,918
because there are more complicated

366
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:57,419
dynamics that can happen you can have

367
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:59,220
demethylated pectin degraded by poly

368
00:13:57,418 --> 00:14:00,509
Galacta renée's and so if you're

369
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,119
chopping your pectin up that's

370
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:06,688
definitely going to be a softer gel then

371
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:08,278
if it's just you know sitting there

372
00:14:06,688 --> 00:14:09,958
without calcium cross-linking because

373
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:12,599
you're actually chopping up the backbone

374
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:14,008
so just because you have PMA activity

375
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:16,528
doesn't mean you're always going to be

376
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:18,839
more rigid it depends on presence of

377
00:14:16,528 --> 00:14:22,048
peleg electron is is and also presence

378
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:23,789
of calcium ions okay let's take a look

379
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:28,228
at what these antibodies look like in

380
00:14:23,788 --> 00:14:30,359
that elongating hi picado I think oh yes

381
00:14:28,229 --> 00:14:32,069
I have to mention that we also have some

382
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:34,319
proteins that we can use called pectin

383
00:14:32,068 --> 00:14:36,328
methyl esters inhibitors that basically

384
00:14:34,318 --> 00:14:38,128
stop this enzyme from D s terrifying the

385
00:14:36,328 --> 00:14:39,868
pectin so we predict that they should

386
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:42,028
keep the pectin in a more fluid state

387
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:43,889
whereas if you over expressed p.m. YZ

388
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:45,389
you might end up with pectin in a more

389
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:47,178
rigid state and then we'll come back to

390
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:50,129
that in a minute

391
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:52,048
okay so these are transverse sections of

392
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:54,389
high picados at 24 hours post

393
00:14:52,048 --> 00:14:56,428
germination when we know the basal cells

394
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:58,558
are actively quickly elongating and

395
00:14:56,428 --> 00:15:01,769
these top cells are slowly long eating

396
00:14:58,558 --> 00:15:04,019
and so LM xx this is the methylated

397
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:05,698
pectin hopefully what you can see here

398
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:07,379
is that there's more signal down at the

399
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:08,848
base than there is at the top although

400
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:11,329
the quantifications with these things

401
00:15:08,849 --> 00:15:13,799
can be very difficult so I caution you

402
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:15,778
but up in the slow growing cells we

403
00:15:13,798 --> 00:15:18,928
definitely have more labeling with the

404
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:21,838
too rigid or possibly rigid antibodies

405
00:15:18,928 --> 00:15:23,639
for Hg so what that means if you look

406
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,669
down at the base is that you should have

407
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,079
more of the fluid pectin and up at the

408
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:31,048
top you should have more of the rigid

409
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:31,739
pectin and so the idea is that the cells

410
00:15:31,048 --> 00:15:33,480
at the base are

411
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,710
able to elongate or part of the reason

412
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,779
they're able to along it is because

413
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:38,460
you're you're keeping that pectin in a

414
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:40,079
more fluid state so it's getting

415
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:43,310
delivered and it's not getting converted

416
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:46,889
into the more rigid rigid rigidity it

417
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:49,889
rigid able pectin okay

418
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:51,059
so if that's true can we actually test

419
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:54,210
that and this is where the atomic force

420
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:56,189
microscopy comes in so hopefully I'll

421
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:58,170
start this movie while I talk so this is

422
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:00,420
an image of an AFM experiment going on

423
00:15:58,169 --> 00:16:02,669
and what you have is a very small tip

424
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:05,339
here which is actually going to do tiny

425
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:05,969
indentations along the surface of the

426
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,620
hypocotyl

427
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,840
so we're limited to looking at the

428
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,429
epidermis right now but we can poke and

429
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,700
essentially what you're doing is asking

430
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:17,009
if I apply a force for example to the

431
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,720
surface of this table if I apply the

432
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:21,269
same force to the table how much does it

433
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,970
indent the table versus how much that

434
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:25,500
force would indent my arm and so by

435
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,180
looking at the force and deformation

436
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,340
that you get at different areas along a

437
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:31,349
high peccato or between two different

438
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,310
materials like me in the table you can

439
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,920
learn something about the material

440
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:36,449
properties and if you do this quickly

441
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:39,870
you're going to be looking at the

442
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:42,680
elasticity of the cell wall so if we do

443
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:46,409
that at the base of the hypocotyl

444
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:47,669
during at four hours so when everybody's

445
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:49,469
going really slowly this is the

446
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:50,939
transition to rapid growth at the base

447
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:54,120
and this is when things are really

448
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,740
kicking it what we can see is that this

449
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,830
number we get called the indentation

450
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:00,779
modulus is going down in time and so an

451
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:03,150
indentation modulus just relates the

452
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:05,160
force to the deformation that you get

453
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:06,299
and so the higher it is the more force

454
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,310
you need to apply to get the same

455
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:11,309
deformation and the lower it is the less

456
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:13,319
force so it implies that the material is

457
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:14,490
getting more elastic over time which

458
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,439
correlates really well with this

459
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:19,259
increasing growth okay

460
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:21,240
that makes sense this is nice and

461
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:23,279
consistent well what happens if we alter

462
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,099
pectin chemistry so based on our

463
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,750
predictions of what soft and what's

464
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,519
allowing growth to happen if we mess

465
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,589
with the home of lecture on an structure

466
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,079
we mess with its mechanics maybe we'll

467
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:36,419
also change growth and so we're going to

468
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,939
go back to those two enzymes the PME and

469
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,440
the PME I the inhibitor to try and

470
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,950
change the kind of pectin that's in the

471
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,610
cell wall and see what happens to growth

472
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,100
so as a

473
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:49,558
reminder for you the PME is catalyzing

474
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:52,379
the removal of methyl groups so this

475
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:53,879
should allow pectin if there's not a lot

476
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,230
of poly collector on a as present to

477
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,960
calcium cross-linked and become more

478
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:00,179
rigid but if you have inducible p.m. II

479
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,360
I that should block p.m. ease activity

480
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:05,160
and leave you more in this fluid state

481
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:08,819
and so we've done this with alcohol

482
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,769
inducible p.m. e and P Mei lines but

483
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:12,808
there are only one p.m. E and 1 p.m. e I

484
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:15,029
and there's about you know sixty to

485
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:16,500
seventy of each family in a rabbit ops

486
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:19,529
Asst so there are a lot of these genes

487
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,509
out there but in this particular case

488
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:23,369
we're just taking one p.m. e 1p me I and

489
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:24,960
asking what happens if we induce ibly

490
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:29,909
over express them to the growth of the

491
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:32,279
hyper kado so luckily i don't know this

492
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:34,048
is just what happened so what you can

493
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,819
see here in grey is that normal

494
00:18:34,048 --> 00:18:38,069
non-transgenic but treated with the

495
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:39,298
inducer which in this case is ethanol we

496
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:42,089
get the slow growth and then the

497
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:44,129
transition to rapid growth and what

498
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:45,779
happens when you overexpress the PME is

499
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,490
that you kind of just always have slow

500
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:49,710
growth and you never get that rapid

501
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:51,509
transition probably and we've done the

502
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:54,179
biochemistry to look at this because

503
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:55,919
you're only having conversion of all the

504
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:57,600
pectin into that calcium cross-linked

505
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,820
form or pretty much all of it so

506
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:02,308
everything's really rigid everything is

507
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:05,009
slowing down and the opposite is true

508
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:06,599
when you have the PME i which keeps all

509
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:09,480
the pectin that comes out in that fluid

510
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:11,459
state and you really you're growing much

511
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,700
more quickly earlier and you sort of

512
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,840
have a more flat fast growth throughout

513
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,058
the length throughout the growth of that

514
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,220
mikado so it has the predicted changes

515
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:23,069
we would expect on an organ level but

516
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,569
also a cell level so because of the way

517
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:27,089
the induction works we don't see the

518
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:28,950
phenotype right away you see it sort of

519
00:19:27,089 --> 00:19:31,379
at 40 48 hours we can see a little bit

520
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:34,230
better so this is cell length they look

521
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,360
the same at the time of induction but 24

522
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,980
hours later you can see that the wave of

523
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:40,259
elongation is happening so this is the

524
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,179
cell index from the base to the top the

525
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:44,579
PME eye cells are a lot longer at the

526
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:47,548
base versus the PME cells which are

527
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:48,869
pretty short all the way along so we're

528
00:19:47,548 --> 00:19:50,819
having that change in the organ and the

529
00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:52,558
change in the cells predictive based on

530
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:56,668
the chemistry so that's pretty nice i

531
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:58,149
will note that we still don't know why

532
00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:00,160
changing pectin

533
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:01,240
kissa tea actually has that effect on

534
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,070
growth so that's something we're working

535
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,750
on what is the actual physical thing

536
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:07,089
that's happening in this cell wall that

537
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:12,220
says because your gel is rigid you can

538
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:14,019
grow less so maybe next time essentially

539
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,480
what happens is that PME blocks this

540
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:21,129
rapid growth phase and Pei is promoting

541
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:23,380
it so what we would want to see is that

542
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:26,470
we can see the change in mechanics that

543
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:29,320
we also expect to happen and so luckily

544
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:31,720
that also works out with the AFM so now

545
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:34,990
I'm showing you the AFM data in a map

546
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:37,150
first of all so each point along this is

547
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:38,890
a single indentation experiment so you

548
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:41,920
can get some spatial information as well

549
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:43,600
so when you have PME expression things

550
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,880
are generally more rigid this is that

551
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,709
indentation modulus so the higher this

552
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,620
is the more rigid the cell walls are and

553
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:54,100
here we have P Mei and things are a lot

554
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:55,750
softer more elastic I'll note that these

555
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:58,089
experiments are done in plasma lytic

556
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:00,700
conditions because this cell wall is

557
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:02,079
quite thin compared to the turgor

558
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,240
pressure inside when you're doing these

559
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,829
indentation experiments depending on how

560
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,509
you do them oftentimes you need to

561
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:08,889
reduce the turgor pressure so you're not

562
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:12,519
just measuring pressure when you're

563
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:14,350
poking on a cell and so I'll show you a

564
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:16,359
graph now so it's a little bit more

565
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:17,799
quantitative but you can see that the

566
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:20,259
indentation modulus of the

567
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:23,079
non-transgenic is almost halfway between

568
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:25,089
when you induce PME and when you induce

569
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:26,500
PMI so they're having that mechanical

570
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:28,809
effect and the effect on growth we'd

571
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:33,279
expect okay this all sounds pretty good

572
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:35,440
but now I want to ask this question

573
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:38,139
about how the direction and and isotropy

574
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,500
is achieved and what you might have

575
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:43,090
noticed if I go back one is one of the

576
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,440
things you get is some spatial

577
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:47,199
information and you might notice that

578
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,940
these transverse walls appear to be more

579
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,549
rigid in the non-transgenic than these

580
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,320
are long gating walls and a really easy

581
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:55,539
way to explain that is because these

582
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:57,129
walls are just thinner so if you push on

583
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:59,740
something that's thinner it will feel

584
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:01,510
softer regardless of if the material is

585
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,890
different but we know we've actually

586
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:04,569
done some measurements on cell wall

587
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,670
thickness here and we know that the

588
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:08,829
walls are maintaining the same type of

589
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:10,150
thickness so we think it's actually due

590
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,889
to this chemical difference in the

591
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:13,350
pectin

592
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:15,750
so those walls appear to be more rigid

593
00:22:13,349 --> 00:22:17,849
the slow walls that might control width

594
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:20,849
expansion are more rigid than the

595
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:22,649
elongating axial loss so let's

596
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:24,240
investigate that a little bit more when

597
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:30,150
we ask how that direction and and

598
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:32,190
isotropy is achieved so we looked at 24

599
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:33,690
hours which is close to what you saw

600
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:35,730
before we're looking at 48 with the

601
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:38,279
induction but this is 24 and already we

602
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:40,950
can see these walls are more rigid than

603
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:43,139
the fast alarm giving axial walls but

604
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:45,210
even at 4 hours post termination when

605
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,679
everything's growing really slowly we

606
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:49,529
can still see that there's a difference

607
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,330
already in these transverse versus axial

608
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:53,579
walls so this is something that's set up

609
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:55,230
pretty early and it's coincident with

610
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:56,939
the fact that that growth is always an

611
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,009
isotropic you're always elongating more

612
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:02,090
in length than you are in width it's

613
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:05,250
just that it gets faster past 24 hours

614
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:06,750
so we've done some quantification of

615
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:10,740
this as well which is maybe a little bit

616
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:12,150
more believable so at 4 hours we can see

617
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,919
that there is a difference between the

618
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:16,110
transverse and axial wall as the

619
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,390
transverse walls are more stiff you see

620
00:23:16,109 --> 00:23:20,428
everything gets a bit softer by 24 hours

621
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,900
which is what it showed you before but

622
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:23,669
you can still see that this maintenance

623
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:27,630
of the ratio between slow and fast

624
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:30,929
growing walls is maintained and so you

625
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:32,580
may also have noticed that pectin could

626
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:34,679
be involved in this as well because in

627
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:36,449
the PM E&amp;P mei / expresses which we'll

628
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:39,509
look at again we've actually abolished

629
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:42,360
that difference and so now we're looking

630
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:44,279
at transverse sections sorry

631
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:46,740
longitudinal sections of high picados

632
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:49,168
and we're looking at high picados cells

633
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,929
near the base at four hours and then

634
00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:53,880
we're gonna look at 24 but remember even

635
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:55,590
at 4 hours we could see this difference

636
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,290
in the elasticity of the cell walls and

637
00:23:55,589 --> 00:24:02,609
so what I have marked here with red

638
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:05,460
asterisks are endosperm sections so and

639
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:07,548
then this is epidermal files marked in

640
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:11,340
green is kind of hard to orient yourself

641
00:24:07,548 --> 00:24:13,798
so what you can hopefully see is that in

642
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:16,289
the epidermal file these two more rigid

643
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:17,789
pectin markers have higher signal on the

644
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:22,558
transverse walls and they tend to have

645
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:24,509
on the axial walls and the opposite is

646
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:26,609
true for the softer pectin marker

647
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:28,589
20 where you have more signal in these

648
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:31,109
trends on the axial walls and less on

649
00:24:28,589 --> 00:24:34,319
the transverse again these are really

650
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:36,539
tricky to do quantitatively but it dives

651
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:38,700
pretty well with the mechanical

652
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:41,639
measurements that we can make and we can

653
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,960
look at this at 24 hours as well and see

654
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,140
once these cells are starting to

655
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,669
elongate we're again seeing a little bit

656
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:51,450
more of the rigid markers on these

657
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:54,330
transverse walls here more of the soft

658
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:55,289
pectin on the elongating walls you can

659
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:58,048
see it gets a little bit more

660
00:24:55,289 --> 00:25:00,210
complicated there is some rigid pectin

661
00:24:58,048 --> 00:25:02,940
on that elongated wall as well so it's

662
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:04,200
not as simple as saying well if you have

663
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,210
this pectin you will grow and if you

664
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,650
have this pectin you won't but it's

665
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:10,259
really difficult right now to work out

666
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:11,669
that quantitative relationship so we're

667
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:15,089
working on it but it's pretty difficult

668
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:16,259
especially with these techniques okay so

669
00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:19,079
you have difference in the elasticity

670
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:21,119
between slow and fast growing walls that

671
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:23,399
same difference is mirrored between the

672
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,949
slow and fast growing regions of that

673
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:28,230
accra petal wave and we can correlate

674
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:29,880
really nicely the chemistry of the

675
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:34,230
pectin with the elasticity of the walls

676
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:38,340
and growth so when we go back to those

677
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:40,019
PME and PME i overexpress so this is the

678
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:41,579
same image that you saw before but now

679
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:44,099
we're focusing on the fact that the

680
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:46,889
ratio between the transverse and axial

681
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:48,269
walls has actually disappeared so the

682
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,030
non-transgenic treated with ethanol

683
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:52,829
shows the rate difference but the PME

684
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:54,210
it's everything is rigid there's no

685
00:25:52,829 --> 00:25:55,829
difference anymore and the PAI

686
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:59,340
everything is soft there's no difference

687
00:25:55,829 --> 00:26:00,869
anymore and you can see that before I

688
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:02,039
showed you the length of the cells but

689
00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:03,899
now I'm actually showing you the length

690
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:06,839
versus the width and you can see the PME

691
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:09,690
I cells are way more an isotropic so the

692
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:12,990
ratio of length to width is more and the

693
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:15,480
PME cells are less am isotropic so

694
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:21,269
you're affecting the an isotropy as well

695
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:23,819
as the elongation rate so one question

696
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:25,230
that came up in the literature based on

697
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:28,200
this observation is whether or not

698
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:30,990
elastic asymmetry is actually enough on

699
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,819
its own to drive an isotropic growth in

700
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:34,890
the night mikado so if you just pretend

701
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:37,659
that cellulose and isotropy doesn't

702
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:40,780
exist if you just have

703
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:42,690
differ than you do axial walls is that

704
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:44,680
enough to give you an isotropic growth

705
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:46,450
so we've done a little bit of

706
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,830
computational modeling with Henrik

707
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,539
Johnson's group at the Saints Barre lab

708
00:26:47,829 --> 00:26:52,119
in Cambridge to ask this question and

709
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:54,819
again all the assumptions that get into

710
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:56,889
your model change perhaps what your

711
00:26:54,819 --> 00:27:00,069
outcomes will be but it looks like in

712
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:01,870
our hands if you take this we're doing

713
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:04,299
this with a finite element method model

714
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:06,699
so we can prescribe material properties

715
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:09,279
to the different cell walls we can say

716
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:11,590
you should be more elastic or less

717
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,509
elastic than these other Direction walls

718
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:15,399
and ask then if we simulate growth what

719
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:20,349
happens and it's using a modified

720
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:21,580
Lockhart model so what happens we

721
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:24,429
measured about a two-fold difference

722
00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:27,399
between the transverse and axial walls

723
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:29,620
and elasticity if we add that in the

724
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,390
thing just balloons so that twofold

725
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:33,789
difference in elasticity is not enough

726
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:35,980
and maybe you know we're not getting the

727
00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:37,899
true measurement who knows but if you

728
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:41,049
pump it up to a hundred full difference

729
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,400
it is enough to give you an isotropy so

730
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:45,909
what you're looking at for the colors

731
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:50,410
here are how anisotropic this strain or

732
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:52,210
growth is and in this case the direction

733
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:55,029
of the an isotropy is shown here with

734
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:57,279
the white lines so with no nothing just

735
00:27:55,029 --> 00:28:00,039
everybody's all the same you end up

736
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:02,220
growing more in width but if you do this

737
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:04,389
hundred fold difference in elasticity

738
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,190
between these walls and these walls then

739
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:07,000
you can get some anisotropic growth but

740
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:09,190
we think that's probably pretty

741
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,930
unrealistic and it's pretty unrealistic

742
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:12,490
to believe that pectin would be the only

743
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:14,830
thing than controlling anisotropy

744
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:19,150
especially since we know that cellulose

745
00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:21,159
is important so what we did next is we

746
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:24,100
simulated some an isotropy from

747
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:26,769
cellulose and in the hypocotyl it's not

748
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:28,839
straightforward in the way that it is in

749
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:31,480
paul green's original work in nutella

750
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:33,579
so in those instances you have cellulose

751
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,650
fibers wrapping around the girth of the

752
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:37,990
cell and that is meant to restrict

753
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:39,519
expansion and width but if you can allow

754
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:41,769
those fibers to slip a part you can

755
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:43,119
facilitate growth in length and that's

756
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:46,240
this canonical way of controlling

757
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:47,919
anisotropy in some organs that tends to

758
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,750
be true and some species that tends to

759
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,160
be true or remember we're looking at the

760
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:53,109
epidermis here

761
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,670
in a rabbit obsess the epidermis doesn't

762
00:28:53,109 --> 00:28:57,309
show really strong alignment of

763
00:28:54,670 --> 00:29:00,100
cellulose what we know now is that the

764
00:28:57,309 --> 00:29:01,720
cortex shows pretty strong alignment so

765
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:04,569
what we've done in these simulations is

766
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,279
not say that the epidermis itself has to

767
00:29:04,569 --> 00:29:08,319
have that material cellulose and

768
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:11,079
isotropy we're just providing it either

769
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:13,329
from the interface of these cells or

770
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:16,389
actually what you'll see next is from

771
00:29:13,329 --> 00:29:18,759
inside layers of tissue so no matter

772
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:21,160
where that information comes from what

773
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:22,990
happens is that you get anisotropic

774
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,960
growth when you have cellulose and

775
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:27,609
isotropy that's good but if you add on

776
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,190
this twofold difference in wall

777
00:29:27,609 --> 00:29:32,319
elasticity you actually get more in it's

778
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:34,870
a triplet growth it's stronger

779
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:37,990
anisotropy and it's faster so you can

780
00:29:34,869 --> 00:29:40,479
sort of see that here this is with the

781
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:43,180
twofold elastic asymmetry added this is

782
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,559
before growth and after growth you can

783
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:47,799
see the cylinders a little bit longer

784
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:50,559
and the degree of anisotropy is a little

785
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:53,409
bit higher and it's even more profound

786
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:55,659
if you simulate internal and isotropy

787
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:57,779
but again these numbers are kind of just

788
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:00,880
made-up but again you see that

789
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:02,710
additional thing and so what we think is

790
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,630
that this pectin asymmetry in the in the

791
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,340
epidermis it's not the only thing

792
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:08,950
controlling and isotropy but it's

793
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:10,179
helping and isotropy to happen it's

794
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:12,880
helping that grouse to happen a little

795
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:14,320
bit faster and it's making sure that

796
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,360
you're those walls are elongated a

797
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:18,339
little bit faster than these transverse

798
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:21,869
walls and that could be a really

799
00:30:18,339 --> 00:30:25,000
important developmental advantage okay

800
00:30:21,869 --> 00:30:26,979
so obviously we want to know what

801
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,450
regulates that ant isotropy and I don't

802
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,220
have an answer for you today but we're

803
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:32,500
looking at some cytoskeletal dynamics

804
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,630
and delivery and ENSO cytosis and

805
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,609
exercise ptosis balance but also some of

806
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:38,970
these other modifying enzymes where do

807
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:41,049
they get delivered where they activated

808
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:42,400
but we might also be interested in

809
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:45,099
whether or not the regulation of an

810
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,080
isotropy can actually be functional so

811
00:30:45,099 --> 00:30:49,329
why would you want to get out of the

812
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:53,109
ground faster I mean it seems to make a

813
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:54,639
lot of sense but let's see okay so let's

814
00:30:53,109 --> 00:30:56,649
go to the second point which is looking

815
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:01,420
at modulation of anisotropy and growth

816
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:03,970
plasticity so this little guy has to be

817
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,090
long get out of the soil it makes sense

818
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,319
you might want to do that

819
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:08,929
right because then you can

820
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:10,490
photosynthesize sooner you establish

821
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:13,400
yourself maybe you beat some neighbors

822
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:15,230
out of you shade competition you get out

823
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:18,140
faster or you establish yourself

824
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:19,640
everything's better for you but there's

825
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,650
a lot of environmental variability that

826
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,780
they're dealing with so what kind of

827
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:26,120
soil do they have to go through does the

828
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:28,250
compaction of the soil change whether

829
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:31,819
you'd want to go thin and fast or fat

830
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:34,039
and slow um how much carbon and other

831
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:35,599
nutrients are available to you and and

832
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:36,829
maybe you want to respond to that in a

833
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:38,839
different way and so there's all these

834
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:41,389
complicating factors that go into saying

835
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:44,809
well maybe being faster isn't always

836
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:46,820
better and so what we noticed in the lab

837
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:49,849
is that if you grow a rabbit up this is

838
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:52,970
very very natural if you grow rabbit off

839
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:55,639
this on plates with sucrose their

840
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:58,130
anisotropy is actually different so what

841
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:00,650
it looks like in this video is that

842
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:02,150
these are shorter they're slower and

843
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:03,970
they're shorter and that's kind of you

844
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:06,650
would think well maybe that's a bad idea

845
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:08,299
but when we calculated their volume and

846
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:10,340
their volumetric growth what we saw is

847
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:11,450
that it was identical so they're growing

848
00:32:10,339 --> 00:32:13,099
the same amount

849
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:15,440
they're just Patricia nning that

850
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:18,679
photography English I don't have an

851
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,809
excuse but they're giving less growth in

852
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,580
length and a little bit more in width so

853
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:24,710
the volume maintains but they're

854
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:26,990
Patricia partitioning I just stop saying

855
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,940
that where it is different in lengths

856
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:33,950
and widths so when you have sucrose

857
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:35,539
you're less anisotropic okay so I can

858
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:37,610
tell you that this is not based on

859
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:38,899
ethylene which is a possibility so

860
00:32:37,609 --> 00:32:40,250
you'll know that the triple response

861
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:43,550
involves you getting really short and

862
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:47,539
really fat but if we do this in the ACS

863
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:49,129
ethylene synthesis octuple mutant you

864
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:50,389
still get this response so it's not

865
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:53,210
dependent on there being ethylene

866
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:55,910
present which is that good control and

867
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:58,220
it also happens no matter what kind of

868
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:59,870
sugar you throw on it so we're looking

869
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:02,269
at the aunt isotropy index so this will

870
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:03,769
be the ratio of length to width and you

871
00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:05,869
can see normally they're way longer than

872
00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:07,579
they are wide when you put them on

873
00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:09,439
sucrose that drops because they're

874
00:33:07,579 --> 00:33:11,179
getting fatter and it happens if you

875
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,009
have sucrose glucose dextrose fructose

876
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:15,720
galactose trealose

877
00:33:14,009 --> 00:33:18,269
so it doesn't appear to be specific to

878
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,339
any one carbon source and the other

879
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:22,289
interesting thing is that if you chop

880
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:25,558
off the cotyledons we're turning dodging

881
00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:28,200
a source of carbon you mimic the low

882
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:29,940
sucrose condition and if you add little

883
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,240
grains of sand back on top to be a

884
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:34,410
weight that doesn't rescue it so it's

885
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,029
not as if it's because they're lighter

886
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:37,470
they grow faster we think it really is

887
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:40,619
something to do with the availability of

888
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:43,140
carbon and you can rescue that caught a

889
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:45,058
lead and remove all non sucrose mimic by

890
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:48,270
actually adding sucrose back in lanolin

891
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:49,940
to the tip so it looks like it's that

892
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:52,829
carbon source that's really important

893
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:55,590
now what we don't know is how this is

894
00:33:52,829 --> 00:33:57,089
being sensed so but there is something

895
00:33:55,589 --> 00:34:00,689
there that's changing this anisotropic

896
00:33:57,089 --> 00:34:03,209
ratio so we can see this at a cellular

897
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:04,529
level as well so this is the zero

898
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:06,539
percent sucrose you can see that

899
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:08,070
increase in lengths of these this is

900
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:10,800
just looking at one cell in the base

901
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:13,409
over time you're seeing less growth in

902
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,210
length and also widths remember you

903
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:17,220
don't really see much of a wave in width

904
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:18,750
in the normal condition but you're

905
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:21,118
seeing a little bit of a wave now here

906
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:22,949
when you have this sucrose so you're all

907
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,780
of a sudden the width birth rate is

908
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:26,489
getting regulated perhaps by that same

909
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:29,970
accra pedal wave so there's an

910
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:32,128
interesting shift there are there cell

911
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:35,009
wall changes and maybe they're related

912
00:34:32,128 --> 00:34:38,608
to pectin that's probably why I'm here

913
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:41,310
so again these can be really different

914
00:34:38,608 --> 00:34:43,889
difficult to quantitate so we're doing

915
00:34:41,309 --> 00:34:45,898
our best but this is immuno for the LM

916
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:47,429
20 remember that's the softer pectin

917
00:34:45,898 --> 00:34:50,069
what we respect to be more fluid and

918
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:51,869
what we can see is that in the 3 percent

919
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:54,179
sucrose case we're starting to get more

920
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:56,399
signal at these transverse walls than we

921
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:59,010
ever had before it's basically like an

922
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:00,269
empty column in the zero-percent and now

923
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:02,730
we're getting some on these transverse

924
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:04,590
walls so the ratio between the two is

925
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:07,170
getting closer to one so you're getting

926
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:08,760
more soft pectin on that wall that's now

927
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:12,170
elongating a bit more and giving you

928
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:15,000
that shift to width growth over length

929
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:16,889
so you get more methylated home electron

930
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,179
into the transverse walls and the

931
00:35:16,889 --> 00:35:19,739
converse is also true with the

932
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:22,019
demethylated pectin although it's really

933
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:24,019
a little bit less obvious quantitatively

934
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:27,269
we can see this but the quantifications

935
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:27,769
again a grain of salt we're getting a

936
00:35:27,269 --> 00:35:30,739
shift

937
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:32,358
away from those transverse walls so

938
00:35:30,739 --> 00:35:34,429
you're getting less rigid packed in

939
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:35,929
there more soft pectin which might

940
00:35:34,429 --> 00:35:40,190
relate to why you're getting that width

941
00:35:35,929 --> 00:35:42,079
growth so you don't normally get so we

942
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:44,480
can see an interesting effect when we

943
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,789
look with the AFM I forgot to change the

944
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,088
title that literally makes no sense but

945
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:52,130
we can call it figure seven okay so if

946
00:35:50,088 --> 00:35:53,960
you do the AFM again these are the basal

947
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:56,690
cells that are elongating what you'll

948
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,670
see is that these look more rigid than

949
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:00,260
the zero percent sucrose you can also

950
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:02,030
see they're a bit fatter than these

951
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:04,250
which makes sense given the measurements

952
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:06,200
I've shown you but it also looks like

953
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:08,000
we're getting rid of that ratio that

954
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:10,009
difference between transverse and axial

955
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,769
walls and so here's just some

956
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:14,720
quantification of that so this is the

957
00:36:12,769 --> 00:36:16,009
zero percent case where you see that

958
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:17,868
difference and there's less of a

959
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:20,089
difference here and also everybody's

960
00:36:17,869 --> 00:36:22,579
more rigid so here's the ratio of the

961
00:36:20,088 --> 00:36:25,429
transverse to axial which normally

962
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:26,659
favors stiffer axial transverse walls

963
00:36:25,429 --> 00:36:28,909
and here we've kind of gotten rid of

964
00:36:26,659 --> 00:36:30,199
that well so this is kind of weird

965
00:36:28,909 --> 00:36:32,929
though because now I'm showing you that

966
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:34,549
the cell walls are stiffer but we know

967
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:37,309
they're still growing volumetrically the

968
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:38,800
same so if my walls are stiffer how do I

969
00:36:37,309 --> 00:36:41,059
still end up growing the same amount

970
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,339
even though it's proportioned a little

971
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:45,440
bit differently and so that was puzzling

972
00:36:43,338 --> 00:36:48,049
to us and so we went in and asked well

973
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,670
is the pressure any different and so

974
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:52,190
we're estimating pressure here based on

975
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:54,500
plasmolysis point so it's not a perfect

976
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:56,269
method but it's what we have and what

977
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,889
you can see is that in three percent

978
00:36:56,269 --> 00:36:59,509
sucrose the pressure is actually higher

979
00:36:57,889 --> 00:37:03,170
in cells at the base when they're

980
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:05,390
growing so the walls may be stiffer but

981
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:07,460
they balance that out somehow by

982
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:09,440
regulating their pressure so that the

983
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:11,300
pressure - wall stiffness ratio is still

984
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,670
facilitating the same amount of growth

985
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:15,619
and that's something again there's an

986
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:18,980
interesting feedback there that we're

987
00:37:15,619 --> 00:37:20,300
not sure how it's happening you can you

988
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,849
can get that kind of dynamic actually

989
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,019
out of a classical Lockhart model and

990
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:25,789
we're doing some modeling to look at

991
00:37:24,019 --> 00:37:29,800
that but it's unclear what the actual

992
00:37:25,789 --> 00:37:32,400
mechanism might be in this case so

993
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:36,250
maybe you're interested in oxen because

994
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:39,039
it's plants so and we know that change

995
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:40,300
is impacting can be affected by oxen so

996
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:41,980
we're looking a little bit at oxen

997
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,650
transporters and this is an example of

998
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:47,019
pin three so these are auxin efflux

999
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:48,760
carriers and so they can change the

1000
00:37:47,019 --> 00:37:50,650
direction of oxen flow depending on

1001
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,080
their polarity and so in the

1002
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:54,970
zero-percent sucrose case what we get is

1003
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:56,319
something that's sort of not very polar

1004
00:37:54,969 --> 00:37:58,419
at all it's sort of around the whole

1005
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,190
cell but maybe here you can see it's a

1006
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:02,380
little bit stronger signal on the

1007
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:04,960
transverse walls and we've done a bit of

1008
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,910
quantification here so you have more

1009
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,710
signal on transverse walls than you do

1010
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:10,480
the axial elongating walls with sucrose

1011
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:14,349
which means you end up with something

1012
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:16,750
like this so you should have more pin3

1013
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:19,869
on these membranes which will drive more

1014
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:22,000
flow across those walls to get more oxen

1015
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:23,500
flow across those transverse walls and

1016
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,309
we think that's facilitating their

1017
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:29,019
growth perhaps through acid growths and

1018
00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:30,340
this is impaired in up in three mutants

1019
00:38:29,019 --> 00:38:31,860
which is good it's always nice to have

1020
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:35,320
mutants

1021
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:36,880
so are there pH changes we might expect

1022
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,890
that if there's more ox and flow across

1023
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,720
that transverse wall that maybe we're

1024
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:44,859
going to see a drop in pH if you believe

1025
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:48,099
acid growth and so we've been using this

1026
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:50,530
a profusion fluorescent protein system

1027
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:54,039
and so what happens is you have our F P

1028
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:56,380
which is pH insensitive and GFP which is

1029
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:58,509
pH sensitive and you look at the ratio

1030
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:00,130
between the two because they're both

1031
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:01,840
produced by the same contract and they

1032
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:04,660
go to the same April plastic space in

1033
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:06,370
this case and you say what is the ratio

1034
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:07,869
between green and red and that should

1035
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:10,420
tell you something about the pH of the

1036
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:14,440
system because this will get lower when

1037
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:15,909
you have more acidic pH and so our rough

1038
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,030
estimates again this is sort of

1039
00:39:15,909 --> 00:39:21,549
preliminary is that the pH ratio between

1040
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:24,370
the transverse and axial walls sort of

1041
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:26,680
is dropping in the 1.5 percent sucrose

1042
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:28,960
and we sort of look at that as meaning

1043
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:30,969
that we're getting lower pH on those

1044
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,860
walls where more oxen is predicted to be

1045
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:35,349
flowing across so we think there's some

1046
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:37,510
acid growth change that's giving this

1047
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:41,199
difference in width versus length and

1048
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:42,950
this is impaired in proton pump mutants

1049
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:44,838
but also if you add then kind of ice

1050
00:39:42,949 --> 00:39:49,899
which is an inhibitor of these proton

1051
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:53,088
pumps okay so the summary of this part

1052
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:55,639
goes like this we think that there's

1053
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:58,009
this change in pectin octane polar

1054
00:39:55,639 --> 00:40:00,920
transport of auxin that changes the pH

1055
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:02,780
we think that's doing something probably

1056
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,690
2 p.m. YZ and PM e is on those

1057
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:07,579
transverse walls we also have some hints

1058
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:09,559
that xyla glucan structure is changing a

1059
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:11,329
little bit on these walls as well and it

1060
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:13,429
could be activating other enzymes like

1061
00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:16,519
expansions which we know are canonically

1062
00:40:13,429 --> 00:40:18,139
activated by changes in pH but then that

1063
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:20,389
result is we think these transverse

1064
00:40:18,139 --> 00:40:22,519
walls in the sucrose condition are

1065
00:40:20,389 --> 00:40:23,960
growing a little bit faster than they

1066
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:26,690
normally would which gives you this

1067
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:29,720
slightly slower growing high picado it's

1068
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:31,099
getting a little bit fatter but if you

1069
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,809
remember I was kind of interested in

1070
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:34,010
whether it mattered that you were a

1071
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:37,279
little bit slower and a little bit

1072
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:39,050
fatter does anybody care so we designed

1073
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,060
some tests to look at this and again

1074
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:43,240
we're just starting to do this and so

1075
00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:45,259
we're looking at success of emergence

1076
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:47,598
because you could imagine just being

1077
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:49,160
faster again it's awesome because you

1078
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,230
get out and you start photosynthesizing

1079
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:52,519
and you were the winner but if you have

1080
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:54,920
different substrates that might not be

1081
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:56,900
true and these are not the best

1082
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:59,750
substrates but it's what we had at the

1083
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:01,700
time so we're using coarse sand and fine

1084
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:03,079
sand so you have different particle

1085
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:05,629
sizes that you have to navigate through

1086
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:07,490
but the thickness of the layer on top of

1087
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:10,160
the seeds on the plate is the same and

1088
00:41:07,489 --> 00:41:11,779
we orient the seeds so they're already

1089
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:15,078
ready to go up they don't have to do any

1090
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:17,240
weird turning and this is the sort of

1091
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:20,210
thing that we see so when you have

1092
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:22,519
coarse sands the skinny fast one

1093
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:25,220
actually does a little bit better but

1094
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:28,759
when you have fine sand the fats low one

1095
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:30,169
does a little bit better so the idea

1096
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,210
would be that it's not always

1097
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:34,519
advantageous to be fast it's not always

1098
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:36,409
advantageous to be slow but somehow if

1099
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:38,300
you can sense you know sensing your

1100
00:41:36,409 --> 00:41:40,789
environment and the carbon availability

1101
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:43,280
allows you to change this and isotropy

1102
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:44,599
and you may be a little bit more

1103
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,430
successful than your friends but it's

1104
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:47,838
obviously pretty complicated matrix of

1105
00:41:46,429 --> 00:41:50,289
interactions that we're just starting to

1106
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,289
explore

1107
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:54,389
so I'm very quickly gonna tell you a

1108
00:41:52,139 --> 00:41:55,769
little bit about pectin gel mechanics

1109
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:57,299
cuz I've been kind of going through and

1110
00:41:55,769 --> 00:41:59,099
telling you oh well pectin gel is really

1111
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,140
important and if it's stiffer that's

1112
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:02,940
changes growth but we want to know a

1113
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:07,109
little bit more about that as a material

1114
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:11,250
so what does that actually mean so how

1115
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:13,470
do you translate from this to the actual

1116
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:15,960
wall structure and the way we've been

1117
00:42:13,469 --> 00:42:18,209
doing this is by really pulling stuff

1118
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,250
way out of the plant system and just

1119
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:23,190
making some synthetic materials and

1120
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:27,179
testing them so first I'll show you some

1121
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:29,940
pure pectin gels and we've developed

1122
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:32,969
another test with the AFM so you will

1123
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:34,889
probably be familiar with creep tests so

1124
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:36,449
these are classical tests that we're

1125
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:38,879
done where you took like a section of

1126
00:42:36,449 --> 00:42:40,049
high picado usually and you clamp it at

1127
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,940
one end and you throw a weight on the

1128
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:44,760
other end and you just measure the

1129
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:46,889
deformation over time so instead of

1130
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,990
these really fast elastic responses that

1131
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:50,609
I've been talking about all along what

1132
00:42:48,989 --> 00:42:52,739
we wanted to do is actually look at the

1133
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,210
way that the material flowed because

1134
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:58,349
maybe that's a little bit closer to

1135
00:42:54,210 --> 00:43:00,389
growth than an elastic band so a good

1136
00:42:58,349 --> 00:43:01,409
viscoelastic material to think about

1137
00:43:00,389 --> 00:43:03,629
which is essentially what we're testing

1138
00:43:01,409 --> 00:43:05,099
here as a memory foam mattress which I

1139
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:08,849
got to sleep on last night Thank You

1140
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:10,108
Adrian so when you get in it you sink a

1141
00:43:08,849 --> 00:43:12,269
little bit over time so there's some

1142
00:43:10,108 --> 00:43:14,069
time dependence in your deformation and

1143
00:43:12,269 --> 00:43:16,619
when you get off at least when I get off

1144
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:18,660
it takes a while to come back up but it

1145
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:21,559
does come back up so there's this time

1146
00:43:18,659 --> 00:43:24,420
delay that might be a little bit more

1147
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:26,429
realistically related to growth and so

1148
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:28,260
the classical creep experiment involves

1149
00:43:26,429 --> 00:43:30,329
a weight on a whole organ and we've

1150
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:34,170
simply miniaturized that using the AFM

1151
00:43:30,329 --> 00:43:36,119
so we push and hold a force and ask how

1152
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:37,950
the material relaxes away from that so

1153
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:39,809
that's stress relaxation you can push

1154
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:41,539
and hold the deformation there's a

1155
00:43:39,809 --> 00:43:43,920
couple different ways to do it but

1156
00:43:41,539 --> 00:43:46,949
essentially you're asking about that

1157
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:49,500
time deformation that happens and then

1158
00:43:46,949 --> 00:43:50,789
we take the data that we get and we put

1159
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,679
it through a couple of different really

1160
00:43:50,789 --> 00:43:53,969
basic material models but this one works

1161
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:56,099
pretty well it's what we call a standard

1162
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:58,319
linear solid you have elasticity from

1163
00:43:56,099 --> 00:44:01,019
these Springs and you have the viscous

1164
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:03,000
flow from these dashpots like a plunger

1165
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:03,780
and a syringe and you can get parameters

1166
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,570
for these different

1167
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:11,220
out of your bottoms so when we do this

1168
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:12,840
in pectin gels what do we see so what we

1169
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:15,359
have here are pectin gels that have

1170
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:18,420
different amounts of methylation so this

1171
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:20,550
is 33% methylated so a lot of that is

1172
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:22,110
available to calcium cross-linked and

1173
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:23,850
what we can see is that instantaneous

1174
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:26,760
stiffness which is analogous to the

1175
00:44:23,849 --> 00:44:29,039
indentation modulus earlier is high so

1176
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,020
the less methylation you have the more

1177
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:33,690
pectin calcium cross-links you can make

1178
00:44:31,019 --> 00:44:35,159
the stiffer you come that is good that's

1179
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:36,809
what we would predict it's also what's

1180
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:39,269
been predicted from food science

1181
00:44:36,809 --> 00:44:42,329
rheology for a long time this is not new

1182
00:44:39,269 --> 00:44:43,769
but what we have done is taken gels that

1183
00:44:42,329 --> 00:44:46,590
have different percentages of

1184
00:44:43,769 --> 00:44:48,239
methylation so for example here half of

1185
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:52,110
it is methylated and you can see it's a

1186
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:54,539
lot softer and something in between it's

1187
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:56,519
not a linear relationship we've taken it

1188
00:44:54,539 --> 00:45:00,750
another step further and we've remade an

1189
00:44:56,519 --> 00:45:02,909
average 41% demethylation by missing 33

1190
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:05,309
and 50 and we can see that it's not

1191
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:08,579
quite the same as when the average is

1192
00:45:05,309 --> 00:45:10,259
actually 41 so you could imagine in a

1193
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:12,299
cell wall it's not just that every

1194
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:15,090
single hem electron and chain has

1195
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,650
exactly 50% methylation but you might

1196
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:18,930
have some that have 70 and some that

1197
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:20,610
have 30 and what we find is that those

1198
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:23,599
synergistic combination of those things

1199
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:26,150
change the material properties as well

1200
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,289
but what about the viscoelasticity

1201
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:30,840
so what we can pull out of this is

1202
00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:32,279
something called relaxation time and i

1203
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:34,200
think what i'm going to show you is is

1204
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:37,080
not the relaxation time but i will tell

1205
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:39,480
you that what happens is that the gels

1206
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:41,670
are less stiff the more methylation you

1207
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,679
have but they're also less viscous so

1208
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:46,200
they're less thick they flow better and

1209
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:48,569
if it makes sense that growth you might

1210
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:51,359
want your material to be more elastic

1211
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:52,710
but also have a bit more flow in it and

1212
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,360
so the way that we look at this the

1213
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:56,280
easiest way to look at this from the

1214
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:59,550
models is actually to look at the ratio

1215
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:02,910
of elasticity to viscosity and so

1216
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:04,830
because the elasticity changes in order

1217
00:46:02,909 --> 00:46:06,989
for that ratio to remain constant you

1218
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:09,420
have to have the viscosity changing in

1219
00:46:06,989 --> 00:46:11,219
the opposite manner and so we end up

1220
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:14,010
knowing that as you're pectin

1221
00:46:11,219 --> 00:46:15,869
methylation goes down so you have more

1222
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:17,470
available for cross links you get

1223
00:46:15,869 --> 00:46:20,319
stiffer and you flow less

1224
00:46:17,469 --> 00:46:22,149
can we see that in a plant so we go back

1225
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:25,000
to this case where we have more rigid

1226
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:27,070
transverse walls and more elastic axial

1227
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,849
walls and we do these viscoelastic creep

1228
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:32,410
tests there too and what we can see is

1229
00:46:29,849 --> 00:46:34,539
that we do see a difference in

1230
00:46:32,409 --> 00:46:37,299
elasticity from our model but also in

1231
00:46:34,539 --> 00:46:39,279
flow so pectin chemistry doesn't just

1232
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:40,510
affect elasticity it's also affecting

1233
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,060
the ability of the material to flow

1234
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:45,580
which may be more related to growth but

1235
00:46:43,059 --> 00:46:49,119
we'll see we still have to show that

1236
00:46:45,579 --> 00:46:50,799
that is actually true okay the last

1237
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,150
thing we don't have very much data on

1238
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,910
yet is we're starting to build more

1239
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:57,220
complex materials and so to do this we

1240
00:46:54,909 --> 00:46:58,809
use cellulose from this bacterial glue

1241
00:46:57,219 --> 00:47:00,879
can acetobacter zile Ennis that makes

1242
00:46:58,809 --> 00:47:02,710
cellulose outside its body we take that

1243
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,110
cellulose and add in other cell wall

1244
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:06,670
components so that the architecture

1245
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:08,710
isn't going to be the same exactly as a

1246
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:10,389
cell wall but hopefully we can get some

1247
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:12,909
information from it and then we just

1248
00:47:10,389 --> 00:47:14,379
test these big hunks of material for

1249
00:47:12,909 --> 00:47:15,849
their material properties and we can

1250
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:19,240
control them a bit better than we can

1251
00:47:15,849 --> 00:47:21,579
say in a mutant in a rabbit offsets so

1252
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:23,289
here's a very brief example of some of

1253
00:47:21,579 --> 00:47:25,239
the things that change if you have

1254
00:47:23,289 --> 00:47:27,730
cellulose cellulose was pectin cellulose

1255
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:29,739
enzyme glue can you get differences in

1256
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:31,659
the weight so the hydration which makes

1257
00:47:29,739 --> 00:47:34,089
sense pectins a little bit wetter can

1258
00:47:31,659 --> 00:47:35,469
hold more water you get changes in the

1259
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:37,180
depths of the material

1260
00:47:35,469 --> 00:47:39,789
so actually xyla glue can looks like

1261
00:47:37,179 --> 00:47:41,889
it's really linking things more tightly

1262
00:47:39,789 --> 00:47:43,449
so proportionally of the same amount of

1263
00:47:41,889 --> 00:47:45,129
cellulose and all these gels it's just

1264
00:47:43,449 --> 00:47:47,289
that you're getting a thinner material

1265
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:48,940
because the xyla glue can and we have

1266
00:47:47,289 --> 00:47:50,110
some difference in young's modulus as

1267
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:52,420
well but we're just starting to explore

1268
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:53,980
this and what we're hoping is by Chris

1269
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:56,200
Eisley controlling the components in the

1270
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:58,179
wall we might get a better idea of

1271
00:47:56,199 --> 00:48:03,039
what's actually happening in a plant so

1272
00:47:58,179 --> 00:48:05,289
well my last slide going very long is

1273
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:08,170
that we're starting to be able to do AFM

1274
00:48:05,289 --> 00:48:09,279
based mechanical measures on sections so

1275
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:11,590
if you remember everything I've showed

1276
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,910
you is from the epidermis but all those

1277
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:14,079
tissue layers are connected to each

1278
00:48:12,909 --> 00:48:16,210
other and so you might want to know

1279
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,069
something about internal cells and their

1280
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:20,559
mechanics and so what I'm showing you

1281
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:22,450
right now is the Miscanthus stem cryo

1282
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:25,029
sections they haven't gone through any

1283
00:48:22,449 --> 00:48:27,579
fixation at all or in bedding except in

1284
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:29,950
OCT media and right now we're just

1285
00:48:27,579 --> 00:48:30,828
looking at vascular bundles because

1286
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,879
those are

1287
00:48:30,829 --> 00:48:34,009
obviously going to be really

1288
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:35,809
mechanically different it's a good place

1289
00:48:34,009 --> 00:48:38,449
to start but we're hoping to be able to

1290
00:48:35,809 --> 00:48:40,009
look at primary cell walls as well that

1291
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:42,858
don't have these really rigid polymers

1292
00:48:40,009 --> 00:48:44,778
to but so you can see here the phloem is

1293
00:48:42,858 --> 00:48:46,728
softer than the sieve elements which are

1294
00:48:44,778 --> 00:48:48,739
softer than the xylem that makes a lot

1295
00:48:46,728 --> 00:48:51,018
of sense and we can see some interesting

1296
00:48:48,739 --> 00:48:52,699
differences between sieve elements and

1297
00:48:51,018 --> 00:48:56,088
companion cells here within the phloem

1298
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:57,588
as well and so this um we can relate

1299
00:48:56,088 --> 00:48:59,989
this to some interesting Galacta

1300
00:48:57,588 --> 00:49:02,298
epitopes as well through work with Paul

1301
00:48:59,989 --> 00:49:03,228
Knox and that'll be coming out in plant

1302
00:49:02,298 --> 00:49:05,329
fizz

1303
00:49:03,228 --> 00:49:07,009
but it just shows you that if you keep

1304
00:49:05,329 --> 00:49:08,959
pushing the method hopefully we can

1305
00:49:07,009 --> 00:49:11,318
start asking even more questions and not

1306
00:49:08,958 --> 00:49:14,018
just relying only on the epidermis so

1307
00:49:11,318 --> 00:49:15,170
hopefully you'll do that when you do

1308
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:16,788
okay

1309
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:17,959
most of this pretty much all of this

1310
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:20,660
work that I've talked about today was

1311
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:23,268
done at the lab in Cambridge but as it

1312
00:49:20,659 --> 00:49:25,478
removed as Adrienne mentioned we're now

1313
00:49:23,268 --> 00:49:28,548
at UCLA so we're continuing the work

1314
00:49:25,478 --> 00:49:30,379
these are the people who did it um two

1315
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:33,259
postdocs for us to do here and Tom

1316
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:36,199
Toyota and two PhD students JJ 10 and

1317
00:49:33,259 --> 00:49:38,539
Louie Kaplan so material scientist and

1318
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:39,709
mathematician while biochemists and cell

1319
00:49:38,539 --> 00:49:42,019
biologists it's a really

1320
00:49:39,708 --> 00:50:04,818
interdisciplinary effort and that's our

1321
00:49:42,018 --> 00:50:06,258
money thanks very much so the questions

1322
00:50:04,818 --> 00:50:07,699
about the atomic force measurements and

1323
00:50:06,259 --> 00:50:09,528
whether we're doing in a constant

1324
00:50:07,699 --> 00:50:11,900
deformation it's really difficult to do

1325
00:50:09,528 --> 00:50:13,068
that with the way the machines work so

1326
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:16,548
you actually have to do with a constant

1327
00:50:13,068 --> 00:50:19,788
force so there so when we do the creep

1328
00:50:16,548 --> 00:50:27,498
tests we are choosing forces that give

1329
00:50:19,789 --> 00:50:30,289
us the same deformation yes so in the

1330
00:50:27,498 --> 00:50:32,509
plants what we tend to do and again this

1331
00:50:30,289 --> 00:50:35,599
is really hand wavy we tend to say well

1332
00:50:32,509 --> 00:50:37,909
we want an indentation depth that's no

1333
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:40,278
more than 5% of the depth of say the

1334
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:43,399
wall because we want to make sure we're

1335
00:50:40,278 --> 00:50:44,389
so in an elastic regime but it's really

1336
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,430
hand wavy

1337
00:50:44,389 --> 00:50:48,108
because most of the rules that have been

1338
00:50:46,429 --> 00:50:50,449
used to model and determine these

1339
00:50:48,108 --> 00:50:53,778
parameters from these experiments are

1340
00:50:50,449 --> 00:50:56,750
with solid materials and plant cell

1341
00:50:53,778 --> 00:50:58,489
walls are cellular solids and so there's

1342
00:50:56,750 --> 00:51:01,568
some complicated geometry that goes into

1343
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:05,719
it so generally we try and get you know

1344
00:51:01,568 --> 00:51:07,190
either 5% of the depth of the wall or 5%

1345
00:51:05,719 --> 00:51:09,679
of the depth of the cell depending on

1346
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:11,838
the type of experiment but one of the

1347
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:14,389
things we're doing now is sticking an

1348
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:16,670
AFM and appealed epidermal layer on top

1349
00:51:14,389 --> 00:51:18,618
of an inverted confocal and actually

1350
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:22,028
looking at what the deformation if this

1351
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:24,048
out looks like under AFM and it's not as

1352
00:51:22,028 --> 00:51:42,559
beautiful and straightforward as a

1353
00:51:24,048 --> 00:51:44,420
Hertzian model would want you to yeah so

1354
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,970
for the gels we've done this a little

1355
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:49,099
bit more carefully so because the def

1356
00:51:46,969 --> 00:51:52,068
for me because it's a finite it's a

1357
00:51:49,099 --> 00:51:54,140
continuous media and so you can look at

1358
00:51:52,068 --> 00:51:55,670
if you increase your indentation depth

1359
00:51:54,139 --> 00:51:57,440
or force you can look at the linearity

1360
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:59,539
of their response and things like this

1361
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,490
and the gels look pretty good I'm a

1362
00:51:59,539 --> 00:52:03,019
little bit worried about doing those

1363
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:04,669
kinds of experiments right now in plants

1364
00:52:03,018 --> 00:52:06,919
just because what we think is happening

1365
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:09,079
is at one point you'll deform a wall

1366
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:11,269
then you'll be deforming the whole wall

1367
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:12,920
then you'll be deforming those walls and

1368
00:52:11,268 --> 00:52:16,278
the cross walls and maybe the tissue

1369
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:17,480
underneath it and so it's not as

1370
00:52:16,278 --> 00:52:19,250
straightforward as you would expect

1371
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,690
based on simple material mechanics

1372
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:22,639
because you have that cellular

1373
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:30,230
architecture but we can talk about a bit

1374
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:33,018
after - how does the high picado know to

1375
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:35,269
go up so please correct me if I'm wrong

1376
00:52:33,018 --> 00:52:37,909
I believe it has to do with state'll

1377
00:52:35,268 --> 00:52:40,298
it's in the endodermis in the high

1378
00:52:37,909 --> 00:52:43,848
picado so there's gravity sensing starch

1379
00:52:40,298 --> 00:52:46,730
containing granules that change probably

1380
00:52:43,849 --> 00:52:55,190
oxen transport yeah and then keep it

1381
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:57,798
growing up one that follows what Brandis

1382
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:58,389
question was getting at it that is I

1383
00:52:57,798 --> 00:53:01,719
notice

1384
00:52:58,389 --> 00:53:05,828
that you had hot spots where the three

1385
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:08,048
anticlinal walls come together so that

1386
00:53:05,829 --> 00:53:11,920
makes perfect sense because you got more

1387
00:53:08,048 --> 00:53:14,500
solid material in that location and you

1388
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:17,700
have a poison effect kind of a

1389
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:21,159
mechanical constraint yeah okay so the

1390
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:26,500
question there is how do you compensate

1391
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:29,409
for that extent and the other not

1392
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:33,760
question but observation it's that you

1393
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:38,018
show that when you have more fine sand

1394
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:41,490
hmm the sucrose which causes an

1395
00:53:38,018 --> 00:53:44,979
expansion they're more successful

1396
00:53:41,489 --> 00:53:48,548
actually that makes sense because if you

1397
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:51,760
look at the circumferential expansion it

1398
00:53:48,548 --> 00:53:53,710
propagates a fracture okay so it's

1399
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,539
better at pushing through those grains

1400
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:56,740
which are more densely packed in the

1401
00:53:55,539 --> 00:54:00,760
fine grain thank you that's a very

1402
00:53:56,739 --> 00:54:02,919
that's very helpful I can go back to the

1403
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,569
first point which is and especially this

1404
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,818
has to do when you're doing sections as

1405
00:54:04,568 --> 00:54:08,880
well an AFM on section so you get these

1406
00:54:06,818 --> 00:54:13,869
sort of nice try Junction middle lamella

1407
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:16,028
areas where what everybody does right

1408
00:54:13,869 --> 00:54:18,190
now and whether or not that's a good

1409
00:54:16,028 --> 00:54:20,079
thing to do is they assume that you have

1410
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:21,608
an incompressible material and so all

1411
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:26,980
these equations you're using a Poisson

1412
00:54:21,608 --> 00:54:29,528
ratio of 0.5 so you make a lot of

1413
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:31,599
assumptions I think that and

1414
00:54:29,528 --> 00:54:33,969
indefinitely so the the wall that

1415
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:35,410
because that geometry becomes important

1416
00:54:33,969 --> 00:54:37,480
as well as you said because you have a

1417
00:54:35,409 --> 00:54:39,068
thicker amount of material it may appear

1418
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:42,548
stiffer because it has less room to move

1419
00:54:39,068 --> 00:54:44,469
in we haven't started doing that yet but

1420
00:54:42,548 --> 00:54:46,268
you could there's a lot of simulations

1421
00:54:44,469 --> 00:54:48,278
you can do simulated indentations and

1422
00:54:46,268 --> 00:54:51,729
finite element models which could be a

1423
00:54:48,278 --> 00:54:52,838
way for controlling for that yeah I

1424
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:55,690
think that's probably what we'll do so

1425
00:54:52,838 --> 00:54:58,778
we'll just make a section and indent on

1426
00:54:55,690 --> 00:55:02,289
it in in silico yeah this is one more

1427
00:54:58,778 --> 00:55:06,009
question that I was interested I assumed

1428
00:55:02,289 --> 00:55:07,390
and that when you're talking about

1429
00:55:06,009 --> 00:55:10,329
detectives you're talking about

1430
00:55:07,389 --> 00:55:12,099
detectives within this so question is

1431
00:55:10,329 --> 00:55:15,220
what is happening in the

1432
00:55:12,099 --> 00:55:17,639
or belly and the Galactic erotic assets

1433
00:55:15,219 --> 00:55:21,449
that are binding themselves together

1434
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:26,109
particularly where you have those three

1435
00:55:21,449 --> 00:55:29,109
junctions so yeah I can repeat the

1436
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:31,090
question so it's it's asking so I'm

1437
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:32,410
making some conclusions about pectin in

1438
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:34,329
the cell wall but I'm not making

1439
00:55:32,409 --> 00:55:35,949
distinctions between we're in the cell

1440
00:55:34,329 --> 00:55:37,900
while we're looking so the middle

1441
00:55:35,949 --> 00:55:39,789
lamella which is responsible for the

1442
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:42,639
adhesion of cells together is that

1443
00:55:39,789 --> 00:55:44,259
different than say the the proximal

1444
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:47,049
primary cell wall to the cell which may

1445
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:49,300
be more growth regulatory so our

1446
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:51,010
measurements right now haven't been fine

1447
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:54,010
enough to really tell us the difference

1448
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:57,190
between metal lamella and proximal like

1449
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:58,780
right next to the to the cell my postdoc

1450
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:01,869
for us is really interested in looking

1451
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:04,060
at cell adhesion and its maintenance and

1452
00:56:01,869 --> 00:56:06,369
so he started looking at some actin

1453
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:07,960
mutants that we can see have mechanical

1454
00:56:06,369 --> 00:56:10,359
differences but I'm hoping that this

1455
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:12,789
section technique really fine tips

1456
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:15,430
really fine scans might actually let us

1457
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:16,570
see differences in middle lamella versus

1458
00:56:15,429 --> 00:56:19,149
primary cell wall I think that's

1459
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:21,160
probably the best way to go in the

1460
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:23,889
galactica that's coming out and plant

1461
00:56:21,159 --> 00:56:25,449
phys we can see that there's in a single

1462
00:56:23,889 --> 00:56:27,879
wall in a sieve element there's a

1463
00:56:25,449 --> 00:56:29,529
gradient of binding of the antibody for

1464
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:31,599
Galacta and there's a gradient of

1465
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:32,950
mechanics across the wall so we're

1466
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:34,480
starting to be able to see that kind of

1467
00:56:32,949 --> 00:56:50,379
resolution but we don't really have the

1468
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:52,360
answers so the question is whether we've

1469
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:55,150
seen any change in plasmid is not a

1470
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:57,849
number size maybe even opening with

1471
00:56:55,150 --> 00:57:01,090
changes in pectin methylation and we

1472
00:56:57,849 --> 00:57:02,619
haven't looked so that is a bad answer

1473
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:04,240
for you but it is the answer so we

1474
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:06,549
haven't looked one might expect that the

1475
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:08,409
more rigid the gel gets maybe the less

1476
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:10,450
easy it is for plasma does not at a

1477
00:57:08,409 --> 00:57:12,730
dilate I know that there are people

1478
00:57:10,449 --> 00:57:13,839
looking at the kalos deposition and

1479
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:15,849
we've been doing some measurements for

1480
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:19,059
them and what calestous the material

1481
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:20,769
properties of the wall and because kalos

1482
00:57:19,059 --> 00:57:21,460
accumulation may be you know more better

1483
00:57:20,769 --> 00:57:23,409
than I do

1484
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:25,309
callus accumulation around plasmodesmata

1485
00:57:23,409 --> 00:57:29,179
can really restrict also

1486
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:30,949
their dilation but it's a question that

1487
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:32,509
sometimes we get asked and I don't have

1488
00:57:30,949 --> 00:57:33,889
a really good answer for it I mean I

1489
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:35,600
think the only way to look would be to

1490
00:57:33,889 --> 00:57:37,819
ask whether some plastic movement is

1491
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:41,210
different when you have the PME

1492
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:52,670
induction versus the PMI pai but we

1493
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:55,760
haven't done this has been a production

1494
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:59,500
of Cornell University on the web at

1495
