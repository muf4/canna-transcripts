1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,158
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,158
University

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:16,019
okay thanks everybody for coming and uh

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,019
and yeah gosh I'm excited I have some

5
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:22,980
some fun slides to present today

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:24,960
um and yeah I'll just hop right in so uh

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,079
Different Strokes for different folks

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,240
this is a phrase coined by Muhammad Ali

9
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,219
talking about how he has different

10
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,439
boxing strategies for different

11
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,000
opponents based on their strengths and

12
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:37,979
weaknesses

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,359
um and this is a really nice parallel

14
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:42,839
for what I'm going to be talking about

15
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,878
today which is that weed species are

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,280
very different based on their biology

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,079
and the traits that they have and so we

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,200
we should really be tailoring our

19
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,840
management based on that

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,640
so uh first off I want to tell you a

21
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,680
little bit about my position I'm mostly

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,500
extension and I do try to hit every

23
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:04,500
corner of the State uh and I cover all

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,579
crops as well as recently added a

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,618
community IPM uh component so I cover

26
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:12,298
backyard gardens and weeds and natural

27
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:15,540
landscapes

28
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:18,900
and I just want to start by giving some

29
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,560
examples of weeds in different systems

30
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,840
that that I've viewed from my travels

31
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,540
across the state and um this is this is

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,219
one that kind of stands out is

33
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:31,618
glyphosate tolerance soybeans where the

34
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:33,900
farmers are really relying on on

35
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:36,180
glyphosate to achieve their their weed

36
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,359
control and um

37
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,000
typically the most problematic weeds in

38
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,819
these systems are also tolerant of

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
glyphosate or have developed resistance

40
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:51,978
to glyphosate as is the case to a tall

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,978
water hemp and horse wheat

42
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,200
in great Vineyards we've we've

43
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:01,319
established this great

44
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,740
um trellis system to to help our our

45
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:06,839
perennial uh grapevines Thrive and it

46
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:10,818
turns out that there are several

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,200
perennial Vining weeds that also tend to

48
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:15,719
thrive in this environment hedge

49
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,419
vineweed Virginia creeper also Poison

50
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,199
Ivy and others

51
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:21,979
um

52
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:25,738
and so it kind of It kind of fits there

53
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:27,959
and then in greenhouses on benches I I

54
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,120
was happy that I worked at Betsy of last

55
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,400
month to attend and presented the

56
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,099
greenhouse IPM in depth which is

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,980
fantastic and um

58
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:40,019
there's a very specific set of weeds in

59
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:42,179
in greenhouses on benches and the one

60
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:45,319
thing that they have in common is that

61
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:49,080
they all can't have the ability to

62
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:51,839
forcefully eject their seed and shoot

63
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,940
those seeds five or six feet away which

64
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,659
is enough to hop up onto the benches or

65
00:02:53,939 --> 00:03:01,019
into hanging baskets or from pot to pot

66
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:04,680
um and so each of these three examples

67
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:08,099
here I've actually LED or co-led uh

68
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:11,099
trials and have have that that data up

69
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:13,378
online it's also I also went into detail

70
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:15,959
in my last uh Horticulture seminar a few

71
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:18,899
years ago and that's up on the web if

72
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:22,199
you're interested more

73
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,760
um and a few other examples of of weeds

74
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,079
that have come to thrive in different

75
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,318
systems

76
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,420
um this is a a good example here from

77
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:34,318
our afri project looking to try to

78
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:36,179
improve establishment of of conifers in

79
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,458
the first few years it's it can be very

80
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,739
difficult uh there's typically High

81
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,500
mortality so one of the sets of

82
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,000
treatments that we're looking at is uh

83
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,639
is with weed management so we're

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,919
comparing cultivation which is kind of

85
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,598
shallowly disturbing the soil and we're

86
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,798
doing this about three times over the

87
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,919
course of the summer

88
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,140
uh mowing about once a month wood chips

89
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,098
which were applied at about a four inch

90
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:02,158
depth

91
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:03,839
and herbicides which were sprayed in the

92
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,759
spring and then in the fall typically

93
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,500
while the trees were were still a little

94
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,239
bit dormant

95
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,039
um and it's interesting because because

96
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,438
this is side by side this is all in the

97
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,598
same field and you know a very similar

98
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:16,858
starting point in terms of which weeds

99
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:19,918
were present

100
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:22,740
and we're coming into the third year

101
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,539
here and and we're still taking data and

102
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,120
analyzing the data but just to

103
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:30,300
anecdotally show you some pictures

104
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,100
uh and and tell the story uh each of

105
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,379
these these treatments looks very

106
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,900
different nowadays in the third year so

107
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:39,659
for example with cultivation

108
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:42,019
uh it's it there is a lot of hairy

109
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:46,439
gallon soga and this is one of our

110
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:48,659
fastest weeds to emerge and and uh

111
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:52,978
flower and set seed it's about three

112
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:54,780
weeks from emergence to flowering so if

113
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:57,060
we're cultivating every five or six

114
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:59,459
weeks that's plenty of time for this

115
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,860
week to complete its life cycle

116
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:04,258
in the mowing system we don't actually

117
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,220
have many weeds per se in this system

118
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,379
but

119
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,540
um instead we have a lot of our seated

120
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:13,379
cover crop which is a mixture of grasses

121
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:15,540
uh and clovers it's our are low growing

122
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:17,399
and require minimal Mowing and are

123
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,860
actually kind of smothering out uh the

124
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:22,978
other weed species it seems in the wood

125
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:26,038
chip system this is really dominated by

126
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:28,560
Canada thistle and Quack grass pictured

127
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:30,959
here and both of these weeds are

128
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,139
perennial with very aggressive root

129
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:36,959
systems and they spread and have a lot

130
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:41,220
of energy embodied in those root systems

131
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:44,459
so they uh can can seemingly easily push

132
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,500
through four inches of wood chip mulch

133
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:49,379
and then in the herbicide system that

134
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,478
this will look very clean very weed free

135
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:53,699
for the first month or two after the

136
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:56,339
herbicide applications

137
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:58,439
um but those soil applied herbicides do

138
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:00,000
break down over time and so you get some

139
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:01,978
late season weeds that are able to

140
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,500
germinate and come through uh like

141
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:07,199
barnyard grass here

142
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,439
okay one final systems comparison that

143
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,600
shows more this type of uh you know

144
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:15,959
different weed species coming to thrive

145
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:18,259
in different situations again we have

146
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:22,019
and I should mention this is an organic

147
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:24,600
uh winter squash this is a delicata uh

148
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:27,240
we have cultivation again compared to a

149
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:30,600
black plastic mulch and a straw

150
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,460
multiplied by hand at at a very high but

151
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,280
a kind of a standard rate of nine tons

152
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:38,219
per acre as well as a rolled Rye system

153
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:40,619
and so this is a cover crop a rye cover

154
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,120
crop that is grown over the winter and

155
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:46,379
through the spring and then is Roller

156
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:49,019
crimp to terminate it into a mulch

157
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:51,180
and Midway through the season

158
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:53,459
um most of these are are looking pretty

159
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,860
good in terms of weed control and and

160
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:58,799
crop health I think the one outlier was

161
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,060
was the rolled Rye system which which uh

162
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,800
we struggled with for a few different

163
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,459
reasons I think there may have been some

164
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:08,579
allelopathy uh potentially this colder

165
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:11,159
more compacted soils maybe some nitrogen

166
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:13,439
immobilization uh but yeah so we

167
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,259
struggled it with with the Rye system a

168
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,478
little bit even though we uh enacted it

169
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:20,879
in two a little bit different ways each

170
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,038
year over the two-year study

171
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,959
um but what I really wanted to point out

172
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,659
here is is the differences in the weed

173
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:30,239
species and I've used principal

174
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,680
components analysis to help tell the

175
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,800
story here I'm just going to kind of

176
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,439
highlight a few of the examples

177
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,120
so Colin personally was strongly

178
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:43,079
associated with the cultivation

179
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,120
treatment and a common person this kind

180
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:48,779
of makes sense is it has these very

181
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,538
thick waxy leaves and it's often able to

182
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:53,758
survive cultivation by re-rooting and

183
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:56,598
taking some of that energy stored in the

184
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,520
leaves and making new roots

185
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:01,399
and common Ragweed was strongly

186
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,379
associated with the rolled Rye treatment

187
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:07,079
uh Matt Ryan and others have shown this

188
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:09,899
before in that the the Ragweed is one of

189
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:13,560
our earliest emerging species so it's

190
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:17,519
able to emerge before we roll down the

191
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:20,038
Rye into a suppressive mulch

192
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:23,098
winter we we don't think of typically as

193
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:25,259
a weed but it's a plant out of place in

194
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:27,478
this context and um

195
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:29,759
interestingly this was a winter wheat

196
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:31,318
straw so I'm wondering where this winter

197
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,240
we came from

198
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,399
um and and actually most of the time

199
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,099
when I see straw in use it does bring in

200
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,778
a signature amount of grain we were

201
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:43,259
lucky that this was winter wheat straw

202
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:45,539
rather than oats or spring wheat because

203
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:47,879
those would have grown very tall and

204
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:50,639
headed out whereas winter wheat requires

205
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:55,019
a vernalization or overwintering period

206
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:58,080
and stayed low growing for us

207
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:59,339
uh the there was a lot of smartly there

208
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,278
are a few different species of smart

209
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:04,440
weeds and they were mixed uh throughout

210
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:07,139
the trial I think that there was just

211
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,680
generally a high level of of smartweed

212
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:13,259
seeds in the in the soil and seed bank

213
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:15,778
um that so just by sheer numbers they

214
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:18,679
were able to to uh to make their way

215
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:18,679
through our treatments

216
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,440
so what I'm really showing and trying to

217
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,659
show in all of these examples is

218
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,700
something called Community assembly

219
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:33,120
Theory which is more of an ecological

220
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:36,778
principle that can be applied to weeds

221
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,440
in that the the species that come to

222
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:42,179
dominate or thrive in a particular field

223
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,600
are really a function of what's there to

224
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:47,458
begin with and which of those species

225
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,659
can make their way through various

226
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:51,359
filters

227
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:54,360
uh the filters can be abiotic like

228
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,759
temperature and climate filters

229
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,600
um they can be biotic like weed to weed

230
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:03,080
or plant plant interactions herbivory

231
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,278
but a lot of times the strongest filters

232
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,800
determining the presence of weeds for

233
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:10,379
which ones survive or not is human

234
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:13,799
management to tillage is the herbicides

235
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:16,620
that are used is really impact the the

236
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:18,599
success of weeds

237
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,639
um and a nice way to visualize this is

238
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,159
through a Swiss Cheese model and you may

239
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,379
have seen this in a different context at

240
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:28,439
the height of covid and that you know

241
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:30,360
you you you you want to uh wear a mask

242
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,640
you want a social distance get

243
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,519
vaccinated each of these things stacking

244
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,919
them together reduces the the likelihood

245
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,560
that a viral particle will will slip

246
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:43,199
through and and uh possibly gets sick

247
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:45,239
and it's the same type of principle with

248
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,560
with weeds

249
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,220
foreign

250
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:52,439
so some of the differences between Weed

251
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:56,160
species that can impact their success

252
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,800
include their life cycle are they an

253
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:01,439
annual that produces thousands of seeds

254
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,979
are they a perennial that is perhaps

255
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,860
more reliant on spreading via the roots

256
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:09,259
uh monocots tend to have a a growing

257
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,300
point

258
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:15,539
a meristem that is protected at the soil

259
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:18,719
line whereas dicots the meristem is up

260
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:21,299
on the on the the ends of the shoots and

261
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,540
exposed to things like mowing or flame

262
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:27,120
weeding or contact herbicides the

263
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:29,159
morphology the the height and you know

264
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,799
spreading nature of weeds is another

265
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:34,679
important factor as is the

266
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:36,479
photosynthesis type which can can impact

267
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:39,419
the success of a plant in drought years

268
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,800
or wet years and there's many other

269
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:42,419
traits

270
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,278
um some of these are down to the

271
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:47,159
molecular level like like how the

272
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:49,200
species respond to herbicides do do they

273
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,059
have the molecular

274
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,339
um you know shapes of some of their

275
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:55,739
mechanisms in at the cellular level that

276
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:57,660
allows herbicides to bind and block

277
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:01,339
particular mechanisms that are important

278
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:04,319
to the plant uh can can the plant

279
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:07,579
metabolize certain herbicides to to

280
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,180
Simply make them ineffective

281
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:12,120
and

282
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:14,159
one of the the important factors that

283
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,259
determine the success of different weed

284
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:19,620
species that you may not think about or

285
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:22,319
at least I didn't for a while was when

286
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:25,259
do weeds tend to emerge and different

287
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,140
species tend to emerge at different

288
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:30,778
times of the year typically based on the

289
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:33,120
accumulation of Growing Degree Days

290
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:37,500
and this is some work led by Matt Ryan

291
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:41,159
that that I um took a piece of and added

292
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:44,278
some review to and and showed that

293
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:46,799
um yeah species have some species

294
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:50,338
anyways like say barnyard grass here

295
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:53,879
have an emergence Peak that can be

296
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:55,560
targeted uh by management

297
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:57,120
so for example

298
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:58,259
um this

299
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,500
um

300
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:05,039
shaded uh band here is is a hypothetical

301
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:07,139
emergence Peak and

302
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,179
um here I have a few different examples

303
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:12,299
or scenarios of ways Farmers might

304
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:14,219
Target that Peak so the crop here is

305
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:17,278
represented by these vertical lines

306
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:19,740
increasing in height and then the X's

307
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:23,220
represent various direct controls like

308
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:25,459
herbicides or tillage or cultivation

309
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,839
um so one simple way is to Simply

310
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:30,179
consolidate you know some of your direct

311
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,060
controls during that period when weeds

312
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:35,219
are just emerging they're very small and

313
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:37,979
when weeds are small they're most

314
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:41,579
susceptible to to Direct Control it's

315
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:44,940
when they're they're kind of the weakest

316
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:47,519
um another way is to to uh ensure that

317
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,800
you have residual herbicides overlapping

318
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,620
during this important period of

319
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:54,659
emergence and similarly with residue

320
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,959
mulches those mulches break down over

321
00:13:54,659 --> 00:14:01,559
time so ensuring that that's applied

322
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:04,018
before the emergence Peak is important

323
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:06,838
planting later can help farmers just

324
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:08,759
simply avoid an emerge an emergence Peak

325
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,620
if they have that flexibility and

326
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:12,179
planting earlier can get the crop

327
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:16,980
established and give it a height

328
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:19,859
advantage over the the emerging weeds uh

329
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,659
a fallow period is is excellent and I

330
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,940
think kind of the gold standard if if

331
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:26,639
the farmer has that flexibility to

332
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,560
Simply you know repeatedly till or spray

333
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,379
during that period to control those

334
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:34,278
emerging weeds without having to worry

335
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:37,139
about damaging their crop potentially

336
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:38,458
and a cover crop can achieve a similar

337
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:41,120
effect

338
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,119
foreign

339
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:48,920
which crops might be used or be adjusted

340
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:53,100
to to

341
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:55,379
fit the the timing of when weeds emerge

342
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,300
in a particular field if the weeds are

343
00:14:55,379 --> 00:15:00,419
emerging in the early part of the season

344
00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:02,578
if if the problematic species like a lot

345
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:06,240
of our summer annuals emerge around this

346
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:08,759
time uh Farmers may consider shifting to

347
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,759
later planting periods to avoid that

348
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:13,860
period uh or use crops like Alfalfa or

349
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,319
winter cereals that are established

350
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,480
ahead of time and have a competitive

351
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,120
advantage through that

352
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,000
for mid-season weeds it's a little

353
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,980
tricky a farmer may try to use short

354
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,778
season crops to avoid this peaky

355
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,659
emergence period

356
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:33,838
and then for late season weeds which are

357
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:37,259
typically winter annuals uh earlier

358
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,060
crops will allow the Harvest and you

359
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:41,100
know get the crop out of the field so

360
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:42,958
that you can then take care of the weeds

361
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:46,100
again without having to worry about

362
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,099
putting the crop in the way

363
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,240
and the other thing we did with this

364
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:54,539
work was look at the previous literature

365
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,940
and uh for for each of the species that

366
00:15:54,539 --> 00:16:00,360
we are interested in and and

367
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:04,500
um kind of initiate a bit of a virtual

368
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,659
common Garden experiment in that uh

369
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,159
we're using them these models that were

370
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:10,620
created which are primarily based on

371
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:13,559
Growing Degree Days and then plugging in

372
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,600
the same data for each of these models

373
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:17,159
based on hardiness zones

374
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,100
um that are found in New York so 4A

375
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:22,679
would be like up in the Adirondacks 7A

376
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:26,399
would be down on Long Island

377
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:28,739
and yeah for for uh most of these the

378
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,539
data corresponded to what we had found

379
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,560
experimentally

380
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:33,480
um

381
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:35,578
but yeah it was interesting and I guess

382
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,699
it makes sense that that there was about

383
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:42,120
a month a month and a half difference

384
00:16:37,698 --> 00:16:44,698
between when a given species would be

385
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,759
predicted to emerge in a warmer climate

386
00:16:44,698 --> 00:16:50,539
versus a cooler plant

387
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,560
and one of the kind of initially

388
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:55,319
perplexing things is that you know some

389
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:57,778
of these models were very different and

390
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,339
um for two of these that can be

391
00:16:57,778 --> 00:17:01,980
explained in that their winner annuals

392
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:03,060
that can also be summer annual so I

393
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,039
think that they're modeling two

394
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:07,500
different populations

395
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,480
um but some of these like Redwood these

396
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,578
are summer annuals and there's quite a

397
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,459
variation with

398
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:16,078
um when the models predicted emergence

399
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,539
and

400
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,980
um I think this shows that that there

401
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,659
are different their population level

402
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:25,980
differences in that

403
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:27,540
uh pigweed in one part of say the us or

404
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,960
Europe or wherever

405
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:32,759
um May emerge or can be predicted to

406
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,679
emerge at one time you know maybe

407
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:38,099
earlier or later than another population

408
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:40,320
so I think that has to do with the

409
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:42,599
history of the field and and how the

410
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,639
selection pressure has played out in the

411
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:46,500
past for each population

412
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,740
um so that's just something that going

413
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,660
forward we'll have to to account for if

414
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:55,819
we're going to be using these models to

415
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,820
make recommendations for farmers

416
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:01,980
but yeah there's there's a lot of

417
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:04,679
biology traits that that of impact which

418
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,660
weeds are successful and which aren't

419
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:09,840
um and a lot of that information is

420
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:11,700
available in these two fantastic uh

421
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:14,459
recent books that were published in the

422
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,919
past couple years uh our own uh Antonio

423
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,860
Di Tomaso is a co-author on both of

424
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:22,679
these uh this uh managed Weeds on your

425
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:25,199
farm was lead authored by Charles Muller

426
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:27,120
the late great Charles Muller who is at

427
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,919
uh at Cornell

428
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,558
um and these are these have been just

429
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:34,080
fantastic resources for educators like

430
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:37,619
me it includes these tables so you have

431
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:41,279
all of the the common weed species and

432
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:42,479
most of the key biological traits that

433
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,700
are going to impact their management

434
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,419
that now if I get a call from a farmer

435
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,038
about

436
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:50,340
how do I what should I be doing about

437
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:51,839
this weed say shatter cane I can quickly

438
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:54,659
remind myself

439
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:58,019
um you know what are the the pertinent

440
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:00,058
um traits there and yeah sorry is the

441
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:02,759
amount of Weeds on your farm is that is

442
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:05,160
that online that's online yes that's

443
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:08,038
that's available for free online and

444
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,940
yeah I encourage you to check it out

445
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:11,940
um

446
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:14,940
sorry yeah no problem and uh yeah and

447
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,720
it's been these books have been a huge

448
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,460
help

449
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,679
um and for example in this weed

450
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,660
identification and management webinar

451
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,840
series uh that several of us put

452
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,940
together with uh with webinars on weed

453
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:29,339
management for grasses for broadleafs

454
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:32,340
for lead management soybeans

455
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:35,159
um I I in particular really lean heavily

456
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:38,339
on those two books and um and actually

457
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:41,160
some of the slides that I use were even

458
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:43,798
um pre-made by the Dita maso group and

459
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:46,440
Terry marshner in particular about how

460
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:48,839
to identify various species and I'll

461
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,519
just quickly go through a few of these

462
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:52,798
um but something that I did was really

463
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:56,339
try to boil down the management

464
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:58,740
information even further I just said you

465
00:19:56,339 --> 00:20:02,879
know maybe two bullet points uh for

466
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:05,640
example Velvet Leaf has these these

467
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,039
densely hairy you know velvety drooping

468
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,380
leaves that herbicides a lot of times

469
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:12,900
can just run right off of and and so

470
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,940
there's issues with uptake

471
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,620
um but it can be controlled uh

472
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,240
effectively when the leaves when there's

473
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:21,899
four leaves or less

474
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:25,740
and Velvet Leaf doesn't typically

475
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:27,720
produce seeds until the end of August so

476
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,359
for shorter season or earlier season

477
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,279
crops again we could we could try to

478
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:34,558
harvest those early and then come

479
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:37,500
through and effectively

480
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:39,660
um till or burn down the remaining

481
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,279
velvet leaves to prevent weed seed

482
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:44,279
production

483
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,960
bird cucumber is uh it can be

484
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:47,579
problematic in field crops it looks

485
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:51,120
somewhat similar to our cultivating

486
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:54,480
cucumber it has these large seeds that

487
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:56,279
enable it to emerge from rather deep in

488
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,038
the plow layer most of our seeds just

489
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:03,058
emerge in the top inch or two

490
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:04,980
um and yeah what I'm calling an Achilles

491
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:07,918
heel or something that kind of sticks

492
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,779
out about each species is that for a

493
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,759
bird cucumber it doesn't produce very

494
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:14,480
much seed and those seeds last a long

495
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:17,819
time so there's relatively little or few

496
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,099
numbers of Brewer cucumber emerging in a

497
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:24,599
particular field I think it's a good

498
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:24,599
candidate for spot treatments

499
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:28,798
pigweeds we have several pigweed species

500
00:21:27,298 --> 00:21:32,038
in New York

501
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:34,500
um and two of them are resistant to

502
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:37,440
different herbicide classes

503
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,779
with the pigment species I think one of

504
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,240
the important Achilles heels is that the

505
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:45,058
seeds don't live very long in the soil

506
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,339
they have a half-life of about a year so

507
00:21:45,058 --> 00:21:50,700
if a farmer is really able to step up

508
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:53,879
their control uh for about four years

509
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:59,179
they should be able to almost completely

510
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:59,179
eliminate the pygmy from the seed bank

511
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,820
first Lane I mentioned earlier has very

512
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,820
thick backseat leaves

513
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,620
um but it is very low growing and it's

514
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:13,620
relatively shade intolerance so it's

515
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:16,579
it's uh susceptible to to crop

516
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:20,219
competition uh from crops like corn

517
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:23,279
and smothering the other means

518
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:26,640
uh crabgrass also is fairly low growing

519
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:28,619
and spreading um so if it's in a long

520
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,080
um competing with with more erect

521
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:33,178
grasses if you're able to keep your

522
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:35,158
mowing height higher uh can kind of

523
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:39,500
shift the competitive the competitive

524
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:41,600
Advantage uh to those other species

525
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:45,659
barnyard grass

526
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:47,839
has seed that unlike some of our grasses

527
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:50,940
or other sweet species where the seed

528
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:52,798
almost immediately drops to the soil and

529
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:56,038
is incorporated into the soil seed bank

530
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:57,418
Fargo Grass kind of retains its seed a

531
00:22:56,038 --> 00:23:00,900
little bit longer and through the fall

532
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:02,960
so it could potentially be be removed

533
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,538
through several different

534
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,759
mechanisms either hand removal or or

535
00:23:05,538 --> 00:23:10,558
mechanized Harvest Time weed seed

536
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:13,500
destruction

537
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:16,259
horse weed it can be a winter or summer

538
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:19,200
annual I mentioned earlier it it is

539
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:21,359
um likely resistant to glyphosate around

540
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,038
the state expose some other herbicide

541
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,319
classes

542
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:27,779
um but it has these very very small

543
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:30,779
seeds it's the seeds are wind blown

544
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:32,220
unlike a lot of our agricultural weeds

545
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:35,038
that have seed that just drop straight

546
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:37,740
to the ground or sweet seeds are tiny

547
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,839
and and they're so in order to be wind

548
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:42,298
blown to be taken by the wing

549
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,279
um and so they're so small they don't

550
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:47,038
have enough energy to push through very

551
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:49,200
much soil they typically only germinate

552
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:50,279
and emerge from basically the soil

553
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,380
surface

554
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:54,599
so they're very susceptible to tillage

555
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:58,380
or soil disturbance to put them deeper

556
00:23:54,599 --> 00:24:02,240
or crop residue or mulches to prevent

557
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,240
their their successful emergence

558
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:09,240
common Burdock and spotted Napoli are

559
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:10,019
both biennials and typically only see

560
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,440
them

561
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:17,940
um in very minimally managed hay fields

562
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:21,380
some perennials uh Canada thistle

563
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,380
field bind weed

564
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:28,859
delay crack grass and yellow nutsedge

565
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:32,460
um are are all perennials with very

566
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:35,219
aggressively spreading root systems and

567
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,500
uh these these species they store a lot

568
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:40,798
of energy and carbohydrates in those

569
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:43,500
roots so it can take many years of

570
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:48,200
repeated management to effectively

571
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:50,759
control these perennial species and one

572
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:54,440
tip that's typically suggested is that

573
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:57,359
farmers use systemic herbicides that

574
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,159
particularly applied in the fall when

575
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,678
these weeds are preparing for winter

576
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:04,380
they're bringing carbohydrates and

577
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,179
resources down into their root system to

578
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,700
store that over the winter help them get

579
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:10,380
through the winter and so if you apply a

580
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,058
herbicide at that time it takes the

581
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:16,580
herbicide with it down to the root

582
00:25:12,058 --> 00:25:19,079
system and helps us destroy the roots

583
00:25:16,579 --> 00:25:20,339
so those are just some some quick

584
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:23,599
examples

585
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:27,538
um and and this this type of of

586
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:29,219
extension I I found a lot of uh support

587
00:25:27,538 --> 00:25:32,220
for it there seems to be a lot of

588
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,500
interest and demand from Farmers uh I I

589
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,900
get a lot of calls and questions after

590
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,579
presentations you know hey what you know

591
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,740
what is this weed that I have I'll get

592
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:43,740
i'll get photos from a phone and then

593
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:46,558
very quickly follow how do I kill it

594
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:50,038
um so this this type of management uh or

595
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:52,139
uh extension I found to be um very

596
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:55,019
effective and I'd like to try to

597
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:57,480
continue to build on this momentum

598
00:25:55,019 --> 00:26:00,000
because this this webinar series these

599
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,880
two great books that just came out uh we

600
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,278
have some momentum going in this line

601
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,820
um and so in

602
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:10,859
looking to establish uh upcoming you

603
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:13,678
know new projects new Grant proposals I

604
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:15,719
I wanted to build on this but at the

605
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,640
same time I didn't want to bore Farmers

606
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,740
by going over all the species that they

607
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,320
don't have they they want to know about

608
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,000
the you know the handful of species that

609
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,460
that they're really having a problem

610
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,038
with not necessarily all these others so

611
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,960
to make this more specific

612
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,058
um I I was thinking back to some work

613
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,058
that I had done in grad school

614
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:38,038
uh doing germinable weed seed bank assay

615
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:39,839
so this is this is where we would take

616
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:42,179
soil samples

617
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,759
um typically 10 samples from across the

618
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:47,278
field mix those up bring them back to a

619
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:49,259
greenhouse uh let the weeds emerge

620
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:50,460
continue to water and encourage weeds to

621
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:53,640
emerge over the course of a summer

622
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,440
record all those species

623
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,020
um I'm thinking okay this might be a

624
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,940
good way to bring this this uh

625
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:03,058
biological based

626
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:05,700
um you know management information to to

627
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:08,399
a farm and really look at and tailor it

628
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:11,340
to the species that they have

629
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,320
um and in this particular trial

630
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:15,899
um or project

631
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:18,720
we we found some interesting things you

632
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,400
know we saw okay that we

633
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,038
EDS um

634
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:27,900
Community composition with these seed

635
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:28,500
bank analyzes was excuse me was

636
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,519
um

637
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,659
somewhat somewhat um explained by

638
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:36,599
geo-chromatic factors like latitude

639
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:39,000
longitude Growing Degree Days and then

640
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:42,298
to a lesser extent by soil factors

641
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,500
academic factors like pH uh soil organic

642
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:46,558
matter

643
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,298
um but what one of my regrets is that we

644
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,000
didn't include any management

645
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:52,980
information about the farm like are they

646
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,319
using tillage what type of herbicides

647
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,839
what type of crops are they planting

648
00:27:55,319 --> 00:28:00,178
um and I so I think that adding that

649
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:03,658
kind of information would be would be

650
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:05,400
really interested and um so a group of

651
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:08,340
us got together and we were successful

652
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,798
in in doing just that and applying for a

653
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:14,639
new project that that uses these beads

654
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:17,639
seed bank analyzes to to do this type of

655
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,580
trait based uh extension

656
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,200
um and we'll we'll be visiting 50 Farms

657
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:23,519
this fall we're Midway through that

658
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,860
already

659
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:28,740
um and these Farms are fruit vegetables

660
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:30,719
uh you know organic conventional field

661
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,640
crops there's a lot of urban Farms

662
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,339
they're participating

663
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,400
um and it's it's primarily an extension

664
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:41,220
project so for each Farm we'll provide

665
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:44,820
photos of of their problem species and

666
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:46,620
how to identify them with key features

667
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:48,178
um show how their weed seed bank

668
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:50,038
compares to others do you have a small

669
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:52,320
weed seed bank or is it is it rather

670
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:54,480
large a lot Farmers like seeing how they

671
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:59,158
compare to other farmers

672
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:01,620
uh but I think most importantly is we're

673
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:04,260
going to really look hard at the species

674
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:07,739
that they have and work to come up with

675
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:11,220
tailored management recommendations uh

676
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:13,558
and and base that on the tools that are

677
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,659
available to each Farm you know I I'm

678
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:18,418
not going to come in and say

679
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:20,640
you just need to add on uh one more

680
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:22,860
piece of Swiss cheese and by the way it

681
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,460
costs fifty thousand dollars

682
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:25,859
um

683
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:27,840
I'd rather come in and say okay if you

684
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:29,278
move this piece of Swiss cheese and inch

685
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:31,019
to the left you're going to dramatically

686
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:33,480
improve your weed management

687
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:36,298
um really at no additional cost

688
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,460
um so looking for those types of of kind

689
00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:41,038
of win-win situations

690
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,679
um based on adjusting Farmers timing of

691
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:47,000
planting maybe crop selection

692
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:50,460
um and and herbicides other factors

693
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,619
so there'll be 50 farms and so it's

694
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,058
likely that if you're a farmer in New

695
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:57,479
York state there's going to be one of

696
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:59,278
those 50 is going to be very similar to

697
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,159
your own situation with the weeds and

698
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,898
what tools you have available so we'll

699
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,299
be translating these recommendations

700
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:11,000
into several languages having them

701
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:11,000
available in print and online

702
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:16,500
um and so far yeah we have booked the

703
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:19,020
the 50 Farms that I I would like to uh

704
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:22,380
give a big thank you to uh county-based

705
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:23,000
uh extension Educators as well as

706
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:27,600
um

707
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,220
researchers that have um you know strong

708
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,079
um you know connections with Growers

709
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,278
like like Greg Peck who helped get the

710
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:35,158
word out

711
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:37,440
um and and the other thing that helped

712
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:39,960
us is that we had a 500 stipend for

713
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,380
Farmers to participate uh although I do

714
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:45,480
have some qualms with uh how Cornell

715
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:49,200
handles the stipends

716
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:51,899
um but yeah there this was

717
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,580
um this was this is primarily extension

718
00:30:51,898 --> 00:30:55,918
but we do have some research questions

719
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:58,439
that we'll be investigating how do

720
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,960
particular species correlate with with

721
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:04,080
crops you know what determines where

722
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,778
species are you know where they are

723
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:08,639
um and in which situations uh we'll also

724
00:31:06,778 --> 00:31:10,679
be looking and screening for some

725
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,240
herbicide resistance for suspected

726
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:14,100
species

727
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,620
you're doing some novel things related

728
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:18,839
to heat and enzymes to attempt to

729
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:21,119
deplete weed seed banks

730
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:22,918
um and I'm we're also open to other

731
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:25,199
questions this will be kind of an

732
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:28,020
interesting data set with 50 farms and

733
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,298
and all of the weed species encompassed

734
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:33,658
or these are the Farms so we're open to

735
00:31:30,298 --> 00:31:35,220
to collaboration if anyone has any uh

736
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:37,980
additional questions

737
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,360
so a little bit more on the Heat and the

738
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,759
enzymes

739
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:45,058
um so

740
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:47,640
heat particularly above 150 degrees

741
00:31:45,058 --> 00:31:50,099
Fahrenheit really just starts to cook

742
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:52,620
weed seeds and

743
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:56,099
um there are a few ways that that this

744
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:59,038
can be established uh on farms one of

745
00:31:56,099 --> 00:32:02,339
them is so using clear plastic uh

746
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:04,460
solarizing and this is kind of a fun

747
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:07,379
story there was a

748
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:10,140
high school student in the Hudson Valley

749
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:13,740
who was interested in solarization and

750
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:15,419
went to his local uh County extension

751
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,579
service who put him in touch with Steve

752
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:19,200
reiners who put him in touch with me

753
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:22,019
because I had done some solarization

754
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,179
before and uh and we we chatted a few

755
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:27,000
times over zoom and

756
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:29,640
um I just gave him one or two

757
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,159
suggestions about replication and some

758
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:35,278
details but this is really his

759
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:38,340
independent project and he really he got

760
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:40,700
his own funding and just uh you know did

761
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:43,678
this amazing work over the summer

762
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,899
and found treatment differences it he

763
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,840
was looking at comparing plastic versus

764
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:51,599
biodegradable film for solarization he

765
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:54,898
found uh hotter temperatures achieved in

766
00:32:51,599 --> 00:33:00,959
the plastic than the biodegradable mulch

767
00:32:54,898 --> 00:33:03,418
or film and um likewise more uh

768
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,980
mineralization of MP and K in the higher

769
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:08,159
temperatures

770
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:10,319
um and he actually took this work and uh

771
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,260
was successfully he got first place at a

772
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:15,298
local science fair uh and is now in his

773
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:16,980
first year at Cornell I was hoping he

774
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:18,960
was going to be on hand to sign

775
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,960
autographs today

776
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:25,019
um but uh yeah very very fun uh project

777
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,480
to to collaborate on with him

778
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:30,298
um other ways that that he can be used

779
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,460
to to Target weed seeds um that I was

780
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:34,619
actually getting questions about from

781
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,480
interested Farmers

782
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:38,639
um you know steam is used to some extent

783
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,140
but it takes a long time

784
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,059
um and it's not feasible on a large

785
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:44,220
scale probably

786
00:33:42,058 --> 00:33:46,440
um they're curious about boiling water

787
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:50,579
and uh they were thinking this could be

788
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:53,460
applied quicker to larger areas

789
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:56,339
um so I I borrowed a camping stove and

790
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:59,399
had these very small plots set out

791
00:33:56,339 --> 00:34:02,158
um uh rep or a representative of

792
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:04,500
actually fairly large volumes of boiling

793
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,659
water applied to the soil and

794
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,679
unfortunately there wasn't a significant

795
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:10,139
effect

796
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,780
um I think that the boiling water didn't

797
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:16,440
penetrate deep enough and I think that

798
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:18,960
it cooled off fairly rapidly to not not

799
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:21,179
actually kill the weed seeds that we're

800
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,679
hoping for and of course with perennial

801
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:26,338
weeds it's going to be less effective

802
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:29,240
anyways as they're likely emerging from

803
00:34:26,338 --> 00:34:29,239
from root stuff

804
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:35,280
um but I was still very excited about

805
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:38,219
this other new idea to to potentially

806
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,800
degrade weed seeds and that weed seeds

807
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:45,000
are typically covered in a waxy coating

808
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:47,339
that includes cuten and xylin and these

809
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,239
materials help protect the seed there

810
00:34:47,338 --> 00:34:54,659
are certain fungi and bacteria that can

811
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:58,439
break down that seed coat using enzymes

812
00:34:54,659 --> 00:35:01,559
they can exude cutenase or xylinase to

813
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:03,780
help them break through and uh and then

814
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:05,699
break down the interior of the seed

815
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:09,180
after that

816
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:11,699
um and these these uh these enzymes

817
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:15,779
actually you can purchase online through

818
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:18,919
the magic of recombinant DNA technology

819
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:22,500
um and so I actually did that and uh

820
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:25,500
incubated uh known quantities of Lamb's

821
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:28,260
quarters seed for about eight hours to

822
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:31,260
each of these treatments and then bury

823
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:33,900
the seed for six months and in the

824
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:37,920
living soil that was kept moist

825
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:40,619
um and thinking that okay if the uh the

826
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,380
enzyme and it gets the job started and

827
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:46,140
breaking down the seed coat perhaps

828
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:48,720
um the ambient fungi and other microbes

829
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:51,420
in the soil could take advantage of

830
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:53,939
those wounds and and kind of finish the

831
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:56,039
job so to speak

832
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,800
uh unfortunately there was no no

833
00:35:56,039 --> 00:36:01,500
significant difference between uh any of

834
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,660
the treatments and uh and that was

835
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,460
unfortunate but I thought well maybe let

836
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:08,759
me uh make sure I'm covering all my

837
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:11,760
bases here and test the German ability

838
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:14,099
The Germ rate of the seed because if

839
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:17,040
there was any type of damage

840
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:19,500
um you know perhaps it's um it would

841
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:22,139
allow the sea to imbibe water more

842
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:24,599
quickly and impact the germination and

843
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:26,039
it actually did so there was a

844
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,300
significant difference for the

845
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:29,400
treatments

846
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:32,460
um based on whether they're exposed to

847
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:36,059
the enzymes or not and this is a modest

848
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:37,980
difference I'll admit but I think it's

849
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:39,719
it's still an encouraging result and

850
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,920
that you know maybe with improved

851
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:42,779
methods

852
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:46,260
um if we do this again in the next few

853
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:48,300
years we can increase that result if we

854
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:50,520
can get close to a hundred percent of

855
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:52,859
the seeds to emerge then a farmer could

856
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:54,960
just come through and control all those

857
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:58,440
all the wheat the weeds their soil and

858
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:02,280
basically have weed-free conditions

859
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:04,858
I also want to mention that um we've

860
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,980
done uh some work in uh investigating

861
00:37:04,858 --> 00:37:10,679
this can new breed of mechanical weeding

862
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:13,320
tools that is coming online to kind of

863
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:16,440
reduce the burden on herbicides and and

864
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:18,480
hand labor Lynn suznowski and I both

865
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:22,079
presented at the Northeast mechanical

866
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,240
weed uh control field day this past

867
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,300
summer and Lynn actually recently

868
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,500
purchased a Nile Oz weeding robot from

869
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,800
France

870
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:36,019
um and gave us a great opportunity to

871
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:39,780
help set up these or help adjust these

872
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:43,019
cultivation implements on it and uh our

873
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:46,079
uh two undergraduate summer research

874
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:47,820
assistants Eric burdham and Juliana Lee

875
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,800
got to help with that I think it was one

876
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,420
of the highlights of their summer and

877
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,000
they're now in their Junior and senior

878
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:56,760
years at Cornell and I think have very

879
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,599
Bright Futures ahead of them

880
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,680
so just to wrap everything up with a

881
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:03,539
nice little bow

882
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,919
um I mentioned there's another sense of

883
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:06,779
Different Strokes for different folks

884
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,380
that you might be more aware of than the

885
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:13,380
boxing scent and that and this is the

886
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:16,680
the way that Sly and the family's Stone

887
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:19,500
used in their song everyday people is

888
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:21,960
that people are different and you know

889
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:24,119
people do things in different ways

890
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,679
um and you know we should celebrate that

891
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:27,539
diversity

892
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:29,159
um and really that applies to weed

893
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:31,320
management and that there's you know

894
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:32,639
there's no single right way to manage

895
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,800
weeds

896
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:37,639
um you know you can do it a million

897
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,619
different ways and and I'm

898
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:43,679
improving and um you know not not

899
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:45,599
letting my own biases affect uh my

900
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:48,960
extension but you know meeting Farmers

901
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:50,760
where they are and I one minute I may

902
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,500
meet with a large scale

903
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,660
um you know conventional grower just

904
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,338
talking about different herbicides and

905
00:38:54,659 --> 00:38:59,039
the next minute I may be talking with a

906
00:38:56,338 --> 00:39:03,480
small scale male organic farmer about

907
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:05,759
hand tools um so you know it's there is

908
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,280
there's there's so many ways to do it um

909
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,920
successfully and as long as

910
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:13,740
um you know I'm always trying to to

911
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:16,500
reduce risks and improve the weed

912
00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:18,739
control yes but also reduce risks

913
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:22,920
related to the environment human health

914
00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:24,059
and the economic bottom line or the farm

915
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,338
um

916
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:28,078
and actually this is a great example uh

917
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:30,059
in itself of Different Strokes for

918
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,240
different folks and that some research

919
00:39:30,059 --> 00:39:35,820
from Maine showed that there's no single

920
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:38,578
best hand tool uh you know they're all

921
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:40,859
good at different things and

922
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:43,019
um you know the ergonomics of each of

923
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:44,940
them fits with different people in

924
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:47,219
different ways based on how tall they

925
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:49,559
are or other factors

926
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:51,059
um and so we actually applied for some

927
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:53,099
funding through the vegetable program

928
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:55,739
work team and we have about 20 different

929
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:57,420
hosts that travel around the state but

930
00:39:55,739 --> 00:39:59,279
kind of a whole library to different

931
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:02,519
field events so farmers can test them

932
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,079
out and see which one works for them

933
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:07,679
um

934
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,119
whoops and in another sense of Different

935
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:10,799
Strokes for different folks is that

936
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,720
people have different learning styles so

937
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,940
a lot of us in extension are really

938
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:16,799
branching out from just presentations

939
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,900
and and one-on-one

940
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,359
um using things like Active Learning and

941
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,920
video podcasts

942
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,199
um and something that I'm excited about

943
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,880
hopefully unveiling in the next year or

944
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:30,598
two is something called a garden

945
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,880
notebook a a campaign I hope to uh

946
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:35,519
establish on social media

947
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,400
um that utilizes some of the drawing and

948
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:41,820
painting skills of a few of us in the

949
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,880
IPM program to reach out to a new

950
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:47,760
audience probably backyard gardeners who

951
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,280
might keep this type of notebook with

952
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,800
Pest management information what are the

953
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,140
key identifying characteristics of

954
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:59,460
different weeds for example uh and maybe

955
00:40:55,139 --> 00:41:02,159
we can work in some research-based uh uh

956
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:04,380
management tips in there as well

957
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:06,719
so I've tried to include some

958
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:08,820
acknowledgments as as I've went I I've

959
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:11,039
been really lucky to work with a wide

960
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:13,140
variety of people in different

961
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:14,940
disciplines as a lot of us are

962
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:16,679
struggling with weeds

963
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,358
um and I just want to thank the New York

964
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:19,460
State Department of Ag and markets as

965
00:41:18,358 --> 00:41:22,380
well as DEC

966
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:24,659
Northeast air and USDA for funding

967
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:27,300
related to some of the work I presented

968
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:30,139
so thank you

969
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,140
any questions

970
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,619
yeah so you know we've been reading

971
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:36,920
about electric computers and lots of

972
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:36,920
sports

973
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:42,440
there's other newer kind of ways

974
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:48,980
is that technology good yeah

975
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,780
right yeah I'm guessing I should repeat

976
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,760
that for example

977
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:59,460
um yeah so the question is uh for Marvin

978
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,980
about uh you know what is the status of

979
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,179
uh robotic and advanced uh weeding

980
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,280
equipment

981
00:42:03,179 --> 00:42:06,899
um yeah so

982
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,260
um a lot of it is still in the

983
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:13,079
development stage but yeah there are our

984
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:14,700
yeah I used to say 10 I used to say 20.

985
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:17,640
I don't know there's there's maybe 30

986
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:19,618
plus startups now

987
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:22,019
um that are trying to tackle this

988
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:23,640
they're seeing this opportunity of okay

989
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:25,380
we're struggling with some herbicide

990
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:28,980
resistance we're struggling with labor

991
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:31,079
shortages can advanced technology kind

992
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:33,599
of take the place here

993
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:35,519
um and a lot of it is uh you know being

994
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,160
at the early stages and with economies

995
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:41,820
of scale it's at the very nascent stages

996
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:44,819
so it's it's it's very expensive and um

997
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:48,119
typically it's it's mostly applied and

998
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:50,220
very high value props particularly in

999
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:52,140
California where there's a high density

1000
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:54,480
of high value crops so they can station

1001
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:58,019
a company there and maybe have a handful

1002
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:01,679
of these tools share them between uh all

1003
00:42:58,019 --> 00:43:04,380
the large farms in the area but um yeah

1004
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:07,078
we're they're starting to expand out

1005
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:08,838
from from uh California

1006
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:11,818
um

1007
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:14,699
it's it's going to be a while yet I

1008
00:43:11,818 --> 00:43:17,818
think before the average farmer in New

1009
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:20,338
York has one of these fancy robots but

1010
00:43:17,818 --> 00:43:22,460
it does seem like prices are coming down

1011
00:43:20,338 --> 00:43:25,559
and you know they're they're becoming

1012
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:27,420
bit by bit more viable

1013
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:29,460
so

1014
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,200
yeah

1015
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,699
um there's some other different answer

1016
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:37,500
technique it sounds like there's like

1017
00:43:32,699 --> 00:43:39,318
weakness anticipate from

1018
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:42,019
um

1019
00:43:39,318 --> 00:43:45,000
if they're like the copper Advance

1020
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:47,400
predict but yet you're against the right

1021
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,519
locations or

1022
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,519
um

1023
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,900
yeah

1024
00:43:56,059 --> 00:44:00,960
that's a great question uh and what was

1025
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:03,719
your name player Claire so Claire was

1026
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,599
asking uh about you know how far in

1027
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:08,399
advance can we predict certain weed

1028
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:10,440
problems and which species are going to

1029
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,599
be maybe problematic or challenging in

1030
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,639
certain situations

1031
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:17,039
um and

1032
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:20,159
yeah that's that's a great question

1033
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:21,960
um I think that to some extent you know

1034
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:24,719
some of these things are a little bit of

1035
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,880
a no-brainer like the okay life is safe

1036
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:28,919
tolerant needs and glyphosate if you're

1037
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,660
only spraying glyphosate

1038
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,818
um

1039
00:44:29,659 --> 00:44:35,940
and there are certain

1040
00:44:32,818 --> 00:44:38,759
um Suites of weeds that are typically

1041
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:40,800
problematic in like organic vegetables

1042
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,900
or you know depending on what type of

1043
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,818
crop it is that you're growing or grapes

1044
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:48,059
like I mentioned

1045
00:44:44,818 --> 00:44:50,338
um so to some extent we can get you in

1046
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:53,219
the right ballpark just based on like

1047
00:44:50,338 --> 00:44:55,559
okay this is the crop and this is the

1048
00:44:53,219 --> 00:44:57,899
frequency and timing of tillage as in

1049
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:01,078
the herbicides use perhaps

1050
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:03,660
um but there's this other factor of what

1051
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:05,280
was the starting point of of the seed

1052
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:07,980
bank what's the history of the field

1053
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,900
before it was grapes was it in you know

1054
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:12,480
was it pasture or what you know what

1055
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:14,639
what seed bank had built up there and

1056
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,639
that would maybe still have a legacy of

1057
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:20,219
that in that given site

1058
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:22,318
um and and if you're and I mentioned

1059
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:24,480
most of our weed seeds do you know just

1060
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:26,519
fall straight to the ground but some

1061
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,920
like dandelions and like horse weed do

1062
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:32,400
blow in so what is the Farm's proximity

1063
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:35,639
to new sources of those weeds are you

1064
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,160
near a big field of dandelions that's

1065
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:40,559
going to constantly be coming in on

1066
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:42,659
um so yeah I think that there's there's

1067
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:45,779
a certain Baseline level we can predict

1068
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:47,338
but there's an overall level of

1069
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:50,339
we have

1070
00:45:47,338 --> 00:45:53,838
um kind of random effects that it's

1071
00:45:50,338 --> 00:45:53,838
going to be unique to each situation

1072
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,519
Brian are are there any examples of uh

1073
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:02,280
mobile

1074
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:05,219
um steam based

1075
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:08,220
reading machines not weeding machines

1076
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:11,219
but a field treatment sheets yeah they

1077
00:46:08,219 --> 00:46:14,219
do that in in Harlem you know with with

1078
00:46:11,219 --> 00:46:17,279
Sandy soils and around here with much

1079
00:46:14,219 --> 00:46:18,838
more Rocky and variable soils I could

1080
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,300
imagine that might be a problem but

1081
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:24,239
that's quite successfully oh really okay

1082
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:26,579
yeah so uh Bill asked about uh you know

1083
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:30,479
what are there examples of of you know

1084
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:34,440
tractor drawn steam uh readers and I'm

1085
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,960
Vaguely Familiar with some that um that

1086
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:38,460
can steam and and have the soil covered

1087
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,380
as they go there's there's like a

1088
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:42,000
covering that keeps the heat in it

1089
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,640
follows the seam

1090
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:48,179
um and I know there was some research a

1091
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:48,719
while ago uh that looked at

1092
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:51,179
um

1093
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:53,639
steam in combination with tillage

1094
00:46:51,179 --> 00:46:56,399
because it can be difficult to get the

1095
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:58,559
steam throughout that soil column so if

1096
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,480
you're if you're rototilling and also

1097
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,519
applying the steam

1098
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,219
um it seems to it seems to do a better

1099
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:08,039
job it was the the take-home message

1100
00:47:05,219 --> 00:47:10,019
that I remember so I just I'm assuming

1101
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:12,059
that there are examples of that as they

1102
00:47:10,019 --> 00:47:15,179
you know I don't know if this was like a

1103
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:18,779
research based a one-off that the

1104
00:47:15,179 --> 00:47:20,699
researcher made but um yeah and and I'd

1105
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,560
be curious to hear more about in Holland

1106
00:47:20,699 --> 00:47:24,299
are they I will try to dig up some

1107
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,460
photographs like certainly took pictures

1108
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:29,640
of it so I have to go and try to find it

1109
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:32,280
yeah just for for comparison sake for

1110
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:35,338
greenhouses is is the most common area

1111
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:37,500
where I see Steam being used and

1112
00:47:35,338 --> 00:47:40,699
um they'll they'll get the temperature

1113
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:43,920
up they'll do it by bed and so there's a

1114
00:47:40,699 --> 00:47:46,199
hose that has holes in it that allows

1115
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,119
the steam to come out and that's

1116
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:50,159
um covered each bed so I think they do

1117
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:52,858
it four times to cover its ethical

1118
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:56,699
Greenhouse another 30 minutes each

1119
00:47:52,858 --> 00:47:56,699
application yeah

1120
00:48:01,338 --> 00:48:07,139
15 years ago never really took off I

1121
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:09,239
think there's a lot of complexity with

1122
00:48:07,139 --> 00:48:11,699
um trying to drive around an orchard

1123
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:13,019
with the machine that'd be steam

1124
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:14,719
that

1125
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:16,880
um

1126
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:19,679
a lot of energy

1127
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,539
they do have it for Landscapes and then

1128
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:22,318
they've actually adapted it also to the

1129
00:48:21,539 --> 00:48:25,980
phone

1130
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:28,818
so that the heat stays in place longer

1131
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,818
foreign

1132
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,480
schools yeah yeah and that I think

1133
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:39,240
controlling the existing weeds with heat

1134
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,858
it requires less energy than going into

1135
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:46,399
the soil and actually killing the weed

1136
00:48:40,858 --> 00:48:46,400
seeds but yeah that's interesting yeah

1137
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,300
well let's set a question about

1138
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:54,118
um since you get around quite a bit in

1139
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:56,280
the state and see a lot of farmers see a

1140
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:57,300
lot of fields there's props I'm

1141
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,920
wondering you know one of the things

1142
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,839
about climate change that we've always

1143
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:03,000
talked about is the weeds are really

1144
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:05,279
gonna have a competitive even more of a

1145
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,338
competitive advantage over a lot of our

1146
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:11,819
our crop plants and I'm wondering if

1147
00:49:08,338 --> 00:49:14,338
you're starting to see some of that

1148
00:49:11,818 --> 00:49:16,739
um come to you know come to be that you

1149
00:49:14,338 --> 00:49:19,380
know start to see the species changing

1150
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:21,659
or difficulty controlling weeds may be

1151
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:23,579
related to climate change what are the

1152
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:24,779
Growers saying because yeah what do you

1153
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:26,940
what are you hearing what are you seeing

1154
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:29,880
yeah that's a great comment uh so yeah

1155
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:31,980
Greg asks uh and comments about uh

1156
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:34,440
climate change yeah bringing in

1157
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:36,838
potentially new species to this area or

1158
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:39,059
making our existing species maybe more

1159
00:49:36,838 --> 00:49:42,239
competitive with crops

1160
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:45,659
um yeah I think it's it's just very hard

1161
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:49,019
to to generalize because uh and Kerry

1162
00:49:45,659 --> 00:49:52,379
marshner and Tony and tommaso have a

1163
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:54,659
uh Smith lever project

1164
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:57,300
um looking into this and and providing

1165
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:59,460
some extension results right now and and

1166
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:02,400
they've reviewed the literature and it's

1167
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:05,639
it it's very hit or miss and species

1168
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:10,920
dependent you know based on you know C3

1169
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:12,358
C4 uh grasses uh dicots and

1170
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:15,059
um yeah

1171
00:50:12,358 --> 00:50:18,239
how certain species are gonna how will

1172
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:21,000
fare in higher CO2 versus higher

1173
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:23,519
temperature or more drought there's just

1174
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,639
so much to it that it's just it's it's

1175
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:28,858
it we can't make a generalization so for

1176
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:31,618
these educational materials we're kind

1177
00:50:28,858 --> 00:50:34,380
of providing key examples here and there

1178
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:37,200
of what you know what might happen

1179
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:39,780
um but um as far as you know what we're

1180
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:44,578
actually seeing on the ground

1181
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:46,200
um yeah uh Tony is is actively

1182
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:49,740
um looking for

1183
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:51,539
um uh Johnson grass is one that he is is

1184
00:50:49,739 --> 00:50:54,719
concerned about as it's a very

1185
00:50:51,539 --> 00:50:56,818
problematic weed south of us and so you

1186
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,679
know if that comes into New York it

1187
00:50:56,818 --> 00:51:01,318
could be in trouble

1188
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:03,118
um we we've already had uh introductions

1189
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:05,279
of of others that are herbicide

1190
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,519
resistant like Palmer amaranth which is

1191
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:11,519
I believe native to the desert Southwest

1192
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:14,219
U.S and perhaps due to climate change it

1193
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:17,699
is now able to to complete its life

1194
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:19,858
cycle in Northern climates like New York

1195
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:22,618
um and that is I think typically

1196
00:51:19,858 --> 00:51:24,900
regarded as one of the world's most

1197
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:27,119
competitive and problematic species so

1198
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:29,519
and that's unfortunately now in New York

1199
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,420
in a few different counts

1200
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:34,259
um

1201
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,260
so yeah but

1202
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:40,439
um

1203
00:51:37,818 --> 00:51:42,779
natural ecosystems you talk about

1204
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:47,300
agriculture but when I drive around I

1205
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:47,300
see you know Japanese spots

1206
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:58,380
okay that's nice

1207
00:51:53,480 --> 00:52:00,119
yeah yeah and I I I have um yeah like I

1208
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:03,019
added this small component so maybe five

1209
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:05,700
percent of my position it includes

1210
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:07,800
backyards and natural areas and so I'm

1211
00:52:05,699 --> 00:52:10,139
paying a little bit of attention but um

1212
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:14,818
I think it's mostly um you know New York

1213
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:15,719
State DEC and and others um USDA

1214
00:52:14,818 --> 00:52:18,539
um

1215
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:20,098
um there's there's someone at the USDA

1216
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:22,679
facility here who's looking at bio

1217
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:24,720
controls I think that if you remember

1218
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:27,539
purple loose strife several years ago

1219
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:29,338
that just covered places like Montezuma

1220
00:52:27,539 --> 00:52:32,039
and now you can go and and you don't

1221
00:52:29,338 --> 00:52:33,960
really see it as much as they they found

1222
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:36,900
a successful bio control it's one of the

1223
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:38,338
most successful examples of Bio control

1224
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:40,019
um and I think that that's where it

1225
00:52:38,338 --> 00:52:42,239
really has to come from that there's

1226
00:52:40,019 --> 00:52:44,460
been you know there's been efforts of

1227
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:46,500
eradication based on spraying and people

1228
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:48,000
going out with cruise but it's just so

1229
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,099
widespread at this point especially like

1230
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,420
Japanese knotweed and the garlic mustard

1231
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:53,460
that

1232
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:57,059
um you know I don't think we have the

1233
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:58,559
human power to to go out and make a

1234
00:52:57,059 --> 00:53:01,559
significant Dent unless there was a

1235
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:03,359
massive funding um but so I think that

1236
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:05,700
the way forward is really through bio

1237
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:09,420
control and with these landscape level

1238
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:11,519
issues like that and and that's an

1239
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:14,338
active area of research

1240
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:16,079
um elsewhere that I just haven't taken

1241
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:17,599
part in as of yet

1242
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,740
see

1243
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,800
all right Brian thank you that was all

1244
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:21,799
right

1245
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:37,078
this has been a production of Cornell
