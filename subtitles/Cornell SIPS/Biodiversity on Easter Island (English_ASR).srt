and

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,000
as part of this class the students spent

19
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,398
their spring break on easter island

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,759
which you know is part of chile

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,600
and they're going to talk to us today

22
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,280
about what they did

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,879
not all our class normally meets on

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,399
tuesday so

25
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,839
they couldn't

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,840
not all the students can come here today

27
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,079
hi there i'm jason thank you all for

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,439
coming

29
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:29,118
i'll be talking about santiago chile

30
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:30,399
while constructing our original interior

31
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,239
for the trip we didn't quite plan on

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,719
spending time in the city of santiago

33
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,158
however due to some unexpected issues we

34
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,158
ended up spending the entirety of our

35
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,759
first day and a portion of the second

36
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,600
day with big city

37
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,200
nevertheless we welcomed the opportunity

38
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,640
and ended up enjoying our time in

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,320
santiago

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,799
after checking into our hotel which was

41
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,599
very modernistic and comfortable we sat

42
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,000
down on foot to find most dominicos

43
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,478
which is an open-air handcraft market

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
that features handmade artisanal goods

45
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:59,759
here we spent a few hours pursuing the

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,599
wares and crafts which included

47
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,040
everything from pet parrots to ceramics

48
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:04,319
and jewelry

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,479
following the time we spent at los

50
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,878
dominicos we all enjoyed delicious meals

51
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,120
found in a restaurant specializating in

52
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,719
brewed inn cuisine

53
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,800
the following day before settling out

54
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,479
for easter island we hopped on a double

55
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,640
decker bus and received a tour of

56
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,560
santiago and learned about its history

57
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,159
with the assistant of a guide

58
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,318
we passed through its many districts and

59
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,479
saw a handful of important sites which

60
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:29,039
included the palacio de la moneda which

61
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,238
serves as the seat of the president

62
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,318
after an

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,840
informative tour of santiago we head to

64
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,839
the airport and we're on our way to

65
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,840
eastern

66
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:39,919
so

67
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,159
um the village of honduras was like any

68
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,079
other village we've ever been to

69
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,000
it was very small and had a few

70
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,719
cobblestone roads that

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,400
led on to

72
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,959
the small beach in town that seemed to

73
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,800
get the social center of their island

74
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,800
there were bars and restaurants that

75
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,080
lined the streets where there was open

76
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,560
air ceiling

77
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,840
oh is this tropical island music that

78
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,360
you could hear playing

79
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,319
we learned that

80
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,040
the main mode of transportation was most

81
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:13,119
they had a lot of cars and trucks but

82
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,039
because of the

83
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,360
dirt roads there they use a lot of dirt

84
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,439
bikes

85
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,360
and once in a while you pass on the

86
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,560
street by someone

87
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,440
on horseback

88
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,439
riding around town

89
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,878
we were also granted the company of a

90
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,199
lot of

91
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,199
many dogs

92
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,158
um

93
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,200
they

94
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:36,959
at first we thought they were all

95
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,039
straight but we quickly learned from our

96
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,199
tour guide that they're actually

97
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:45,439
um they're all owned they're just part

98
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:46,639
of that laid-back kind of life

99
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:47,280
um

100
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,598
the

101
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,000
town also blessed us with a palm sunday

102
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,878
mass with a song

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,878
or a song

104
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,560
which is their

105
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,080
traditional language

106
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,759
there was also a fresh produce market

107
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,000
and plenty of shops and superheroes for

108
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,000
stuff

109
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,318
so while we're in easter island and

110
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:11,280
santiago we got the chance to experience

111
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:13,359
various delicious foods um

112
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,878
so breakfast usually consists of fresh

113
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,680
fruit

114
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,560
eggs crepes

115
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,199
here's

116
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,478
the omelet that we got meat and always

117
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,919
fresh

118
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,079
fruit juice

119
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,918
so the meals that we usually had were

120
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,439
very meat heavy so it's hard to find

121
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:31,680
vegetarian meals

122
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,478
most meals

123
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,519
included freshly caught fish

124
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,560
and

125
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,959
others included local beef and chicken

126
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,000
the meals also included

127
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:45,918
island-grown taro and sweet potatoes but

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,360
the sweet potatoes there actually what

129
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,198
they call sweet potatoes are actually

130
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,720
yams and they

131
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,960
came they're very prevalent on the

132
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,960
island and came in both yet orange and

133
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,959
purple

134
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,080
so the meals there were tended to be a

135
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,279
mix between both chile and traditional

136
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:05,599
food but with more seafood and also

137
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,719
more westernized meals like we had pizza

138
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,680
one night

139
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,440
um

140
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,038
we all got to try ceviche which was the

141
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,600
first for me and ended up being really

142
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,839
delicious and dr b got to have his

143
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,639
favorite traditional chilean drink from

144
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:18,638
pisco sour

145
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:23,680
and so but due to the island's

146
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,759
remote location and the high information

147
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,639
costs all food prices were really really

148
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,560
high

149
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,400
but overall we all really enjoyed the

150
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,399
food and enjoyed what they had

151
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,919
all right

152
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,038
a little bit about what a moai and off

153
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,799
you are

154
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,639
here you'll see a picture of the moai

155
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,199
which are the human-like figures which

156
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,199
are carved of stone and they are really

157
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,280
known to have distinct hands and long

158
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,840
fingernails and they're standing on a

159
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,478
platform which is called an ahu the ahu

160
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,319
are long with wings and they have

161
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:57,038
stones in front of them these are

162
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,399
primarily used as a way to worship the

163
00:05:57,038 --> 00:05:59,839
ancestors

164
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,719
some people actually actually come in

165
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:05,359
front of the ahu and sit and gather to

166
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,160
have different ceremonies in order to

167
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,240
um worship their ancestors

168
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,319
we visited two different offices here

169
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,759
you'll see this is ontatongaruki where

170
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,479
they actually have 15 standing moai

171
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,160
another one we went to was ahu tahai but

172
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,240
they didn't have quite as many moai but

173
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,400
then they were as well preserved but it

174
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,600
was still a very well established ahu on

175
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,560
the island

176
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,879
um also at ongota high we were able to

177
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,120
see this structure which was uh

178
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,439
the remnants of an old house which was

179
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,478
actually the way they had it was um just

180
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,478
this

181
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,639
round framework with a canoe was

182
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,879
actually placed on top of it and so it

183
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,240
was just a very small shelter that they

184
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,159
would just use because they were mainly

185
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,680
outdoor people because of the good

186
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,520
weather and but they would just have

187
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,439
this small shelter that they would use

188
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,758
to sleep in and the most their time has

189
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,439
been outdoors

190
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,400
so on our second day we visited the

191
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,918
volcanic crater uh rana radar which is

192
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:01,679
on the side of the quarry where most of

193
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:02,399
the moai were carved

194
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,079
and

195
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,038
we had a special opportunity here to

196
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:09,839
talk with archaeologists from ucla who

197
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:12,159
are completing um an excavation of some

198
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,318
of the moa which you can see right here

199
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,520
these statues were carved in any

200
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,680
position that they would kind of fit

201
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,279
into the rock using stone tools called

202
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,598
toki um

203
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,279
and these are made of ball salt and

204
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:24,719
subsidian rocks

205
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,559
um

206
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,400
the spine was the last they would carve

207
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,759
face up on their backs the spine was the

208
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:31,279
last portion

209
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,280
carved and cut away from the rock and

210
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,559
then they would be set up in a pit so

211
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,758
that the back of the mower could have

212
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,120
carved and often had interesting designs

213
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,120
called petroglyphs in them

214
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,079
around 90 moai have been excavated from

215
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,679
the quarry and a lot of them were

216
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,758
excavated in non-archaeological

217
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,240
conditions which has made piecing

218
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,560
together the history of the moai much

219
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,079
tougher for archaeologists today

220
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,959
we also

221
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,478
had the opportunity to see the moai

222
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,478
in transport

223
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,560
down from the quarry in places where

224
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,478
they had fallen or broken

225
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,399
and um

226
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,318
also been placed into the ground and

227
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,000
just never taken out of there and so the

228
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,000
soil has filled it around it had a very

229
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,360
eerie and

230
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,360
comparison piece of that here

231
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,239
was another quarter we got to visit on

232
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,199
our itinerary

233
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,280
it's the quarry where the top mounts

234
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,120
were made top-notch are

235
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,958
these um

236
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,759
they're almost like half they're round

237
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,759
uh

238
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,759
carved out of red storia it's a

239
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,519
different rock than the moai were carved

240
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,759
out of

241
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,759
only certain loba i got to wear these

242
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,000
and it showed that they were at a higher

243
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:48,319
power taking on the chief

244
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,320
um

245
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,959
there are several theories about how the

246
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,278
top knots were placed on top of the foam

247
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,439
line one of the theories is whether or

248
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:01,360
not the moai were laying down and they

249
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,880
kind of like tied up with rope on their

250
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,120
heads and then they erected it straight

251
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:08,838
up um but these are all theories and we

252
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,839
don't really know exactly

253
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,360
so

254
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,040
during our time at uh in charlotte we

255
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,120
got to hide to one of those several

256
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,240
volcanoes the three major ones one of

257
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,000
them being twitty

258
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,959
it took us roughly 30 minutes to reach

259
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,559
the top of the highest point there

260
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,719
and once there we were amazed by how

261
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,319
isolated we published in the distance

262
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,320
and they're basically a thousand miles

263
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,560
of uninterrupted to largely

264
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,600
uninterrupted sea just anywhere you can

265
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,278
see

266
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,720
and so we then followed romo and our

267
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:40,240
guide to the other side of the hills

268
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,240
where there were the sites of very early

269
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,600
moai statues

270
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,039
it's been determined that these statues

271
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,959
were left at the smallest and then they

272
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,519
got larger as time went on they had

273
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:51,039
carving larger and larger statues and so

274
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,839
these in the line were likely carved

275
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:56,399
between the states of 9118

276
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,800
after this site we continued on to a

277
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,799
cave made by a lava tube known as the

278
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,120
cave of the virgins where the women were

279
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,958
once kept to pale their skin because

280
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,879
paleness was a sign of beauty in that

281
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,958
culture so they were kept there for

282
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,879
months and so we got to crawl in there

283
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:13,838
five at a time and see the petroglyphs

284
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:13,838
on the side of the wall

285
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,159
okay so i'm gonna talk about random cow

286
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:22,879
um it's one of the larger volcanic

287
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:25,600
craters on the island it's about 200 000

288
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,879
years old and a mild diameter and to

289
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,639
this day it's probably one of the most

290
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,278
incredible things i've ever seen

291
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:33,679
um not only is it aesthetically really

292
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,679
pretty but it is also like an enormous

293
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,039
source of um

294
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,039
sustaining the population of easter

295
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,000
island with its like vast array of

296
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,559
plants

297
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,799
uh in life within the crater um we

298
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,479
learned about ramona regarding us a lot

299
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,719
about like the biodiversity

300
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,480
that is in the crater there's medicinal

301
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,320
burn that lies with the computer that is

302
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,120
using cancer

303
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,600
there's also been analysis of the mud

304
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,360
water composition that has been

305
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,920
determined to stuff the growth of dna

306
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,919
increasing the longer video on life

307
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,240
which i mean you can kind of say that

308
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:09,679
and set up committee like that

309
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,000
and as well as recently there have been

310
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,838
um plans have served as their original

311
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,639
medicine address

312
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:21,200
which as ramona told us the rapid new

313
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:21,199
year people get vip access to them

314
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,399
so cool hero is the fertility zone that

315
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:29,278
the ancient refugee people would play to

316
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,440
promote

317
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,838
fertility among its people the noise

318
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,959
made by the fertility zone resembles a

319
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,040
common shell

320
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:39,199
fertility petroglyphs are carved into

321
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,958
stone all over its surface

322
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,720
showing the significance of fertility in

323
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,399
their culture ramon taught us how to

324
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,079
play the stone which can be quite the

325
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,559
task you can either

326
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,879
cuff one end the other side of that hole

327
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:53,359
and hit it to make the sound or you can

328
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:58,078
blow into it so a few of us gave it a

329
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,079
try and only joy is here was successful

330
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,839
um

331
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,600
there are also bugs calling in another

332
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,000
bit which also made it a little

333
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,399
difficult

334
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,600
so our next stop this day was to enable

335
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,278
the world

336
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,440
and this is a stone that is said to have

337
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:15,519
been carried to the island by its first

338
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,120
king hotu matua

339
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,879
having to travel thousands of miles

340
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,278
across the pacific where this large

341
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:23,919
stone proved its meaning to the rocky

342
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:26,159
people it is said to possess heavy doses

343
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:27,360
of mana the spiritual power bestowed by

344
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,039
the gods

345
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,360
from facing one's hands on the stone

346
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,799
mana will bring them health and energy

347
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,639
we all got the chance to touch the stone

348
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:38,679
before leaving the site in hopes that we

349
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,680
would absorb some of this energy

350
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,000
so i'm going to talk about boating

351
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,399
struggling and tell you guys a little

352
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,480
bit about the vermeer cult um so on our

353
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,360
first date i like revisited random cat

354
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,839
which i talked about before and abrondo

355
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,000
and um

356
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,839
back um in history historically aroma

357
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,120
used to be the center of the village

358
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,600
and um

359
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,560
during the birmingham era which is when

360
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,040
basically you had rivaling tribes or

361
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,879
plans and they each year

362
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,679
they put a competition where like young

363
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:12,639
boys would um compete to lead for the

364
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:14,638
following year so they would swim out to

365
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,600
the islands which were shown um in the

366
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,919
picture of montenegro

367
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,720
and they would swim out there and the

368
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:25,599
person who collects an egg and gets back

369
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,399
up the mountain um first is the one who

370
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,519
will basically go back here and um

371
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:34,720
basically group the academy intact and

372
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,240
um you have to um

373
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,480
they also spent some time out on the

374
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,240
islands as they got there um meditating

375
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,240
and kind of getting touched spiritually

376
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,839
with um

377
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,360
so that was interesting we learned about

378
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,040
that from up there and then

379
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,039
later in the week we had a chance to go

380
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:53,120
out and on a boat ride and um see like

381
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,639
the islands up close and which was

382
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,440
really cool the water was beautiful it

383
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,959
was

384
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,839
like the brightest blue indigo you've

385
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:01,439
ever seen it was really pretty and um it

386
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,959
was just amazing to see that like you

387
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,480
want to swim out there and actually come

388
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,599
back and skip oh you don't see it here

389
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,480
but you can probably see that make sure

390
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,240
that the

391
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,759
that one side is pretty steep so it's

392
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,360
been pretty difficult to scale like

393
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,879
trying to keep an eye on your hat and a

394
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,320
lot of times our tour guide promotes

395
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:17,039
that that people put in there like could

396
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,040
put in their mouths

397
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:21,679
so and then it was like a really rainy

398
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:25,278
day when we did this and um for most of

399
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,799
the simple there's lots of opportunities

400
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:28,320
and it was interesting to see because

401
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,559
there weren't a lot of fish or anything

402
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,160
and it was really like not your typical

403
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:35,838
snorkeling experience because it wasn't

404
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:37,519
like that much like coral life or um

405
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,360
anything like in the sea very much like

406
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,240
you saw probably free fish but it was

407
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,720
awesome

408
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,480
nonetheless um and on the way back we

409
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,720
saw about like

410
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,920
multiple rainbows framing the

411
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,920
science that were really pretty

412
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,958
much about time we spent

413
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,039
learning about local flora at the

414
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:59,679
botanical garden column kind of is

415
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:01,759
extremely active in

416
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,599
conservation of biodiversity and

417
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,198
involving the local community in their

418
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,399
efforts

419
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:08,719
they grow

420
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,639
a lot of our academic and

421
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,759
medicinal plants in their nursery and

422
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,839
distribution to a local to the locals

423
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:20,838
and last year they gave out thirty

424
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,839
thousand plans to the proper new people

425
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,159
oh also companies are currently involved

426
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,278
in attempting to reintroduce and plan on

427
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,159
more

428
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,600
engaging or endangered plants back to

429
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,399
easter island

430
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,399
for example they're

431
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,239
trees which are endemic to each island

432
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,278
and almost when

433
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,440
almost everything at some point

434
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,679
they also have a

435
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,759
the traditional proper new agricultural

436
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:00,000
methods like the

437
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,000
metal wine which are stone structures

438
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,278
built around the plants to protect them

439
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,399
from livestock and wind or strong water

440
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:12,559
and creating a microclimate to provide

441
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,559
the optimum moisture and temperature

442
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:17,758
so we got to visit the hospital on rough

443
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,198
week

444
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,360
because easter island has a long

445
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:23,359
tradition of using herbal medicines many

446
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,600
islanders have wanted them to be used in

447
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,199
the hospital so as a compromise there's

448
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,959
a special room attached to the hospital

449
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:30,479
with a separate entrance

450
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,159
and this allows patients to have a

451
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,480
choice of choosing

452
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,240
traditional or occidental medicine

453
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,920
and we were able to tour the facilities

454
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,079
and talk with pamela

455
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:42,000
the president of the board of wrestling

456
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,159
traditional medicine

457
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,440
and she told us that herbal treatments

458
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,719
are the only

459
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,720
one aspect of their holistic approach to

460
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,480
healing which treats the entire mind and

461
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,240
body of the patient

462
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,000
pamela works with three other islanders

463
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,159
in addition to visiting physicians and

464
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,759
anthropology students

465
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:01,278
in order to stretch the very limited

466
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,640
budget of the traditional medicine

467
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:06,798
program kayla is now using a radio show

468
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,520
to help the rap many people learn how to

469
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:12,639
grow and use medicinal plants at home as

470
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,639
well as hospitals

471
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,798
so the artisan market was one of the

472
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:20,798
last steps of me uh

473
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:22,318
towards the end of our trip we went to

474
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,240
the artisan market down the road from

475
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,078
our hotel essentially it's kind of a

476
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,640
gift shop of our experience so we were

477
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:31,918
able to grab a couple souvenirs there

478
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:35,759
and uh there was a plenty of handcrafted

479
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,520
handcrafted souvenirs and uh turtleness

480
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:40,079
stone and wood and it's just really

481
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:43,038
awesome in traditional

482
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,079
crafts and one of our classmates liz was

483
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:47,359
able to

484
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:49,119
purchase a handcrafted wood structure

485
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,558
that she actually saw the woman doing at

486
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:54,719
the site so that was

487
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:54,720
kind of cool and she was really upset

488
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:58,798
so after one of our last dinners

489
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:01,038
together on the island we headed to

490
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:02,879
karikari a local performance held in the

491
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,558
town that draws in both native and

492
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,120
foreign people

493
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,319
so when the instrumental section of this

494
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,319
act came out there were a lot of

495
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,599
drummers and guitarists and auxiliary

496
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:13,119
percussionists

497
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,599
we were immediately impressed with their

498
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,359
talent energy express through the music

499
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,719
next the dancers and singers filled the

500
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,839
stage of their traditional song and

501
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,038
dance

502
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,558
here

503
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:24,079
now i can't think of the most exciting

504
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:27,119
part of the night as a part of the

505
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:27,119
karikari show

506
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:37,440
several of us including myself got the

507
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,840
exhilarating opportunity to express

508
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,960
ourselves revenue style

509
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:42,959
one was for me quite

510
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,559
um she fit right in with the vibrant and

511
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,798
awful culture here so after seeing the

512
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:55,359
karikari ballet um

513
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,720
it seemed very apparent that they

514
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,319
probably perform this in order to keep

515
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,319
the traditional rap and unique culture

516
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,159
alive through its younger people

517
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,480
and it seems as though it serves as an

518
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,798
educational tool by exposing spectators

519
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,798
to their

520
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:13,439
cultural right so anaconda beach is the

521
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:15,678
beach on easter island

522
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,279
um it is said to be the landing place of

523
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,080
polynesian chief

524
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:22,720
and and settlers so these settlers

525
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:25,599
created the first settlements on rapidly

526
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,000
um we going up to the beach uh ramon

527
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:31,519
told us of a tsunami that hit the island

528
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,079
previously and wiped out 95 of the sand

529
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,359
so what we saw there was what was left

530
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:38,399
and it still looked like a gorgeous

531
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:40,798
beach that you'd want to be at um it's

532
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,400
currently home to two ahus as you

533
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:43,759
learned earlier

534
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,960
one of which is currently under

535
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:49,679
construction

536
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,679
and other homes six moai statues

537
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:55,440
now this was a particularly

538
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,360
significant day for myself

539
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,200
because it was my first time stepping

540
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:02,879
foot into an ocean

541
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,880
market problems we don't get out much

542
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:09,839
great experience the water was a deep

543
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:11,840
deep blue very salty

544
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:15,798
we were all loving life dr v was

545
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:15,798
floating off into the distance

546
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:36,798
um on our last day we got the

547
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:38,960
opportunity to check to the top of manga

548
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:41,359
taravaca via horseback

549
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,400
um magoterovaca is the highest point on

550
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:45,279
easter island at 507 meters

551
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,798
um

552
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,720
we

553
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,798
so we this was our only opportunity to

554
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,720
get to the top so we're very excited

555
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:55,119
um the views were incredible the entire

556
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,759
way up as you can see and when we got to

557
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:59,599
the top we all jumped off our horses and

558
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,960
left them at a watering hole to graze

559
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,839
and we all watched

560
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,319
it wasn't very far but the very top

561
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:08,720
and um so when we were at the top we got

562
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:11,359
to take even more incredible pictures

563
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,679
and we could see the curvature of the

564
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:15,359
earth on the horizon because you can see

565
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,440
so much of the ocean around you which

566
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,759
was really incredible

567
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,000
on our way back down we got to

568
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,679
see even more great views of hangaroa

569
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,038
and the ocean

570
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,200
around us

571
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:27,200
and

572
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,759
the weather held out perfectly it was a

573
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,279
beautiful sunny day we all got plenty

574
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:34,319
sunburned

575
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:35,599
and

576
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:37,119
but just right as we were getting back

577
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,119
to the ranch it started to drizzle a

578
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:40,798
little which actually was welcome after

579
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,798
the hot day in the sun

580
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:45,119
um so this was actually the high point

581
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:48,480
of my trip and i think everyone agrees

582
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,479
that it was a well worthwhile threat

583
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,200
so uh

584
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:55,119
on richard childers i was the defective

585
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,519
translator for the trip being almost

586
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,639
fluent in spanish and so when we're here

587
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,599
in the states we never really worry

588
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,720
about whether or not the guy in

589
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:03,359
starbucks is going to be able to

590
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,200
understand our latte order as i simply

591
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:06,959
given we'll be able to communicate to

592
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,640
express ourselves and what we want

593
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,159
because the fluent spanish speaker took

594
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,159
the lazy route and only really traveled

595
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,080
abroad in south america but it's

596
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,520
sometimes difficult for me to understand

597
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:17,119
this concept of not being able to

598
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:18,319
express myself

599
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:20,719
so i had the pleasure to put my

600
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,000
authority to good use during our trip

601
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,919
and although there were times i forgot

602
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
what language i was speaking and to whom

603
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,600
it's a flurry of questions i never had

604
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,279
to deal with the concept of not being

605
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:30,399
able to get my point across

606
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,720
of just not being able to pull the

607
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,240
waiter aside and ask if this strange

608
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,720
sauce i've never seen before has

609
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,240
shellfish or if the empanadas are vegan

610
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,079
or not

611
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,919
so although i tried to find answers for

612
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:43,038
as many questions as i could especially

613
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,000
in the little times which were kind of

614
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:45,679
crazy

615
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,200
uh i know it must have been a hassle for

616
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,640
you to deal with

617
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,720
and so i also know there's a fair bit of

618
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,799
culture that one misses out on in such

619
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,640
cases there were times when locals would

620
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:56,400
crack little jokes or tell stories might

621
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,880
be the only one chuckling

622
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,679
creeper in the corner

623
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,919
and believe me if uh retelling a joke

624
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,440
less than the humor translating it makes

625
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,120
it ten times worse

626
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,400
and this was no exception

627
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,678
i want to thank all of you who left

628
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,880
anyhow

629
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,880
sorry i couldn't make it more

630
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,080
understandable

631
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,480
so i guess in general i'd like to

632
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,558
recognize my fellow group members

633
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,000
both for their patience and flexibility

634
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:21,440
and for their dedication to going and

635
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,038
learning and having fun no matter what

636
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,038
the language barriers and i hope that

637
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:28,158
through my translation i kind of ease

638
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:28,158
some of these difficulties

639
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,159
so now we'll begin the part of the

640
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:36,720
presentation where we talk about the

641
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:40,080
many research projects that different

642
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,919
groups of students on the trip

643
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,519
developed and participated in throughout

644
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,520
the trip

645
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,440
the project group that i was in charge

646
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,679
of was a

647
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,080
sort of plant identification scavenger

648
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,840
hunt in which we

649
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,599
looked at the biodiversity on ireland by

650
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,038
comparing what species we thought would

651
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:58,719
be there from

652
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:00,640
looking at

653
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,640
finding species names in books and on

654
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,440
the internet that were connected with

655
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,679
easter island and before the trip we

656
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,519
were able to find 131 species names

657
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:13,519
specifically associated with mr island

658
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,839
but finding a total species number was

659
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:18,960
quite challenging and we came up with

660
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,798
212 from a few different sources online

661
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,079
and

662
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,879
this was a number that was challenging

663
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,558
to find because often um

664
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,880
the number 47 would be mentioned as the

665
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:31,359
number of native higher plant species

666
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,679
going out which is kind of ambiguous

667
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:36,319
um this fairly small species count you

668
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,559
notice the idea that the biodiversity in

669
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,798
the island would be very low and that it

670
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:42,879
would be fairly thin and desolate

671
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:44,879
however upon arriving we discovered that

672
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,640
this was not in fact the case

673
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,880
much of the island is covered in rolling

674
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,120
grass vistas and you wouldn't know it

675
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,919
from a large variety of trees mango

676
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:56,158
avocado palm china berry eucalyptus

677
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:59,759
beautiful cultivated tropical flowers

678
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:02,400
and plants general lush vegetation

679
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,919
of the island's only town angora

680
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,159
we were lucky enough to visit our tour

681
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,720
guide's house for lunch and explore his

682
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,640
extensive and frankly overwhelming

683
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,558
gardens which contain many classic

684
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,960
tropical plants that are found across

685
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:16,720
the globe which we hadn't included

686
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,519
previously on our list

687
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,159
overall we photographed 101 more species

688
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:23,599
than the original 131 and we're also

689
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,278
able to find and photograph many of

690
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:26,639
those as well

691
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:28,640
the two methods for attaining our

692
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,840
species counts were combined allowing us

693
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,159
to account for 232 species on the island

694
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:36,639
20 more than the number of 212 that were

695
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,120
previously documented

696
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,919
so after the trip we all everyone in our

697
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:41,678
group

698
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,520
was reflected on the plant biodiversity

699
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,200
on the island we came up with some

700
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:47,278
interesting conclusions

701
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,840
um

702
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:52,159
the species count is low especially even

703
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,119
in comparison to our local infra new

704
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,720
york

705
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,798
in many ways this actually provided a

706
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,558
greater experience of the concept of

707
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:00,558
biodiversity because we were able to

708
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:02,480
understand the vastness and subtlety of

709
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,720
difference within the kingdom plantae on

710
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,679
a comprehensible scale

711
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,880
even if only 232 species

712
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,679
we learned about and experienced first

713
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,000
first-hand harmful medicinal delicious

714
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,240
and fascinating plants found all across

715
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,960
the island we saw grasses that made

716
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,440
horses ill plants that treat cancer and

717
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,120
enjoyed fresh mangoes off of a tree just

718
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,400
steps away from our hotel on a daily

719
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:25,839
basis

720
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,400
the prevalence of food crops was

721
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:30,000
especially notable in terms of

722
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,640
people's ability to create their own

723
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,798
sustainable paradigms

724
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,038
the biodiversity was also emphasized by

725
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:39,038
the hotspot that

726
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:41,440
alexa mentioned grano cow in which

727
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:43,038
almost all the plants on the island grow

728
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,360
and some plants that are found nowhere

729
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:47,278
else on the island grow

730
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,000
so like most people haven't considered

731
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:52,159
this term the oed to find biodiversity

732
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,679
is the diversity of plant animal life

733
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,080
especially as represented by the number

734
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,798
of texan species we discovered that this

735
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:00,960
term is both nuanced and complicated and

736
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:02,558
carries numerous implications and it's

737
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,319
important to consider in the context of

738
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:06,158
specific places

739
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,639
simply counting species numbers skews

740
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,080
one's perspective of a place and of

741
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,919
their perception of ecosystems

742
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,519
sustainability and value

743
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,038
and so it also is a fatalistic

744
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:16,558
perspective for a place like easter

745
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:19,038
island and failed to consider that the

746
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:21,440
people like the ravanui can restore the

747
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:23,278
biodiversity of their environment by

748
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,798
attempting to document biodiversity of

749
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:26,480
the stereotypical way we ended up

750
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:28,558
discovering that this concept is much

751
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,919
harder to nail down than wants to be

752
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:31,519
thought and it means more than just a

753
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,360
number

754
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:36,960
and these are some pictures of plants

755
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:40,000
that can be found both native and

756
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,000
a little bit more typical

757
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,440
okay so hi i'm alexa

758
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,278
i me and maddie kind of took

759
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,000
charge of this we came up with the idea

760
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:53,119
of transects and megan um helped us out

761
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,519
with um

762
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:57,599
transects in the island um

763
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:59,679
and we kind of did something similar to

764
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:03,480
eliza's group but we kind of tried to

765
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,480
make it a little bit more

766
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,798
um but we decided to do the objective of

767
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,319
our play divider csa was to assess the

768
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,079
composition of advanced species

769
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:17,038
throughout eastern island

770
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:19,278
based on our data and um so given the

771
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:20,558
history of the deforestation oyster

772
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,679
island and the

773
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:26,240
depletion of the native platfora it was

774
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,960
a big question in our minds as to like

775
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,880
okay what the species are there and like

776
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,038
where what is their spread like on the

777
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,960
island so our goal is to obtain a

778
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:36,798
quantitative analysis of the species

779
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,278
diversity at various locations on the

780
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:41,200
island by calculating like a percentage

781
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:43,679
of abundance of

782
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,640
each species in each study that we

783
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,038
visited

784
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,038
um so prior to departure our group and

785
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:52,000
liz's group can work together to compile

786
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:53,038
a plan species id booklet um

787
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,398
off the internet and like getting

788
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,720
pictures on the internet that we can

789
00:28:54,398 --> 00:29:00,319
identify what we found and while on the

790
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,278
island we um took transects at each um

791
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:02,720
spot

792
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:05,038
as many spots as we could that we

793
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,558
visited and our train set was eight

794
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:10,558
meters in length and we did 400 watts

795
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:12,558
four meter you know four one meter

796
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:14,960
clocks thoughts

797
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:16,720
to transact and photograph these species

798
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,440
that we found on the transect and

799
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,480
surrounding it as well

800
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,640
and

801
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,759
it identified it using the previous iv

802
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,840
build

803
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:28,079
we took data at

804
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:31,519
random rare to the highest point of

805
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:33,278
mafia terribaca which is photographed

806
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,398
hoiki peninsula

807
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:36,720
konam

808
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,719
um

809
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:44,480
so the the poster in the hallway shows a

810
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,720
figure with the species compositions

811
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,798
that we found and we found that there

812
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,880
was a range of abundances and varieties

813
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:53,519
of different species at each site

814
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,760
each all sites though had a large number

815
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,319
of varying species of grass and

816
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:00,319
speculation says that this grassland

817
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,879
landscape has existed on the island

818
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:04,960
since the natives over harvested the

819
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,559
trees for timber and overused slash and

820
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,319
burn on agriculture techniques to feed

821
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:12,319
the overpopulation

822
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,720
in the 15th century the peak of this

823
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:16,558
populance was recorded between 7 000 and

824
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,919
10 000 inhabitants

825
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:18,798
on the island

826
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,799
but it's

827
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:22,079
controversial however whether or not

828
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:23,599
this directly related in the

829
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:25,759
deforestation

830
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:28,079
regardless deforestation

831
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:31,200
did lead to dwindling and

832
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:33,519
extinction of various

833
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,000
original native species

834
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:38,879
an example of this being the native palm

835
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,640
tree which was harvested for lumber and

836
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,600
all the nuts were eaten by both humans

837
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,520
and rats that were brought to the island

838
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:47,918
as a result it was eliminated as a

839
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,879
species

840
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,240
our when comparing the results of the

841
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,039
various sites

842
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,200
on you can see the difference in native

843
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:59,599
versus invasive between konaf and the

844
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,240
other sites quite obviously

845
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:05,439
this is due to conex restoration

846
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,440
project for the native plants of easter

847
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,080
island so within their borders they

848
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,399
contained much less invasive species

849
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:15,038
but outside of their control was quite

850
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:17,199
the opposite so the establishment of

851
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:18,879
invasive species especially facilitated

852
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,840
in the areas where there is no

853
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,919
restoration of projects

854
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:26,720
in the future increased number and size

855
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,240
of transects on in more locations would

856
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,720
probably be needed to get an accurate

857
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,319
biodiversity assay of the island

858
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,159
an investigation into why each site um

859
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:37,918
where it's composed of different species

860
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,399
would also be really interesting and

861
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,600
could be done by

862
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,439
a more

863
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:45,038
comprehensive composite plant

864
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,640
composition species throughout the

865
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:48,640
island and studies of the various

866
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,919
microclimates and histories and

867
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,919
topography of the land

868
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:57,599
so i will be presenting massive bonds

869
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,919
research objectives and findings

870
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:02,558
you can be here for the presentation but

871
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:05,440
he will be here after

872
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:07,119
i don't know 15-20 minutes if anybody

873
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,120
has questions for him

874
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:10,879
so the goal of messi's research project

875
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:13,278
was to conduct a survey of the plants

876
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,440
using revenue in medicine approximately

877
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:17,839
80 of the world's population relies

878
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,759
primarily on natural health products as

879
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:21,599
sources of medicine

880
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,679
this occurs even in areas where western

881
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:25,839
biomedicine is available due to easier

882
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,240
access cultural preference and lower

883
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:30,079
cost easter island is an ideal location

884
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,319
to survey medicinal plants because the

885
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:33,439
use of herbal medicines is a strong part

886
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:35,759
of their culture

887
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,519
this island hospital or the island

888
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:38,879
hospital even includes an attached

889
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,759
clinic where traditional medicines are

890
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,679
administered like discussed before

891
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:45,519
because very few books and articles have

892
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,080
been written about the ref revenue and

893
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,000
ethnobotany most information was made by

894
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:52,720
interviewing four of the islanders who

895
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,798
are showing us archaeological sites

896
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,399
ramon our tour guide also

897
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:57,839
helped us out with this

898
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,079
he grew up on the island and used many

899
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:02,240
medicinal plants regularly regularly

900
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:04,319
such as a mixture of ginger root and

901
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,919
sugar cane which was taken for coughs

902
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:07,678
and stomach cramps

903
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,519
while ramon drove us around the island

904
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,840
he also pointed out plants like castor

905
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,720
bean soaring along the road which can be

906
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,720
used to ease joint pain and inflammation

907
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,240
one of her mom's friends had even spent

908
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,399
several years being treated at the

909
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,640
hospital with very little effect and

910
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,319
after being switched using castor bean

911
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,919
instead of

912
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:28,319
contemporary medicine her condition

913
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,759
rapid rapidly improved so that's an

914
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,678
interesting story

915
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,000
another important source of

916
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,480
ethnobotanical information was george

917
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,480
the growing manager of pronoun

918
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,480
he described several important medicinal

919
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,079
species one of these is how naco naco

920
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,558
a plant in the nightshade family which

921
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:48,720
produces a small tomato-like berry this

922
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:51,519
fruit is very nutritious and is eaten to

923
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,278
treat rashes and stomach illness

924
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,399
one of the most interesting plants we

925
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:58,398
saw was matua hua a fern that has shown

926
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:00,398
high potential in tests as an

927
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:02,319
anti-cancer drug

928
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:04,398
the islanders drink a tea made from its

929
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:07,599
roots to treat fractures sprains

930
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:08,799
menstrual cramps burns and bruises

931
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:11,118
the person we met with the most

932
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,159
knowledge of verbal medicine was pamela

933
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,599
puck

934
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,639
from the traditional side of the

935
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,720
hospital

936
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,800
she grows dozens of plants at her house

937
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,799
on conapt property in other locations on

938
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,240
the island used for treating for

939
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,240
patients

940
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,078
this project identified a total of 23

941
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,519
medicinal plants representing 20

942
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,119
different families

943
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:30,719
however this is most likely only a

944
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,000
fraction of all of the plants used on

945
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,759
easter island

946
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,838
because of the use of herbal treatments

947
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,079
on the island is still alive and well

948
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:40,000
both at the hospital and in daily living

949
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,839
easter island provided

950
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,079
an ideal location to study not only the

951
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:46,838
patients but the context of how they are

952
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:49,599
integrated into rapid

953
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:51,039
culture all right so many of us being

954
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,480
from horse backgrounds thought it would

955
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:54,800
be interesting to

956
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,440
study horses and diversity effects on

957
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,079
the island so elizabeth jay and myself

958
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,760
headed up this research group

959
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,839
um we learned that earlier in the

960
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,359
history on easter island

961
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:09,519
horses were consumed as a source of food

962
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:10,319
but now that biodiversity

963
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:12,719
is

964
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,720
on its way upward and resources are more

965
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:16,879
readily available the horse meat is no

966
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:19,039
longer needed

967
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,240
but because of the overpopulation of

968
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:23,039
horses

969
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:25,118
uh many of the natives would like to see

970
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:27,759
the consumption of horses promoted once

971
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,920
again particularly population

972
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,960
currently on the island there are 5 000

973
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,280
horses

974
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,159
and 5 800 people so it's just about a

975
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,160
one to one ratio

976
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,920
when talking to the researchers at konap

977
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:44,879
they said that ideally they'd like to

978
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,400
see two to four hectares per horse

979
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,240
on the island

980
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:53,039
and the island is 160 hectares

981
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:53,039
square kilometers

982
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,560
so

983
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,800
when doing the map you would need 100 to

984
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:02,320
200 square kilometers of land so they

985
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,320
are dealing with space issues

986
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:10,640
when talking to konap

987
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:12,480
their goal is to reintroduce the

988
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:14,639
speed like native species

989
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,400
and various other plants to the island

990
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,639
and they're facing many issues with

991
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,680
horses as far as keeping those plants

992
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:23,759
alive so they're often building barriers

993
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:26,480
around the plants shrunkery

994
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,920
what not to keep the horses out

995
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,920
and if you go back to the previous

996
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,838
picture they're trying to keep the

997
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,480
horses away from the moai statues the

998
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:36,960
more the horses are using the ahus and

999
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,119
the scratching posts so they're actually

1000
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,358
eroding away the statues

1001
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,358
so they put in these turnstiles that

1002
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:45,119
ideally only humans are

1003
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:47,119
physically capable

1004
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,119
but

1005
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,800
there are horses on the other side and

1006
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,838
they are grazing directly in front of

1007
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,960
the eyes

1008
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:56,400
and using them as rather close to it

1009
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,720
they're doing what they can to keep them

1010
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:02,320
out jason can you go back are

1011
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:04,480
those gopher holes

1012
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:08,280
or something else these here yes those

1013
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,280
are rocks those are wrong

1014
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,240
oh and also um

1015
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,680
horses

1016
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:17,919
they're all owned the five thousand

1017
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:19,679
horses on the island are all owned by

1018
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,280
someone but they're roaming free and

1019
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:23,440
they must they mostly take care of

1020
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,040
themselves so you all you'll always see

1021
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,519
a brand on them

1022
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:28,480
so you can find their owner

1023
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:30,480
and

1024
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,000
often courses are seen as a status

1025
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,280
symbol on the island more horses you

1026
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,199
have

1027
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,519
higher you are

1028
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:39,439
so some natives would like to see a role

1029
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:43,280
play an effect that limits the person to

1030
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,280
how many horses they can own

1031
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:46,078
and often you'll see

1032
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,599
islanders

1033
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,800
utilizing those transportation so i

1034
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,400
think they'll see

1035
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,400
so much now as you did in the past

1036
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,200
all right

1037
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,720
so

1038
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:01,439
my my group for our research for young

1039
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:03,838
fun

1040
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,720
kaitlyn and i was to investigate food

1041
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:08,960
crops on easter island

1042
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:08,959
we

1043
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,199
sorry i'm really nervous

1044
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:16,239
so okay so our group was to investigate

1045
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:18,480
the food crops on the island and we

1046
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:20,559
also were interested in the climate and

1047
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,400
irrigation systems

1048
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:25,440
um the methods we use to collect our

1049
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,480
data was through uh resources through

1050
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,960
using

1051
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,639
uh through observing at restaurants and

1052
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,400
menus and seeing what ingredients were

1053
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:33,358
often on menus

1054
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,880
through

1055
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:36,719
observations at farms that we have

1056
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,920
visited and family family farms and

1057
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:40,959
gardens and also at the local food

1058
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,559
markets

1059
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,920
you can see what was imported and what

1060
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:45,358
was

1061
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,639
locally grown

1062
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:49,199
so

1063
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:51,118
the results that we found because it was

1064
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:54,000
definitely a consistent group of crops

1065
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,880
that were consumed and also highly grown

1066
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,519
on the island um such include tarot

1067
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,838
sweet potato banana mango and guava

1068
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:04,320
guava sorry and

1069
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:06,400
we found those as consistent staples in

1070
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,000
our meals and also

1071
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,480
we saw them growing in the fields

1072
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,239
obviously

1073
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,639
the museum

1074
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:16,879
museum day anthropological sebastian and

1075
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,078
endler which is a museum on easter

1076
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,920
island uh

1077
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,079
recognized sporting crops as the most

1078
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,680
important crops on easter island some of

1079
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,320
which are food crops and some of which

1080
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:27,838
are ethnomechanically important and

1081
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,920
important

1082
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:31,119
some of our meals most of our meals

1083
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,200
consisted of

1084
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,960
for breakfast guava and mango and

1085
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:36,879
bananas my

1086
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,880
maddie had shown earlier

1087
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,680
and for lunch we

1088
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,760
had

1089
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:44,799
mostly sandwiches and our ingredients

1090
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,320
were mostly tomato and cheese and

1091
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,280
my speculation is that the cheese is

1092
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,400
imported we didn't see cattle per se or

1093
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,440
not at least

1094
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,838
enough to

1095
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,838
produce

1096
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:01,199
and for dinner uh those foods we had a

1097
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,838
side of dish with a side of sweet potato

1098
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:08,519
for uh master chips and they had a

1099
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,519
variety of seafood on the island um

1100
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,400
and um

1101
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,920
so

1102
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,920
an observation that i just wanted to

1103
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,720
point out is that the size of the fruit

1104
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,920
was

1105
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:24,318
uh

1106
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,159
obviously different for me at least um

1107
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:27,599
for example the pineapples

1108
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:29,679
were about like seven to eight inches

1109
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,720
tall whereas my mom can sometimes like

1110
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:34,639
pineapples are like huge and then uh but

1111
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:36,078
in contrast the watermelon was

1112
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:38,639
relatively large compared to the

1113
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,920
watermelon in the united states so

1114
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:44,078
i thought that was another subject

1115
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,079
matter to be investigated in the future

1116
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:46,480
for

1117
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:48,480
in terms of the marketplace where we

1118
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,440
also collected some of our data

1119
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:55,440
pictures we found various other crops

1120
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:58,639
such as uh cabbage uh basil cilantro

1121
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,838
chives pumpkin cucumber garlic

1122
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:01,118
some of which are imported in

1123
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:02,318
southwestern

1124
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,119
island

1125
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:06,800
another major

1126
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,240
source for us for our information with

1127
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,160
ramon our tour guide which we had

1128
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:12,078
discussed previously a lot has been a

1129
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:14,399
really great help to us in their project

1130
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,920
and he uh gives a tour of his garden at

1131
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,119
home where he grows

1132
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,800
pretty much all of the crops that i've

1133
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,800
mentioned previously and

1134
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:26,480
um

1135
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:28,879
every nine months and how he cuts back

1136
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,318
to shoot after it fruits and new babies

1137
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,039
emerged from the ground and it's kind of

1138
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:35,759
a continuous process

1139
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:38,480
which was really great and some

1140
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,359
practices that are unique to star island

1141
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,960
is

1142
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:42,078
um

1143
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,000
with their incorporation of their

1144
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:47,039
culture and agriculture practices is

1145
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,599
planting new uh cuttings plant cuttings

1146
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:51,440
during the new moon and planting

1147
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,400
seeds during full moon

1148
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,639
also

1149
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,119
there is a prevalence of male farmers

1150
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:59,118
because women are

1151
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,039
traditionally not supposed to be farming

1152
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:03,440
when they're on the administration cycle

1153
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:04,639
so there's mostly male farmers for that

1154
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,159
purpose

1155
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:07,920
and um

1156
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:09,920
another traditional practice for

1157
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,200
agriculture is to have the quantified

1158
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,280
which were the stone structures

1159
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:15,118
surrounding the trees

1160
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,040
which young front had discussed which

1161
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,480
are used to

1162
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:20,719
pretty much promote the optimum

1163
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,240
temperature moisture on the plant within

1164
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:24,559
the structure by

1165
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:26,239
preventing livestock from

1166
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,639
grazing on it and

1167
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:31,639
from environmental factors such as water

1168
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:31,639
and

1169
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,400
so

1170
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,119
the reason you might need to hold

1171
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,599
moisture in these plants like the amount

1172
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,760
of eye were used is because easter is a

1173
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,559
very hot tropical climate

1174
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,599
their

1175
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,838
hottest seasons their hottest season is

1176
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,920
typically what our winter would be as

1177
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:51,519
their dry season where they can see

1178
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,599
anywhere between two or four inches per

1179
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:56,239
month which really isn't that much water

1180
00:42:53,599 --> 00:43:00,480
if you're 85 plus degrees

1181
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:02,959
and not dropping below 60 at night

1182
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,599
and the soil there is also very dark

1183
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:09,199
it's a weather basalt soil that's

1184
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:12,720
high in ph finely textured porous

1185
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:14,480
so having this dark rich and iron soil

1186
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:17,598
gets really hot really quickly it

1187
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,358
doesn't hold in the moisture

1188
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,200
over water it

1189
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:24,480
so

1190
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:25,759
in the picture with the drip irrigation

1191
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,358
it kind of makes sense that they would

1192
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,560
have that just because you can see how

1193
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:30,559
dark the slime was there

1194
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:41,519
so you can see posters from all of these

1195
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,199
presentations out in the hall and talk

1196
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:44,639
to students

1197
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:46,159
who are involved in them afterwards if

1198
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:48,480
you have more questions

1199
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:50,399
so in conclusion i just wanted to talk

1200
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,318
about

1201
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,760
just throughout my time at cornell the

1202
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:56,079
importance of hands-on interact

1203
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,160
interactions for sparking curiosity and

1204
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,920
promoting excitement has been reiterated

1205
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:01,598
again and again

1206
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,599
this class followed above and beyond

1207
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,359
that trend there's only so much

1208
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,119
literature research writing papers and

1209
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:08,559
attempting to memorize information that

1210
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,079
you can do to try to learn about

1211
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:12,159
something

1212
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,079
the real learning in education

1213
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:16,078
begins when you take this academic based

1214
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,599
inquiry and connect it to a place

1215
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,280
through experience

1216
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:21,039
when visiting a place for an academic

1217
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,319
trip there's a tendency to avoid certain

1218
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:25,039
activities because they aren't

1219
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:26,800
educational or too touristy which can

1220
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:29,279
actually limit the experience's

1221
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,119
educational potential

1222
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,040
by reflecting back on the trip i can

1223
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,720
think of many new experiences traveling

1224
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:36,480
with a large group

1225
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:38,639
being rely on one person to communicate

1226
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,240
with a lot of the people for a week

1227
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:41,519
and going out on a boat on the open

1228
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:43,039
ocean and riding on a horse for the

1229
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:45,119
first time for me

1230
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:47,358
um that really enhanced and clarified

1231
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:50,240
many things that i've learned about in

1232
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:51,838
school just throughout my life um now i

1233
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:54,799
have better communication teamwork

1234
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:56,799
skills and patience desire to learn my

1235
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,839
spanish a lot better

1236
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,200
um wonder why the ocean is so clear and

1237
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:03,199
what kind of organisms were on those

1238
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:04,799
rocks 15 meters below us when we were

1239
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:06,799
struggling

1240
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,560
and understand in a way that only riding

1241
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,359
can show you what it was like to travel

1242
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:13,039
around before there were cars

1243
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:15,279
this knowledge of place and activity

1244
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:16,800
combined with vigorous minds and ability

1245
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,319
to reflect on the contemplate are

1246
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,560
experiences were traits that i saw

1247
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:22,159
exemplified and taken advantage of by

1248
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:23,119
everyone in this group

1249
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:25,920
and

1250
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:28,240
this provided an outstanding opportunity

1251
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:32,280
for learning and experience that i and

1252
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:32,279
everyone who went i'm glad

1253
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:45,039
before we take some questions i forgot

1254
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:48,159
to introduce the co-instructor in the

1255
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,159
class dr betsy lam

1256

1261
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:04,000
work so thank you for your help with

1262
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:05,118
this she joined us

1263
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,440
do you have any questions for the

1264
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,440
students

1265
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,319
yes

1266
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,800
do you see any

1267
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:14,159
reptiles or amphibians

1268
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,240
on the island are there anything there

1269
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:18,239
was there was lizards in that room

1270
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:31,760
specifically but yeah the general

1271
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,760
wizards but nothing really large

1272
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,040
i was surprised on many of our hikes not

1273
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:40,559
to see snakes i feel like that's

1274
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:42,639
something about home i expect to see

1275
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:45,119
kind of hiking and that wasn't really

1276
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:47,440
anything that you can process

1277
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,440
yes

1278
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:55,039
in his book collapse

1279
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:56,480
which i recommend to all of you

1280
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:59,440
jared diamond

1281
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,599
positive the question

1282
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,960
with regards to the fact the island was

1283
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,960
totally deforested

1284
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,880
what did the person think and cut down

1285
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,880
the last

1286
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:25,519
everyone was very sustainable on the

1287
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:26,318
island to release their own

1288
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:27,838
food

1289
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:30,838
so i think at least there has been

1290
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:30,838
bananas

1291
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:39,639
they were gradually

1292
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:39,639
eliminated by rats

1293
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,960
going on is the island that's present

1294
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,119
greatly they're trying to bring in

1295
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,159
actually right now is digital and palm

1296
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,440
and

1297
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:01,759
conak believes that it's the most

1298
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,760
similar relative to the palms which are

1299
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,040
originally on the island and so they

1300
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,880
think that because of the similar

1301
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:08,480
climate and and

1302
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,240
the similarities in the two palms that i

1303
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,599
think that it'll be the most fun

1304
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:14,000
uh

1305
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,440
state line on the island so there's a

1306
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,440
great effort from kona right now to do

1307
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,440
that

1308
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,079
you showed lots of examples of gardening

1309
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,680
and producing their own food do you

1310
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,119
think they had to import a lot of

1311
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:40,879
produce as well or do you think they

1312
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,119
basically produced kind of all of the

1313
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,119
islands

1314
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:46,799
i feel like i think from like the sense

1315
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,559
that we bought it's like more they can

1316
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,480
produce for themselves but like the

1317
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,160
reason why you know prices were so high

1318
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,318
for the classes it's hard to sustain

1319
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:56,318
them all are generally in their own

1320
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:58,639
population and especially now that they

1321
00:48:56,318 --> 00:49:00,880
become such a tourist population

1322
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:01,920
but they have i mean such a large amount

1323
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,680
of people that are coming into the

1324
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,440
island just for touristic and like i

1325
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:07,199
don't think that the small a lot of the

1326
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:10,079
small personal farms like our forgotten

1327
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:11,679
role he had he had like a tree of like

1328
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,880
each species kind of but i think that

1329
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,679
wouldn't be something that he could

1330
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,358
really

1331
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:17,358
have enough to profit and sell to the

1332
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:20,239
market

1333
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:20,239
yeah ramon really

1334
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:24,880
we talked a lot about how like personal

1335
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,880
sustainable they could be like a family

1336
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,720
could sustain like was really good at

1337
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,480
learning and knowing how to take care of

1338
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:33,759
themselves and produce what they needed

1339
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,760
to eat and to survive

1340
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:40,318
in order to

1341
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,318
provide for other people

1342
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:46,160
just to add the farms we visited now you

1343
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:47,519
generally see one greenhouse structure

1344
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:50,078
and maybe a

1345
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:51,358
one to two acre lot of ireland with

1346
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,440
vegetables

1347
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:54,799
small scale

1348
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,440
and also i mean the great part of that

1349
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,039
is that like the iron in general three

1350
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,079
fourths of it i believe is protected by

1351
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,599
kona

1352
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:03,200
and then they have the small town

1353
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,880
hungarian so it only leaves a really

1354
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:07,879
small area of the island which is even

1355
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,880
allowed

1356
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:17,439
real simple question how how big is the

1357
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:19,920
what are the what are the distances 168

1358
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,318
square kilometers so seven seven miles

1359
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,519
by fourteen miles about i mean depending

1360
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:26,239
on where you take the dimensions from

1361
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:26,880
the kind of triangle

1362
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:30,318
it's

1363
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,318
half the size of grand island

1364
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,519
i have denying assumptions

1365
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,280
that

1366
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:45,119
the way that the statues got the

1367
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,400
glorious to wherever they ended up

1368
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,920
was well

1369
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,920
kind of unknown

1370
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:54,960
did the people that you talked to live

1371
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,960
on the island do they have are you

1372
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:59,359
there was um a few different things that

1373
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,440
had like a couple different theories

1374
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:02,558
that kind of evolved from different uh

1375
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,920
archaeologists that have been on the

1376
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,839
island of time actually the

1377
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,920
archaeologist jonathan hilberg we talked

1378
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:10,400
to from ucla was there at the time they

1379
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,400
all have different theories uh

1380
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,318
there's some that are currently go from

1381
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,920
like they're rolling them on blogs that

1382
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:17,838
the logs will roll them there's

1383
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,760
different theories where

1384
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:21,119
they'll walk them

1385
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,480
yeah i mean there's a lot of different

1386
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,400
theories and so it really depends on who

1387
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,480
you talk to because um

1388
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,160
they haven't really just like assessed

1389
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,000
one as being correct they just can't

1390
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:31,519
come up with the reasons there was a

1391
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,920
there was a study not too long ago where

1392
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:36,400
they they tried the theory of

1393
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,720
placing them as good and then having the

1394
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,960
logs roll the skid keep placing the

1395
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:43,039
locks in front of the skid and they got

1396
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,000
very effective results they got hundreds

1397
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:45,440
of feet

1398
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:50,159
throughout the time

1399
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:50,159
there was a tv program which showed

1400
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:57,679
but the interesting thing of course is

1401
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:00,000
that it's not flat you're taking them

1402
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:02,799
from the volcanic quarry down and then

1403
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,400
to the coastline and with the nickel

1404
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,480
theories like that and we're standing on

1405
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,079
this large pill they call a quarry and

1406
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,920
we're saying you want us to take this

1407
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:11,440
moai here all the way over there and

1408
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,358
you're gonna walk it

1409
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:16,079
it just was so unfathomable to us at

1410
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:17,598
that point that like personally i think

1411
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:20,000
a lot of the other methods seemed more

1412
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,039
reasonable but there's definitely

1413
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,358
a lot of

1414
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:25,759
support for those theories the largest

1415
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:28,880
they were able to transfer was 30 feet

1416
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:31,520
high i forget the 15 six times

1417
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,440
86 times

1418
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:35,759
what they're able to transport the the

1419
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,599
build the largest ever carved with 60

1420
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,160
feet high but it still remains in the

1421
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,160
mountainside

1422
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,318
in terms of um

1423
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:50,480
the in terms of the oral tradition

1424
00:52:48,318 --> 00:52:52,960
though there is support for the theory

1425
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,400
that the moab walked because that is

1426
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,720
that is part of their oral tradition is

1427
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,639
the idea that they say like the moai

1428
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:00,078
walk and so they they don't know how but

1429
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:01,838
part of their oral tradition is that

1430
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,280
that is and i did read one study which

1431
00:53:01,838 --> 00:53:05,119
actually looked at a lot of the

1432
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,440
transport roads and all of them had at

1433
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:10,079
least a slight downhill grade to the

1434
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,159
location of their eyes so as impossible

1435
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,280
as it seemed to us it could that that is

1436
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:15,118
a

1437
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:18,800
of course it's a bit more romanticized

1438
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:18,800
than flipping them on their stomachs

1439
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,318
my favorite was the one that said they

1440
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:27,639
shot them on the volcanoes

1441
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:27,639
or the aliens

1442
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:00,800
were they dependent on those palm trees

1443
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:03,358
for food

1444
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,839
well they used the pantries to like do

1445
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:09,480
the cut canoes out of them

1446
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:09,480
to get there yeah

1447
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:17,318
um

1448
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,960
any other questions

1449
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:49,959
well thank you very much
