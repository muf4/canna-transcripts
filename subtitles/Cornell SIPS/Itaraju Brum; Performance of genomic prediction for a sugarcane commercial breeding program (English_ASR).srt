1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:10,038
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,479 --> 00:00:12,980
University everybody today we're going

3
00:00:10,038 --> 00:00:16,070
to talk about shortcake also going to

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:19,149
talk about a drum prediction woods up

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:25,698
here but maybe it's regain is something

6
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:49,308
about was business opportunity through

7
00:00:25,699 --> 00:01:03,079
the ad that's chains and cars conception

8
00:00:49,308 --> 00:01:07,658
and actually in Brazil in Brazil the top

9
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:12,400
producer followed by India and China and

10
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:12,400
part not being among the ten most

11
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:27,679
painted crop in the world in terms of

12
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:37,669
area and just are interesting for sure I

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:40,280
think a high qualified species so it's

14
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:42,530
actually the varieties the cones that we

15
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:47,618
see in the few today there are hybrids

16
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:51,019
from true qualified speeches in 2007 you

17
00:01:47,618 --> 00:01:56,629
also are crossing and the clonally

18
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:59,658
propagated crop impacts on how we manage

19
00:01:56,629 --> 00:02:02,899
the build environment and also train

20
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:07,300
your crops harvest happens every year

21
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:10,539
after a growing season ending

22
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:14,979
became think you got average of five

23
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:17,319
harvests from each problem so what do

24
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:20,979
genome selection sugarcane so you know

25
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:22,959
selection is being a tool that working

26
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:24,519
very well with quantitative traits and

27
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,700
those are the ones that are interesting

28
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,820
sugarcane so with being also shrinking

29
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:32,979
has really long cycles actually when

30
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:35,439
considered a cycle since this time

31
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:38,349
didn't we that we do across until the

32
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:42,069
time that we can do a cross again we've

33
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:43,479
real long and actually the traits that

34
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:48,579
are interesting are also quantitative

35
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:52,389
that's why we we went on to study how

36
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:56,080
can we or how good king genome selection

37
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:58,719
works for shirking review all my

38
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,840
presentation when we start having my

39
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:10,329
datasets both the molecular markers and

40
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:13,150
the field data and then for parents and

41
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:18,040
then another way of looking for to the

42
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:20,050
more for markers and shirking so I'm

43
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:26,319
gonna give an overview of the building

44
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:29,560
program working in broader so W program

45
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,709
is some selection states start with the

46
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:36,400
first age which is actually a family

47
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:39,209
stage where plant families are planted

48
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,689
together and evaluate it together for

49
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:45,789
traits like bricks and I think those

50
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:47,859
families that are selected the clones

51
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:55,509
that are the plans that are selected are

52
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:58,120
currently propagated plants are not only

53
00:03:55,509 --> 00:04:01,679
propagated by doing with larger plots we

54
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,920
can have better phenotype of the plants

55
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:09,400
this happens normally around two years

56
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:13,179
one year to move from one stage you got

57
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,930
the third stage when having a bigger

58
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,259
plots

59
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,728
everything has measurements that we see

60
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:20,480
they're important for selection like

61
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:23,800
sucrose and weight

62
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:29,900
when we can see the performance of the

63
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:32,329
varieties a better resolution at the

64
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:35,269
same time here is two normally on a

65
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:37,389
single occasion and then on the

66
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:40,779
following stage then there's further

67
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:43,550
multiplication where things can be

68
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:47,569
evaluated in different locations and

69
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:51,020
actually through many more years so the

70
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:55,219
data that I'm using here comes from CTC

71
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:59,359
as Mark mentioned knowledge center in

72
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:02,780
Brazil here's translation here's the

73
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,340
overview of the headquarters and also

74
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:07,969
our breathing station that stays here

75
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:10,189
and enough for Brazil those are some

76
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:13,910
growing areas in Brazil the main growing

77
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:18,620
areas so let me go a little more in

78
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:21,140
details about my data's hands so I have

79
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:24,800
data from true breeding cycles I'm

80
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:27,370
calling cycle 5 in old seats they follow

81
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:34,550
the same scheme that I described in far

82
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:36,740
but on the third stage we had the actual

83
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:40,550
phenotyping that I'm gonna describe on

84
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:45,740
the first on the following chapter and

85
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:49,370
then use its own the third stage we got

86
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:54,730
data that were on all these traits

87
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:58,340
bricks all fiber and weight and also

88
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:01,520
sequencing data and from which we got is

89
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:03,679
new information so basically the Disney

90
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:06,859
the molecular marketing so much that we

91
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:12,050
have come from the third stage and we

92
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:15,230
have two cycles to to do our analysis so

93
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:18,590
just another statistics from these data

94
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:20,840
science here I'm showing the size of the

95
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:23,449
families in this third stage and we see

96
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:28,369
that okay we have some families that are

97
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:30,620
pretty large but most of them so that

98
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:33,050
there will be some imbalance in term

99
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,340
imbalance in terms of the the feminism

100
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:38,030
on the third stage

101
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:43,149
due to selection so let's take a look at

102
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:46,579
the molecular marker data so we did

103
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:52,159
sequencing for genotyping from about

104
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:55,849
2,000 samples we use the technology use

105
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,500
some probes to capture the locations in

106
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:01,370
the genome that we are actually getting

107
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:04,610
our sequencing from and then from that

108
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:07,639
we got a raw data set of more than 200

109
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:10,879
thousands niche that later was further

110
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:14,000
filtered out so we got to a final data

111
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:17,259
set with 55,000 markers in more than

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,259
1,700 clones

113
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:25,240
Marlin the molecular marking from ish so

114
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:29,359
here in my initial analysis I'm gonna

115
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:32,329
consider the is need information terms

116
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,120
of the presence of ABS or absence of the

117
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:37,550
alleles simulation when I use a simple

118
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,310
representation where I get a distinction

119
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:43,009
between the heterozygous state from the

120
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:46,160
homozygous a state only that we're going

121
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:49,750
to talk more about the the last section

122
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,530
of there with the market information

123
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:55,939
relationship we submitted a

124
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:58,539
relationships from the clones and I'm

125
00:07:55,939 --> 00:08:00,740
going to show a broad view of the

126
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:03,310
relationship between the individuals

127
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,960
based on a piece for component analysis

128
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,269
here actually those three plots are the

129
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:11,299
same just the colors that are different

130
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:15,649
and what I'm showing here in the colors

131
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:17,870
are first here the cycles where the

132
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:20,179
clones came from so basically I'm

133
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,100
showing that there is no particular

134
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:25,910
difference between the clones of the

135
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:30,350
truth cycles in the other hand when I

136
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:34,009
start putting colors based on familiar

137
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:36,320
parents are made it won't come from we

138
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:39,259
start to see a relationship with others

139
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,980
and the dots so basically they structure

140
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:46,850
that we can see in the among those

141
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,590
clones modulated she did parents that

142
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,779
they came from

143
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:52,780
then from the cycle soon that kind of

144
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:56,230
makes sense when you see how the parents

145
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:59,409
were used in the different cycles you

146
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:03,100
have some overlap between parents and

147
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:07,629
also even when the parents don't don't

148
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:09,759
overlap they are related move on so we

149
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:13,439
also have pedigree information from

150
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:16,269
those clones that we use to estimate

151
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,970
relationships between the clones in here

152
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:21,340
do you have comparison between the

153
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:24,460
marker relationships and the pedigree

154
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:27,160
relationships that is an overall

155
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:30,519
correlation of 0.63 not that high

156
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:34,839
between those those estimates and you

157
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:38,649
are able to detect some outlier clones

158
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:41,139
that we decided to not use using the

159
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:45,220
following analysis basically they look

160
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:47,500
like replicated individuals maybe dip

161
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:50,350
there some is labeling and then these

162
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:56,889
comparison allowed us to do this

163
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:59,590
filtering yeah those are 17 cars okay so

164
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:02,110
I'm gonna show the first results that

165
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:05,110
are but genomic prediction for chrono

166
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:09,580
prediction so I'm just explaining what

167
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:12,310
we did so basically that analysis the

168
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:16,480
first step we got blues based on on the

169
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:21,579
rough phenotype records and then then

170
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:23,379
use those rules on a second step as our

171
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,850
optional type to do the predictions

172
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:33,009
together with the markers information

173
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:36,129
only data from here the linear model

174
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:38,139
that I use on the first step based on a

175
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:41,909
point out that we had a term for the

176
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:45,039
clones and also we controlled for

177
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:50,110
spatial relationships between the plants

178
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:52,120
on the field or on a second stage then

179
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:55,330
you have the linear model if two random

180
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:59,340
facts one that comes that's correlated

181
00:10:55,330 --> 00:11:01,470
using the relationship derive is derive

182
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,750
some pedigrees and another from the

183
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,180
markers and I'm gonna do a comparison

184
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:10,399
later in which I use one term or the

185
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:13,439
other and here's how we're doing our

186
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,329
validation in of the predictors so

187
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,420
basically there are two they're going to

188
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:20,850
be true ways to compare one in which I'm

189
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:23,279
doing cross validation we've gone from

190
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:26,730
the cycle oops oh five which is a larger

191
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,129
data set and then

192
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:33,090
so basically splitting the data in tank

193
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:34,649
folds with six raptors and in another

194
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:37,139
approach we are going to use the whole

195
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:42,299
data set from cycle

196
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:47,850
oh five to predict the individual cycle

197
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:50,069
all six so here before showing the

198
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,870
results I'm gonna just presenting some

199
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:56,580
hurt ability broad sensor table

200
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:58,620
Testament here and I'm gonna also use

201
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:01,830
this to talk a little more about the

202
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:03,990
traits that I have so basically we have

203
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:06,720
the ones that I mentioned Greeks fiber

204
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:10,110
pole and weight but they were measured

205
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,810
in some combinations of conditions that

206
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:15,990
are different so we have a first harvest

207
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:19,469
and a second harvest for the stage three

208
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:22,110
data set and also have the this the

209
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:25,560
Asarco that I mentioned and we also have

210
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:29,850
two seasons so in both case half the

211
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:33,659
population will phenotype the beginning

212
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:36,480
of the season that's the early set and

213
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:41,149
then another half of the population in

214
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:44,039
the end of the season that's the delay

215
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:47,399
that's why we have so so many

216
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:49,500
combinations of the of the the traits

217
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,069
and then are basically considered a as

218
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,179
individual traits in these and Al's

219
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:58,740
so here is the first results from

220
00:12:54,179 --> 00:13:01,739
cross-validation here then you have the

221
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:04,740
four traits Briggs fiber pole and weight

222
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:08,690
and harvest the first and the second

223
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:15,289
harvest and in these bars

224
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:17,000
have the both early and late trait and

225
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:19,549
you can see here that we have over our

226
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,480
prediction actresses ranging from a

227
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:30,259
little point one to close to point four

228
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:33,440
and there is actually not a clear trend

229
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:36,350
between harvest one and harvest true and

230
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,570
between oiling Li not say that that Kaos

231
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:43,840
always predict better for one or the

232
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:46,100
other and between the traits themselves

233
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:49,370
that in this particular case does

234
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,990
there's a little difference between them

235
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:55,960
but you can see that fiber is a bit

236
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:58,700
better then they wait these

237
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:04,519
cross-validation listen separating the

238
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:08,030
early in late SATs but another analysis

239
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:10,159
to put them together that I'm showing

240
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:12,769
here so basically by doing these

241
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,870
increase the training sets I have a

242
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:18,319
larger population to do my training and

243
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:22,789
then I can do prediction to both the the

244
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:27,590
same individual SATs early are late

245
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:29,360
ardent to predicting together in some

246
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,519
case that there was an increase of

247
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,440
prediction accuracy but it's not like

248
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:40,759
there's not a clear trend for all of

249
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:42,980
them actually these things and these

250
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:44,899
predictions I'm using both the molecular

251
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:49,000
marker ink the degree in the model so I

252
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:53,329
have that full model with those defects

253
00:14:49,000 --> 00:15:00,049
and here I'm comparing what I get when

254
00:14:53,330 --> 00:15:03,710
predicting only information so basically

255
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:06,859
the dots here are the same traits that I

256
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:09,200
was showing in the previous plot but now

257
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:13,250
the values are the accuracy things out

258
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:16,220
then you see that there is a train of

259
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:18,000
higher accuracy when using the markers

260
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:23,370
in comparison

261
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,250
and it's here and this one basically the

262
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:28,289
difference that include the previous

263
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:32,909
result here with markers in per degree

264
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:35,578
in compared with only the degree so they

265
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:39,480
look very similar which means that this

266
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:43,169
uh driving the increase in accuracy here

267
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:46,438
is the prediction for the markers so

268
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:50,549
let's move to their to the other skiing

269
00:15:46,438 --> 00:15:54,179
of predict of validating the prediction

270
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:56,938
which I'm basically using the whole of

271
00:15:54,179 --> 00:16:01,289
the whole cycle of five to predict the

272
00:15:56,938 --> 00:16:04,379
whole cycle all six the same so here we

273
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:06,990
see a drop in prediction actresses for

274
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:11,459
for all of the Canes comparison to what

275
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:14,698
we had before and the same idea here

276
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:22,739
holds there's not a clear trend between

277
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:24,838
the harvests and the early the early

278
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,778
late season together for prediction in

279
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:30,050
this case we get some case actually here

280
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:38,720
in fiber are there is a bomb and the

281
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:38,719
prediction is a big drop

282
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:51,088
markers and degree now then is not super

283
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:53,578
clear distinction between there's not

284
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:59,040
not clear advantage for using the

285
00:16:53,578 --> 00:17:02,909
markers in these final remarks that are

286
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:07,230
between these analysis so that there was

287
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:09,779
a first paper that reported general

288
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:14,699
prediction sugar cane was by a GUI arrow

289
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:17,099
in 2013 they actually had higher

290
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:19,199
accuracy for bricks and stock number we

291
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:20,938
charted two traits that we have in

292
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,818
common here actually I don't have stock

293
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:26,548
number but stock number is thought to be

294
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:31,079
as reported to be very correlated to

295
00:17:26,548 --> 00:17:32,859
wait so maybe you can trace a comparison

296
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:35,409
in this case

297
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:38,379
they had similar hurt abilities but they

298
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:40,660
higher accuracy and there's one

299
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,550
important difference between the I study

300
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,640
and this one which is the population

301
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:50,430
composition so in their study they were

302
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:53,970
using varieties and clones derived from

303
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:57,490
bridging programs all over the world and

304
00:17:53,970 --> 00:18:00,009
that I think that's the main difference

305
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:04,720
between the I study in this one here we

306
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:08,109
were doing a study based on clones

307
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,329
arrived at rebuilding program during the

308
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:12,069
selection and I think that can be

309
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:15,250
something to keep in mind when thinking

310
00:18:12,069 --> 00:18:19,419
about implementing genome prediction in

311
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:24,210
a in a brilliant program forum self are

312
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:26,920
shrieking so some other comments on

313
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:29,289
regard to the prediction across cycles

314
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,930
actually we have we can see that there's

315
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:34,990
a lot of G by E so if it does not the

316
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:38,049
best way to compare there will be that's

317
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:40,480
expected to be a drop in the prediction

318
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:41,769
accuracy and the same way here was

319
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,400
interesting to do this comparison

320
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:48,190
because it kind of looks like what we

321
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,500
might observe when we first deploy

322
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:54,250
hurricane in a breeding program if we

323
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:56,460
also do the phenotyping of the the first

324
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:59,759
selection

325
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:02,249
I think if you had multiple year data

326
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,798
maybe could get some improvements in our

327
00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:09,179
in our predictions and it got a better

328
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:12,388
clear view of the the trends with regard

329
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:15,869
to the g-body that's happened and then

330
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:20,209
we've got to whether to use markers of

331
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:24,259
the pretty degree for addiction observe

332
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:30,480
advantage when doing cross validation

333
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:34,079
and maybe this points to that we've used

334
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:37,079
these predictions families think we

335
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:40,589
would have a really clear advantage for

336
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:43,470
use in the markers in that case we can

337
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:47,928
connect up the prediction for using the

338
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:51,808
pretty good move on to another top which

339
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:56,788
is focus on predicting parental

340
00:19:51,808 --> 00:19:59,548
breathing values so basically I'm using

341
00:19:56,788 --> 00:20:02,099
the same data set as before but instead

342
00:19:59,548 --> 00:20:06,418
of predicting the clonk performance as I

343
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:08,519
did I'll look to the parents from that

344
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:10,350
derived those clones in the building

345
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:18,589
program and our estimate bringing values

346
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:22,138
for them and also all the records and

347
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:26,308
I'm gonna put together data from stage 1

348
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:31,699
and stage 3 in that case we're gonna

349
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:35,548
have a kind of very unbalanced data set

350
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:38,879
we have parents that have from two to

351
00:20:35,548 --> 00:20:41,249
more than 200 records available in this

352
00:20:38,878 --> 00:20:43,648
case so the Britney valves values are

353
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:48,179
gonna be derived from a bar Aladdin's

354
00:20:43,648 --> 00:20:51,989
little sense and also because I don't

355
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:56,269
have markers on the parents for this

356
00:20:51,990 --> 00:21:02,009
data set I'm gonna use the approach by

357
00:20:56,269 --> 00:21:04,259
llegará 2009 which called the H matrix

358
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:06,450
which is a combination between the

359
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:09,329
pedigree relationship matrix and the

360
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,720
marker relationship matrix basically it

361
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:12,809
came

362
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:15,329
expand some of the marker information to

363
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:18,109
the whole matrix using this approach and

364
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:23,970
just as a comparison here when I

365
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:27,449
correlated the pedigree matrix to the H

366
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:30,390
matrix only on on the set of cones that

367
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:32,880
don't have marker information be having

368
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:35,130
relation of point seven three if you

369
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,670
remember before we had in a correlation

370
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:42,030
of point six point six three so they are

371
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:46,080
still not super highly correlated so

372
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:51,899
there is this kind of shows how one

373
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:54,809
information push the other so here's my

374
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:58,350
linear mixed model there's a bunch of

375
00:21:54,809 --> 00:22:00,569
letters here but what I want to focus is

376
00:21:58,349 --> 00:22:02,759
on on determine G which is the random

377
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:06,210
effect for the genotype and then these

378
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:08,640
random fact will use this H matrix that

379
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,289
I'm talking about actually sometimes I'm

380
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,570
gonna use the H matrix sometimes we're

381
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:14,480
going to use the pedigree matrix so I'm

382
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:18,899
gonna do prediction using the range

383
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:24,539
compared to the pretty gray to the

384
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:26,580
pretty value derived from the image in

385
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:29,730
this case I'm gonna do prediction across

386
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:33,599
psychosis again using all records from

387
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:36,960
2005 to form that the training set and I

388
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:43,709
use the parents that are only in 2006 as

389
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:48,710
my validation data sets so here's the

390
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:52,740
results so basically we have predictions

391
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:55,740
in which I'm using the pedigree in our

392
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:59,730
College the pedigree with relationships

393
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:02,880
the H matrix and also an HDI blue matrix

394
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:05,460
that I'm calling here in each I form the

395
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:10,680
subset of the data for which I have both

396
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:13,009
marker and pedigree information with

397
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:16,580
both matrices

398
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:18,798
and then in this case that there was a

399
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:23,629
higher prediction accuracy for for

400
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:28,429
weight but in general there was very

401
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:31,460
little increase for using the marker

402
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:34,850
information and even decrease when using

403
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:37,519
weight another comparison that I did

404
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:41,089
here was to include in the observed data

405
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:45,710
the decide the previous cycle which is

406
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:47,869
kind of and kind of reusing the same

407
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:52,490
data that I'm using as training but

408
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:55,519
that's what brings the best best

409
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:58,640
estimates for the brainy values and then

410
00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:02,119
there is a real big increase in

411
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:05,120
prediction accuracy here I would say

412
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:07,489
that actually the act the real

413
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:10,099
prediction accuracy that we might expect

414
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:13,970
is not beside it should be something

415
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:16,849
here later lower but I'd like to show

416
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:19,910
these results so to have another

417
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:23,619
information mind another comparison that

418
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:28,880
we did was to loop to the parents and

419
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:31,579
and see if we there are some full sibs

420
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:37,309
there so basically had a couple of

421
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:40,220
families in the parent days and with an

422
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:44,359
average of a bit more than five clones

423
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:46,279
per family and we did the same estimates

424
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:48,439
of correlation that we did before but

425
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:53,240
now only looking to those full sibs

426
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:56,539
handles and in this case we can still do

427
00:24:53,240 --> 00:25:00,859
a good prediction for what wait but

428
00:24:56,539 --> 00:25:03,349
there is a sharp decrease for our greens

429
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:05,178
I tested actually the significance of

430
00:25:03,349 --> 00:25:11,109
this as my imagine there might be a lot

431
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:11,110
of variation for this small number of

432
00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:18,079
and actually the standard deviations you

433
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:19,428
are pretty high so if I do a t-test it's

434
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:21,849
going to be it's not going to be a

435
00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:21,850
significance

436
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:26,180
so it'll be interesting to do this

437
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:30,590
analysis again with a larger number of

438
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:34,370
families our larger families some

439
00:25:30,589 --> 00:25:36,619
remarks here so in this case when

440
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:39,859
interesting thing was to use the progeny

441
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:42,769
data to do our predictions and compares

442
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:45,109
what we did before which was the data

443
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:47,809
derived from the clones themselves and

444
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:52,609
so I think that we're able to combine

445
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:55,450
data from many states and for years and

446
00:25:52,609 --> 00:25:58,369
after the the mixed models allowed to

447
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:02,809
spite of that tool to analyze this very

448
00:25:58,369 --> 00:26:06,889
imbalance and then a comparison between

449
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:09,679
markers and pedigree prediction you can

450
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:12,680
see that actually again we have probably

451
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,660
a better use of the market information

452
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:17,810
when you look to prediction we think

453
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:21,259
families and also in this and as we

454
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:25,279
could use this H matrix which kind of

455
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:28,460
make it easier to use Drax's information

456
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:30,349
that we might read having the brilliant

457
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:33,910
program but for which we don't have a

458
00:26:30,349 --> 00:26:33,909
marker information yet

459
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,290
okay so so in this last section I'm

460
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:45,029
gonna talk about something a little

461
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:47,839
different so I said in the beginning

462
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:51,629
that sure canes a polyploid species and

463
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:53,759
I was only looking to they're markers in

464
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,490
a very simple way only looking to the

465
00:26:53,759 --> 00:27:01,170
presence or absence of the marker of

466
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:03,180
daily use there so actually we know that

467
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:06,690
we might have more information there

468
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:09,870
right because it's a polyploid so in

469
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:14,370
this section I'd like to explore a bit

470
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:16,589
more on the markers this is a diagram

471
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:21,289
that's pretty common to seeing shuriken

472
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:24,779
presentations that kind of shows how the

473
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:28,349
chromosomes which sure can look like and

474
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:29,849
so here they're putting the colors to

475
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:33,599
each of the species that form the

476
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:36,000
hybrids and then the main thing that I

477
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:38,189
like to point here is that yeah we have

478
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,390
many copies from each of the chromosomes

479
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:46,259
so that's why it's polyploid and also we

480
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:49,680
have like aneuploidy so we have

481
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:53,160
different numbers of of flight levels

482
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:55,860
for each chromosome and actually this

483
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:59,070
might happen even between clones so if I

484
00:27:55,859 --> 00:28:00,779
go to another cone I do not that these

485
00:27:59,069 --> 00:28:03,659
numbers for the same chromosome should

486
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:07,799
be the same kind of make things a bit

487
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:11,640
complicated here so here I'm gonna I'm

488
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:13,129
showing a bit more on detail on what I

489
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,990
mean by this

490
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:19,020
but what's happening to the marker so it

491
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:21,660
might be might happen again not on the

492
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:24,210
polypoid button outer pool boy that we

493
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:27,630
can observe markers in high higher

494
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:30,620
dosage so you might have things that we

495
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:35,510
observe deploy like a single copy or

496
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:39,109
absence but also higher dosage of the

497
00:28:35,509 --> 00:28:41,279
alleles and basically that's the kind of

498
00:28:39,109 --> 00:28:44,058
difference that i'm missing in my

499
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:47,759
previous analysis

500
00:28:44,058 --> 00:28:50,970
so that's one question that you might

501
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:53,909
have is okay does it matter does it

502
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:56,610
matter the dosage my happy that like

503
00:28:53,909 --> 00:29:00,710
after a dosage of zero like when I

504
00:28:56,609 --> 00:29:04,979
compared to my traits of each increase

505
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:07,259
the presence of the Leo amor office

506
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:09,749
doesn't matter anymore it might happen

507
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:12,329
that it really matters that as I get

508
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:22,259
more higher dosage I have a higher

509
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:24,989
impact on my trade or something crazy to

510
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:28,429
the dosage or not we do eat you're not

511
00:29:24,989 --> 00:29:32,480
having the chance to look to this okay

512
00:29:28,429 --> 00:29:35,278
so is it easy to to look to that and

513
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,878
there are reports in the literature that

514
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:40,739
explored this idea of looking to the

515
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:44,219
marker information that you get from a

516
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:47,249
population and try to identify infer

517
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:49,519
Kane what's the dosage even in the case

518
00:29:47,249 --> 00:29:52,048
of values that appear in higher dosage

519
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:55,499
it turns out that it's kind of hard

520
00:29:52,048 --> 00:30:01,138
there are a lot of changes that we we

521
00:29:55,499 --> 00:30:03,960
kind of don't see a clear result and

522
00:30:01,138 --> 00:30:07,229
then here I'm kind of summarizing what I

523
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:09,960
think are the problems in in looking to

524
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:13,190
the higher dosage restriction so if

525
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:16,048
you're doing an analysis of markers for

526
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:19,379
those Egyptian first of all we need to

527
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:24,808
know what's the dosage that we we have

528
00:30:19,378 --> 00:30:27,658
on a given locus I mean the maximum

529
00:30:24,808 --> 00:30:31,970
dosage are the quite level but we don't

530
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:31,970
know this information yes

531
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:37,710
maybe you should couldn't have an

532
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:39,690
approach that through the analysis gives

533
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:44,090
this flight level that's another

534
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:47,548
possibility but it's hard to do another

535
00:30:44,089 --> 00:30:51,089
things that sure Kings highly

536
00:30:47,548 --> 00:30:55,499
heterozygote species and as other plants

537
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:59,339
we might observe a lot of duplications

538
00:30:55,499 --> 00:31:02,788
of genes and and so on so it might

539
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:05,548
happen that big the signal that we are

540
00:31:02,788 --> 00:31:07,710
observing here and you can see new to me

541
00:31:05,548 --> 00:31:10,679
the Millat remark information that it

542
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:14,759
gets be it for instance in our case the

543
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:17,159
sequencing information from looks we you

544
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:20,399
want that signal to be really derived

545
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:22,528
from every single allele that observed

546
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:27,418
on the locus but due to hetero zygosity

547
00:31:22,528 --> 00:31:30,200
we might not do or actually might get

548
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:33,538
signal from more than the moon was high

549
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,749
together when we were clustering the

550
00:31:33,538 --> 00:31:38,479
sequence information so there are some

551
00:31:35,749 --> 00:31:40,950
difficulties here and another is

552
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:42,929
actually that we want the signal

553
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:46,409
information the the reads that you get

554
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:47,909
from sequencing in our case to the

555
00:31:46,409 --> 00:31:52,470
number of ways to be a function of the

556
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:56,099
dosage and for instance if you have a

557
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:58,558
narrow read sequencing we that might be

558
00:31:56,098 --> 00:32:00,358
a problem we do to sampling errors we

559
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:03,868
might get a different number of reads

560
00:32:00,358 --> 00:32:09,598
than what we would expect from the

561
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:13,738
dosage so what I'm gonna do here is to

562
00:32:09,598 --> 00:32:15,989
try to avoid some of these questions so

563
00:32:13,739 --> 00:32:20,819
I'm gonna do an analysis that simplifies

564
00:32:15,989 --> 00:32:24,749
how we look to the marker data which is

565
00:32:20,819 --> 00:32:27,358
use signal directly without doing any of

566
00:32:24,749 --> 00:32:29,579
those fancy statistics and Allison

567
00:32:27,358 --> 00:32:33,528
democra data in which we find the dosage

568
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:37,648
itself so examples of these later but

569
00:32:33,528 --> 00:32:40,169
I'm gonna use that so we can't test this

570
00:32:37,648 --> 00:32:44,668
question that I made a few minutes ago

571
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:46,870
is it worth it to use the dosage

572
00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:50,420
information when doing

573
00:32:46,869 --> 00:32:54,319
instead of analysis in sugarcane maybe

574
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:56,390
it's not worth it so maybe a simpler

575
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:58,428
analysis in which we just look to the

576
00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:00,590
presence and absence of values that's

577
00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:08,269
enough and that you can't do better than

578
00:33:00,589 --> 00:33:11,659
that so I'd like to and another thing is

579
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:14,058
okay we do all these analysis trying to

580
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:16,250
find the dosage of like as I shown in

581
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:19,789
the literature I'll find it the dosage

582
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:23,269
information from the markers and maybe

583
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:25,399
if you if you can test that this the use

584
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:29,058
of this information is valuable then you

585
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:34,330
don't give more incentives to follow on

586
00:33:29,058 --> 00:33:37,279
that and we are going to do this through

587
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:39,589
both 2oz engineering prediction so a

588
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,660
building on the previous results we're

589
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:43,909
going to do a an analysis in which I

590
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:46,160
have their markers on a simpler

591
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:49,460
representation and order in which that

592
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:51,370
doesn't take into account the those at

593
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,890
your formation and other that does and

594
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:57,619
compare the results

595
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:59,809
oops so basically I'm going to reuse the

596
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:03,229
information that I got before that we

597
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:06,920
had before and here I'm going to explain

598
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:09,320
what I mean by another representation of

599
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:16,070
their markers so I'm showing in this

600
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:19,879
table or data points for snips and here

601
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:22,669
I have weed counts from both of those

602
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:25,128
I'll use from these names so in one case

603
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:27,049
for instance I've read counts from my

604
00:34:25,128 --> 00:34:30,710
whip reference to you but not for my

605
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:33,740
alternative value in my what a called

606
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:37,429
discrete genotype or discrete coding of

607
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:41,059
the marker information our sign a value

608
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:44,480
let's say zero to this case I mean I

609
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:46,668
have both alleles I'm gonna say it's a 1

610
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,159
and when I don't have one of the other

611
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:50,529
Olivos it's true that's basically what I

612
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:53,590
did before

613
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:55,929
but induce new approach but I call a

614
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:58,660
continuous coding of the genotype I

615
00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:01,360
basically get the ratio between the the

616
00:34:58,659 --> 00:35:04,869
read counts from the reference value to

617
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:07,450
the total number of reads that I have so

618
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:11,019
I will have something that's continuous

619
00:35:07,449 --> 00:35:13,449
so that goes from zero to one and that

620
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:17,710
allows me to distinguish distinguish

621
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:20,409
cases like this that might have and the

622
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:21,220
assumption is that if I have a higher

623
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:24,429
dosage

624
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:25,089
I'll have higher read counts for that

625
00:35:24,429 --> 00:35:30,969
illegal

626
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:35,829
so using this discontinuous genotype for

627
00:35:30,969 --> 00:35:39,789
four so here's an example of how that

628
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:41,739
works in the actual data that we have so

629
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:45,489
I'm showing here one is neap and another

630
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:48,099
is need this is me on top you have the

631
00:35:45,489 --> 00:35:52,029
continuous coding and on bottom the

632
00:35:48,099 --> 00:36:03,909
discrete coding and those are the like

633
00:35:52,030 --> 00:36:06,910
histograms from my values 1 &amp; 2 but in

634
00:36:03,909 --> 00:36:14,230
the continuous causing this value that's

635
00:36:06,909 --> 00:36:20,109
the heterocycles range of values that go

636
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:27,250
from this kind of flipped so these guys

637
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:28,720
here appear okay and this might be

638
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:38,500
interesting because then you get a

639
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:42,509
higher resolution for these it also only

640
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:47,079
had one so if you're working with a deep

641
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:51,490
these to happen only have heterozygous

642
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:53,079
individuals in our approach but ensuring

643
00:36:51,489 --> 00:36:55,379
that happen at least it happens in my

644
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:55,380
dataset

645
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:07,670
basically I throw out markers like this

646
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:12,190
in a discrete analysis is that between

647
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:15,798
one and another and so what I'm gonna do

648
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:18,349
I'm gonna do - I have two matrices one

649
00:37:15,798 --> 00:37:20,500
calling D from disparate and see some

650
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:23,000
continues it markers in both

651
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:31,760
representations and from the markers

652
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:33,260
under that are like this so with extra

653
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:41,809
markers that I didn't have access to

654
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:45,559
before so I had some samples that her

655
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:49,190
work or replicated so I did an analysis

656
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:51,740
taking four counts this the Obsidian our

657
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:54,409
servers are replicated in gnome

658
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:58,639
replicated and compared those two

659
00:37:54,409 --> 00:38:00,710
distances to find an optimal read death

660
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:04,068
for futuring these snips

661
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:08,960
so the optimal one is actually 80 I used

662
00:38:04,068 --> 00:38:17,289
some 50 just to not lose that many snips

663
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:17,289
but no significant difference here so

664
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:31,640
using it is the DC and c2 the same train

665
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:38,598
here the same stage three homes that I

666
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:44,568
use we see that using discrete coding

667
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:51,039
and same markers I got the first very

668
00:38:44,568 --> 00:38:57,099
similar actually we have point nine to

669
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:57,099
this diagonal elements

670
00:39:14,929 --> 00:39:18,049
[Music]

671
00:39:29,838 --> 00:40:04,440
okay I might have and I do my heart

672
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:11,940
apart becomes very messy difficult to

673
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:16,519
see a clear trend so actually continuous

674
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:21,838
and speed coding in a manner which is

675
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:26,730
going over a range of thresholds that of

676
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:28,619
just using for a range of threshold I

677
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:34,588
count the number of significant hits

678
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:36,420
that I have four for that here in this

679
00:40:34,588 --> 00:40:40,259
plot I'm showing the number of hits that

680
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:52,730
with that and on rad been using this

681
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:52,730
discrete coding so higher number of hits

682
00:40:53,449 --> 00:41:00,409
and well actually if you do this analogy

683
00:40:57,409 --> 00:41:00,409
here

684
00:41:02,889 --> 00:41:15,679
holding have more markers but forth in

685
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:18,769
this case I just compared the C and the

686
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:24,019
B movies and you see we have a higher

687
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:50,469
number of hits that case talking getting

688
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:56,739
more markers due to the use of the CR I

689
00:41:50,469 --> 00:42:02,719
also but they are just check it for

690
00:41:56,739 --> 00:42:04,669
markers that are not significant how

691
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:06,439
many of them are significant for the

692
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:08,659
game modeling based because of the

693
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:15,470
likelihood is not directly comparable

694
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:21,069
between both so we see here increase in

695
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:23,480
the number of weeks and 15% more

696
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:29,620
compared to the number of markers that

697
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:29,619
we get from only using linear model so I

698
00:42:29,769 --> 00:42:36,590
used develop modeling but also some

699
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:40,070
artists modern ways of modeling the data

700
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:45,700
are ths support vector machines and rain

701
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:49,880
forests so those are the results or

702
00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:51,919
genomic blob in the four traits and the

703
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:55,269
different matrices so let's focus on

704
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:58,630
this one most of the case there are a

705
00:42:55,269 --> 00:43:02,050
slight improvement in using this

706
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:05,599
continuous coding and even when I use

707
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:10,430
the cecum it has I didn't show the

708
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:14,420
numbers here but my situated has only so

709
00:43:10,429 --> 00:43:20,690
here we're talking about 50,000 markers

710
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:29,539
the C 2 matrix has 5000 markers if you

711
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:31,789
have a high and well not not always but

712
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:35,239
in general there there's a little

713
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:38,300
increase in predict trends include the

714
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:42,019
other models for John prediction I don't

715
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:43,460
see I don't observe a real improvement

716
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:47,960
between the different models and

717
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:57,230
sometimes it gets really works so I'm

718
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:59,780
gonna stick with two random effects and

719
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:07,329
that didn't I'm not going to show here

720
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:10,490
but it didn't improve much of this

721
00:44:07,329 --> 00:44:13,789
continuous coding actually provided some

722
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:15,379
gain in information so I have some have

723
00:44:13,789 --> 00:44:21,259
more markers that were not polymorphic

724
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:23,300
before because of the relationships were

725
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:25,850
a little different it looks like we're

726
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:29,480
getting access to new information that

727
00:44:25,849 --> 00:44:31,309
we didn't have before the actual pass

728
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,650
and you also had more hits

729
00:44:31,309 --> 00:44:37,539
so non prediction it was about the same

730
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:41,570
so it's not clear whether it was a real

731
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:44,840
improvement in accuracy there but I

732
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:49,430
think we can say that to use some forms

733
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:53,180
of dosage encoding in studies for sure

734
00:44:49,429 --> 00:44:56,489
can might be beneficial so that's what

735
00:44:53,179 --> 00:45:02,319
we are actually investigating

736
00:44:56,489 --> 00:45:07,509
in shops like you I think some people so

737
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:09,100
especially so all these I study was my

738
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:11,730
PhD the whole program the data

739
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:14,219
everything comes from from CDC and

740
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:16,679
actually a lot of people there that

741
00:45:14,219 --> 00:45:21,869
contributed to get the data

742
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:26,079
imagine the the feud records everything

743
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:28,000
consistent childhood they were directly

744
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:30,340
involved in establish the framework for

745
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,690
this project and also Michael

746
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:35,950
Butterfield and William Burton they were

747
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:38,860
responsible for actually sponsoring

748
00:45:35,949 --> 00:45:42,879
everything yeah I also like to thank a

749
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:45,250
lot my speciality mark John Lou Jim

750
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,740
booth especially mark for accepting

751
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:50,710
accepting me here and guiding through

752
00:45:47,739 --> 00:45:53,709
all those years and supporting every

753
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:58,869
staff and also I'd like to think about

754
00:45:53,710 --> 00:46:02,380
all the sorrows and teen we interacted a

755
00:45:58,869 --> 00:46:06,069
lot through those years I learned a lot

756
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:07,990
through that here and bring in this odd

757
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:09,539
picture because I think has some folks

758
00:46:07,989 --> 00:46:13,449
that I'm not here anymore

759
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:16,960
I'd like to especially mention then in

760
00:46:13,449 --> 00:46:20,230
September make San Antonio and Gucci

761
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:24,579
it's not here that we gave a lot of

762
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:26,820
include to my analysis so that's it for

763
00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:26,819
today

764
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:42,670
I have a question about your prediction

765
00:46:39,579 --> 00:46:45,069
between cycles you talked about the

766
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:47,710
common parents they were subsets that

767
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:49,570
were used in both cycles I'm wondering

768
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:51,039
if just from those original predictions

769
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:54,190
you did if you ever look at the accuracy

770
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:55,929
on the cycle you were predicting just

771
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:57,700
for the common parents because you

772
00:46:55,929 --> 00:47:02,440
should be able to predict within family

773
00:46:57,699 --> 00:47:05,199
better than just across so you're

774
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:09,820
suggesting to use the premise that I had

775
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:11,349
in common look at the accuracy what I

776
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:14,080
was thinking you use the whole training

777
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:16,059
population into the prediction but then

778
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,559
you know maybe you're predicting so that

779
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:20,590
when you are late with the whole group

780
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:23,860
eat that's what showed but just look in

781
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:26,680
those common I actually I actually did

782
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:32,559
that just not showing I that there is a

783
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:34,869
higher accuracy super high but yeah it's

784
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:38,259
higher than that significantly higher I

785
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:41,019
should have included your concern

786
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:47,770
between when you look at your dosage of

787
00:47:41,019 --> 00:47:49,329
an allele there you if there's a you

788
00:47:47,769 --> 00:47:51,400
know are you looking at a difference in

789
00:47:49,329 --> 00:47:57,639
whether or not you haven't read depth or

790
00:47:51,400 --> 00:48:02,320
whether or not so ideally we would be

791
00:47:57,639 --> 00:48:05,650
looking to the dosage that's the what we

792
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:11,440
actually have in the plans is the dosage

793
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:12,760
not worth the read counts so the thing

794
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,510
is we don't have access to that

795
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,750
information

796
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:22,930
yes I'm not sure if you're gonna get a

797
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:26,139
day half finish working so I'm trying to

798
00:48:22,929 --> 00:48:30,730
to here actually not propose that we

799
00:48:26,139 --> 00:48:33,609
should use the read that and I think we

800
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:37,840
still need to find a way to get the

801
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:40,119
actual dosage but what I try to do was

802
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:42,700
through

803
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:45,960
try to ask a question okay is it worth

804
00:48:42,699 --> 00:48:48,429
it to look should we do that because

805
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:51,338
actually I had this this question when

806
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:53,679
it when I got here and that's why my oh

807
00:48:51,338 --> 00:48:56,619
my mission Alice's her based only on the

808
00:48:53,679 --> 00:49:00,759
presence or absence of markers and if I

809
00:48:56,619 --> 00:49:03,068
went to do an a dosage actual dosage and

810
00:49:00,759 --> 00:49:05,858
else probably I would be working with

811
00:49:03,068 --> 00:49:08,230
way fewer markers than I have now

812
00:49:05,858 --> 00:49:13,538
and actually it's pretty complicated to

813
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:20,440
do that so so so actually not proposing

814
00:49:13,539 --> 00:49:36,190
to you but can we use to answer some by

815
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:38,619
using another way - this has been a

816
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:43,440
production of Cornell University on the

817
