1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,929
great well thank you Chris and thanks

4
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,539
Chris

5
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:16,550
bill Gillian for the invitation and

6
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:18,439
thank you for everyone who's taken time

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:22,190
to meet with me in the last couple days

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,929
it's been really a incredible experience

9
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,750
for me and I look forward to more

10
00:00:23,928 --> 00:00:30,018
interactions so Chris already mentioned

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,849
social media do me a favor if you're on

12
00:00:30,018 --> 00:00:34,789
Twitter take out your phone and follow

13
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:39,020
me Jim Brady I actually I think I follow

14
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:40,850
half of you at least already but I like

15
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,469
many here I'm really passionate about

16
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,320
science communication science outreach

17
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:48,170
and thrilled to see so many students and

18
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,549
faculty and staff engaged in science

19
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,050
outreach and science communication here

20
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,729
I think it's really critical that

21
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:56,988
scientists actually talk science beyond

22
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:58,878
our academies so so follow me I'll

23
00:00:56,988 --> 00:01:01,608
follow back and if you want a live tweet

24
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:03,289
you've got my permission to do that so

25
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:06,859
I've had a lot of really great

26
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:08,359
conversations while I've been here a lot

27
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,950
of time interacting with students which

28
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:12,739
I love one of the conversations that

29
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,409
we've had is how did you as a student

30
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:17,179
get into the field of Plant Pathology

31
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:19,130
and repeatedly I'm hearing that it's so

32
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,380
important that a student knows a plant

33
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:24,859
pathologist so a student has a research

34
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:26,298
interaction and internship or takes a

35
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:28,759
plant path course so that seems like a

36
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:30,200
really important way to get into this

37
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:33,978
field that we really think of as a

38
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,899
discovery field now for me my path was a

39
00:01:33,978 --> 00:01:37,399
little bit different but while I've

40
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:38,719
never actually studied at Cornell

41
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:42,439
Cornell has played a really prominent

42
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:44,450
role in where I'm at today in a way

43
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:47,118
that's probably not very obvious so I

44
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,939
actually grew up on a grape farm Concord

45
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,618
grape farm in Southwest Michigan by the

46
00:01:49,938 --> 00:01:54,379
time I was 10 years old I was really an

47
00:01:51,618 --> 00:01:55,280
active gardener and I started reading a

48
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:58,640
magazine called

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,189
Roe Dale's organic gardening now back

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,000
then this was I'm dating myself here but

51
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:07,819
in the mid 80s and organic gardening was

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,710
not it was not a thing at least in South

53
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:12,379
West Michigan and remember my father

54
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,520
pulling me aside and saying the organic

55
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:15,500
gardening doesn't work it's something

56
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,300
the hippies do and you know don't waste

57
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,659
your time on this so clearly he was

58
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,760
wrong but but I read this magazine

59
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:24,590
religiously and I learned a lot about

60
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:27,469
gardening and I learned a lot about

61
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,450
plant science and as you as the pages of

62
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:31,159
organic gardening that taught me that I

63
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:33,079
could actually have a career as a plant

64
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:34,819
scientist and what are the names that

65
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,090
kept coming up over and over and over

66
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:39,949
again was Henry Munger and so if you

67
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,469
don't know does anyone not know well

68
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:44,689
it's that the breasts question let me

69
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:47,240
tell you Henry Munger was an important

70
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:50,479
plant breeder and a professor at Cornell

71
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,400
University and and for some reason he

72
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:56,359
was very well featured in this magazine

73
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,039
back in the mid 1980s so he really more

74
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,250
than anyone I think influenced my

75
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:03,530
decision going to plant sciences and

76
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:06,169
really this this magazine and his career

77
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,770
lit a passion in me that continues to

78
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:09,889
this day

79
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:11,480
so so so thank you Cornell I've always

80
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:14,809
had a soft spot for this institution

81
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:16,399
because of that connection so it's

82
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,129
really an honor to share with you our

83
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,010
research I work at the plant and of

84
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:24,620
Plant Pathology one of the hallmarks of

85
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:26,810
our work has been mining crop wild

86
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,629
relatives or wild species related to

87
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:32,030
crop plants for useful genes and I

88
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:34,579
really work in the area of the genomics

89
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:37,430
of plant disease resistance so one of my

90
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:41,390
goals is to use gene bank collections to

91
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:43,459
identify genes for crop improvement so

92
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:46,729
that they're more resistant to to

93
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:48,979
pathogens now for many many years I've

94
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:50,119
worked in the potato late blight passive

95
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:52,359
system and if you're a plant pathologist

96
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,090
I'm sure you already know this story

97
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:58,880
this was the the causal agent of the

98
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:01,489
late the Irish potato famine or the

99
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,169
European potato famine in the 1840s so a

100
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:05,060
plant disease coupled with social

101
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:08,329
factors that made an Irish population

102
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:11,180
almost wholly dependent on potato for

103
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:13,780
for their existence so we had some

104
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:17,389
really bad years in the 1840s really

105
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:20,199
intense late blight epidemics and potato

106
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:22,639
a million people starved to death in

107
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:25,490
Ireland a million more left the country

108
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,039
including the ancestors of John F

109
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,418
Kennedy so quite literally if it hadn't

110
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,500
been for this plant disease the u.s.

111
00:04:29,418 --> 00:04:33,829
probably never would have had a

112
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,620
president called JFK but this disease

113
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:36,599
which was sown

114
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,490
in the 1840s is still one of the leading

115
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,890
biotic constraints of potato production

116
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,300
worldwide on the price tag is somewhere

117
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:44,789
in the neighborhood of five to billion

118
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,740
five to eight billion dollars annually

119
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,800
so it really is a very significant

120
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:52,439
disease so one of the efforts that my

121
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,970
group has focused on over the years and

122
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:57,779
we're one of many labs around the world

123
00:04:53,970 --> 00:05:00,060
to do this is the discovery of genetic

124
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:01,829
resistance too late like now to give you

125
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,259
a visual of just how devastating this

126
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:07,109
disease can be I'm going to share with

127
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:08,789
you a month in the life of potato leaf

128
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,160
like nursery so this is a research plot

129
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,900
at the University of Minnesota we don't

130
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,790
use fungicides here at all we

131
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:17,399
intentionally release the pathogen we

132
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:21,240
use overhead irrigation to maintain high

133
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:24,509
humidity and when the pathogens happy a

134
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,639
field that looks like this can turn into

135
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:29,129
a field that looks like this

136
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,689
now obviously the majority of the plants

137
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:34,230
in this field the breeding lines the

138
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:38,550
potato cultivars are susceptible but

139
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:41,220
there are a few islands of green such as

140
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,710
those shown there and more often than

141
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,810
not those islands are green are wild

142
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:47,310
species of potato so this is one of the

143
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,589
species that my group has worked on over

144
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,839
the years so it originates this one

145
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:54,179
originated from Mexico we got the

146
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,829
materials from a gene bank and I'm

147
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,800
through phenotypic works such as this

148
00:05:55,829 --> 00:06:01,649
we're identifying resistance genes that

149
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,530
could be incorporated into potato now

150
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:08,429
this approach is inherently phenotype

151
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:10,649
driven and and that's that's slow and in

152
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:13,259
laborious now phenotyping is a lot

153
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:15,479
sexier today than it was back even a

154
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:18,360
decade ago and so my colleagues at

155
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,640
University of Minnesota folks here in

156
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,520
many institutions across the globe are

157
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,560
working on remote imaging as a way of

158
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,990
speeding up the plant phenotyping

159
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:31,259
process so we're taking pictures of

160
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:33,240
fields with drones or with a field based

161
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:36,449
apparatus or we're doing laboratory

162
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:40,139
analyses of course data collections one

163
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:42,180
thing data analysis is another and and

164
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:44,969
so plant phenotyping is getting much

165
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,250
larger scale a lot of effort in terms of

166
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,590
training computers to recognize what

167
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,769
plant disease looks like

168
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:53,810
example so while this is a lot faster

169
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:55,459
and more high-throughput than walking

170
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:59,300
the field and looking for those rare

171
00:06:55,459 --> 00:07:01,879
islands of green this is also inherently

172
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,400
based on plant phenotyping so if you

173
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,389
think about a wild population of plants

174
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,879
or you think about a gene bank

175
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:09,860
collection we know there are useful

176
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:11,120
genes in that set but we also know there

177
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,790
are a lot of genes that aren't useful

178
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,769
for crop production so finding a useful

179
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:17,689
disease resistance gene in a gene bank

180
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,879
collection or a wild population of

181
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:22,969
plants is really akin to finding a

182
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:24,769
needle in a haystack and I would argue

183
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,350
that plant phenotyping is always going

184
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:30,349
to be a bottleneck in discovery of

185
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:32,840
useful traits in crop wild relatives to

186
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:35,150
give an example the four pictures you

187
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:38,629
see here are another wild potato species

188
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:40,719
solanum poly edenian and from top to

189
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:43,610
bottom they're grown under increasing

190
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,610
herbicide concentrations okay so you can

191
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:48,980
see low or no herbicide concentrations

192
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,540
very happy plant at the top at the

193
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,700
bottom the majority of the plants have

194
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,950
been killed so this plant obviously

195
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:56,839
lacks herbicide tolerance but in this

196
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:58,310
study I really wasn't looking for

197
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,839
herbicide tolerance at all I was trying

198
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:02,300
to figure out how to grow these wild

199
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,829
species in my late blight nursery in a

200
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,290
way that didn't require hours and hours

201
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:08,829
of hand weeding so something as mundane

202
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:11,720
as how do you cultivate a wild species

203
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:13,159
becomes a hurdle to discovery of useful

204
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,410
traits because if you can't do it on a

205
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,050
large scale in a phenotype driven

206
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,120
approach something like cultivations is

207
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,199
a big issue

208
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,389
understanding what late blight

209
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,969
resistance or any resistance phenotype

210
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:26,839
looks like in a plant that is

211
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:29,830
morphologically and physiologically

212
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:32,809
distinct from crop plants is a hurdle

213
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:35,149
pathogen race specificity is always a

214
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:36,589
problem in in plant pathology so if I'm

215
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:38,360
challenging this with one particular

216
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,790
race of Jocasta infestans

217
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,789
is it actually resistant to two other

218
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:48,019
races and of course phenotyping is is

219
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:51,319
inherently resource intensive so space

220
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:53,090
labor funding all represent hurdles for

221
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,230
the application of unit vectors and

222
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:58,460
approaches so if phenotyping is a

223
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:01,129
bottleneck for the use of crop wild

224
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,600
relatives what's the alternative

225
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:05,439
and in last five

226
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,690
seven years my group has been working

227
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:12,079
towards utilizing our knowledge of gene

228
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:14,389
function and advances in DNA sequencing

229
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:16,879
technology to develop genotype driven

230
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:19,250
approaches to inform phenotyping for

231
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,809
trait discovery and the work I'm going

232
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,179
to share with you today is work that's

233
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:24,729
happening in the rows a CA and you'll

234
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:27,049
see why in just a moment

235
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:30,440
now I'm there probably people in this

236
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:32,838
room that that know this way better than

237
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,550
than I do but in order to make sense of

238
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,170
the project that I'm going to share with

239
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:39,229
you I want to start with a little primer

240
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:41,870
on how plants recognized and respond to

241
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,670
pathogens and plants really a very

242
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,039
sophisticated surveillance systems

243
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:47,958
they're they're multiple different

244
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,549
strategies that plants use but one of

245
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:51,619
the predominant ways the plants

246
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:53,059
recognize and respond to pathogens are

247
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,698
through genes that we collectively call

248
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:58,939
resistance genes or our genes and our

249
00:09:55,698 --> 00:10:01,490
genes of course encode our proteins and

250
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:04,490
regardless of the plant species or the

251
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:07,759
pathogen class against which these genes

252
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:10,519
act but the proteins that they encode

253
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:13,550
share certain architectures and the

254
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:16,879
predominant superfamily of our genes

255
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:19,729
encode and enbe arc our nucleotide

256
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:23,720
binding site domain and a leucine-rich

257
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:26,629
repeat or an LR R so NBL are our super

258
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,610
family is really very prominent in in

259
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:31,639
terms of plant recognition of pathogens

260
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,688
now for the purposes of this talk I want

261
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:36,409
you to remember that there are two

262
00:10:32,688 --> 00:10:39,289
flavors of mvlr protein so they both

263
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:40,669
have ND and L are domains but they

264
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:42,980
differently end terminus so they're

265
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:46,309
there TIR domain here on the bottom and

266
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:49,550
a coiled coil or non TIR type so these

267
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:51,919
these are two distinct flavors of nd L

268
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:55,969
are our genes or MBL are our proteins

269
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:57,948
and we know that they have monophyletic

270
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:02,720
lineages and it'll become important in

271
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:05,659
just a moment now in the plant NBL are

272
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,410
our proteins play the role of cellular

273
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:10,818
sentinels and switches so these are

274
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:14,000
constitutively expressed at low levels

275
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:16,370
and the lr are in particular is involved

276
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,589
in protein protein binding and through

277
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:20,509
Dean protein binding the lor detects

278
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:22,699
directly or indirectly the presence of

279
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:24,919
the pathogens when that happened so

280
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:27,588
that's the role of Sentinel and when

281
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:31,490
that happens it induces a protein

282
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:33,769
conformational change that allows the NB

283
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:37,068
art domain in combination with the

284
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:41,269
n-terminal components to trigger a

285
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:43,159
really elegant cascade of a gene

286
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:46,399
expression that results in the phenotype

287
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:49,549
that we see as resistance so the lrr

288
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:55,100
plays the role of Sentinel the nd plays

289
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:57,859
the role of switches now in addition to

290
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:00,230
a pretty robust understanding of how

291
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,959
plants recognize and respond pathogens

292
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,938
we're also living in an age of really

293
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:07,239
significant advances in DNA sequencing

294
00:12:04,938 --> 00:12:10,149
technology this is a timeline showing

295
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:13,220
whole genome sequencing in plants and

296
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:14,659
the first plant to be full the genome of

297
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,459
which was fully sequenced is a rabid

298
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:19,129
abscess back in 2000 followed very

299
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:21,219
quickly by rice and for a long time

300
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:24,709
these were our model monocot and dicot

301
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:27,110
species but if you look out here 2017

302
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:29,328
the rate of discovery the rate of

303
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:32,149
generating old genome sequence in plants

304
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:34,448
is really a lot more robust and we've

305
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:36,198
got something like 250 plant you know

306
00:12:34,448 --> 00:12:39,198
genomes that have been fully sequenced

307
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:40,729
at this point now this project that I'm

308
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:42,740
going to share with you focuses in the

309
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,569
Rose ACA and some of the key players in

310
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,579
terms of whole genome sequence are the

311
00:12:44,568 --> 00:12:50,509
Malus domestica or apple genome that was

312
00:12:46,578 --> 00:12:52,849
released first in 2010 for gary of Eska

313
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:55,909
this is a relative of strawberry

314
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:57,829
it's a diploid species called referred

315
00:12:55,909 --> 00:13:00,019
to colloquially as the the woodland the

316
00:12:57,828 --> 00:13:02,479
woodland strawberry and that was

317
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:04,278
sequenced in 2011 and then Prunus

318
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,949
Persico or the peach was sequenced in

319
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:09,049
2013 so these were the first three of

320
00:13:06,948 --> 00:13:11,328
several genomes that were sequenced in

321
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:13,338
the Rose ACA today we've got a total of

322
00:13:11,328 --> 00:13:16,159
12 rosacea genomes that are publicly

323
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:18,410
available Rose is coming out very soon

324
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:21,289
this fall and I can't wait to get my

325
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:22,909
hands on it because the the Rose genome

326
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:25,879
even though the families called the Rose

327
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:27,469
a CA named for Rose Rose has not been

328
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:30,139
sequence so it's not amongst the 12 that

329
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:33,350
we're studying in this particular study

330
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:36,828
at least yet so the availability of

331
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:38,329
genome resources for ROS ACA made this a

332
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:44,328
really good candidate for the work that

333
00:13:38,328 --> 00:13:47,299
we're pursuing and as we have worked

334
00:13:44,328 --> 00:13:49,489
towards trait discovery disease

335
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:51,349
resistance discovery in particular over

336
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,060
the years it's really been interesting

337
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,940
to me that comparative genomics

338
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:57,859
approaches have been rarely employed for

339
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,870
study of disease resistance so

340
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,550
comparative genomics or taking knowledge

341
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,528
from one species and applying it to

342
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:06,109
another really has revolutionized many

343
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:08,419
many aspects of the plant sciences but

344
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:10,430
not disease resistance in the NBL are

345
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:12,708
our genes in particular there are many

346
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:15,500
reasons why that's the case

347
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:18,319
first of all plant genomes have many NBL

348
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,600
our genes this is a graph that shows the

349
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,320
12 rosacea species that we're studying

350
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:26,720
in this particular study and I'm just

351
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,570
plotting the number of mvlr genes that

352
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,360
we found so way over here on your left

353
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:35,778
is the black raspberry genome this has

354
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:39,139
43 and ELR genes that's ridiculously

355
00:14:35,778 --> 00:14:41,509
small cucumber papaya have maybe similar

356
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:43,639
numbers but but most plants have many

357
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:47,208
dozens or several hundred are genes so

358
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:50,629
not a lot of genes in rubus in contrast

359
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:53,179
apples shown here on the right 663 and

360
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:55,458
DL are genes so there are a lot of our

361
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:57,198
genes in plant genomes and the plant

362
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:59,208
genomes in the rows a CA really vary

363
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:00,919
significantly in terms of the number of

364
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:04,809
our genes present so that creates a

365
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:07,909
problem for comparative approaches

366
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:09,948
additionally NBL our genes evolve very

367
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:12,110
quickly and this is a slide that my

368
00:15:09,948 --> 00:15:14,659
colleague Nevin Young provided to me

369
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:17,120
so Nevin for many years has worked in a

370
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:19,338
model legume known as medicago tran

371
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,310
Quechua and his team sequence a very

372
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:25,060
large number of accessions of medicago

373
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:27,559
tranquila and this graph summarizes

374
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:31,069
diversity of multi gene families across

375
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:32,649
those various genomes the x-axis is a

376
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:36,129
measure of synonymous substitutions

377
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:38,659
across these gene families and the

378
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:41,389
y-axis is a measure of nonsynonymous

379
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:43,519
changes so anything that's down in this

380
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:45,679
quadrant is

381
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:50,289
relatively slow evolving and anything up

382
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:53,809
here is very rapidly evolving and if you

383
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:56,599
look at these three individuals these

384
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:59,179
are domains common in NBL are genes so

385
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,550
we've got the env ark the leucine-rich

386
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:03,699
repeat and the TIR domain so those are

387
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:06,199
amongst the most rapidly evolving

388
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,230
components of plant genomes this

389
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:12,290
particular gene is late nodule in' not

390
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:15,529
an NB lr gene but it is a protein that's

391
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:17,899
involved in mediating legume Rhizobium

392
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:19,100
interactions so in general genes that

393
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:21,909
are involved in plant microbe

394
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,779
interactions tend of all very rapidly

395
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:25,549
that makes sense from a biological

396
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:28,730
perspective because we know that

397
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:30,949
microbes are smaller their population

398
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:33,110
numbers are much larger than we've seen

399
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,150
in plant communities for example and we

400
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:37,700
know that the life cycle hum allows them

401
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:40,340
to adapt very quickly relative to plants

402
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:42,560
so in order to compensate that the

403
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:45,220
plants have figured out how to evolve

404
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:49,429
our genes very rapidly to keep pace with

405
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:50,779
the microbial populations so the fact

406
00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:53,089
that these genes about really quickly

407
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:56,870
presents another hurdle for applying

408
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:59,420
comparative genomics approaches now I've

409
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,580
talked already about the general

410
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:06,099
structure the conserved architecture of

411
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:09,650
our proteins and of course genes reside

412
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:12,199
on a chromosome somewhere but it's

413
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:14,690
relatively rare to find an NB LR gene

414
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,940
that exists as a single entity on a

415
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:19,910
chromosome what's more often they occur

416
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:23,209
in clusters a functionally divergent but

417
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:24,740
sequence related copies and the fact

418
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,120
that they're clustered within the genome

419
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,579
is really important in terms of their

420
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:31,219
evolution because unequal crossing over

421
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:34,009
within individual genes or within that

422
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:36,500
cluster can really lead to very rapid

423
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:38,809
changes in the overall structure of

424
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,630
these clusters so these clusters can

425
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:43,879
expand and contract and and you see a

426
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:46,670
driver of really rapid allelic

427
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,930
diversification as a result of this

428
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:52,730
clustering so this in particular

429
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:53,960
obscures one to one north illogical

430
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,519
relationship so that's sort of a

431
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,960
hallmark of comparative genomics you

432
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:58,519
need to know that the gene

433
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,069
you're comparing have a common

434
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:04,639
evolutionary origin and this this isn't

435
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:07,879
particularly significant complexity in

436
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,190
terms of applying comparative genomics

437
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,470
approaches this graphic actually shows

438
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:14,480
what gene clustering mvlr gene

439
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,640
clustering looks like in actual plant

440
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,829
genomes so this is Prunus persica where

441
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,169
the peach genome they're 8 chromosomes

442
00:18:18,829 --> 00:18:23,720
and their rate and and each bar that you

443
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:25,788
see here is an end ELR gene that we've

444
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,278
identified in our study and you can see

445
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:30,288
a really strong tendency for these genes

446
00:18:28,278 --> 00:18:32,148
to cluster throughout the genome so this

447
00:18:30,288 --> 00:18:35,269
really is a very important mechanism for

448
00:18:32,148 --> 00:18:36,908
evolution of these genes alright so you

449
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:39,259
want to take just a moment to summarize

450
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:42,710
this idea of comparative genomics so

451
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:44,419
there are three main reasons why we

452
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:46,460
haven't seen application of comparative

453
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:48,020
genomics approaches for mvlr genes

454
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,630
first of all there are many of them

455
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:53,418
within the plant genome they evolve very

456
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:55,580
rapidly in response to microbes and this

457
00:18:53,419 --> 00:19:00,679
idea of ornithological relationships are

458
00:18:55,579 --> 00:19:01,970
really very rapidly obscured what I'm

459
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:03,528
here to tell you that I think there's a

460
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:06,019
lot of potential for comparative

461
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:07,730
genomics for mvlr genes

462
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:09,379
and I think the application of

463
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:13,880
comparative genomics to this particular

464
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:15,590
gene class can help us identify traits

465
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,600
in gene big collections for crop

466
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:19,819
improvement we're working in the rows

467
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,918
ACA probably don't need to introduce

468
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:26,480
this family it's a horticulturally very

469
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,919
significant and it also in addition to

470
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,298
being horticulturally significant has a

471
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:34,870
very robust bylaw Janee so we know that

472
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:37,339
everything that we call rows ACA today

473
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:41,028
came from a common ancestor that lived

474
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:43,038
about a hundred million years ago 59

475
00:19:41,028 --> 00:19:44,329
million years ago rose raspberry and

476
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:47,869
strawberry diverged from a common

477
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:50,240
ancestor 52 million years ago the poems

478
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:53,689
so apple and pear diverged from the

479
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,730
stone crops stood stone fruits 32

480
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:57,980
million years ago apple and pear

481
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,778
diverged from a common ancestor and we

482
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,610
know that all the stone fruits today the

483
00:19:59,778 --> 00:20:04,220
cherries the peaches the plums have a

484
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:06,229
common evolutionary origin that is more

485
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,079
more recent than 32 million years ago

486
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,549
but we don't know exactly when that was

487
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:12,049
so it's important that

488
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:14,980
we've got really robust you know

489
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:17,779
resources for Rose ACA we've got a

490
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:19,970
well-established bylaw Janee but this

491
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:22,460
phylogeny also has a really significant

492
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:24,140
chronological component and so this

493
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,600
combination of traits allows us to ask

494
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,730
and answer some really sophisticated

495
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:30,259
questions about trait evolution and of

496
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:34,940
course we're focusing here on disease

497
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:37,640
resistance so for the last several years

498
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:42,740
we've been working in this system to

499
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:44,960
identify ways of essentially a strategy

500
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:47,180
and a computer pipeline that allows us

501
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,110
to make meaningful comparisons across

502
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,779
species

503
00:20:48,109 --> 00:20:52,429
this is dr. Leon Vanek he's a postdoc

504
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:54,379
working my group and he's um he's

505
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:57,320
actually been responsible for much of

506
00:20:54,380 --> 00:21:00,140
what I'm gonna share with you today now

507
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:02,689
key to our approach to comparative

508
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,910
genomics is recognizing that these gene

509
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:07,580
clusters while very important

510
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:10,009
biologically represent a degree of

511
00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:12,799
phylogenetic redundancy so our goal is

512
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:14,900
to look at ancient relationships of our

513
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,480
genes and understand how speciation

514
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:20,030
events in the family have influenced the

515
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,730
our gene component in genomes and the

516
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:24,889
clusters that we see today we know are

517
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:26,569
relatively recent in origin and we know

518
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:29,570
that they have a common evolutionary

519
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:31,159
origin so all of these these genes in a

520
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:34,339
cluster today could be traced back to a

521
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:36,230
single copy so from a phylogenetic

522
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:39,349
analytical perspective they're really

523
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:42,470
redundant and we've opted to collapse

524
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:45,279
these into a single composite sequence

525
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:47,000
that represents that group so we

526
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:51,019
demonstrated through a series of

527
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,480
empirical studies that an 80% protein

528
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:57,740
identity level in the NBR domain in

529
00:21:53,480 --> 00:22:00,529
particular is the correct definition of

530
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:02,319
this diversity bin and I'm happy to talk

531
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:05,960
about why we ended up with that number

532
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:09,379
but this diversity bin as we think of it

533
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:12,079
in my mind is akin to a species right so

534
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:14,630
we all understand that species is number

535
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,970
one an artificial construct but that the

536
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:20,320
species is a meaningful biologically

537
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:22,339
meaningful entity that represents

538
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,019
geneious of genotypes that are

539
00:22:22,339 --> 00:22:26,539
genetically diverse in this

540
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:29,000
same way this composite group just

541
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:32,109
Aversa T bin represents a set of our

542
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,250
genes that are genetically diverse but

543
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:37,250
but but this still has biological

544
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:39,109
meanings as you'll see in a moment we've

545
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:41,150
also created a standardized terminology

546
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:43,369
to go along with us so rather than

547
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:45,230
calling these composite groups we refer

548
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:47,779
to these as roser 80 groups and that's

549
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:49,880
answer ROS ACA our genes to 80% identity

550
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:51,730
and we can number these sequentially so

551
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:55,940
as a community this becomes a resource

552
00:22:51,730 --> 00:23:00,470
for for dialogue about the evolution of

553
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:02,380
these genes so roser 80 groups so in the

554
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:05,509
rosacea we've got 12 different species

555
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:08,450
our computer pipeline identified a total

556
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:09,589
of about 2500 our genes one of the key

557
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:12,170
things that we're doing in this study is

558
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:14,869
applying a common set of rules across

559
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:18,410
all 12 species so the numbers that we

560
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:20,419
identify in in a particular species

561
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:22,130
sometimes varies from what's published

562
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,710
in the literature that's because our

563
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:25,970
definition are our stringent rules are a

564
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:28,819
little different than what we see

565
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:31,309
different communities applying but what

566
00:23:28,819 --> 00:23:33,049
we call in our gene and Apple really

567
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:35,210
corresponds to exactly the same

568
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:36,200
definition in peach or strawberry in

569
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:39,230
this particular case

570
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:43,569
so these 2500 our genes could be

571
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:46,130
collapsed into 651 grosser 80 groups

572
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:48,109
this is still a large number but it's

573
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:50,780
small enough that we can start to

574
00:23:48,109 --> 00:23:52,669
visualize data in new ways and a lot of

575
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:55,339
this really is about data visualization

576
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:56,990
and observing these these evolutionary

577
00:23:55,339 --> 00:23:59,419
patterns so one of the things that we've

578
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,930
done in the study is to create phylogeny

579
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:05,509
so this is a maximum likelihood treat

580
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:06,950
generated by our pipeline from these 651

581
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:09,259
rows or 80 groups so each of the branch

582
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:10,940
tips here are these these diversity bins

583
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:15,589
that represent multiple different DNA

584
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:18,200
sequences now this tree can be annotated

585
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:20,529
with all kinds of information so here

586
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,910
I'm layering on information about the

587
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:24,440
representation of individual sequences

588
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:27,380
across the various genomes and the rows

589
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,330
a CA now I could show this as the 12

590
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,350
different species with 12 concentric

591
00:24:29,329 --> 00:24:33,470
circles it gets really really

592
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:36,109
complicated very quickly so instead I've

593
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:38,390
opted here to show this at a tribe level

594
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:40,519
so there are four tribes

595
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:42,890
presented here in the Rose ACA the Ruby

596
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:46,519
a the boat in Chile the amygdala and the

597
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:49,070
pairi a the Ruby a in this case is a

598
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:52,009
single genome sequence of rubus so black

599
00:24:49,069 --> 00:24:54,409
raspberry the Potentilla includes

600
00:24:52,009 --> 00:24:56,180
strawberries so we've got five excuse me

601
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,850
six different trig area species in this

602
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:01,820
study a Meg delay are two different

603
00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:06,169
prunus species and the pairi a are apple

604
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:09,169
and pear so this visualization allows us

605
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:10,759
to to see certain trends that that the

606
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:14,600
genes are represented differentially

607
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:16,910
across these various genomes we also at

608
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:20,509
a topological topographical level we've

609
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:22,490
defined nine different clades reflected

610
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:25,569
in this outer ring are also shown by the

611
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:30,380
color of the tree itself and these are

612
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:33,019
labeled played a through clade I and

613
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,930
importantly we can demonstrate that this

614
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:40,309
tree that the topology of this tree

615
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:42,920
points to these two broad evolutionarily

616
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:45,200
distinct lineages of NBL are genes I

617
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:49,220
mentioned that the TIR non TI archives

618
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,990
so in fact we see that same evolutionary

619
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,850
pattern reflected in the structure of

620
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,470
history so that serves almost as an

621
00:25:52,849 --> 00:25:55,699
internal control telling us that the

622
00:25:54,470 --> 00:26:00,920
pattern that we're seeing in this

623
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:03,110
approach has biological relevancy so a

624
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:05,630
lot of time went into this this simple

625
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:07,579
diagram but now that we've got this we

626
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:11,630
can start to make certain evolutionary

627
00:26:07,579 --> 00:26:13,189
observations about the Beeb's the

628
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:15,410
patterns of diversification these are

629
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:17,029
genes across the various species so I'm

630
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:18,670
going to list for evolutionary

631
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:21,940
observations coming out of this study

632
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:25,850
the first is that our gene lineages are

633
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:28,220
predominantly of ancient origin and what

634
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:30,529
this tells us is that this magical plant

635
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,660
that lived 100 million years ago that

636
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:35,990
gave rise to everything we call rose ACA

637
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:39,050
today already had the remnants of those

638
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:42,500
nine our gene clades back 100 million

639
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:46,159
years ago and of course as that plant

640
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:50,660
diverged into distinct species the the

641
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:51,440
plant physiology changed the geographic

642
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,929
representation

643
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,399
of the plants change in the pathogens

644
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:57,950
that it encountered change so we see

645
00:26:55,398 --> 00:27:01,308
adaptation of the our genes throughout

646
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:03,409
speciation events but all almost all of

647
00:27:01,308 --> 00:27:06,470
the our genes that we see today can

648
00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:09,309
trace their lineage to a common ancestor

649
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:12,740
that lived 100 million years ago

650
00:27:09,308 --> 00:27:15,648
secondly we see from our analyses that

651
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:20,378
everything is everywhere except when

652
00:27:15,648 --> 00:27:23,569
it's not and by that I mean that the the

653
00:27:20,378 --> 00:27:24,980
nine clades are predominantly the nine

654
00:27:23,569 --> 00:27:26,990
our gene clays are predominantly

655
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,548
represented across the 12 genomes there

656
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,929
are a few exceptions I want to highlight

657
00:27:28,548 --> 00:27:32,148
the exceptions because I think those are

658
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:33,350
really the interesting case I'm going to

659
00:27:32,148 --> 00:27:36,918
show this a couple different ways it's

660
00:27:33,349 --> 00:27:38,778
it's difficult to represent this data

661
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:40,370
but I'll do the best I can I'll show in

662
00:27:38,778 --> 00:27:42,470
a couple different ways so this

663
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:44,329
complicated figure is best read from

664
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:47,210
right to left

665
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:49,490
the right column here represents the 651

666
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:52,610
rows or 80 lineages that we've created

667
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:55,788
and we've broken these into the TIR and

668
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:58,819
the non TIR types next we've mapped the

669
00:27:55,788 --> 00:28:01,009
representation of those lineages back on

670
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:03,138
to the individual clades so those a

671
00:28:01,009 --> 00:28:04,909
through I that we've defined finally

672
00:28:03,138 --> 00:28:07,099
we've mapped the presence of the clades

673
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:09,200
onto the 12 genomes that are analyzed in

674
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:11,898
this study now if you have really good

675
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,038
eyes and you really stare at this a long

676
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:15,048
time there are a couple things that'll

677
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:18,769
they'll jump out at you first of all

678
00:28:15,048 --> 00:28:21,490
clade F right here really really tiny

679
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:24,558
and in fact there's a single rows or 80

680
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:26,960
sequence that represents clade F in this

681
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:29,480
particular study clade F is only found

682
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,528
in apple and pear so the poem troops

683
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:35,690
it's absent in the prunus it's absent in

684
00:28:32,528 --> 00:28:37,819
strawberries and in raspberry so that

685
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:40,759
tells us that that particular clade is

686
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:42,109
probably of recent origin so most of

687
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:44,480
these are really ancient 100 million

688
00:28:42,109 --> 00:28:46,939
years ago this one had to have evolved

689
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:51,378
sometime in the last 32 million years or

690
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:53,480
so also if you study this for a long

691
00:28:51,378 --> 00:28:55,788
time you'll see that clade a well

692
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,429
represented across the rows a CA but

693
00:28:55,788 --> 00:29:00,288
missing in the two prunus species so we

694
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:03,798
hypothesized that this might have been

695
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:05,419
lost sometime within the last 39 million

696
00:29:03,798 --> 00:29:07,878
years ago

697
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:10,700
now I can show this in a different way

698
00:29:07,878 --> 00:29:13,509
on this tree you've already seen clade f

699
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:16,190
is this thin blue line right here

700
00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:18,528
present only in Apple in pair and

701
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:21,950
missing in the other species in clade a

702
00:29:18,528 --> 00:29:24,739
is missing in the two prunus genomes

703
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:26,869
that we we've studied um and so that

704
00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:29,569
must have been a recent loss at least no

705
00:29:26,868 --> 00:29:32,088
more than 52 million years ago now these

706
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:33,798
are really hypotheses you know our data

707
00:29:32,088 --> 00:29:36,019
set while we've got 12 genomes it's

708
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:38,358
ultimately limited and they're both

709
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:40,700
technical and biological reasons that we

710
00:29:38,358 --> 00:29:43,608
might see this pattern so this really

711
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,409
warrants more analysis will be analyzing

712
00:29:43,608 --> 00:29:46,759
more genomes but these are really

713
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:50,539
interesting patterns that we can only

714
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:52,819
see through comparative approaches now

715
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:56,538
another exception to that everything is

716
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:58,098
everywhere rule comes from for garius

717
00:29:56,538 --> 00:30:00,798
species so we we're fortunate to have

718
00:29:58,098 --> 00:30:03,319
access to six different genome sequences

719
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:05,358
of for Darius species and the six

720
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:09,200
species here are shown as columns in

721
00:30:05,358 --> 00:30:13,009
this table and the nine are gene clays

722
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,778
that we've defined our rows now there

723
00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:17,749
are there are a couple types of data

724
00:30:14,778 --> 00:30:19,669
that are represented here the the size

725
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:22,608
of the circle indicates the relative

726
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:25,339
number of individual DNA sequences per

727
00:30:22,608 --> 00:30:27,408
clade per species a related measure is

728
00:30:25,338 --> 00:30:29,808
the color which is the number of rows or

729
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:31,579
80 groups for clade for species really

730
00:30:29,808 --> 00:30:33,798
the thing you need to know to understand

731
00:30:31,578 --> 00:30:36,440
this is if you see a circle that means

732
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:38,179
there's an R gene from that clade in

733
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,828
that particular plant you know and the

734
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:42,079
bigger the circle the darker red the

735
00:30:39,828 --> 00:30:44,928
circle the more individual sequences are

736
00:30:42,078 --> 00:30:47,388
present so a couple things jump out

737
00:30:44,929 --> 00:30:49,879
immediately clade F that's that that

738
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:52,098
tiny little clade that we see only an

739
00:30:49,878 --> 00:30:55,848
apple and pear completely missing in our

740
00:30:52,098 --> 00:30:59,208
fir garius species but this species is

741
00:30:55,848 --> 00:31:03,378
fir gary of Eska and this was one of the

742
00:30:59,209 --> 00:31:05,959
it was the very first sequence for for

743
00:31:03,378 --> 00:31:08,328
garius species and for Gary Tabasco has

744
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:12,019
really been touted as as a model system

745
00:31:08,328 --> 00:31:13,759
for analyses in the rows a CA for many

746
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:16,608
different applications so it's really

747
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:19,279
sort of disturbing to me that we found

748
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:22,009
no evidence of clade a D or F

749
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,839
uh ie in this particular plant you know

750
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:25,490
again there could be technical reasons

751
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:27,259
there could be biological reasons maybe

752
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:29,750
if we sequence a different genotype of

753
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:32,509
for Gary of Eska those sequences of D

754
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:36,049
presents but I think this is sort of a a

755
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:38,119
wake up call I guess for overuse of

756
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:39,919
model systems in studying plant genome

757
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:41,319
so what we really need are lots of plant

758
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:45,700
genome sequences from lots of different

759
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:50,480
individual genotypes within each species

760
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:52,100
so a third a third evolutionary

761
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,319
observation from the study is that

762
00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:57,559
patterns of our gene homology reflect

763
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:59,179
species phylogeny and and I'll explain

764
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:01,039
what this means in a moment but this

765
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:04,160
really is justification for a

766
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:06,889
comparative approach for our genes

767
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:11,269
so we've remember that in this study

768
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:13,970
we've collapsed the the phylogenetically

769
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:15,349
redundant diversity in these our gene

770
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:18,079
clusters into a single composite

771
00:32:15,349 --> 00:32:20,119
sequence importantly these sequences

772
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:23,960
while defined in a brisson identity

773
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:26,179
level for the MD protein we have not

774
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:29,140
constrained species representations so

775
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:32,690
in some cases these groups comprise

776
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:34,790
sequences from only one species in some

777
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:37,430
cases they might contain sequences from

778
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:39,859
multiple different species now I want to

779
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:42,529
clarify that I'm talking about the

780
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:45,439
representation within individual rows or

781
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:48,500
ad groups so a broad clade could be

782
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,759
represented across the rows a CA but for

783
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,099
example and what we'll talk about this

784
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:54,700
in just a moment these sequences shown

785
00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:57,109
right here are found only in Apple

786
00:32:54,700 --> 00:33:00,350
alright so that that's an example of a

787
00:32:57,109 --> 00:33:02,240
rosary ad group that comprises sequences

788
00:33:00,349 --> 00:33:04,669
from one species even though the clade

789
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,670
overall is represented across the rows a

790
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:10,460
CA so if we only look at representation

791
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:13,940
within the rows a CA we see that the

792
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:17,240
majority of of individual rows or ad

793
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:19,070
groups comprise sequences that come only

794
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,039
from one tribe so closely related

795
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:23,480
species and that's represented by by the

796
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:25,279
numbers in these circles and this makes

797
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,950
good sense right this is consistent with

798
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:31,430
this model of rapid evolution of our

799
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:33,170
genes to adapt to pathogen pressures but

800
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:35,670
when we see roser ad

801
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:38,430
comprising sequences for more than one

802
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:41,880
tribe the more closely related the tribe

803
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:44,308
is the more common shirts individual

804
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:48,050
sequences are so for example we see the

805
00:33:44,308 --> 00:33:51,960
the stone fruits and the poems sharing

806
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:54,720
17 brochure ad groups in common and frog

807
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:57,269
area species and and rubus species

808
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,789
sharing for that's in contrast to the

809
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:01,980
more distantly related tribes so so the

810
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:04,440
more distantly related you are the less

811
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,029
likely you are to to share sequences in

812
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,970
common that that makes good sense that's

813
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:10,320
really what phylogeny is built on but

814
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:12,569
this more or less serves as a

815
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,460
justification for comparative genomics

816
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:17,100
approaches so this really works for our

817
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:19,500
genes as well as for other genes now

818
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:21,719
this this graph also shows something

819
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,460
that I find just fascinating and

820
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:25,648
perplexing and I would love to hear your

821
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,898
thoughts on this we always think about

822
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:29,579
our genes is evolving very rapidly I

823
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:32,159
showed you the graph I've used that

824
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:34,199
terminology multiple times but there are

825
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,909
certain our genes that we've found in

826
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:38,009
the study that are very slow evolving

827
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:40,530
and in particular for roser eighty

828
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:43,070
groups comprised sequences from all the

829
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:46,260
tribes so over a hundred million years

830
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:48,320
these genes the protein sequences have

831
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:51,530
not diverged by more than twenty percent

832
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,730
that does not match pattern of

833
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:56,040
responding to two paths changing

834
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:57,990
pathogen pressures so one of the key

835
00:34:56,039 --> 00:35:00,750
questions that comes to my mind is what

836
00:34:57,989 --> 00:35:02,669
are these sequences doing there are a

837
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:04,260
few models that we've gotten in mind

838
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:06,059
they could be involved in non host

839
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,570
resistance and maybe they're so good at

840
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:08,460
what they do

841
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:10,710
they've been conserved in the rows a CA

842
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,300
and they're defending its would be

843
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:14,460
pathogen that we don't even think of as

844
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:17,519
a pathogen for the rosacea so that's one

845
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:20,010
possibility they could be engaged in in

846
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:22,289
in mediating positive plant microbe

847
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:23,370
interactions or maybe they have entirely

848
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:25,230
different functions they could be

849
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:27,989
involved for example in environmental

850
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:29,309
stresses so there's some key experiments

851
00:35:27,989 --> 00:35:32,429
we can think of look at their

852
00:35:29,309 --> 00:35:35,159
transcription patterns up regulate them

853
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:36,750
knock them out but really what do you

854
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:38,849
what do you challenge these plants with

855
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,559
if you knock one of these genes out what

856
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:42,179
do you challenge with but I'd love to

857
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:44,449
hear your thoughts and exactly how we

858
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:46,619
can tackle what these things are doing

859
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:48,569
but this really

860
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:49,980
illustrate the power of comparative

861
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:51,990
genomics if we were looking at the

862
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,820
genomic sequence of apple certainly

863
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:55,619
those gene sequences are present there

864
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:58,170
we would have no idea that they're

865
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:59,670
highly conserved so so through this

866
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:01,860
comparative approach where you begin to

867
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:03,960
see that understanding these patterns of

868
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,789
diversification actually can tie back to

869
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,050
putative biological function that's

870
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:10,619
really what we want to leverage in the

871
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:12,210
study now the fourth and final

872
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:13,609
evolutionary observation I want to share

873
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:16,260
with you I think is the most exciting

874
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:18,000
and that is that species differ in

875
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,560
patterns of our gene diversification and

876
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,559
this really provides clue to how to use

877
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:24,269
this to mine those gene Bank collections

878
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:26,309
so we've seen this tree before I've

879
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:29,820
already pointed out that Clady is well

880
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:32,759
represented across all of the species in

881
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:34,710
this study but within the clade there

882
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,660
are certain subclades that show very

883
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:39,470
different patterns so this sub play that

884
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:42,449
I'm highlighting is a good example of

885
00:36:39,469 --> 00:36:45,119
diversification that's happened only in

886
00:36:42,449 --> 00:36:48,299
the palm fruits only an apple or in pair

887
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,639
so very very well represented in apple

888
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:52,470
and pear but this subclade is absent and

889
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:54,449
these other species to me this means

890
00:36:52,469 --> 00:36:57,179
something there's an evolutionary reason

891
00:36:54,449 --> 00:37:00,000
why this has happened and I would

892
00:36:57,179 --> 00:37:02,429
predict that that has some biological

893
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,829
function that's important apple and pear

894
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:08,419
but you're relevant to the other plant

895
00:37:04,829 --> 00:37:10,799
species now there's another layer of

896
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:12,720
data that I want to layer on here and

897
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,820
we'll talk in more detail about this on

898
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:18,230
this outer circle that you see here is a

899
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:21,840
heat map that shows the representation

900
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:23,579
shows the the composition of the

901
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,120
individual rosário group so remember the

902
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:29,009
roser ad groups are the branch tips here

903
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:31,559
so this actually shows you how many

904
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:34,020
individual DNA sequences went into

905
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:37,079
defining that our gene that the roser ad

906
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:39,239
group dark color indicates two sequences

907
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:41,819
which is the minimum definition and in

908
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:43,169
this study the largest has more the

909
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,880
largest Rose rating group has more than

910
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:47,579
60 sequences and that's shown as white

911
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,829
so within this subclade for example we

912
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:51,809
see a multitude of colors are orange

913
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:53,929
being sort of in the twenty to forty

914
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:56,549
individual DNA sequences going in group

915
00:37:53,929 --> 00:37:59,099
but if you look across the tree you you

916
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:00,580
you see many examples of this sort of

917
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:03,219
pattern of evolution

918
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:05,409
so apple and pear really prefer this

919
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:07,629
clade telling us that there's something

920
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,989
happening in a functional evolutionary

921
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:10,630
way

922
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:13,419
I mean contrast strawberry loves this

923
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:14,769
particular clade so understanding what

924
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:17,110
these patterns already think is really

925
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:19,000
key to linking DNA sequence to putative

926
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:21,690
function and then ultimately mining

927
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,039
these for the improvement of crops

928
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:25,900
alright so the for evolutionary

929
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:28,480
observations just to conclude this piece

930
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:30,490
our gene lineages are of ancient origin

931
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,039
everything is everywhere except when

932
00:38:30,489 --> 00:38:35,589
it's not patterns of our gene homology

933
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:37,960
reflects species by lodging and and

934
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:44,170
species differ in patterns of our gene

935
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:46,449
diversification so that was all through

936
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:47,769
observational science and and the next

937
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,989
phase I want to tell you about a couple

938
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:52,000
hypotheses that are emerging from here

939
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:55,439
that that really only happened because

940
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,440
we're looking across species

941
00:38:56,309 --> 00:39:00,969
so one of the one of the areas I've

942
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,760
really been interested in for a long

943
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:05,889
time is an answer to this question is

944
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,890
agriculture escalated the molecular arms

945
00:39:05,889 --> 00:39:10,599
race between plants and pathogens

946
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:12,279
there's really an elegant literature out

947
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:14,110
there that documents at large-scale

948
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,590
monocultures practice in modern

949
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:19,120
agriculture has had significant impact

950
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:20,829
on the effector suites of pathogen

951
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,319
populations we've seen that multiple

952
00:39:20,829 --> 00:39:25,090
different paths of systems I think it's

953
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,880
perfectly logical that we would see the

954
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:30,700
same pattern in plants I'd look a little

955
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,860
bit different so um in plants what we

956
00:39:30,699 --> 00:39:36,159
think is happening is that pathogen

957
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:40,780
pressures are are driving plant genomes

958
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:42,940
to diversify specific alleles and as we

959
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,010
talked about in in terms of clustering

960
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,869
of these genes one of the key drivers

961
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,910
for allelic diversification is expansion

962
00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:50,619
of our gene clusters so so thinking

963
00:39:48,909 --> 00:39:52,960
about evolutionary patterns where

964
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:54,759
individual species have lots of our

965
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,860
genes and high allelic diversity in

966
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,860
certain clades or subclades on our tree

967
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:02,559
we think is an evolutionary indicator

968
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:04,269
that pathogen pressures are causing the

969
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:08,199
the plan to diversify in those genomic

970
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:11,079
regions now to test this we've turned to

971
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:14,139
the apple scab path ax system now apple

972
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:14,829
scab e is aptly named it caused a scab

973
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:18,039
on apple

974
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:21,130
it's caused by the fungus Ventura and a

975
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:23,800
koala and it is for a very long time

976
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:25,809
been a target of Apple breeding efforts

977
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:29,170
in particulars so there have been a

978
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:32,019
total of 20 our genes or resistance

979
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:35,019
genes defined in a phenotypic level in

980
00:40:32,019 --> 00:40:37,900
in the apple apple scab half a system

981
00:40:35,019 --> 00:40:39,849
these are labeled rvi 1 through RBI 20 I

982
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:42,250
think two of these have been cloned they

983
00:40:39,849 --> 00:40:44,049
are in fact mvlr our genes the rest of

984
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:46,840
them have been mapped to varying degrees

985
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:47,890
and are useful for breeding applications

986
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,680
but we don't actually know what the

987
00:40:47,889 --> 00:40:54,789
underlying gene is so in this study we

988
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:56,589
called the literature and and and put

989
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:59,139
the Associated molecular markers back

990
00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:01,510
onto the apple reference genome and we

991
00:40:59,139 --> 00:41:04,269
could find likely NBL are candidates for

992
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:07,480
15 of these genes and when we looked at

993
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:10,329
those 15 genes we hypothesized the apple

994
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:12,070
scab genes should occupy these these

995
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:15,069
large species specific highly

996
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:16,960
diversified grosser ad clades and in

997
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:20,920
fact I'm showing it only for three of

998
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,900
these RBI 415 and one the candidates for

999
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,059
those genes reside in that highly

1000
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:28,230
diversified subclade and Clady that I

1001
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:30,909
described and in fact each of these

1002
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:33,159
comes from a rose or a tea group that

1003
00:41:30,909 --> 00:41:35,739
contains many different DNA sequences so

1004
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:37,259
this pattern of allelic diversification

1005
00:41:35,739 --> 00:41:40,809
I think of it as really iterative

1006
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:42,460
evolution perhaps Apple hit on some gene

1007
00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:44,139
sequence that worked really well against

1008
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:46,510
then tria and a koala and then

1009
00:41:44,139 --> 00:41:49,389
evolutionary dynamics created more

1010
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:51,040
allelic diversity at that locus and some

1011
00:41:49,389 --> 00:41:52,539
of that allelic diversity works against

1012
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:55,050
Ventura and equality and some of it

1013
00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:58,029
doesn't but this idea of reinventing

1014
00:41:55,050 --> 00:42:00,670
functional genes seems to be a pattern

1015
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:03,370
of evolution that plants are adapting

1016
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:04,900
and it's reflected very nicely in the

1017
00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:07,289
overall topology of our tree

1018
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:09,460
now I'm looking across there 15

1019
00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:12,820
candidate genes we found really strong

1020
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:16,269
statistical support for for this idea

1021
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:18,400
that important agricultural genes reside

1022
00:42:16,269 --> 00:42:20,679
in these highly diversified plates so

1023
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,110
that gives us a clue and how we can

1024
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:25,059
actually go after gene bank collections

1025
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:28,610
so if we develop strategies for

1026
00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:30,349
generating sequence sequence data

1027
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:32,480
from genebank collections at those low

1028
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:34,940
sigh we suddenly have a way of

1029
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:38,300
recognizing which genotypes or species

1030
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:40,940
or populations have novel DNA sequence

1031
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:43,360
or protein level diversity and that

1032
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:46,849
information then can inform phenotyping

1033
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:49,190
so this this uses a system can really

1034
00:42:46,849 --> 00:42:53,420
speed up discovery a beautiful traits

1035
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:55,309
for plant breeding and and so this idea

1036
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:58,010
of mining hum is really where we're

1037
00:42:55,309 --> 00:43:01,340
going now the first the first step

1038
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:04,160
towards that we're pursuing actually in

1039
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:06,950
in rows in the rows black spot pather

1040
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:09,230
system so sanho Constanza professor at

1041
00:43:06,949 --> 00:43:11,000
university of minnesota david's Lezak is

1042
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:12,800
at the University of Wisconsin River

1043
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,869
Falls I've collaborated with these two

1044
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,450
guys for probably ten years on rose

1045
00:43:14,869 --> 00:43:20,929
black spot issues stands actually a

1046
00:43:17,449 --> 00:43:23,839
breeder and he's part of the USDA cap

1047
00:43:20,929 --> 00:43:26,059
called Rose breed and the focus of that

1048
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:28,280
is to develop molecular markers linked

1049
00:43:26,059 --> 00:43:31,009
to useful disease resistance traits like

1050
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,090
black spot in rows so in connection with

1051
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:34,370
that project we've already generated

1052
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:37,280
large segregating populations and we've

1053
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:42,440
done a lot of phenotyping data in snip

1054
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:44,990
marker analyses we want to leverage that

1055
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:47,210
data set and a rosary ad system to

1056
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:48,589
identify perfect markers for

1057
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:50,929
marker-assisted breeding and in this

1058
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:53,059
context I'm defining a perfect marker as

1059
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:54,769
one that's actually derived from the

1060
00:43:53,059 --> 00:43:58,099
causal gene so the goal is to actually

1061
00:43:54,769 --> 00:44:01,159
land on top of the allele that makes ros

1062
00:43:58,099 --> 00:44:05,900
rosa resistance due to the black spot

1063
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:07,429
pathogen and for this we're adapting DNA

1064
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:09,829
sequence capture approach called ren

1065
00:44:07,429 --> 00:44:11,929
seek so this was pioneered by jonathan

1066
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:14,599
Jones's group in ironically the potato

1067
00:44:11,929 --> 00:44:17,389
late blight system the idea is that a

1068
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:19,759
series of DNA sequence baits are created

1069
00:44:17,389 --> 00:44:22,929
from known our gene sequences and that's

1070
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:25,070
used then in to pull down corresponding

1071
00:44:22,929 --> 00:44:27,169
genetic necessarily identical but

1072
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:28,970
corresponding sequences from DNA

1073
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:32,210
solutions from for example gene Bank

1074
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:34,459
collections that gives us a pool of our

1075
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:37,340
gene enriched DNA that can be sequenced

1076
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:40,400
at large scale so we're using this in

1077
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:42,559
ROS we're creating a DNA baits from what

1078
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,619
we've learned are the nying claims

1079
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:47,750
in the Rose ACA we've already created

1080
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:49,309
resistant susceptible bulbs based on our

1081
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:52,130
Rose phenotyping that we've completed

1082
00:44:49,309 --> 00:44:55,400
our goal is to create sequence libraries

1083
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:57,170
that have allele level resolution will

1084
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,329
identify can't have polymorphisms and of

1085
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:02,389
course validate on the larger on the

1086
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:04,250
larger data set so this really serves as

1087
00:45:02,389 --> 00:45:06,559
a proof of concept that would be

1088
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:08,510
directly applicable to rose breeding but

1089
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:11,929
I I think could be really ported to

1090
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:15,760
almost any plant family almost any gene

1091
00:45:11,929 --> 00:45:18,230
bank collection and so for example

1092
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,270
downstream we'd like to do this in the

1093
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:23,150
apple scab half a system or in potato

1094
00:45:20,269 --> 00:45:26,230
late blight or in We Trust I think it

1095
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:29,750
has really a multitude of applications

1096
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:32,090
so to wrap up in this seminar I've

1097
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:33,260
presented compared a comparative

1098
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:36,140
genomics framework that we're calling

1099
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:37,670
the rose or a tea system this is really

1100
00:45:36,139 --> 00:45:41,629
what we've done is to define a set of

1101
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:43,340
rules for looking across plant families

1102
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:44,840
at the evolution of these genes and

1103
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:48,320
we've created a computer pipeline that

1104
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:50,300
does that in a semi automated fashion in

1105
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,980
the rows a CA some of our evolutionary

1106
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,750
observations are that our gene linea

1107
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:58,159
deserve at least a million years old

1108
00:45:53,750 --> 00:46:00,679
everything is everywhere almost our gene

1109
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:02,480
distribution reflects phylogeny and the

1110
00:46:00,679 --> 00:46:04,129
most important is that species differ in

1111
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,159
patterns of our gene diversification

1112
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:10,190
that is our entree into hypothesis

1113
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:12,319
testing linking individuals our gene

1114
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:15,050
sequences or our protein sequences the

1115
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:17,030
putative biological function and of

1116
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:19,010
course the end goal here is to really

1117
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:21,200
effectively mine gene bank collections

1118
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:23,420
for crop improvement hopefully the

1119
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:25,819
genotyping will drive informed

1120
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:27,980
phenotyping that will sort of fast

1121
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:30,830
forward our process of plant improvement

1122
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:33,219
and with that I've got time I'm very

1123
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:41,840
happy to take any questions

1124
00:46:33,219 --> 00:46:41,839
[Applause]

1125
00:46:41,949 --> 00:46:55,460
yes yes so the question was do do our

1126
00:46:53,179 --> 00:46:57,559
genes tend to cluster near recombination

1127
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:01,220
hotspots in plant genomes and the answer

1128
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:03,190
is yes and so this idea of clustering is

1129
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:06,189
really important in terms of driving

1130
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:08,450
overall evolution and adaptation

1131
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:11,360
creation of new alleles at these low

1132
00:47:08,449 --> 00:47:13,449
site but other factors like bead and

1133
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:16,309
genome locations that are more prone to

1134
00:47:13,449 --> 00:47:17,899
recombination is another key piece of

1135
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:20,179
that they're often associated with trans

1136
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:23,030
poseable elements which I think probably

1137
00:47:20,179 --> 00:47:24,949
has a biological role so there are there

1138
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:26,330
many factors we probably don't have a

1139
00:47:24,949 --> 00:47:30,069
full complete understanding of what's

1140
00:47:26,329 --> 00:47:30,069
driving it but but your question spot-on

1141
00:47:30,789 --> 00:47:50,420
yes are you talking specifically about

1142
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:52,639
the four yeah so great yeah so the

1143
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:54,559
question referred to that small set of

1144
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:56,119
our genes that really has not evolved

1145
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,670
very rapidly over a hundred million

1146
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:01,960
years and the question was are these our

1147
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:04,730
genes are the core the cognate effectors

1148
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:14,090
highly conserved in pathogen population

1149
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:16,070
sorry so you're asking if the conserved

1150
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:19,309
our genes are guards of highly conserved

1151
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:20,870
plant proteins probably yes actually I

1152
00:48:19,309 --> 00:48:23,090
would even go so far to say that the the

1153
00:48:20,869 --> 00:48:26,119
cognate effector probably is highly

1154
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:28,280
conserved and I think that that you know

1155
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:30,259
whether that is sort of a non host

1156
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,490
that's consistent with the idea that

1157
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:33,530
they might play a role in non host

1158
00:48:31,489 --> 00:48:35,659
positions I think it also could be

1159
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:38,330
consistent with the idea that they may

1160
00:48:35,659 --> 00:48:40,849
be involved in mediating positive plant

1161
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:42,079
microbe interactions so I'm speculating

1162
00:48:40,849 --> 00:48:44,539
it's it's fun because we don't have any

1163
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:48,440
data about that but but probably I think

1164
00:48:44,539 --> 00:48:50,929
that's a logical okay so

1165
00:48:48,440 --> 00:49:06,800
you can be uniques FBI in the support

1166
00:48:50,929 --> 00:49:08,239
centers okay yes it's a great question I

1167
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,818
wish I knew the answer so the question

1168
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:13,189
is in in that F clade that that tiny

1169
00:49:10,818 --> 00:49:14,949
little clade R Gean clade that seems to

1170
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:17,780
only be represented apple and pear

1171
00:49:14,949 --> 00:49:19,838
what's it doing is it corresponding to

1172
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:23,420
some unique pathogen that's only found

1173
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:26,210
in apple and pear and I don't know

1174
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:28,309
probably but what there are many unique

1175
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:30,889
pathogens of each of the species in the

1176
00:49:28,309 --> 00:49:33,730
study so it's it's a good guess but I

1177
00:49:30,889 --> 00:49:33,730
don't know how to narrow that down

1178
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:38,300
[Music]

1179
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:48,619
okay so bill bill yeah it's a great bill

1180
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:50,929
bills are asking why why do the number

1181
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:53,750
of our genes in rosacea genomes vary

1182
00:49:50,929 --> 00:49:55,929
from 43 and in rubus to more than 600

1183
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:58,639
and Apple I don't know but it but I

1184
00:49:55,929 --> 00:50:02,868
think it actually means something so

1185
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:04,879
some of our let me give to two schools

1186
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:07,160
of thought on this there's this idea out

1187
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,510
in the literature that woody plants

1188
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:10,519
should have more our genes because

1189
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:12,980
they're longer lived um I have traced

1190
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:15,050
this back to the the pop the poplar

1191
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:16,490
genome sequence it seems to be just sort

1192
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:18,500
of put out there's a hypothesis I've

1193
00:50:16,489 --> 00:50:20,059
seen it in multiple different papers I

1194
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,769
see no evidence of it I don't understand

1195
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:23,630
how a woody plant says oh yeah I need

1196
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:25,369
lots of our genes I don't think that's

1197
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:28,430
the driver what I think is actually

1198
00:50:25,369 --> 00:50:31,338
happening is relates to the agriculture

1199
00:50:28,429 --> 00:50:35,239
intensification of these things so more

1200
00:50:31,338 --> 00:50:37,608
highly you know intensively farmed

1201
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:40,219
plants things that have a longer history

1202
00:50:37,608 --> 00:50:42,679
of cultivation things that are a broader

1203
00:50:40,219 --> 00:50:46,309
worldwide distribution I think should

1204
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:49,098
have more our genes especially compared

1205
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:50,809
to the wild relatives and you know we

1206
00:50:49,099 --> 00:50:52,250
even though we've got 12 genomes in the

1207
00:50:50,809 --> 00:50:55,400
study we don't really have that many

1208
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:57,108
wild species so why do I think I'd like

1209
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,690
to do with our pipeline is do sort of a

1210
00:50:57,108 --> 00:51:02,340
meta-analysis of the 251 plant genomes

1211
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:04,860
that we do have and start to

1212
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:07,530
you'll look at life history of the plant

1213
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:10,380
cultivation history the you know the

1214
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:12,750
agricultural significance of it whether

1215
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:14,490
it's woody or not woody and see what the

1216
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:16,639
correlation is a number of our genes so

1217
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:19,469
I don't know it's a great question um I

1218
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:21,929
I'm a biologist I think there has to be

1219
00:51:19,469 --> 00:51:30,509
a reason for us but I don't know what it

1220
00:51:21,929 --> 00:51:33,779
is this cultural facility I'm sorry

1221
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:39,060
you're gonna have to speak up facilitate

1222
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:41,100
the diversification yeah right right so

1223
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:43,049
this idea the question is uh

1224
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:45,869
relates to agricultural intensification

1225
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:50,039
why what's the driver how is that

1226
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:51,839
influencing the the the putative change

1227
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:54,360
in our gene numbers I think they're both

1228
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:56,309
intentional selection unintentional so

1229
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:59,400
you know agriculture as we know it's ten

1230
00:51:56,309 --> 00:52:01,019
thousand years old so somebody had a

1231
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,519
great idea ten thousand years ago to

1232
00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:06,090
actually plant some of the seeds that

1233
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:08,159
she went out and harvested that act

1234
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:10,440
alone the domestication process put

1235
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:11,519
selection on the plants right so plants

1236
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:13,829
that don't shatter plants that

1237
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:15,719
overwinter plants that taste good etc so

1238
00:52:13,829 --> 00:52:17,909
there was an inherent selection that

1239
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:20,369
went on during that domestication

1240
00:52:17,909 --> 00:52:21,779
process I think probably people ten

1241
00:52:20,369 --> 00:52:23,519
thousand years ago didn't want to eat

1242
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,260
scabby apples any more than we do today

1243
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:27,269
so they probably ate the ones that look

1244
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:29,130
good it wasn't intentional selection but

1245
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:31,679
it but it was selection of course in

1246
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:33,240
more modern times breeding where we're

1247
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:34,319
intentionally putting that selective

1248
00:52:33,239 --> 00:52:36,989
pressure on there so I think it's

1249
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:38,760
probably a combination one of one of the

1250
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:40,769
key things that has come out of our

1251
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,240
study though is it's really changed the

1252
00:52:40,769 --> 00:52:43,590
way I think about evolution I've always

1253
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:46,139
thought of evolution is happening over

1254
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:48,420
millions of years now I'm really curious

1255
00:52:46,139 --> 00:52:49,859
our genes like are they even generation

1256
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:52,139
generation are we seeing changes in

1257
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:55,140
these clusters and I think that'd be

1258
00:52:52,139 --> 00:52:56,670
really a really cool set of experiments

1259
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:58,170
to do and with you know whole genome

1260
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:59,460
sequencing becoming more accessible it's

1261
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:03,809
something we probably can do in the

1262
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:05,990
not-too-distant future thank you very

1263
