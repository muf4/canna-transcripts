00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:14,638
University if you think of other plants

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,640
around the world that do things in this

4
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:20,559
spectacular fashion Hawaiian silver

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:24,480
swords for example um the Giant puya

6
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:26,839
from from Bolivia and Peru um other

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,240
examples uh the the century plant the

8
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:31,800
giant Agave from our own deserts these

9
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:33,878
plants are like salmon right they live a

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,719
long time they reproduce once and it

11
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:37,718
exhausts and kills them the act of

12
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:40,719
reproduction what's remarkable to me

13
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,079
about this is that it's it's marshalling

14
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,520
that kind of energy and that kind of

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,520
floral display but it gets a chance to

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,000
reproduce over and over again and that's

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,559
what we were discussing before you all

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,640
arrived as to like how does it balance

19
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:55,519
its energy does it does it engage in

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,000
just really extraordinary photosynthetic

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,199
rates and photo and photosynthetic um

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,799
you know productivity in ways that those

23
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:03,679
other plants can't all of the plants I

24
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:05,399
mentioned uh either grow at high

25
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,400
elevation in the tropics or on desert

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,040
islands and so the problem there is not

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,200
photosynthesis because they have lots of

28
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,680
sun it's that it's drought you know and

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,640
these plants don't have that problem

30
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,040
they're they grow in rainforest and and

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,599
and they're not limited by moisture so

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,520
it also as another lesson it reminds us

33
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,679
that plant reproductive strategies are

34
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,560
also limited by where they live what

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,600
kind of soil they're on what kind of

36
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,600
environment they're in Etc

37
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,759
so so there's another another thing that

38
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:38,118
we're looking to to to to study this

39
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:40,200
time around um we tracked as you can see

40
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:43,159
in this in this sheet uh we tracked the

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,799
odors that we've studied in other plants

42
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,280
and that we expected to see that have

43
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,399
been other people studying this plant

44
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,239
and Publishing their results and so we

45
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,960
weren't shocked by anything um some of

46
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:56,239
our faculty Carl Nicholas for example

47
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,478
smelled the fishy odor um uh on the

48
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,679
morning after and asked you know is it

49
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:04,039
is there an amine in there and and sure

50
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,960
enough they're the very low levels of um

51
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:08,640
compounds that were very sensitive to

52
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,679
trimethyl amine is kind of rotting fish

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,039
odor uh and what we've wondered this

54
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,199
time around is is that actually um a

55
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:18,000
volatile coming off the pollen grains

56
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:21,039
because it started showing up in our

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,598
study when the pollen was available in

58
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,919
the inside the flow so this time around

59
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:26,560
we we might like to collect some pollen

60
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:28,639
and do a separate scent collection from

61
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,080
the pollen itself and the reason why

62
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,759
that's of more than trivial interest is

63
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,400
for the animals that are getting Co

64
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:37,878
covered and coated with pollen um it's

65
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,680
very important that they don't groom

66
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:41,679
okay one of the reasons so a question

67
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,040
that com commonly arises when we look at

68
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,080
this plant is why is it so

69
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:50,079
large why is so big why is it so

70
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,400
overstated anything in nature that's

71
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,480
that's exaggerated or overstated is

72
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,959
interesting to us um and one of the

73
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:56,759
things that people suggest is that the

74
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,080
population density of these plants is so

75
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:02,239
small they don't grow in groves right

76
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,560
there's one here one there um that they

77
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,200
have to advertise from a distance to get

78
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,400
their pollinators to find them the

79
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:10,598
second time the third time because it

80
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,158
doesn't work unless they get duped two

81
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:16,280
or three times in the process of of of a

82
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:19,239
week um and so one of the things we've

83
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,158
wanted to know is um how does that

84
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:24,680
transition work from from male from

85
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:26,239
female stage to to male stage the the

86
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,640
flies have to fly with the pollen on

87
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,400
their bodies they might have to fly 500

88
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,559
meters or a kilometer or two or three

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,879
kilometers to find the next one of these

90
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,560
before they can enact you know they can

91
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:39,158
complete the the the loop and and

92
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,438
enclose the loop on pollination uh it's

93
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:41,798
important that they don't groom the

94
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:44,120
pollen off their bodies while they're

95
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,159
doing that okay and if you watch insects

96
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,319
as much as we do a lot of insects are

97
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:51,798
fastidious they'll hit four or five

98
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:54,119
flowers fly to a perch sit on the perch

99
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,760
and then brush themselves flies are very

100
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,200
good at this where you've all seen them

101
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,878
kind of do this with their hind legs and

102
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,759
their for legs and clean themselves off

103
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:03,798
they have brushes on their legs to clean

104
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:06,359
their antenna so they can smell they can

105
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:08,159
right um our moths that we study we

106
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,239
study these very large Hawk moths that

107
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,919
visit night blooming flowers like the

108
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,560
Darwin's Orchid from Madagascar that

109
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,399
Paul has shared with us in years past

110
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,839
they're they're slobs they don't groom

111
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,159
and they're gypsies they they fly tens

112
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,159
of miles a night so they're a dream for

113
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,000
plants because they don't waste the

114
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,600
plants pollen investment in them and

115
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,240
they're able to move pollen long

116
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,400
distances without wiping it off their

117
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,280
bodies

118
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:36,359
so um here we're kind of interested in

119
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:40,799
in that that the male part of the of the

120
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,840
plant too um are are the insects leaving

121
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,160
at dawn the following day and if and are

122
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:45,879
they doing so with pollen on their

123
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,080
bodies and is there something about the

124
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:49,439
odor of that pollen that might you know

125
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,639
make them more likely to leave it where

126
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,639
it

127
00:04:54,439 --> 00:05:02,959
is this has been a production of Cornell
