1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,798
University I'm going to talk about what

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,679
I did on my summer vacation actually so

4
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:16,239
this is actually I mean this in a sense

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,560
that um in just a few months I'll be

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:21,278
fully retired and at that point I'll be

7
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,879
asking for the faculty to grant me a

8
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,480
Meritus status so I have to prove that

9
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,678
I'm still actually doing something

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,359
useful and that's what this is all about

11
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:32,278
today so I'm going to talk about major

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,559
question which is how novelty arises

13
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,800
it's a probably the fundamental question

14
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,799
in evolutionary biology and I'm going to

15
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:42,159
talk about it in several ways one is

16
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:46,119
about species and how they arise and

17
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:48,119
evolve secondly how structures uh evolve

18
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:51,159
how they originate and thirdly at the

19
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:53,759
cell level how does cell types evolve so

20
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:56,439
all three of those so I'll tell three

21
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:59,198
short stories essentially the first is

22
00:00:56,439 --> 00:01:02,280
about speciation and its consequences

23
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:04,198
turn that one off okay and uh in

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,200
particular couple of short stories about

25
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:09,560
soybean relatives which I worked on for

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,478
years and also rice and then uh after

27
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,879
that the evolution of nodulation

28
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:15,799
symbiosis and finally talking about Gene

29
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:17,039
duplications and the EV evolution of

30
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:19,040
cell type

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,159
diversity what these things have in

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,759
common other than novelty is poly and

33
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:25,159
suang mentioned that my research has

34
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,118
been about poly whole genome duplication

35
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,000
for many many years

36
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:32,118
now so polyploidy I think is everybody

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,239
knows here is everything above the level

38
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:38,640
of two sets of chromosomes in a

39
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:40,719
Cell It's a phenomenon that is very

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,439
common in nature at the at the

41
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,118
organismal level endopolyploid is a

42
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,559
common phenomenon as it mentions here in

43
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,478
this review paper indispensable for

44
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,600
normal development and organ formation

45
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:53,920
across various organisms from fungi to

46
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,519
humans and plants of course as well

47
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,000
Adrien rotors work on giant cells in

48
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,118
seil of arabidopsis for example so

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,039
there's muscle cell two nuclei and then

50
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:06,840
also it's a very common phenomenon in

51
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:09,360
cancer cancer is a says here is an ugly

52
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,080
consequence of Endor replication and

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,959
polyploidization but I'm not going to be

54
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,840
talking about Endo polyploidy today I'll

55
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,719
be talking about whole organism

56
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,560
polyploidy where whole organisms are

57
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,840
duplicated duplicate their genomes and

58
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,959
polyol occurs throughout the entire tree

59
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,319
of life U all of us in this room are

60
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,959
multiply polyploid along with all other

61
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:33,119
vertebrates based on a very long time

62
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:35,719
time ago polyploidization event all the

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,879
way back here in the Cambrian

64
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:41,120
explosion other commonly uh common lab

65
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,919
organisms such as yeast are

66
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,560
polyploid and uh if you like salmon for

67
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,799
example and trout you're eating

68
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,719
tetraploids recent

69
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,360
tetrols but plants really do polyploid

70
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:56,598
in a big way and this is uh from the

71
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,519
1,000 plant transcripts thousand

72
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:01,518
different transcripts of different

73
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,640
species among on which there were 244

74
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,480
whole genome duplication events

75
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:07,798
identified some shared many of them

76
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:10,639
shared but also unique ones at the tips

77
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,599
of these branches of the trees and if

78
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:16,119
you look over here on the side at the uh

79
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:18,560
distribution of the number of poly

80
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,920
events whole genome duplication events

81
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,239
and the ancestry of all of these

82
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,039
different TXS so what you'll see is that

83
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,280
many of the common angiosperms so the

84
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:29,120
rosids and the asterids for example so

85
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,959
legumes asers all of those things have

86
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,039
an average about four whole genome

87
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,680
duplication events in their evolutionary

88
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:38,318
histories that you see in the

89
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,080
genome so my friend Jonathan Wendell

90
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,158
published a very nice paper on this some

91
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,560
years back and he calls it the wondrous

92
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,878
cycles of polyan plants it's for us

93
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,000
enthusiasts about poly we think of it as

94
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,039
a wonderful sort of thing but what we

95
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,079
see is this cycle here all a whole bunch

96
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,840
of different poly events across the tree

97
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:58,879
of life and we have all sorts of events

98
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,959
that happen and concominant to that and

99
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:04,959
finally this whole cycle of duplication

100
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,799
and uh Gene loss balanc biased

101
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,799
fractionation or Gene loss of different

102
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,799
G sub genomes genome downsizing so loss

103
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:13,760
of repeated sequence for example

104
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,400
rearrangements and then you've produced

105
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,560
a functionally diploid plant through

106
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,239
this process involves many different

107
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,680
individual processes that are called

108
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:23,000
lumped together as

109
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,519
diploidization so this diploidization

110
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,079
cycle Follow by another round of polyl

111
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:31,000
gives us the complex genomes that we see

112
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,599
in flowering plants today

113
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,360
so the first of my vignettes is about

114
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,479
speciation I'm not going to talk much

115
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,520
about this this is um an area where a

116
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,319
lot of my research has been over the

117
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:43,079
years um but I'm just going to mention a

118
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:45,839
couple of things excuse me that we've

119
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:48,120
been doing lately um so long-term

120
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,000
project actually look at the uh

121
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,959
evolution of the soybean relatives that

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,720
you see down here perennial soybeans

123
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,638
native to Australia Jacob Landis has led

124
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,880
much of this work in recent years and so

125
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,240
collaboration with Ching Lee Leu at

126
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,759
senta and and Andrew Farmer at National

127
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,720
Center for genome resources in Santa Fe

128
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,840
this paper um I think Jacob just

129
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,520
submitted it what a week and a half ago

130
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,038
something like that so this was one of

131
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,038
the main things we worked on during the

132
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:16,120
summer was uh understanding this Legacy

133
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:18,759
of poly ploying ingression and looking

134
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,399
at it across 2300 different nuclear

135
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:23,080
genes from from genome resequencing done

136
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:25,519
by

137
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:27,478
senta um a second project that was

138
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,758
working on quite a bit this summer was

139
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:34,680
mainly led by Janu

140
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:36,680
here um jenu and her Mentor S at the

141
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,240
Botanical Institute in in

142
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,079
Beijing uh have been working on rice

143
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,360
alop polyploids for many years and this

144
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,000
particular uh project was a Genome

145
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:51,000
Project in which looking at this race

146
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,918
that you see here this Ariz of minuta 48

147
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,879
chromosomes derived from these two

148
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:58,959
diploid species here formed around

149
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:00,879
700,000 years ago traced the genomes

150
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,599
using philogenetic methods and

151
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,399
everything and here you'll see the

152
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,599
circus diagram showing the sub genomes

153
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:09,679
of the polyploid and they're virtually

154
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:11,598
identical in terms of synony and their

155
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,439
organization with the genomes of the

156
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:14,839
diploid however when you dig a little

157
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,038
bit deeper you'll find that the

158
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:19,918
diploidization process has started in

159
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:21,680
this paper is about how uh different EP

160
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:23,719
different parts of that diploidization

161
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,598
are either episodic some of them

162
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,680
occurring right away after polyploid

163
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:29,598
formation and others are more gradual

164
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,680
for example the acquisition of

165
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:33,560
transposable elements has been a gradual

166
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,759
process as opposed to Gene loss which

167
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,439
has been much more episodic so this is a

168
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,400
a project that I'm not going to say much

169
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,598
more about just to let you know we're

170
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,038
working on

171
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:46,918
that so one of the questions is why is

172
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:49,399
polyol so common across plants

173
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:52,639
particularly and the idea is that polyol

174
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:55,279
is a generator of novelty U both at

175
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,639
pretty much every possible level this

176
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,638
classic paper by Don Levan someone Bill

177
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:03,680
knows very well yeah smiling here in the

178
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,560
front uh is real classic in terms of all

179
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,720
the ways that polyol can create

180
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,680
evolutionary novelty uh on paper by Mike

181
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,919
freeling a little bit later Gene balance

182
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,759
duplications are a drive to increase

183
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:16,560
morphological complexity so this has

184
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,598
been a a recurring theme in the poly

185
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,000
Ploy literature all

186
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:22,680
along uh Jeremy Cod who was a student

187
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,680
here many years ago has been one of my

188
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,120
top collaborators for years now uh and I

189
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,840
wrote this paper on auto a little essay

190
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,639
really on EP autopolyploidy is an

191
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:36,598
epigenetic macrom mutation so a macrom

192
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:39,038
mutation is a single event poly in this

193
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:41,719
case with many different phenotypic

194
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:44,279
consequences so it qualifies there and

195
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,319
epigenetics are molecules and mechanisms

196
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,359
that can perpetuate alternative gene

197
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,319
activity states in the context of the

198
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,080
same DNA sequence so this is one of many

199
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:56,680
definitions of epigenetics it's one that

200
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:59,598
suits my purposes so I grabbed it

201
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,720
basically if you make a synthetic polyl

202
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:04,519
just double the chomosome number using

203
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,720
culine you have a plant that's isogenic

204
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:10,038
with its diploid progenitor so it has

205
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,080
the same DNA sequences so but it also

206
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:14,360
has many phenotypic consequences when

207
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,680
you do that that's the maum mutation and

208
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,598
the same DNA sequence is the epigenetic

209
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,240
part so an autopolyploid is an

210
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:23,598
epigenetic macrom mutation and that's

211
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,038
the source of all of that novelty from

212
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:28,639
The genome doubling part uh I did I

213
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:31,240
mentioned also Alo polyploids the rice

214
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,000
for example and Alo polyploids add

215
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,759
another component which is hybridity

216
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,240
heterosis those kinds of effects as well

217
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,718
but pure polyploid as you might call has

218
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,879
it has been called autopolyploidy is a

219
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,920
matter of just doubling the same genome

220
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:47,240
and so it by itself can create

221
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:49,719
evolutionary novelty that's the point

222
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,440
here Jeremy and I explored this at the

223
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,399
cell level becoming trying to get caught

224
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,399
up to cell biology modern cell biology

225
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:59,159
and wrote this paper and all these lines

226
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,799
and everything show you we're talking

227
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:02,639
about two different phenomena right

228
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:05,039
increased dosage when you double the

229
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,439
Genome of course and also increased bulk

230
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,120
amount of DNA this is something that's

231
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,399
rather controversial something called

232
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,919
the nucleotype people are familiar with

233
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,679
genotype and phenotype very few people

234
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,799
are familiar with the nucleotype which

235
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:20,958
is just um correlations with various

236
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:23,399
different uh characteristics of the

237
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,759
plant or animal such as cell size

238
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,720
nuclear volume things like that that

239
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,360
follow from increasing the DNA content

240
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,200
and it's not clear yet at this point

241
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,039
whether or not uh this is causality or

242
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,240
correlation only but it's a intriguing

243
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,120
thing that you see this trend across

244
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,079
many different traits where

245
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,440
autopolyploids or just plants with

246
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:47,559
larger DNA contents even show these

247
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,800
trends of having larger cell size

248
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:52,359
nuclear volume and those sorts of things

249
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:55,278
and this is thought um in many ways to

250
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,720
be the source of all the other phenomena

251
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,919
that follow from that all these

252
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,278
different lines that I'm showing here

253
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:03,039
complex

254
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:05,078
relationships the key point of this for

255
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,519
this talk is just that this also does

256
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:09,159
lead to morphological changes

257
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,879
physiological changes and even

258
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:15,000
ecological changes as well and that

259
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:19,000
brings me to my next uh section of this

260
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,278
talk and that's the origin of nodulation

261
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,278
symbiosis so nodulation is a symbiotic

262
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:26,240
association between some flowering

263
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:28,679
plants a limited number of them and

264
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,200
diverse soil bacteria and the bacteria

265
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:34,399
are house in these nodules which you can

266
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,600
see here which then fix atmospheric

267
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,839
nitrogen to form ammonia so fertilizer

268
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,040
for the plants the nodule is a

269
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:43,120
morphologically and anatomically and

270
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:46,240
biochemically complex evolutionary

271
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:49,560
novelty it's not found in other

272
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,879
plants its most associated nodulation is

273
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:54,319
with the legume family but it's neither

274
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:56,320
confined to the legume family uh nor is

275
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,440
it Universal within the legume families

276
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,800
I'll show you in a second

277
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,519
question that's been asked for many

278
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:05,120
years is what is the nodule exactly well

279
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,078
we can look at it and see what it is

280
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,799
it's on the roots usually the roots

281
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:11,919
sometimes the choots of a plant but it's

282
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:15,399
what does it where does it come from and

283
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:17,078
so uh Ann hirs at UCLA and Tom Laro used

284
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,720
to be up the road here at Boyce Thompson

285
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:22,799
Institute years back asked is it a

286
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:26,079
modified root or modified stem or a

287
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:28,679
completely novel organ an organu

288
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:31,719
generous early ideas about nodule

289
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:34,078
Origins uh included horizontal transfer

290
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,839
of different com uh components such as

291
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,799
leg hemoglobin and those of you who eat

292
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:41,760
impossible Burgers may be familiar with

293
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:43,919
leg hemoglobin as the the red color that

294
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,000
you're seeing there that substitute for

295
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:50,479
myoglobin and

296
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,200
hemoglobin anyway um so I I could say

297
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,519
more about it we had I just gave this a

298
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,040
talk for Mark Mark Sor in the background

299
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,919
there the poly the polyol talk yesterday

300
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:00,679
for your class Mark and one of the

301
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:03,719
students pointed out that when you look

302
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:05,838
at the impossible Burger um what is that

303
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,519
stuff there in a real Burger is it is it

304
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,040
blood when you get the red Stu and there

305
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,639
was a big debate about whether it was

306
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:12,439
actually blood or not and it turns out

307
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,480
someone looked it up and it's myoglobin

308
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,440
it's not hemoglobin it's not blood that

309
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,278
gives you the juice of a hamburger

310
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,920
apparently but I didn't know that on

311
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:24,439
this burger it's it's leg hemoglobin so

312
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:28,039
it's a vegetarian item anyway to get

313
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,760
back to the talk uh the evolution of of

314
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:32,799
Ruda symbiosis

315
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:35,278
involves this nodule structure and U

316
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:38,278
Martin parisy and Katherina Markman

317
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:40,679
asked this question how novel Really Are

318
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:42,399
nodules and so this gets back to the

319
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:44,879
original question about what it is what

320
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,039
is a nodule so it turns out that most

321
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,519
everything that is happening in

322
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:52,039
nodulation is a matter of recruiting a

323
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,120
pre-existing function or structure from

324
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:57,000
some other program already present in

325
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:00,198
the plant and so my colleague Makoto

326
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,839
Hayashi and Takashi soyano a asked this

327
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:04,198
question and reviewed this some years

328
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,760
back now and so basically what

329
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:10,799
nodulation has done is recruit uh Gene

330
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:13,319
regulatory modules from arbuscular micro

331
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,799
risal symbiosis from lateral root

332
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,959
development from nitrate responses and

333
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:19,759
maybe from other places as well from the

334
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:22,359
whole infection process there's all

335
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:26,000
sorts of things but almost nothing about

336
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,199
nodulation is itself novel on the genes

337
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,039
or anything

338
00:13:27,198 --> 00:13:33,198
else so here at the heart of it all is

339
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:35,679
something called nin and uh this recent

340
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:38,240
review paper nin is a transcription

341
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:40,039
Factor called nodu Inception and so if

342
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,720
you look at what happens during

343
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:46,679
nodulation you have the Ryobi Ryobi

344
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,278
being signal by the plant and exchanging

345
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:52,078
signals infecting starting an infection

346
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:54,679
thread infection thread growth uh

347
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:57,439
proceeding into the CeX initiating

348
00:13:54,679 --> 00:14:00,559
nodule formation and eventually forming

349
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,000
a complete nodule with uh this outgrowth

350
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,879
from the from the plant and eventually

351
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,679
then becoming functional involving in

352
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:10,078
nitrate responses and all that so every

353
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:13,319
one of these steps is uh controlled by

354
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:15,198
nin and so basically nin first of all

355
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,440
had to acquire some sort of binding

356
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:19,278
sites for key elements of the signaling

357
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,519
process were recruited from micar risal

358
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:24,278
Sy biosis including the cyclidia binding

359
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:26,440
site which you see down

360
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:29,278
here and then the other thing that had

361
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,600
to happen was that nin targets must have

362
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:35,000
acquired nin binding sites now there are

363
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,759
about 145 direct interactors of nin at

364
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,480
least one that's one estimate maybe an

365
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:40,680
overestimate but still a lot of

366
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,759
different genes have had to come

367
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:45,078
directly under the influence the control

368
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:49,278
of nin so all of those had to acquire

369
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:51,359
binding sites from n and U so one of the

370
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:53,720
questions a big evolutionary question is

371
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,278
how in in the evolution of novelty is

372
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,278
how do these kinds of binding sites are

373
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:00,639
they if they're truly novel how do they

374
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:02,198
evolve even if they're not truly novel

375
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,720
how do they get brought under the

376
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:07,439
control of a novel transcription Factor

377
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,959
system so this is a major question we'll

378
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,759
return to that in a bit so I haven't

379
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:14,758
told you about polyol yet um the polyol

380
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:17,120
angle here is that people have

381
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:19,000
speculated for many years that

382
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,600
polyploidy within the legumes which had

383
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,839
been known to exist to occur had been

384
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,879
implicated in the evolution of

385
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,720
nodulation so this is the medicago

386
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:30,240
genome paper

387
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:33,720
2011 and U when the mitochondrial genome

388
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,159
or sorry the metago genome was sequenced

389
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,399
it was found uh not surprisingly because

390
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:41,879
of previous work that the The genome was

391
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:44,600
structured showing evidence of a whole

392
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:46,759
genome duplication at and shared with

393
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,440
other legumes as well so when soybean

394
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:52,120
was then was sequenced it showed it had

395
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,480
that uh that whole genome duplication as

396
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,120
well so looking at this people

397
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,800
speculated well okay so this you've got

398
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,278
a whole genome duplication

399
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:04,439
in at the base of this whole group of

400
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:07,399
legumes we know that whole genome

401
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,839
duplications can spur novelty nodulation

402
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,919
also seemed to be unique to legumes or

403
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,319
at least probably evolved there as one

404
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,719
of its uh one of its sources of

405
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:18,240
evolution and so the speculation was

406
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,639
well okay so this is what's happened

407
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,120
we've had polyol either causing

408
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,039
nodulation to occur or doing something

409
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,560
to uh modify it if it already existed so

410
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:31,360
about the same time this paper from Rene

411
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,958
GS and his group a whole genome

412
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,480
duplication has occurred at the root of

413
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:40,078
the legume piloid this is the bean-like

414
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:43,159
subam so soybean and um Lupin and things

415
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:45,479
like that we hypothesize that Gene pairs

416
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:48,078
originating from this duplication event

417
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,839
have evolved symbiotic functions and

418
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:52,599
then a couple of years later another

419
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:55,399
paper came out talking about it may have

420
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:59,240
uh led to enhanced root nodu symbiosis

421
00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:00,839
in the piloid the bean-like legumes

422
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,038
and you see evidence of that this is a

423
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:06,959
paper from some other colleagues of mine

424
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:09,919
that came out just recently looking at

425
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,360
the flavonoid synthesis and biosynthesis

426
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,000
genes in the legume family and showing

427
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:16,599
again there's some novel genes found

428
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,318
only in the legumes uh many of these are

429
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:21,558
due to Gene duplications and that are

430
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:23,959
unique to the legume family so this is

431
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:26,599
supports the idea that um that whole

432
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:30,840
genome duplication has led to increasing

433
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:30,839
the repertoire of genes available for

434
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,079
nodulation so I mentioned already that

435
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,599
it's not necessarily found only in the

436
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:42,319
legumes so in fact uh nodulation is

437
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:43,839
phenetically scattered and until 2018

438
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,279
which I'll explain in a moment this was

439
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,599
explained by a combination of

440
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:50,359
convergence and loss so it turns out

441
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:53,159
that nodulation once thought to be

442
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:55,678
widely scattered in the flowering plants

443
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,960
early on in the year of phenetics was

444
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,240
shown to be concentrated in one CA

445
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,880
within the flowering plants and this is

446
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,279
called the N nitrogen fixing clade or n

447
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,760
nodulation fixing clade um and within

448
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:10,119
this clay though you'll see that it's

449
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,440
scattered so the light blue or dark blue

450
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:15,719
here that you see dark blue means that

451
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,480
entire group uh is invol has nodulation

452
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,558
symbiosis light blue means that it's

453
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,599
scattered within that group so in

454
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:25,158
legumes for example the green is Rial

455
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:28,079
symbiosis these other ones are actinal

456
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,480
symbiots it's a different group of

457
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,439
bacteria

458
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,960
within the legumes you can see again

459
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,880
dark green means that that entire group

460
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,360
every one of those plants will nodulate

461
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,120
with one or two exceptions where it's

462
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:42,199
been lost but in other groups you'll see

463
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:44,359
light uh light green and that means that

464
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,919
it's scattered within those groups so

465
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:48,959
you have this distribution where um

466
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,679
everything is concentrated in one Cay

467
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,759
but then within that entire group you

468
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:56,960
have origins or losses it's just a very

469
00:18:53,759 --> 00:19:00,000
complex pattern and again nodulation is

470
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,880
phenetically scattered and mostly it was

471
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,400
uh explained as a combination of

472
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,080
convergent gains and then independent

473
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,519
losses the question was always how many

474
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:11,199
of each so we were pretty confident that

475
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:12,879
there were multiple Origins but we

476
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,480
didn't know how many and how many times

477
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,640
it have been

478
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,360
lost so um why do we care about this I

479
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,759
mean I care because I'm an evolutionary

480
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,678
biologist and so this is certainly an

481
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,839
interesting question sort of curiosity

482
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,640
driven research question but the bigger

483
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:30,720
picture for people who are interested in

484
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,280
applied sorts of things is that um

485
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,919
generating the F generating fertilizer

486
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:37,558
for agriculture is a very expensive

487
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,759
ecologically expensive as well as

488
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:42,519
monetarily expensive uh proposition and

489
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:45,400
so wouldn't it be nice if we could

490
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:47,679
engineer grasses for example crop plants

491
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,679
that don't do n this symbiotic nitrogen

492
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,840
fixation to have these kind of

493
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,679
Partnerships make nodules make their own

494
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:56,599
fertilizer essentially and so um if

495
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:58,400
you're thinking about that you might ask

496
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:59,480
the question how easy is that going to

497
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,880
be

498
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,558
and if it's in evolution it was happen

499
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,440
multiple different times that would be

500
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,759
an easier proposition perhaps than if

501
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,320
you uh had only it had only happened one

502
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:13,480
time ever in all the history of

503
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:15,119
flowering plants of course even if it's

504
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,400
happened multiple times it's happened

505
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:19,199
only in that one clade so something is

506
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,200
unique about that clay that we have to

507
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,159
figure out if we're going to make

508
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,120
grasses uh do this kind of thing as well

509
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:29,440
right and that uh predisposition people

510
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,359
called it has been really elusive nobody

511
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,840
has figured out what is that makes that

512
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,038
clay different from everything else

513
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:38,720
that's sort of a a Holy Grail kind of

514
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:40,720
thing as well all right so um chasing

515
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,839
unicorns why do I say that well because

516
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,360
it was everybody kept talking about this

517
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:47,000
but it was very hard to figure out how

518
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:50,479
you would actually test these different

519
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,759
hypotheses and uh so proving or testing

520
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,880
whether or not nodules across different

521
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,599
uh nodulating species are homologous in

522
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,919
other words they have the same origin

523
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:02,639
and they come from a common ancestor

524
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:06,000
that was the big question how can you

525
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,280
tell that apart from a convergent gain

526
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,159
right so one of the things we thought

527
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:12,678
about this was following other work it's

528
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,520
not unique to me my application to the

529
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,679
to the legumes or to nodulation was

530
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:20,158
maybe unique but um the idea was out

531
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:23,519
there in other areas might the genomes

532
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,799
of non-nodulating taxa Harbor fossil

533
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:28,000
evidence that they once

534
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:30,359
nodulated so that would help us to

535
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,839
distinguish between primary absence of

536
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:35,959
nodulation and secondary loss uh and

537
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,918
focusing on non- nodulating species

538
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,840
instead of nodul so instead of asking

539
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,919
whether nodules are homologous we could

540
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:45,839
ask for evidence that some plants that

541
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:47,640
no longer show nodulation had actually

542
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,918
once been able to nodulate that's what

543
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,600
we're trying to

544
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:55,120
do so in 2018 that was a seminal year

545
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:58,199
for this two different groups came up

546
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:00,119
with tests of this and uh both of them

547
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,080
came to the same conclusion and this

548
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:04,079
first paper discovered signatures of

549
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:06,720
multiple independent loss of function

550
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:10,119
events in the indispensable symbiotic

551
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,798
regulator nodule Inception nin and and a

552
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:14,399
number of different holy sequence

553
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:15,759
genomes and in this paper taken together

554
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,480
results challenge The View that

555
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:20,119
nodulation evolved in parallel raises

556
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,079
the possibility that nodulation

557
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:24,479
originated approximately 100 million

558
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,960
years ago in a common ancestor of all

559
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,400
nodulating plant species and then was

560
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,919
subsequently lost in another group

561
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:35,519
so this was great and nin was almost the

562
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:37,600
only Gene lost there are a couple of

563
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:40,158
other good candidates that sort of are

564
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:41,959
lost here and there but basically nin is

565
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,600
the one thing that's really unique about

566
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,159
nodulation in terms of the of

567
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:48,639
genes so what did this look like well

568
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:51,600
here's a

569
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:55,240
philogyny um here's the single origin of

570
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:57,599
nodulation the stars or losses and here

571
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,319
is see I think I've got an arrow for nin

572
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,719
showing here this is the presence or

573
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:03,879
absence of nin and if you look down this

574
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,600
column and compare it with nodulating

575
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,159
and non-nodulating species you'll see

576
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:09,719
that there's a very good correlation

577
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,440
between the presence of nin and

578
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,319
nodulation or the absence of n nin and

579
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,679
non-

580
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:17,399
nodulation and so here's again what

581
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,840
things look like in the genomes you've

582
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:24,679
got in legumes vgna fasolis soybean

583
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:27,480
pigeon P chickpea things like that I've

584
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:30,960
all got a functional copy of nin uh

585
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,679
nissolia shown here is a legum that has

586
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,840
clearly lost the ability to nodulate and

587
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,320
it is lacking in entirely so a good

588
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:39,439
correlation between a known loss and the

589
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:41,960
absence of

590
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,960
nin here is a plant that's in the

591
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,200
papilionoid family but near the base and

592
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,759
it might or might not have lost it

593
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,360
secondarily we don't know but the data

594
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:54,400
here suggests n is just gone completely

595
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:56,678
so it's probably a loss and up here is

596
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,600
the red bud tree which those of you may

597
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:00,798
not know it's a legume it's in the bean

598
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:03,119
family but it's one of the first

599
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:06,278
offshoots that its subf family is sister

600
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:09,278
to the rest of the legume family and in

601
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:11,000
h cerus the red bud nin is present but

602
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:13,400
it's a pseudogene so it's been

603
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,720
inactivated so again it's not always

604
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,919
lost but inactivation also shows you

605
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,240
that this critical Gene involved in

606
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:23,240
nodulation is present in a non-

607
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,519
nodulating species but it is just

608
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:29,240
nonfunctional and we followed up shuen

609
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:31,679
Chang is a good colleague of mine

610
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,919
uh and he he has been also looking into

611
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,519
this further more genome sequenced we

612
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,919
see the same pattern whenever that

613
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,918
happens uh any the cor strong

614
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,640
correlation between absence of nin and

615
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,600
lack of

616
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:48,120
nodulation so um Robin van velson and

617
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:50,038
Renee Garretts um LED this little uh

618
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:52,079
essay type thing in trans implant

619
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:54,519
science here's again the pattern that

620
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:57,278
we're seeing all these black things here

621
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:58,960
black clades are places where nin where

622
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,440
sorry where nodulation

623
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,640
does not occur and again we're saying a

624
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,919
single origin of nodulation followed by

625
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:09,278
Massive parallel losses so the weakest

626
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:12,440
link in any argument about having a

627
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:14,720
single origin was always it took so many

628
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,960
independent losses to account for this

629
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,278
that it was never going to be a

630
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,519
parsimonious argument and as long as

631
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:22,519
parsimony was your Criterion for judging

632
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:25,759
things this just was never palatable at

633
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:28,599
all as an as an ongoing argument so how

634
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:31,038
does this U new hypothesis deal deal

635
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:32,398
with that and the answer is so you're

636
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:35,519
asking what could cause so many

637
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:39,479
independent losses and it has to do with

638
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:41,240
uh atmospheric CO2 levels and so in what

639
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,880
has happened is that Global atmospheric

640
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,679
CO2 levels have generally been

641
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,399
decreasing in the last 100 million years

642
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,000
uh since the time when nodulation is

643
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:50,918
hypothesized to have

644
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,880
risen and

645
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:56,200
consequently U because nodulation really

646
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,760
requires a lot of carbon in the form of

647
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,399
making the nodule but also giving

648
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:03,558
photosyn to the bacteria in exchange for

649
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:05,798
the nitrogen they they produce when you

650
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:08,319
have a situation in which CO2 levels are

651
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:10,398
decreasing carbon becomes increasingly

652
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:13,240
expensive and the cost benefit ratio

653
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:16,038
between nodulation nitrogen fixation and

654
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,480
the expense of the carbon changes and

655
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:20,759
shifts so you start out with a carbon to

656
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,038
nitrogen cost benefit ratio it's

657
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:26,278
positive at the beginning of this whole

658
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:28,319
era but it declines as CO2 levels

659
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:30,640
decline in the atmosphere becomes more

660
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:34,079
more expensive and so what the

661
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:37,038
hypothesis says is that as that happens

662
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:39,079
different genotypes different species

663
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:41,759
and remember this is a genotype of the

664
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:44,439
plants by genotype of the bacteria by

665
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:47,879
environment kind of proposition G byg by

666
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:51,120
e as that happens carbon becomes too

667
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,640
expensive and nodulation ceases so the

668
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:56,119
plants just shut it

669
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,240
off so absence of nodulation is not loss

670
00:26:56,119 --> 00:27:00,319
at least not initially right so

671
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,880
nodulation is plastic and actually if

672
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:04,558
you look today if you look at field

673
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:06,520
legume crops if you fertilize that field

674
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:07,918
the legumes don't bother to make nodules

675
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:09,639
it's too expensive they get free

676
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,799
nitrogen from the fertilizer so they

677
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,679
don't need to do that so it's a plastic

678
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:16,558
response if you keep turning if you keep

679
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:19,000
everything turned off after you've

680
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:21,359
ceased to do nodulation however

681
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,960
everything starts to Decay as you remove

682
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:27,000
the genes from the uh from positive from

683
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:29,000
selection and so purifying selection is

684
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,038
relaxed and you'll start to accumulate

685
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,640
mutations in these key genes so that's

686
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:36,158
why cerus for example the red bud still

687
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,840
has nin but its nin has decayed it

688
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,480
doesn't function anymore other Gene

689
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:42,918
other plants have lost nin

690
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,720
completely so this is what happens also

691
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:47,840
with cave animals cave animals when they

692
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,440
go into the darkness the eye becomes

693
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:53,519
dispensable and usually mutations occur

694
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,840
pretty quickly to eliminate the eye and

695
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:58,319
uh there even are scenarios that are

696
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:00,278
suggested somewhat controversially

697
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,119
involve positive selection because even

698
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:03,839
the Machinery that's involved in in

699
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:05,798
making eyes even if you're not using

700
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,480
them is also expensive and so there may

701
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:09,599
be some selection pressure to actually

702
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,278
get rid of the eyes

703
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:14,398
entirely so this single origin massive

704
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:17,159
parallel loss hypothesis became very

705
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:19,319
popular in the community actually uh in

706
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:22,039
those two papers that I cited before

707
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:24,000
that's like 90% of the top players in

708
00:28:22,038 --> 00:28:26,720
the nodulation community were involved

709
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,359
in one of those two papers so there

710
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,679
people really are pretty invested in

711
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:33,240
this hypothesis but then as I say here

712
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,960
this paper came around now it's been in

713
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,519
BIO archives for a couple of years it

714
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,798
took it a long time to get through but

715
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:42,640
finally published just a few weeks ago

716
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:45,319
actually um and so in this paper what

717
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,240
they did was they made a philogyny of

718
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:51,200
12,000 different species of nodulating

719
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,038
and non- nodulating uh plants in this

720
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,720
whole CA primarily all much of it from

721
00:28:54,038 --> 00:28:57,759
herbarium material by the way this is a

722
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,839
shout out to the herbarium because you

723
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:02,440
can use her Baran material to actually

724
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:04,918
isolate DNA and use that in a study like

725
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,120
this they updated the nodulation

726
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:09,240
database of which species nodulate and

727
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:11,599
which ones don't they then used hidden

728
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,519
Markoff models to test the fit of

729
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:16,079
different evolutionary transition rate

730
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,440
models and reconstructed ancestral

731
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,079
character state so this is

732
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,600
state-of-the-art phylogenomics basically

733
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,000
this is what people do with big

734
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:26,759
phylogenies they test hypotheses like

735
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:31,798
this and they looked at root nodulation

736
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:34,398
symbiosis whoops that happened wow uh

737
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:36,759
and their results showed that they the

738
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:39,639
best models were 16 independent gains

739
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:41,359
and 10 subsequent losses so we've gone

740
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,759
back to now the state-of-the-art

741
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:47,240
hypothesis on a philogyny is now saying

742
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:50,000
16 Origins the one that everybody in the

743
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:53,159
nodulation community likes is one origin

744
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,720
so what's right what's the truth okay

745
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:58,399
now truth and science that's a two words

746
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,360
that you don't want to necessarily put

747
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:02,158
together all the time the question is

748
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:04,240
how do you test the homologies right

749
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,360
we're back to that question back to

750
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,079
where we were before 2018 saying okay

751
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:11,839
maybe there were multiple Origins but

752
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:14,038
how do we test that now and how can you

753
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:16,319
test homology if recruitment was

754
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:18,200
convergent this is a big question this

755
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:19,720
is what's called Deep homology and I

756
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,759
didn't mention that when I mentioned the

757
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,839
recruitment process in nodulation but

758
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:28,000
those things that are shared across

759
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:31,720
nonhomologous Origins right are them

760
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
elves homologous so um lateral root

761
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,798
development using scarecrow and short

762
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,720
root for example that's something that's

763
00:30:35,798 --> 00:30:40,918
common to all plants right and that

764
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,679
module is going to be homologous no

765
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:45,120
matter how many different times it was

766
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:47,759
recruited by in different origins of

767
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:50,319
nodulation so looking at that is never

768
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:52,599
going to help us answer that question

769
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:55,359
not just the presence of that the use of

770
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:58,480
that particular module developmental

771
00:30:55,359 --> 00:31:01,158
module so what if all the components are

772
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,120
homologous how do you test this all

773
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:06,320
right so because what we really want to

774
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:09,000
do is the uniqueness of the assembly

775
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:11,359
that is what we want to test so how can

776
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,759
we figure out whether the same thing was

777
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:16,599
built a couple of different times that's

778
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:19,759
the question we're getting at so back to

779
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:22,079
nin again here's nin our friend uh our

780
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:24,240
nin binding sites homologous across

781
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:26,879
putative Origins remember that nin had

782
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,839
to be recruited n the targets of nin had

783
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,080
to recruit this binding site all these

784
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:33,798
different genes that you see here right

785
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:37,158
had to independently in that model in a

786
00:31:33,798 --> 00:31:39,798
16 Origins model 16 different times all

787
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:42,039
of those genes had to recruit nin

788
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:45,398
function all right so how do we tell

789
00:31:42,038 --> 00:31:48,200
that well can fossil nin binding sites

790
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:50,000
be detected in non nodulates so here's

791
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,360
an idea this is a paper we're writing

792
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,558
now is sort of a not a rebuttal to that

793
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:56,918
new paper but really just exploring how

794
00:31:55,558 --> 00:31:58,519
could we can actually test these

795
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:00,320
hypothesis

796
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:03,519
um people involved in writing that paper

797
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:05,519
by the way are best man at my wedding um

798
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,480
and my academic grandson is the main

799
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,278
author and so it's kind of a I'm not I'm

800
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,919
not angry with these people or anything

801
00:32:10,278 --> 00:32:14,638
like that I just want to get to the

802
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,720
bottom of things so n nin binding sites

803
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:19,719
is positional criteria for

804
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:23,038
homology imagine a gene here's a gene

805
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,798
Gene X in an ancestor XA it has a couple

806
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:27,359
of different binding sites for different

807
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:30,599
transcription factors now nin comes

808
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:32,719
along this Gene becomes recruited by as

809
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:34,839
part of the nodulation process to and

810
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,440
binds nin so here you have a nin binding

811
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:38,319
site I've conveniently put it between

812
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,720
these other two sites this is a

813
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:42,798
nodulating species one suppose we

814
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,240
sequence another nodul from a different

815
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:47,240
group of plants and we find the same

816
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,599
position that would be consistent with

817
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:53,599
homology of that site it's the same

818
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:55,519
sequence 8 to 15 base pair more or less

819
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:57,519
binding site and it's in the same

820
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,720
position but if we sequence some other

821
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,000
different genomes from other plants and

822
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,240
we find that these nin binding sites

823
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,599
even if they are the same site because

824
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,679
that's what nin binds across different

825
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:10,439
groups if they're in different places

826
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:12,840
that would be consistent with

827
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,639
non-homology so that's the idea there's

828
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:16,079
not a lot to go on here but this is

829
00:33:14,638 --> 00:33:19,519
about the best I think we're going to be

830
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:21,839
able to do and so we certainly know in

831
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,720
binding sites this paper just came out a

832
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:25,879
couple of few I guess a month ago or so

833
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,120
I just saw it a month or so ago and

834
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:31,000
anyway this uh there are binding sites

835
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:33,719
some of these interesting sites here are

836
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,359
found across both nodulating and non-

837
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,038
nodulating non- legumes as well so they

838
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:39,479
exist we don't know the context I don't

839
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:41,319
know the context yet but that's

840
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,839
something we can look

841
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:46,759
at okay so um philosophical questions

842
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:49,398
continue to be raised about the nature

843
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:51,038
of homology so for those of you who are

844
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:53,518
evolutionary biologists have been

845
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:55,440
hearing the word homology forever since

846
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,120
you first started reading about anything

847
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,519
about evolutionary biology and it's a

848
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:02,439
major controversial topic how to define

849
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:04,759
homology and what it means and how to

850
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,639
test it and everything else gter Vagner

851
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:08,358
who's an author on this paper has been

852
00:34:06,638 --> 00:34:11,679
writing books about this for many

853
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:13,358
different years and here's um character

854
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,800
identity mechanisms are something that

855
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:17,440
this group of authors has come up with

856
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,800
and I can't explain them to you because

857
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,358
it's more philosophy than it is biology

858
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:25,079
actually I think but there's something

859
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:26,878
uh that integrate information come to

860
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:29,200
this kind of hourglass structure this is

861
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:31,719
where the mechanism sits and then has

862
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,759
different readouts from that the best

863
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:36,678
example I can give you is actually for

864
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:39,679
the origin of cell types and this is

865
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:42,200
another paper this paper from 2016 gter

866
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,320
Vagner was the last author on this paper

867
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:47,000
the idea being that there's this

868
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:50,119
integration mechanism here the core

869
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,398
regulatory complex that takes all the

870
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:55,800
inputs synthesizes that and reads it out

871
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:57,719
to uh coordinate the efforts of all the

872
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,480
different transcription factors involved

873
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:02,078
in this regulatory complex and that

874
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,280
combination

875
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,880
combinatorial um factoring of

876
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,920
transcription factors and their outputs

877
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,440
is what makes a cell type specific to

878
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,358
itself it is the the defining feature of

879
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,720
a cell type I guess I say it that way is

880
00:35:14,358 --> 00:35:18,679
better all right so that's what's that's

881
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:20,199
the classic example of one of these

882
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:23,159
character integration

883
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:24,838
mechanisms um at the level of the cell

884
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:27,199
and then they talk about in this paper

885
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:29,838
things at higher hierarchical levels

886
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:32,439
again being analogous to that so why do

887
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:34,679
I mention that that's my next thing um

888
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,240
first of all here's Giles ID's paper

889
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:39,199
again this is one you saw already but

890
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:41,719
they and summarizes this very nicely

891
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:43,519
rather than novel emergence of new genes

892
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:45,239
the evolution of nodulation appears to

893
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:47,559
have involved the r networking of

894
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:49,759
pre-existing processes principally

895
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:52,119
controlled by the master regul regulator

896
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,800
nin told you all of that already he goes

897
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:56,640
on to say they go on to say we need to

898
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,720
understand not only how this this

899
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:00,838
happens but also also how it's able to

900
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:03,000
activate such diverse development in the

901
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:04,519
different cell types so now we're back

902
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,318
to cell types not only do we need to

903
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:07,639
know about cell types philosophically

904
00:36:06,318 --> 00:36:09,559
but we need to know about them

905
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:11,879
practically speaking to actually get to

906
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:14,400
the bottom of this mystery and that

907
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,400
brings me to my last vignette which is

908
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,880
dup Gene duplications and the origin of

909
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,358
cell type

910
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,440
diversity so Jeremy and I've been

911
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:24,920
interested in in cell types for a little

912
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:28,039
while mainly because it turns out that

913
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:30,000
the effect of poly varies with cell type

914
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:32,119
and so some cell types respond by

915
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,280
becoming much larger other cell types on

916
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:38,000
the other hand don't and so being a cell

917
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,920
size is one of the key factors involved

918
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,239
we think in pretty much everything

919
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,960
Downstream of poly fluidization in

920
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:47,318
creating novelty this is an important

921
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:49,559
thing to know and um so we ask the

922
00:36:47,318 --> 00:36:52,599
question well first of all what's a cell

923
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:56,318
type and guess what people don't know

924
00:36:52,599 --> 00:37:00,440
don't agree on what a cell type is so um

925
00:36:56,318 --> 00:37:02,079
this is 202 2 2023 hqu Zang is the head

926
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,720
of the Allen brain Institute where they

927
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,920
work on neurons and neuron cell types

928
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:09,799
where hundreds of if not thousands of

929
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,760
cell types these authors are tops in

930
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,519
their field what's a cell type this

931
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,680
paper was just from a week and a half

932
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:19,079
ago and um it's a little review P not

933
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:21,879
review paper a little popular piece in

934
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:25,599
nature and so um I was actually

935
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:27,800
interviewed for this paper um but uh

936
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,440
it's so it's still a question of what

937
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,519
this actually means what is a cell type

938
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,880
and so yeah I was at interviewed because

939
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:35,039
I've written a little bit about it

940
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,920
because I was trying to figure out what

941
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:39,559
in the world a cell type was and how

942
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,639
deal with it likened it to species which

943
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:43,679
is a very bad thing to do because

944
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:47,279
species nobody agrees on what a species

945
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:49,679
is and um worked with Mark Lio you'll

946
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:53,400
see him in a second again to just talk

947
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:56,719
about this in a recent paper last

948
00:37:53,400 --> 00:38:00,240
year mark is one of the leaders in the

949
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:02,679
field of s cell biology and plants and

950
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:04,959
um I'm fortunate to be a colleague of

951
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:07,318
his on a on a grant that we have

952
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,519
together along with Jeremy and Andrew

953
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:12,199
farmer whose name you saw in relation to

954
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:14,358
gini this is a talk that we gave this

955
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:16,679
summer actually presented at our botney

956
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:19,119
meetings in in uh

957
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:22,480
Michigan a single cell perspective on

958
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:24,400
duplicate gene expression and this work

959
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,358
is asking this is ongoing project we

960
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,920
haven't published anything yet on this

961
00:38:26,358 --> 00:38:31,318
uh and soybean at least to what extent

962
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:34,318
does cell type and cell State diversity

963
00:38:31,318 --> 00:38:37,920
provide niches for duplicated genes so

964
00:38:34,318 --> 00:38:40,480
what do I mean by that so duplication of

965
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,440
genes is really frequent if you look at

966
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,079
this this is a classic paper here Lynch

967
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:48,440
and connory 2000 you're looking here the

968
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,480
number of pairs percentage of pairs of

969
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:54,280
duplicated genes as a function of time

970
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:57,760
right so this is K KS down here so it's

971
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:00,400
a aoxy for time this you'll see this

972
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,040
kind of L-shaped pattern in all

973
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,599
different taxa what this is these are

974
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:08,199
small scale duplications so single genes

975
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,880
or a few genes at a time and what this

976
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:14,639
is showing is that um duplication Is

977
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:17,838
frequent you have lots of pairs at time

978
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:20,118
T equals zero essentially and not much

979
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:22,078
else beyond that meaning that these

980
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:24,318
things are duplicating turning over copy

981
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,160
number variation and Gene Gene copy

982
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:29,440
number and then loss almost immediately

983
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:31,399
okay now arabidopsis looks a little bit

984
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,358
different and that's because this peak

985
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,039
down here is a whole genome duplication

986
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:36,519
that a arabidopsis the most recent of

987
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,800
the whole genome duplications that

988
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:40,480
arabidopsis has experienced it's a

989
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,760
little bit different but the same idea

990
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,800
occurs you have a whole genome

991
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,599
duplication followed by lots of losses

992
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,880
of gen in that diploidization process I

993
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:52,359
mentioned at the beginning so we have to

994
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,760
account for why gene pairs get kept ever

995
00:39:52,358 --> 00:39:55,598
because most of the time you think about

996
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,640
it these are redundant genes at the time

997
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,359
of their formation you don't need them

998
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:01,838
the plant was perfectly happy with just

999
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:03,960
one copy before and now we have to

1000
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:07,039
explain why does some get kept and other

1001
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,400
ones don't you've probably heard of

1002
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:11,599
neofunctionalization this is

1003
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,440
partitioning expression by function so a

1004
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:16,720
gene that had a single function this

1005
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,440
duplicate copies have the same function

1006
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:20,439
initially but then one of them acquires

1007
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,280
a novel function and that gets

1008
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,318
maintained once these genes are

1009
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,920
partitioned by function there's reason

1010
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:28,920
to keep both copies essentially being a

1011
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,880
little an anthropomorphic here so that's

1012
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,920
partitioning by function

1013
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,000
subfunctionalization is also involving

1014
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,039
function but usually we think of it as

1015
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,838
being partitioning of expression

1016
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:41,759
involving location so in this model a

1017
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:44,159
gene has multiple functions and then

1018
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,880
these are partitioned such that some one

1019
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:47,838
gene is doing some of the functions some

1020
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,440
doing the other this diagram is not as

1021
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:51,440
good I think as this one here this is a

1022
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,400
little simpler and if you think of

1023
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,119
something that a single copy Gene was

1024
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:58,318
expressed in Limb and brain and then

1025
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:00,160
after duplication one of the copies

1026
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:02,318
loses the ability to be expressed in the

1027
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:04,519
brain the other loses its ability to be

1028
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:06,920
expressed in the limb now you have an

1029
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:08,440
indispensable two copies you need one of

1030
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,559
each of those copies and they're

1031
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:13,358
maintained okay so this is involving

1032
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:15,679
location of the expression as much as

1033
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:17,440
anything so looking at expression of

1034
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:20,318
location at the Single Cell level we

1035
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,200
have bulk tissu cell types cell states

1036
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:24,639
of a single type and then single cells

1037
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:27,439
within that we have a gene duplication A

1038
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:29,679
and B copies we can ask about expression

1039
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,760
whether one or both or neither are

1040
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:33,799
expressed and if we look at the bulk

1041
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,359
tissue the root might be expressing one

1042
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,318
copy predominantly the leaf the other if

1043
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:40,239
we now look at the root expression at

1044
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:42,559
the cell type level we see the same kind

1045
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:44,799
of pattern where some are some cell

1046
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:47,159
types or or cell clusters are expressing

1047
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,160
some cell types are expressing some one

1048
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:51,679
gene some the other some both some

1049
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:53,799
neither and now we break out the

1050
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:56,279
epidermis cells for example and look at

1051
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,000
these as they develop becoming mature

1052
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,839
again the same kind of pattern and even

1053
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,559
at the Single Cell level we may see

1054
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:04,639
variation in terms of which Gene is

1055
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:07,400
being expressed um this level of the

1056
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:09,239
single cell is probably Beyond kind of

1057
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,599
for various reasons beyond our ability

1058
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:13,479
to really work with very clearly and so

1059
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:17,000
we're really talking about cell clusters

1060
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:20,039
a mixture of St State and

1061
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,800
type couple of years ago we looked at

1062
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:24,519
expression partitioning of duplicate

1063
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:27,440
genes in arabidopsis 11,000 different

1064
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:30,119
different duplicate Gene Pairs and this

1065
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,159
we classified them as you can see here

1066
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:35,240
if neither Gene was expressed in any of

1067
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:37,759
the cell clusters was a class zero one

1068
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:41,159
only one copy expressed and that's what

1069
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,880
we see here in copy one and class one

1070
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:45,799
both copies expressed but always both

1071
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:49,200
were present no fixation in any of the

1072
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:52,440
cell types uh in this class three we

1073
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:54,879
have um uh both copies expressed and in

1074
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,720
some cell types only one was expressed

1075
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,720
in other cell types both were expressed

1076
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:59,358
and then

1077
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:01,000
here we have a case of what really looks

1078
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:02,598
like subfunctionalization we have

1079
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
partitioning of expression in different

1080
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:06,480
cell types or cell clusters between the

1081
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,199
two Gene

1082
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,358
copies and this is what this looks like

1083
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:13,519
uh one of the subfunctionalization cases

1084
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:15,239
your two genes that are derived from the

1085
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:17,838
whole genome duplication in the Rabid

1086
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:20,519
opsis and you can see here one of them

1087
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:22,920
is expressed here and this is endodermis

1088
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:24,800
and down here the other copy is not

1089
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,480
expressed there but it's instead

1090
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,079
expressed in a couple different places

1091
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,280
as well so this partitioning has

1092
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,760
happened presumably following Gene

1093
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,280
duplication we're now looking at soybean

1094
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,480
in this project at 10 different organs

1095
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:41,839
and you can read the details over here

1096
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:44,440
120,000 single nucleus sequencing 187

1097
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:46,440
cell clusters a lot of annotation this

1098
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,920
is a project involving Mark Libo and

1099
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,639
some of my other

1100
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,960
colleagues um looking at 60,000

1101
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:55,118
duplicated Gene pairs by the type of

1102
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,599
duplication and you can see the numbers

1103
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,838
here main thing I want to show is that

1104
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:00,800
this involves also two whole genome

1105
00:43:58,838 --> 00:44:03,358
duplications one that I've mentioned

1106
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,559
before is found in all the bean-like

1107
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:07,519
legumes the other one is a much more

1108
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:10,000
recent duplication only within the last

1109
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:12,719
say 10 million years or so and that one

1110
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,960
is in in soybean only the other one is

1111
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:17,799
about 60 million years

1112
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,119
old so if we look at the ex evolution of

1113
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,160
expression patterns following

1114
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:23,240
duplication what do we expect to see

1115
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:24,799
here's a single copy Gene expressed in a

1116
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:27,719
number of different cell

1117
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,160
clusters or number of different genes

1118
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:32,000
we make a simplifying a very simplifying

1119
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:33,558
assumption that everybody makes

1120
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,280
unfortunately and that is that

1121
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:37,319
immediately following duplication

1122
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,359
duplicate copies are identical in their

1123
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:43,279
expression patterns and their functions

1124
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:45,440
and there's some logic to that but it's

1125
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,920
um it's it's a pretty tricky one to make

1126
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,559
but everybody has to do it for

1127
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,480
evolutionary purposes there's not much

1128
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:53,000
else you can do because we don't have

1129
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,599
access usually to the progenitor

1130
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,280
species so following duplication you

1131
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,838
have two copies where you had one one

1132
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,519
before and if there're you follow that

1133
00:44:58,838 --> 00:45:02,480
assumption they are all doing the same

1134
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:04,719
thing which means they're going to be

1135
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:08,400
class two that's what this is showing

1136
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:10,598
here and that's at time T equals zero

1137
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,838
you let this go further 10 million years

1138
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:15,480
or so later you now have some of them

1139
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:17,119
still maintaining this uh class to but

1140
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,800
other ones have evolved to different

1141
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,680
classes depending on which genes are

1142
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,839
being expressed in which tissu some are

1143
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:26,480
silenced some are retained uh some might

1144
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:29,358
be lost entirely so that's what we have

1145
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,920
for prediction and so the expectation is

1146
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:34,400
that over time we should see a depletion

1147
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,960
of this class 2 type of Gene where both

1148
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,720
are being expressed well what do we

1149
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:44,039
actually see here's some data um first

1150
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:45,519
of all class zero is the one that's are

1151
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:47,800
not expressed these pairs are not

1152
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:49,920
expressed at all anywhere so in every

1153
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,480
organ most Gene pairs have at least one

1154
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,960
copy

1155
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,800
expressed most of the genes the largest

1156
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:58,639
single fraction are these class two

1157
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:01,519
genes 20 to 30 30,000 pairs where both

1158
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:04,039
genes are expressed we have only one

1159
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:06,920
duplicate copy expressed uh by loss or

1160
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:09,199
gain of been seven to 12,000 pairs some

1161
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,838
fixation of one copy and it's always the

1162
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:13,639
same copy in these cases 7 to 15,000

1163
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:15,880
Pairs and then that little tiny bit up

1164
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:18,000
above here expression partitioning

1165
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,318
within organs and this is what that

1166
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,480
looks like a few hundred genes at the

1167
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:24,480
most and I'll just call your attention

1168
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,280
to the nodule because I'm going to loop

1169
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,480
back a little bit to nodulation here at

1170
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,440
the end of this

1171
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,199
talk so basically there's

1172
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,200
differentiation in the location of

1173
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:36,118
expression for about 50% of Gene pairs

1174
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:38,519
after their

1175
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:41,160
duplications so if we want to look at

1176
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:42,679
this time course we can compare the old

1177
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:45,000
duplicate the old whole genome

1178
00:46:42,679 --> 00:46:47,159
duplication 60 million years with the 10

1179
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,719
million year duplication and our

1180
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:51,519
expression is that there's a depletion

1181
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:54,799
of class two genes over time and what do

1182
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:56,559
we see this is exactly what we see here

1183
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:00,318
if you look there's much more of this

1184
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:03,800
class 2 Gene in um in the recent

1185
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:06,318
duplication than in the old

1186
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,039
duplication and this we see this also in

1187
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:10,719
terms of the expression of

1188
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:13,838
subfunctionalization as well this class

1189
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:16,679
four all right my last thing here is to

1190
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:19,920
talk about co-expression networks um

1191
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:21,838
this is function now and uh Gene

1192
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,400
regulatory networks are involved in

1193
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:26,199
function I think everybody would agree

1194
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:29,079
with that and Gene uh co-expression

1195
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:31,358
networks are proxies for Gene regulatory

1196
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:33,680
networks that's the point that's being

1197
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:36,880
made here Chandler who's a postto with

1198
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:39,838
Jeremy coat looked at this reconstructed

1199
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:44,119
gcns for all these genes here's some

1200
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:47,239
data 400 800 modules per organ uh 40 to

1201
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:49,480
100 genes on on average per

1202
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:51,439
module and the question here is how

1203
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:54,400
often do both members of a pair belong

1204
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,599
to the same module right so what we're

1205
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,400
saying here is this is from the Rabid

1206
00:47:56,599 --> 00:48:01,760
Ops interactome paper some years back

1207
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,559
initially following duplication all the

1208
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,960
interactions of a gene that was single

1209
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:07,960
copy or maintained by both copies so

1210
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:10,760
again this is same the idea kind of that

1211
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:13,280
I mentioned before or location of

1212
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:16,160
function but over time we have

1213
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:19,680
interaction rewiring and these two uh

1214
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:23,799
genes can now belong to different uh

1215
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:26,838
networks okay so what we found was that

1216
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:29,318
80 to 90% of duplicate genes in this

1217
00:48:26,838 --> 00:48:32,039
data set belong to different modules so

1218
00:48:29,318 --> 00:48:34,599
a massive amount of rewiring has gone on

1219
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:36,480
across the board so extension extensive

1220
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:38,559
functional differentiation of duplicate

1221
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,639
copies and looking at this thinking of

1222
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:43,720
this as a Time course we have the module

1223
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:46,639
in which one homeologue one of the two

1224
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:49,838
duplicated copies uh exists and the

1225
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:52,078
module in which the second copy exists

1226
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:54,159
initially we should see them belonging

1227
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,920
to the same modules and all the genes

1228
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:57,480
would be shared no change at all

1229
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,159
following duplication

1230
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:02,280
and over time we should see migration

1231
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:04,598
away from this nice diagonal into the

1232
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,000
other parts of this module space that we

1233
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:09,559
see

1234
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,559
here what we actually see is pretty much

1235
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:13,880
that note the much stronger diagonal

1236
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:16,920
still not great but stronger certainly

1237
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:18,720
than this here in the recent duplication

1238
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:21,000
versus the old duplication so we're

1239
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:25,239
seeing that process of migration away

1240
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:27,639
from being in the same uh modules over

1241
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:29,679
time this is what the these modules look

1242
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:31,759
like both duplicates in the same module

1243
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:34,960
this is one of the nodule modules it's

1244
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:37,559
hard to say that but and here's nodule

1245
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:40,159
module 108 which is just the opposite

1246
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:42,160
where only one duplicate of is in is

1247
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:45,239
present in the module for most of the

1248
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:49,118
genes right and to come back to this the

1249
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:51,358
nodule is is a novel organ as we said

1250
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,240
and you might think that a no novel

1251
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:54,558
organ would provide more niches for

1252
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:56,719
expression

1253
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:59,160
subfunctionalization and in fact that's

1254
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:01,399
more or less what we see if you look at

1255
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:03,199
this look at the comparison of the whole

1256
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,798
genome duplication two whole genome

1257
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:07,759
duplications the nodule is always uh on

1258
00:50:05,798 --> 00:50:10,039
the high end at the highest one in terms

1259
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,119
of the number of subfunctionalized cases

1260
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:14,679
of Gene pairs that we

1261
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:17,519
see nodules do not appear to differ in

1262
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:19,199
the amount of partitioning that we get

1263
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:22,119
looks pretty much like everything else

1264
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:25,358
but if you look at um cell type specific

1265
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:27,039
modules in this these gcn if you look at

1266
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:30,358
everything else all the other organ look

1267
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:33,480
fairly similar here this is the cell

1268
00:50:30,358 --> 00:50:36,400
type specific modules here the nodule is

1269
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:38,760
very different in terms of that and why

1270
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,400
might that be it is because the cell

1271
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,799
clusters that are showing the most of

1272
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,760
that sort of effect are actually novel

1273
00:50:42,798 --> 00:50:49,199
cell types infected cell types within

1274
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:51,359
within the nodule so all right so what

1275
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:53,159
I've shown you from this last part is

1276
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:55,239
cell types and States within organs

1277
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:56,838
provide apparently inexhaustible niches

1278
00:50:55,239 --> 00:50:59,199
for refinement of duplicate Gene

1279
00:50:56,838 --> 00:51:01,000
expression single cell resolution allows

1280
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:03,358
us to track evolution of cell type

1281
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,280
specific expression over time and the

1282
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:07,000
nodule which is a relatively young organ

1283
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,440
provides insights into the evolution of

1284
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,119
novelty and the role played by

1285
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:13,240
duplication and fueling Innovation so

1286
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:15,039
there are my three vignettes poly

1287
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:17,358
generates diversity through speciation

1288
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:19,318
and genome Evolution it may have been

1289
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:21,318
involved in the origin or refinement of

1290
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:23,519
nodulation and then these wondrous

1291
00:51:21,318 --> 00:51:25,759
cycles of poly can be observed in the

1292
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:28,358
occupancy of expression nishes at the

1293
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:32,040
Single Cell level by duplicated genes

1294
00:51:28,358 --> 00:51:35,279
and with that thank you

1295
00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:38,039
questions uh so I had a question about

1296
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:42,319
um essentially like synthetic biology

1297
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:44,000
with uh this n group so has there been

1298
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:46,279
has there been any attempts to your

1299
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,440
knowledge of taking those groups that um

1300
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,440
because they would be closer like the

1301
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:53,400
ones that do have the motifs for this n

1302
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:55,798
binding but they their n gene or or set

1303
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,440
of genes is deactivated there been any

1304
00:51:55,798 --> 00:52:01,519
attempt to sort of reactivate that and

1305
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:03,280
see if they make nules or um conversely

1306
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:04,759
or I guess like in addition that any

1307
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,480
more difficult aspect of like

1308
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:10,640
engineering this n plus motives into

1309
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:14,559
yeah so there's a lot of questions there

1310
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:16,838
right um the the first answer is no

1311
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:19,160
nobody has reactivated a non-nodulating

1312
00:52:16,838 --> 00:52:22,798
species by putting a functional copy of

1313
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:24,838
nin in I'm guessing that Renee gz has

1314
00:52:22,798 --> 00:52:27,280
probably tried that with Trea this

1315
00:52:24,838 --> 00:52:30,400
parasponia group is actually in the in

1316
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:33,599
the Cannabis family uh it's weird plant

1317
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:35,599
that grows in new calonia and and anyway

1318
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:37,880
it has close relative Trea that doesn't

1319
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:39,599
nodulate and so they're they're really

1320
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,798
closely related so either it's a very

1321
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,318
recent gain of nodulation or a recent

1322
00:52:41,798 --> 00:52:45,280
loss of nodulation depending on which

1323
00:52:43,318 --> 00:52:47,318
way you go that would be a wonderful

1324
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:50,480
system for trying that experiment I

1325
00:52:47,318 --> 00:52:52,838
can't believe Renee hasn't done it but I

1326
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,000
it's not reported anyway so let's see

1327
00:52:52,838 --> 00:52:58,440
other questions uh using nin and other

1328
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:01,480
ways uh people have actually shown that

1329
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:03,760
you can take the nin from one nodulating

1330
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:06,079
species and go all the way to some other

1331
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,960
clay completely put it in and it it'll

1332
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:09,400
compensate for mutations and Lotus

1333
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:12,639
japonicus for example you actually

1334
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:15,880
putting in from this parasponia that

1335
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:18,719
cannabus thing and put it into a mutant

1336
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:21,039
of lotus japonicus and get it to

1337
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:21,798
function in nodulation again so they are

1338
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:24,159
really

1339
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:26,880
interchangeable um as for looking at The

1340
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:28,838
Binding sites themselves uh people have

1341
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,318
done dap seek and things like that

1342
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:32,759
trying to find where the the the sites

1343
00:53:31,318 --> 00:53:34,880
are and what's interacting and

1344
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:37,480
everything but the noise level and these

1345
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,680
things Mak Makoto Hayashi I've talked to

1346
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,880
him about it and he said they've done

1347
00:53:38,679 --> 00:53:44,039
the experiment they've got thousands of

1348
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:46,480
hits and he he thinks that even the 145

1349
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:49,039
direct interactors with nin is probably

1350
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:51,159
an overestimate and he said other people

1351
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:54,400
are looking into this to really refine

1352
00:53:51,159 --> 00:53:56,239
that more um so it's pretty complicated

1353
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,720
but certainly people are interested in

1354
00:53:56,239 --> 00:54:00,719
in doing that kind of

1355
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:03,598
experiment Randy I think you had your

1356
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:07,118
hand up I thought about the cost of

1357
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:10,039
running no have people done an economic

1358
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:15,240
analysis in like yield per dollar and

1359
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:18,719
what it cost to to yeah for example

1360
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:21,318
nitrogen fixing versus right that's a

1361
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:24,118
good question I haven't seen an economic

1362
00:54:21,318 --> 00:54:25,679
analysis of that um but people have and

1363
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:27,880
there's a lot of sort of information

1364
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,199
around that a sense like for example

1365
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:32,039
that someone did a really neat

1366
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:34,879
experiment of trying to replicate carbon

1367
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:37,558
atmosphere from a several million years

1368
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,680
ago and showed that nodulates would have

1369
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:41,798
had a much bigger Advantage then than

1370
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:44,239
now than in more recent carbon

1371
00:54:41,798 --> 00:54:45,358
atmospheres so there's that's economics

1372
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:47,118
but of a different kind than you're

1373
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:49,119
talking about actually what people are

1374
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:51,480
looking at now with with engineering

1375
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:55,358
Giles oldid who mentioned a couple times

1376
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:57,240
here um he they they and others he and

1377
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:59,440
others have been thinking about what are

1378
00:54:57,239 --> 00:55:02,000
the components of nodulation short of

1379
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,639
making a nodule could you get into

1380
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,400
grasses and actually have that be you

1381
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:08,519
know a little more realistic to try to

1382
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,240
do that than than get a whole nodule on

1383
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:13,199
the plant and there's some neat things

1384
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:15,838
that people are finding Jamel an at

1385
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:18,719
Wisconsin found um I mean he's not the

1386
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:22,519
one who found it I guess a raise a land

1387
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:25,358
race of maze in the mountains of Mexico

1388
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:28,159
where uh that accumulates biofilms of

1389
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:30,719
nitrogen fixing bacteria on the roots

1390
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:32,639
and actually derives a serious benefit

1391
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:34,639
from that so that's another thing

1392
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:35,960
another angle people are looking at so

1393
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:38,598
no Randy I'm sorry I don't have an

1394
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:40,358
answer for the dollars but yeah okay

1395
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:44,200
I'll just take the dollars just take the

1396
00:55:40,358 --> 00:55:46,038
dollars and run garv and then yeah so uh

1397
00:55:44,199 --> 00:55:47,919
regarding the last result about

1398
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:49,680
duplicate Gene diversification so we

1399
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:53,318
also see similar results in enzymes as

1400
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:55,838
the ks increases uh it the corelation

1401
00:55:53,318 --> 00:55:58,639
decreases but I mean it makes sense but

1402
00:55:55,838 --> 00:56:01,599
the altern explanation is that

1403
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:04,000
duplicates that tend to diversify

1404
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:06,760
quickly are the ones that are selected

1405
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,798
and are retained for longer time

1406
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:11,720
duplicates that overlapping functions T

1407
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:14,880
to get lost MH I'm not sure how to

1408
00:56:11,719 --> 00:56:17,719
distinguish between that hypothesis and

1409
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:19,599
what time the diverse hypothesis yeah

1410
00:56:17,719 --> 00:56:23,480
well there's a lot going on under the

1411
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:25,280
hood right with those those curves um as

1412
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,920
you know because you know a lot about

1413
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,160
polyl one of the other mechanisms that

1414
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,960
actually preserves genes in polyploids

1415
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:35,759
but not in in single duplicates is

1416
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:40,440
dosage balance constraints right so

1417
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:42,880
there's a lot of of of um Nuance

1418
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:44,358
basically to those graphs that I don't

1419
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,798
get into here at all in fact that's one

1420
00:56:44,358 --> 00:56:48,719
of the things we're exploring is can you

1421
00:56:45,798 --> 00:56:51,719
see correlations between D dosage

1422
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:53,000
sensitive genes versus preservation and

1423
00:56:51,719 --> 00:56:54,759
there's a whole lot of things we did

1424
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,960
that in the Rabid opsis paper to some

1425
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:59,760
degree and we'll probably do that again

1426
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:03,639
here but yeah there there's a lot lot

1427
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,960
happening with that Laura I just

1428
00:57:03,639 --> 00:57:07,679
thinking about more about these

1429
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,280
assumptions underlying the Gen duplicate

1430
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:11,879
have those assumptions been

1431
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:16,000
experimentally tested so Laura is asking

1432
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:18,880
whether the assumptions of um of of

1433
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,318
shared or preserved function at

1434
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,798
duplication could those assumptions be

1435
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:25,599
tested I'm not sure you even need to to

1436
00:57:23,798 --> 00:57:28,000
know that they're really wrong in some

1437
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,880
cases frankly I mean so for examp I

1438
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,480
didn't get into this in the seminar but

1439
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:34,160
if you think about the difference

1440
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:36,838
between just trans just um duplicating a

1441
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:39,279
gene right in suu versus transposing it

1442
00:57:36,838 --> 00:57:41,159
to someplace in the in the dark matter

1443
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:43,079
of the genome where you know you're

1444
00:57:41,159 --> 00:57:44,719
around a bunch of transposable elements

1445
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:46,480
there's no way that that Gene is going

1446
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:48,358
to be the same function and yet it's

1447
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,240
considered a duplicate right the other

1448
00:57:48,358 --> 00:57:53,480
one is a

1449
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:55,639
retrotransposon kind of situation or

1450
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,119
when you actually um you chop out the

1451
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:58,519
intron and everything and you're going

1452
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:01,200
to put that Gene in there call that a

1453
00:57:58,519 --> 00:58:04,000
duplication and is that really going to

1454
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:06,679
have the same function so I don't know

1455
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:10,119
um one other complicating factor is that

1456
00:58:06,679 --> 00:58:12,358
when we talk about autop poly so when we

1457
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:13,480
talk about poly often people think just

1458
00:58:12,358 --> 00:58:16,199
make the Assumption it's just

1459
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:19,159
duplication of the genome right but an

1460
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:20,358
awful lot of poly probably all poly

1461
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:22,798
involves

1462
00:58:20,358 --> 00:58:24,639
hybridization either in the systematics

1463
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:26,639
and evolutionary biology sense of being

1464
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:28,118
between two species or in the plant

1465
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:30,279
breeders sense I'm looking at the plant

1466
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:31,920
breeders in the audience here who think

1467
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:34,720
of a hybrid as being between two

1468
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:36,318
varieties of maze right so almost

1469
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:38,959
everything probably when polyploids

1470
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:41,239
originate involves some kind of a cross

1471
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,519
different genotypes are involved now to

1472
00:58:41,239 --> 00:58:46,479
say in an era when we know that there's

1473
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:48,920
a Le specific expression differences in

1474
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:51,400
pretty much every Gene right to think

1475
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:53,159
that those are going to be identical no

1476
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,760
