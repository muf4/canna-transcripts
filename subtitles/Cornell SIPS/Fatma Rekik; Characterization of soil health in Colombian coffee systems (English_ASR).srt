1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,339
University

3
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:13,388
alright Thank You heralds and thank you

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:16,240
everyone for being here based on the

5
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:18,820
presence I'm assuming we have some

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:21,519
coffee lovers or soil health lovers or

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,510
both or neither which is fine you're

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,820
probably here because you're taking a

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,439
class and you need to be here but I'm

10
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:30,579
hoping that it'll be an insightful

11
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:31,960
presentation so to give you some

12
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:36,160
background information about coffee

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:38,320
production in in Colombia almost all of

14
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,439
our coffee that we consume is produced

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,628
by small holder farmers in Colombia and

16
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:45,640
it's been increasingly challenging for

17
00:00:43,628 --> 00:00:48,820
them to keep up with production and earn

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,859
a consistent income because of the price

19
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,588
of fluctuations the market price

20
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:57,940
fluctuations as you can see from the

21
00:00:53,588 --> 00:01:00,338
1972 2006-16 you see drastic changes

22
00:00:57,939 --> 00:01:03,248
which makes you know an inconsistent

23
00:01:00,338 --> 00:01:05,950
income for farmers the other issue is

24
00:01:03,249 --> 00:01:08,379
drastic changes in climate trends this

25
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:10,450
was an article in The Guardian about two

26
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:12,280
and a half months ago about how climate

27
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,980
change is predicted to have coffee

28
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:19,689
growing area that supports these small

29
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:21,969
holder farmers so soil health actually

30
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:23,709
can be a solution in a sense that it may

31
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:26,140
offer coffee farmers on marketing

32
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:29,739
advantage and significant price premiums

33
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:31,960
by promoting sustainability the ftp here

34
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:35,609
which is the Fairtrade proof is just one

35
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:39,280
example of an organization that provides

36
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:41,189
price premiums based on social economic

37
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,420
and environmental sustainability and

38
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:47,019
sometimes these price premiums can be so

39
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:51,700
high to be double what your regular

40
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:58,030
commodity price is so the purpose of

41
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:59,950
this multidisciplinary study so the

42
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,379
purpose of this multidisciplinary study

43
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,210
is to identify the characteristics of

44
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:06,670
soil health in Colombian coffee systems

45
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:10,978
to better address the issues of economic

46
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,979
social and environmental sustainability

47
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:17,739
so the outline is so the multiplet study

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,629
consists of three parts the first part

49
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,870
is

50
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:25,479
very sociological anthropological based

51
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,800
study that consists of understanding

52
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,479
soil health and associated farmers

53
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,840
perception and Colombian coffee systems

54
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:34,000
the second part is to determine the

55
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,150
association between coffee cup quality

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,639
and soil health and the third part is a

57
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:46,259
comparative analysis of the different

58
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:49,299
regional scoring frameworks so our study

59
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:51,659
was located in six municipality 'he's

60
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:55,630
within the department of Calca

61
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:57,789
department is equivalent to state so the

62
00:02:55,629 --> 00:03:02,680
kalke is located in the southwest part

63
00:02:57,789 --> 00:03:05,560
of colombia and farms in the each

64
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,770
municipality either belonged to the

65
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,680
local coffee co-op or didn't belong so

66
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:14,020
they were members or non-member farms

67
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:17,950
from the member farms to soil samples

68
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:20,439
were collected a most the most fertile

69
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:21,789
sample as indicated by the farmer so we

70
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,789
went to the farm and we told him ok we

71
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:26,919
want you to identify in your farm the

72
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:30,579
most fertile for type lot and we sampled

73
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:32,649
that and excuse me and the least for

74
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,320
tile and the same thing as indicated by

75
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,909
the farmer and then a representative

76
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:41,769
sample one representative sample was

77
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:44,710
collected from the non-member farms so

78
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:47,939
this this is this is what was this is

79
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:51,580
what this is great information for to

80
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:54,789
assess the procession of farmers of soil

81
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,800
health so the samples were collected

82
00:03:54,789 --> 00:04:00,129
they were they were sent to the soil

83
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,689
health lab here and I'm a number of

84
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:04,389
physical chemical and biological

85
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:05,770
indicators were measured physical

86
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:07,419
indicators included what aggregate

87
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,300
stability which is measured measured

88
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:13,208
using a rainfall simulator which

89
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:16,270
delivers 12.5 milliliter millimeters of

90
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:19,569
water in five minutes an available water

91
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:22,299
capacity which is which is measured

92
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:24,790
using pressure chambers that extract

93
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,689
water at two different pressures the 10

94
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:30,129
kilo pascal and the 15 kilo pascal

95
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:31,848
biological indicators included organic

96
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:34,999
matter which which is measured

97
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:37,459
based on Lawson ignition active carbon

98
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:40,819
which is measured with potassium

99
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:44,179
permanganate oxidation and measured with

100
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:48,319
a 550 nanometers spectrophotometer soil

101
00:04:44,178 --> 00:04:50,478
respiration measured by capturing co2

102
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:53,629
and a four day incubation using

103
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:55,848
potassium hydroxide and the soil protein

104
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:57,709
index was which is extracted with a

105
00:04:55,848 --> 00:05:00,348
citrate buffer under high temperature

106
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:02,869
and pressure finally the chemical

107
00:05:00,348 --> 00:05:05,928
indicators included pH measured in a

108
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:08,179
one-to-one water slurry phosphorus

109
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:10,718
potassium and the micronutrients were

110
00:05:08,178 --> 00:05:15,888
all extracted with modified Morgan and

111
00:05:10,718 --> 00:05:20,498
quantified by with the ICP so the whole

112
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:22,728
the songhouse scoring was was was

113
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:24,409
undertaken using a cumulative normal

114
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:26,568
distribution so the cumulative normal

115
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:28,579
distribution is the derivative of the

116
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:31,098
Gaussian distribution the you know the

117
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:35,718
Gaussian distribution function and it

118
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:38,628
gives you the probability that a member

119
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:42,050
of the distribution is less or equal to

120
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:44,110
your measured soil health indicator for

121
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:47,658
instance if you look at active carbon

122
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:51,379
then if we look at the measurement 600

123
00:05:47,658 --> 00:05:53,240
and you derive the distribution it gives

124
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:54,709
you six hundred would be here it gives

125
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,139
you that the score would be fifty

126
00:05:54,709 --> 00:06:02,559
percent so in some way you can look at

127
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:05,658
it as a ranking scheme so the parameters

128
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:07,249
for for MU and Sigma which is the

129
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:09,348
population mean and in the population

130
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:12,860
standard deviation we're either

131
00:06:09,348 --> 00:06:14,688
estimated from local conditions and this

132
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,459
was done what where thresholds and

133
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:19,039
critical values for specifics of how the

134
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:21,199
indicators have not been established so

135
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:24,318
in the literature it's nearly impossible

136
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,449
to find the optimum the thresholds or

137
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,158
the optimum levels for available water

138
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:31,158
capacity organic matter active carbon

139
00:06:28,158 --> 00:06:33,558
protein respiration and phosphorous so

140
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:35,688
in that case you estimate the population

141
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:37,129
mean in the in the standard deviation

142
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:39,370
using the sample mean and the standard

143
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:44,930
deviation the sample being the N equals

144
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:46,389
223 for four parameters parameters were

145
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,860
also

146
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:50,449
determined from existing critical values

147
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,840
found in the literature specific to

148
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:55,819
coffee soils and hence was the case for

149
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:59,388
potassium magnesium zinc manganese and

150
00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:02,530
iron wet aggregate stability was the

151
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:05,840
exception wet aggregate stability when

152
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:08,779
when you when you plot the distribution

153
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,948
it's very less skewed and that all of

154
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:14,568
the measurements were on the high end

155
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:16,908
they were 90 and so we used the measured

156
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:18,800
values as the scores themselves because

157
00:07:16,908 --> 00:07:22,188
the measured values is a percent based

158
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,408
measurement so we use that those are

159
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:27,199
scores and then overall soil health is

160
00:07:24,408 --> 00:07:28,459
computed as the unweighted arithmetic

161
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,550
mean of individual soil health

162
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:33,348
indicators meaning that you calculate

163
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,028
the scores for each individual for all

164
00:07:33,348 --> 00:07:36,468
of the indicators and then you take the

165
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:40,459
main and you get your overall soil

166
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:42,500
health score so these are what the soil

167
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:45,560
health scoring curves look like for each

168
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:49,490
indicator there are two things to note

169
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:52,819
in this in this graph so there are so

170
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:56,329
some scoring curves follow a more is

171
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:59,990
better curve which is the case for the

172
00:07:56,329 --> 00:08:03,079
following and then some of them followed

173
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:07,728
a optimum range curve which was the case

174
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:10,459
for pH iron iron and zinc and then some

175
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:13,158
of them followed a less is better which

176
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:16,370
is manganese so the less manganese do

177
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:19,788
have the higher score your soil your

178
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:22,069
soil is has the other thing to note

179
00:08:19,788 --> 00:08:24,800
about this graph is that some indicators

180
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:26,810
required accounting for texture so we

181
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,478
adjusted them for texture and those were

182
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:32,000
the the indicators that showed

183
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:34,250
significant difference in measured

184
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,309
values between the between the different

185
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,198
textural classes and so this was a WC

186
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:41,389
organic matter active carbon and

187
00:08:39,198 --> 00:08:43,399
respiration we did not develop curves

188
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:45,528
for course textured soils because we did

189
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,360
not have a representative sample of

190
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:49,419
course sector sold soils coming from

191
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,450
Colombia

192
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:55,469
so the first part of them of the of this

193
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:57,490
of the multidisciplinary study is is

194
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,620
understanding soil health and associated

195
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,629
farmers perceptions and the objectives

196
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,278
were to determine the Geo demographic

197
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:05,049
and environmental factors that play a

198
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:07,419
role in farmers perception of soil

199
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:09,458
health and its accuracy whether coffee

200
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:12,129
farmers have accurate perceptions of

201
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:14,169
soil health so this is and the soil

202
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:16,600
health indicators most associated with

203
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:19,028
farmers perception the statistical

204
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,800
analyses used here were anova four

205
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:23,350
factors influencing soil health and

206
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,689
farmer soil health perception accuracy a

207
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:29,290
Fisher's exact test for count data which

208
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:31,660
is a more accurate test than chi square

209
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:33,629
and the g test when you have when your

210
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:35,948
sample size is less than a thousand and

211
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:37,328
and we use that for the factors

212
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:40,000
influencing farmers soil health

213
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:41,769
perception accuracy and then we also did

214
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,778
a logistic regression and a principal

215
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:46,299
component analysis for the soil health

216
00:09:43,778 --> 00:09:51,519
indicators most affecting farmers

217
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:54,069
perceptions so in these in these box

218
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:58,000
plots we have soil health score on the

219
00:09:54,070 --> 00:10:01,810
y-axis and and the gender municipality

220
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,778
and membership variables so our results

221
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:07,179
actually show that female farmers have

222
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:12,870
significantly higher soil health and

223
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:15,129
male farmers yes that it they have and

224
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,948
someone needs to tell this to trump I

225
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:20,039
think that would be interesting to see

226
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:23,229
what his reaction would be so

227
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:25,120
furthermore we saw significant

228
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:28,509
difference among municipality Xin terms

229
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,820
of soil health Rosa roses having the

230
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:35,049
lowest mean and the ki bo having the

231
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:37,209
highest mean we also found that members

232
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:40,328
have significantly higher soil health

233
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:42,250
and non-member for coops which makes

234
00:10:40,328 --> 00:10:45,578
sense that means that the service is

235
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:50,948
provided by the co-op have measurable

236
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:53,979
positive impact on the soil health our

237
00:10:50,948 --> 00:10:56,109
results also show that coffee farmers

238
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:59,800
have correct perceptions of their soil

239
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:01,789
health these are so on the y-axis again

240
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:03,859
we have the soil health score the

241
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:06,379
the measure to a health score front from

242
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:08,330
the lab and these are the perceived soil

243
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:11,029
health so this is what they ranked most

244
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:12,889
fertile nice fur tough and on average we

245
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:15,980
did find that the most fertile what they

246
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:17,720
what they specify to be most fertile was

247
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:25,399
significantly higher than the least

248
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:27,529
fertile finally when we we were

249
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:30,230
interested in seeing what what factors

250
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:32,959
influencing influences farmers / cheb

251
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:35,960
perception of soil health when we looked

252
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,090
at a gender we saw that there is no

253
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,590
significant difference in terms of their

254
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:41,840
perception accuracy their ability to

255
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:45,950
perceive their soil high accurately did

256
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:48,769
not differ between between gender it did

257
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:52,850
not also differ between Tim Bo between

258
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:56,389
municipalities but we saw that it did

259
00:11:52,850 --> 00:12:00,019
defer based on the actual soil health

260
00:11:56,389 --> 00:12:03,100
meaning that far farmers who had higher

261
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:06,529
soil health were better at predicting

262
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:10,580
their other soil health and you see this

263
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:16,129
by this linear up a significant linear

264
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:20,500
model so a principal component analysis

265
00:12:16,129 --> 00:12:22,879
is a great way to visualize patterns and

266
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,730
little lies patterns and really describe

267
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:28,639
your data it's really it was it's really

268
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:33,430
important for two reasons it helps you

269
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:36,529
detect variables and attributes that are

270
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:39,409
that have higher impact and then but it

271
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:41,809
also helps it's really useful for

272
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:44,600
dimension reduction so if you want to

273
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:46,489
achieve a parsimonious model than a PCA

274
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,060
would be a great way to do that and so

275
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:51,710
that's what we did we use PCA for the

276
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:55,869
logistic regressions which also show

277
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:59,570
next up to assess which indicators

278
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:02,240
affect farmers perception which affects

279
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,690
a farmers perception of soil health so

280
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,039
in the first principal component which

281
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:09,530
explains thirty four percent of the

282
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:13,370
total variability you can see that it's

283
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:15,539
very biological biological heavy so most

284
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:18,328
of the indicators are biological

285
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:20,009
and we do have some physical and then

286
00:13:18,328 --> 00:13:21,359
the second principle component analysis

287
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:24,379
explains seventeen percent of the

288
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,329
variability and is very chemical based

289
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:31,649
so for the sake of the of having a

290
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:33,838
parsimonious model we used the the

291
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:35,309
values that represent the values with

292
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:42,149
strong correlations so those are the

293
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:44,189
ones in bold so our logistic regression

294
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:46,440
showed that organic matter of protein

295
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,940
iron respirations are indicators that

296
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,940
are most related to soil health

297
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:54,870
perception organic matter had a

298
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:56,759
significant positive relationship with

299
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:59,519
farmers perception and this makes sense

300
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,440
you see it in the literature organic

301
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,110
matter is a very effective way of

302
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:08,759
assessing your soil health when measured

303
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:11,970
data are lacking protein also had a

304
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:15,480
significant positive relationship with a

305
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:18,149
oil health perception the only way I can

306
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:21,690
explain this is protein is basically the

307
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:24,480
nitrogen bound organic compounds and

308
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:27,360
somehow the the farmers have a

309
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,399
perception of the importance of nitrogen

310
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,220
and the availability of nitrogen and

311
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:34,948
that somehow translate into being able

312
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:37,110
to perceive their soil health what's

313
00:14:34,948 --> 00:14:40,318
interesting is that respiration is also

314
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:43,409
significant but it's negative and the

315
00:14:40,318 --> 00:14:49,250
only way I was able to interpret this is

316
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:52,049
that the farmer seemed to took their eye

317
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:55,198
they seem to confound bit confuse are

318
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:58,528
confused between beneficial biological

319
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:01,139
activity and detrimental Peston and fat

320
00:14:58,528 --> 00:15:03,328
infestation which throws throws off

321
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:05,129
their perception accuracy that's the

322
00:15:03,328 --> 00:15:08,370
only way I was able to interpret this

323
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:12,059
and I'm I'm happy to hear your input at

324
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:16,709
the end of the seminar so the second

325
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:19,528
part of the second part of the study was

326
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:21,568
to assess whether soil health has an

327
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:23,519
effect on koffee kup quality so to

328
00:15:21,568 --> 00:15:26,009
assess the existence and the relation

329
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,019
the nape the existence and the nature of

330
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:29,039
the relationship relationship between

331
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:31,078
coffee cup qual

332
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,458
and soil health and the soil health

333
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:35,099
indicators that our main predictors of

334
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:37,948
coffee sensorial attributes we selected

335
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:41,639
68 member for member farms that were

336
00:15:37,948 --> 00:15:43,889
demarcate advisee meter quadrants and

337
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:46,169
then we did an inventory for tree

338
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:48,209
density which is a proxy proxy for shade

339
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:50,399
coverage which literature has shown to

340
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:53,068
have a positive impact on cup quality

341
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,589
and also elevation of the farm coffee

342
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:57,299
cherries were also sampled and the

343
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:58,800
statistical analyses used where the

344
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:00,929
correlation matrix and linear

345
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,778
regressions to assess the relationship

346
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:05,729
between coffee quality and soil health

347
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:07,470
and then a best subset regression for

348
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:10,649
coffee sensorial attributes to soil

349
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:15,959
health indicators so this is an example

350
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:18,708
of a coffee report so coffee is assessed

351
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:23,068
by a professional certified copper that

352
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:25,559
assesses a number of a physical physical

353
00:16:23,068 --> 00:16:27,360
sensorial attributes and also granule

354
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,609
metric which is a series of civic test

355
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,370
this is a list of all of the sensorial

356
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:34,649
attributes and the physical attributes

357
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:37,620
so all the individual scores are

358
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:43,409
composited and you have a total coffee

359
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:47,159
coffee coffee square so the correlation

360
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:48,480
coefficient of coffee quality coffee

361
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:52,318
quality scores with soul health

362
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:55,139
indicators show that available water

363
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:58,458
capacity and organic matter arnette are

364
00:16:55,139 --> 00:17:03,028
significantly negatively correlated with

365
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:05,458
coffee cup quality you also see a

366
00:17:03,028 --> 00:17:08,429
negative correlation with phosphorus and

367
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:12,029
iron but a positive with manganese when

368
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:14,909
we run a linear regression we first use

369
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:16,349
a full linear model with all of the soil

370
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:19,860
health indicators the number of trees

371
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:22,558
and the elevation and our model did not

372
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:24,599
come out to be significant at all and we

373
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,908
had a negative which indicates that it's

374
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,589
a very poor linear model so what we did

375
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:31,110
was we did a best subset regression of

376
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:33,269
the five best predictors which are in

377
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:36,178
bold and so we extracted these and ran

378
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:39,720
their separate linear model and that's

379
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:41,980
when you start to see significance so

380
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,079
again you see a negative

381
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,929
correlation with organic matter the

382
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:49,149
estimates are negative protein

383
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:52,330
respiration has a positive estimate and

384
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:54,309
then pH and iron have a negative so so

385
00:17:52,329 --> 00:17:58,509
these these findings are puzzling you

386
00:17:54,308 --> 00:18:00,819
would think that you know so higher soil

387
00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:04,210
health is better in in in every

388
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:07,720
dimension but after a much saught we

389
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:09,940
think that we think that coffee might

390
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,100
actually be very similar to grapevines

391
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,919
and that you don't want you don't

392
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:17,409
necessarily want a high soil health and

393
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:19,720
that additional organic matter or water

394
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:21,610
holding capacity or pH doesn't

395
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,440
necessarily translate to better coffee

396
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:26,918
quality and so you see again this

397
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,570
trade-off between between quads between

398
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:31,179
quantity and quality and where this

399
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:37,710
farmer has to decide whether to maximize

400
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:37,710
yields or achieve premium coffee quality

401
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:43,359
we're and in terms of the micronutrients

402
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,890
that we see her I'm I'm still haven't I

403
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,168
looked at the literature and I still

404
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:49,960
can't translate know how to translate

405
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:55,169
that and to don't know how that

406
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:58,870
translates into into coffee cup quality

407
00:18:55,169 --> 00:19:00,520
so I best subset regression for it was

408
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:03,339
used for predicting coffee sensorial

409
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:05,558
traits so you see all of the sensorial

410
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:08,949
treats here and all of the soil health

411
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:10,750
indicators here and we noticed that iron

412
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:14,440
phosphorus and wet aggregate stability

413
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,970
were consistent and predicting coffee

414
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,630
sensorial traits they were the best

415
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:22,960
three predictors of of coffee sensorial

416
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:26,850
traits with a fairly good r-squared

417
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:30,308
value and so this is important because

418
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:35,409
it could provide an alternative to the

419
00:19:30,308 --> 00:19:38,529
different sensorial assessment the third

420
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:41,860
and last part of the study involved a

421
00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:46,928
comparison of the regional soil health

422
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:49,058
scoring frameworks so this where we so

423
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:51,700
we did this and in an attempt to develop

424
00:19:49,058 --> 00:19:53,950
to assess the feasibility of developing

425
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,720
global soil health standards which is

426
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:59,259
sort of aligns with the NRC

427
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:01,298
goals of achieving national soil health

428
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:02,619
standards and so the objectives were to

429
00:20:01,298 --> 00:20:04,418
assess whether different regional

430
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:06,819
scoring frameworks yield similar results

431
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:10,570
and to develop a simplified version of

432
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:13,298
the Colombian of the coffee Colombian

433
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:16,839
coffee soil health scoring framework for

434
00:20:13,298 --> 00:20:18,940
this we the 223 samples were subjected

435
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:21,579
to three type of indicator and overall

436
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:24,519
soil health scoring the scores were

437
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:26,529
compared using a key test and an inter

438
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:29,470
alight inter-rater reliability test

439
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:31,418
which gives you the ICC an inter class

440
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:34,240
correlation coefficient which which

441
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:35,799
gives you the level of agreement between

442
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,980
the different score between the

443
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:41,079
different ranking mechanisms so if you

444
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,548
have an icc of point2 or below you have

445
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:46,389
poor agreement between the different

446
00:20:42,548 --> 00:20:50,529
scoring mechanisms and above point 8 is

447
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:52,929
on an almost perfect agreement so

448
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:55,259
they're currently there exists three

449
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:57,759
regional scoring curves that we know of

450
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:59,919
the comprehensive assessment of soil

451
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,808
health that's the scoring framework

452
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,179
developed at cornell specific to the

453
00:21:01,808 --> 00:21:07,658
northeast the Colombian coffee so health

454
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:09,820
scoring specific to kalka columbia and

455
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:12,730
the western kenya soil health scoring

456
00:21:09,819 --> 00:21:17,428
functions which were developed by bianca

457
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:20,159
some of you know Bianca and colleagues

458
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:23,230
so these are what the different scoring

459
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,870
functions look like these are

460
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:28,599
categorized by the textural classes so

461
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:30,788
fine texture clot of soil medium texture

462
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:34,990
soil and coarse texture soil and these

463
00:21:30,788 --> 00:21:36,700
are for the different regions again stnd

464
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:39,370
is the cumulative normal distribution

465
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:43,210
which is the derivative of the Gaussian

466
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:45,219
distribution and when you compare if we

467
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:47,860
take for instance if you look at wet

468
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:51,190
aggregate stability again we use the

469
00:21:47,859 --> 00:21:55,000
measured values to score the wet a grits

470
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:57,850
debility in the calc of colombia's

471
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,359
framework but if you compare western

472
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:03,969
kenya and nor the northeast you see some

473
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:06,209
some differences in terms of them in

474
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:08,289
terms of the scoring function which is

475
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,660
composed of the mean and the

476
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:13,269
standard deviation so you see 58 and 43

477
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:15,519
19 and 17 so there is about a fifteen

478
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:19,690
percent difference between the between

479
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:21,759
means and if you go across the different

480
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,559
scoring textures you you could also see

481
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:27,099
that in medium it gets it there closer

482
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:30,609
the fairly close and the same thing for

483
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:32,529
available water capacity you see so in

484
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:36,909
this case the in medium texture soils

485
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:40,690
the the the mean for western Kenya and

486
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:43,810
and the North East are identical and

487
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:45,400
standard deviations are very similar so

488
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:48,579
these are just the different scoring

489
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:55,570
functions by textural class and by

490
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:57,899
region so additionally we also performed

491
00:22:55,569 --> 00:23:00,399
we also performed a methodological

492
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,620
developed a methodological framework

493
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,320
with which we named the weighted

494
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:07,899
Columbian coffee so health scoring and

495
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:10,750
the overall soil health was computed in

496
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:13,360
this in this framework as a weighted

497
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:15,670
mean of the individuals soil indicator

498
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,649
scores plus texture so if you remember

499
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:20,650
the approach that we use use previously

500
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:23,650
was as an unweighted it's just a mean a

501
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:26,440
regular mean but this was weighted and

502
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:29,110
the weights were determined using a PCA

503
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,940
where the sum of the eigenvector vectors

504
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:34,059
of the first four principal components

505
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:38,740
were were the actual the actual weights

506
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:40,960
and so you can see here that that

507
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,640
biological indicator seems to have the

508
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:49,299
highest weight I know this will make

509
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:51,460
Janice really happy so and so the the

510
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:53,529
formula for the weighted overall soil

511
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:57,190
health is basically your the soil health

512
00:23:53,529 --> 00:24:01,779
indicator times its weight so on over

513
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:06,910
the sum of the weight and these are the

514
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:11,889
results so the so there are two things

515
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:14,430
to note in this uh in this slide so the

516
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,430
t-test

517
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:20,710
the t test shows that the different that

518
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:23,949
the different scoring mechanisms yield

519
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:27,669
significantly different scores however

520
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:30,850
in some cases the ICC the inter

521
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:32,890
correlation coefficient was high which

522
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:34,719
indicates that there is actually a

523
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:38,049
strong agreement between the different

524
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:41,558
scoring mechanisms and this was the case

525
00:24:38,048 --> 00:24:44,918
for what aggregate stability protein and

526
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:50,168
the overall so health scoring in other

527
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:52,299
cases the results from the t-test were

528
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:54,759
matched the results from the inter

529
00:24:52,298 --> 00:24:56,528
correlation coefficient meaning that the

530
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:58,869
different scoring mechanism feel

531
00:24:56,528 --> 00:25:01,028
significantly different scores and so

532
00:24:58,869 --> 00:25:04,449
that the different scoring mechanism are

533
00:25:01,028 --> 00:25:07,419
different and this was the case for

534
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:11,259
organic matter respiration pH and

535
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:14,710
phosphorus so the way to interpret this

536
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:15,669
discrepancy between ICC and the t-test

537
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:18,120
between in the inter correlation

538
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:21,190
coefficient and the and the t-test is

539
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:23,678
that although sometimes that she test

540
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:26,320
indicates that they are significantly

541
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,659
different in reality they're not because

542
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:32,259
the different scoring mechanism seemed

543
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:35,799
to generate scores that are in the same

544
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:37,839
range meaning that 99 and 94 and 96

545
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:40,658
they're all high it does it may be the

546
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:42,819
means are significantly different but

547
00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:45,010
the scoring the three scoring mechanism

548
00:25:42,819 --> 00:25:49,148
consistently because it's consistently

549
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:52,028
score the score the soils high and it's

550
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:55,178
the same thing for the overall soil

551
00:25:52,028 --> 00:25:57,599
health they're consistently medium but

552
00:25:55,179 --> 00:26:06,450
in other cases they were significantly

553
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:08,889
different so lastly given the financial

554
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:10,750
given the financial the logistical and

555
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:14,169
the resource constraints of smallholder

556
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:16,089
farmers in colombia we try to develop a

557
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:19,960
simplified and less expensive version of

558
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:23,379
a soil health assessment and we use that

559
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:25,259
this using a best subset regression so

560
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:29,400
the best stuff that regression is at

561
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:32,490
of regression that models that models

562
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,980
all possible that basically generates

563
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:36,750
all possible models based on a specified

564
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,329
number of predictors so if you if you

565
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:42,240
want one predictor it'll give you the

566
00:26:39,329 --> 00:26:45,029
best model with one single predictor and

567
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,029
you could also choose a set of two or

568
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:51,690
three and so when you look at the best

569
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:54,049
single predictor active carbon was very

570
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:56,880
had very high predictive power and

571
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:58,980
predicting overall soil health followed

572
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,830
by organic matter and this is a great

573
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:03,089
finding because especially because of

574
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:04,710
the nature of the active carbon

575
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:07,679
assessment which is very easy and very

576
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:09,450
inexpensive basically all you have all

577
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,360
you need is some potassium permanganate

578
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:14,340
and a small field spectrophotometer and

579
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:17,399
you can have your active carbon

580
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:24,959
measurement fair in a matter of 20

581
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:28,290
minutes about and and fought it and then

582
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,590
if you add if you if you add other

583
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:33,299
indicators for higher predictive power

584
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:36,299
that's when you see protein and

585
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:39,539
respirations play a role and predicting

586
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:42,480
over also a health so it's it's not

587
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:44,549
until predict groups of three where you

588
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,539
see where you start seeing some chemical

589
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:50,220
indicators as major predictors so what

590
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:52,889
have we learned from this big

591
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,930
multidisciplinary study we learned that

592
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:56,790
female farmers and co-op members have

593
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:59,310
significantly higher soil health than

594
00:27:56,789 --> 00:28:01,049
their counterparts farmers appear to

595
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:02,700
have correct perception of their soil

596
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:05,039
health which is not associated with

597
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:07,610
their gender or municipality but with

598
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:10,259
how healthy their soil actually is

599
00:28:07,609 --> 00:28:12,240
organic matter respiration and protein

600
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:14,900
our indicators that are most related to

601
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,730
farmers perceptions of their soil health

602
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:19,560
we also learned that coffee quality is

603
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,900
significantly higher with lower soil

604
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:26,069
organic matter water quality holding

605
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,720
capacity and pH and iron phosphorus and

606
00:28:26,069 --> 00:28:29,700
wet aggregate stability were

607
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,400
consistently best at predicting coffee

608
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,259
sensorial attributes finally in the last

609
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,240
part we learned that achieving global

610
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:38,259
soil health standards is possible

611
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,349
especially when only considering

612
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:45,759
the indicators that showed a high ICC an

613
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:47,829
inter correlation coefficient oops we

614
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,539
also learned that active carbon is a

615
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:51,759
great test that can highly predict

616
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:53,920
overall soil health and can be used as

617
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:57,369
in a simplified version of a soil health

618
00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:00,100
assessment with that I'd like to

619
00:28:57,369 --> 00:29:04,359
acknowledge my source of funding the NSF

620
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:07,299
g RFP I'd like to thank my major advisor

621
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:09,250
Harold who's been mentoring me ever

622
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:11,950
since I was a dumb undergrad and been

623
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:13,690
very patient with me Miguel Gomez who

624
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:16,299
hired me as an undergraduate research

625
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:19,120
assistant when my senior year and who

626
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:23,129
got me involved in this project and dr.

627
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:25,509
Hobbs who in whose invaluable

628
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:28,000
international work has really taken this

629
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:31,539
research to a whole nother level I also

630
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,670
want to thank Kirsten Kurtz and Bob from

631
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:36,250
the soil health team kirsten was the one

632
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:37,720
who taught me everything about soil

633
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:41,140
health and how to run all the samples

634
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:43,029
and I actually started when I first

635
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:46,140
started working in the soil health lab I

636
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:51,309
started with the Colombian samples and

637
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:52,960
Bob who's been the you know the behind

638
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:55,419
it all just organizing everything and

639
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,039
then steven perry from the cornell

640
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,930
statistical consulting unit who's been

641
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,059
giving me such difficult advice

642
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:05,529
throughout the all these parts captors

643
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:07,269
and then the story behind this slide is

644
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:10,629
actually pretty deep it's not just a

645
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:13,450
year regular thank you slide so when I

646
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:15,400
was doing the literature review for the

647
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:18,250
third part about the global soil health

648
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:20,740
standards I did so much littered review

649
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,869
that it was a pain in the neck and I had

650
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:24,849
to teach myself how to read dense

651
00:30:22,869 --> 00:30:27,189
academic papers in four different

652
00:30:24,849 --> 00:30:29,500
languages so I had to learn how to read

653
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:31,269
papers and Portuguese and Spanish and

654
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,160
French which thankfully I already know

655
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:34,599
and English of course I already know so

656
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,090
these are the languages that I used in

657
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:40,319
my literature review and that's all I

658
00:30:37,089 --> 00:30:40,319
have thank you
