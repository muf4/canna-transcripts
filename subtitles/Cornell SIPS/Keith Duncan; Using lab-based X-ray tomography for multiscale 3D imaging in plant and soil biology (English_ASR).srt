1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,480
University hear me thanks Lynn for that

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:13,679
for that wonderful introduction and for

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,240
uh Decades of of friendship and

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,039
professional collaboration uh and thank

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:21,839
you for the opportunity to share uh our

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,199
research program at the Danforth Center

8
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,118
uh with with with Cornell and everyone

9
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,560
who's doing some fantastic plant science

10
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:31,359
here um you might see some familiar PL

11
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:35,039
uh familiar faces some references to to

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,800
Cornell folks um as Lynn said I'm the

13
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,238
director of the X-ray Imaging facility

14
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:42,000
at the Danforth Center uh and if you are

15
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:45,159
not already aware uh the danforce center

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,600
is the world's largest uh nonprofit

17
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:50,799
independent plant science uh Research

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,879
Institute and uh we have the fortunate

19
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:55,319
position to really look into a lot of

20
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:58,000
issues in plant science especially food

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,518
security that that other places don't

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,480
really have the freedom or the support

23
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:06,039
um to

24
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:09,478
do um I'm a research scientist in Dr

25
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,719
Chris Topps lab Chris is the pi and he

26
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:13,879
started the lab in 2013 using

27
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:17,239
phenotyping to look at root biology and

28
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:19,399
that has expanded to include not only

29
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:21,478
roots and genetics but everything

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,159
surrounding the roots so there's a wide

31
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:26,679
range of expertise that we share and as

32
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,520
I expect many of you here are starting

33
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,479
to realize that no one lab will have

34
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,039
nearly enough expertise to get

35
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:35,840
everything done you must collaborate you

36
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,920
must find ways to work with your

37
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,200
colleagues to really pull more of the

38
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,159
science out of all these projects so you

39
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,719
can see the list on the left plant

40
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:47,118
genotypes and uh genetics and

41
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:49,078
phenotyping my background in microscopy

42
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,920
and imaging there's cell biology there's

43
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:53,118
a engineering chemical engineering and

44
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,399
perhaps most importantly is

45
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:58,078
computational science because all the

46
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:00,879
beautiful images are mostly just

47
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,879
greeting cards until we can actually

48
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,879
pull some of that biological information

49
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,879
back out the other end of these these

50
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,919
really cool 3D

51
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:13,079
volumes so a couple different um

52
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:15,159
headings today um this is lab based

53
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,719
x-ray microscopy as opposed to working

54
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:19,598
at a synchrotron uh the lab base makes

55
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:21,878
it very very accessible there's of

56
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,399
course uh tradeoffs compared to

57
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:25,399
synchrotron Imaging uh so I'll cover

58
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,879
x-ray

59
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,519
tomography folks often say it's microct

60
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,878
or nanoct or macro now that's just the

61
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,000
resolution you're dealing with it's all

62
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,000
the same instrument so we have an x-ray

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,318
tomography instrument we have an x-ray

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,239
microscope which generates images in a

65
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:45,238
slightly different way um there is

66
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,840
specific application in volume electron

67
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,319
microscopy that is using xrm as a road

68
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,000
map to show you where in your resin

69
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:56,318
block you want to go for organel level

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,158
volume Imaging with with a Serial block

71
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:02,079
face sem or or a fibsem other the the

72
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:03,840
instrumentation that does uh tomography

73
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,239
at the nanometer

74
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,039
scale uh we've done some really sort of

75
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,719
exciting pioneering work looking at

76
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:14,079
micro risal fungi in situ which is a

77
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:16,280
really big Challenge and uh we've been

78
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,560
recently getting into looking at uh

79
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,360
x-ray Imaging of field soil to try to

80
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,158
see what can we understand about the 3D

81
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:28,360
structure of soil uh at multiple

82
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:30,120
scales so to begin with uh coming up on

83
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,480
eight years this August week took

84
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,920
delivery of a large format industrial

85
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,000
scale uh x-ray tomography instrument

86
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,679
this has been collaboration with veent

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,680
bioscience uh biosciences who make a lot

88
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,480
of of biorationals and and micro Ral

89
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,879
micro risal products for the commercial

90
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:50,919
Market in addition to uh part of an NSF

91
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:53,840
Grant now these large scale industrial

92
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:55,958
instruments are frequently found in

93
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,959
automotive and Aerospace Boeing will

94
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,799
probably have a dozen of these to look

95
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,479
at aircraft Parts they have to do

96
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,000
non-destructive Imaging of aircraft

97
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:05,759
parts to confirm that they're they're in

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,280
good shape and having taken two

99
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,120
different flights to get here I'm glad

100
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,360
they do that they know the parts are

101
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,719
working but they have to certify that

102
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,040
all the parts are good so they have uh

103
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:18,040
very large cabinets they can handle very

104
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,759
heavy weights they have a lot of

105
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,360
interior space to work with and these

106
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,319
were the advantages that we found uh in

107
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,120
the large format

108
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:30,000
instrument a quick review of how we

109
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,439
generate image data using um x-ray

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,360
tomography the setup is relatively

111
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:38,038
straightforward you have an x-ray Source

112
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,800
sample sits on a turntable in the middle

113
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:43,639
and you have a detector which collects

114
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:46,439
the image we uh broadcast x-rays through

115
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:49,639
the sample that impinges on the detector

116
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:51,879
we'll rotate that turntable over uh

117
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,519
typically 360 Degrees we'll collect

118
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:54,839
thousands of images from around all

119
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,439
those

120
00:04:54,839 --> 00:05:00,198
angles and then computationally

121
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:03,600
reassemble all those images into a 3D

122
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:06,280
Volume that we can now explore

123
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,000
electronically um a lot of the

124
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:09,839
animations that you'll see today uh

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,800
certainly the colorful ones were done by

126
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:15,719
my senior technician uh Clara Libo she's

127
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,600
been developing her uh undergraduate

128
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,360
degree in art her master's degree in

129
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,960
electron microscopy and combining them

130
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,759
to really make some stunning and

131
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:28,399
striking ways of of presenting these 3D

132
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,000
volumes the Practical offshoot is we can

133
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,198
study these things without tearing them

134
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,680
apart if you wanted to count every seed

135
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,160
inside this pepper you could do that

136
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,800
digitally without having to hack it

137
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,600
apart um some of the very first work we

138
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,199
did was uh actually in collaboration

139
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,000
with Jason Londo who's at uh Geneva

140
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:47,520
hopefully you're online there Jason

141
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,959
hello

142
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:53,519
um they provided hundreds of of grape

143
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,198
ruses these are the stems Left Behind

144
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,879
after the berries of the grape are gone

145
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,319
and if you want to improve grape

146
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,719
varieties you can't just focus on making

147
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,560
big berries you need to understand the

148
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,199
underlying 3D architecture of what's

149
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,439
going to hold those berries and the

150
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,360
enormous amount of variability that

151
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:12,719
already exists in these

152
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,080
systems so certainly with our eyes we

153
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,720
can look at all the different grape

154
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,478
bunches and see that they're very very

155
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,880
different but how do we quantify these

156
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:24,719
differences so what we did is we scanned

157
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:28,319
hundreds of these um grap ruses and when

158
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:31,160
you are fortunate enough to work with um

159
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,680
an applied mathematician like Ma Lee

160
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:37,520
whose one one of her expertise areas is

161
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,280
looking at topology how do you evaluate

162
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:42,959
a 3D structure and so she uses something

163
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:44,879
called persistent homology which takes a

164
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,239
geodesic distance that you measure from

165
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:50,120
one end of a complicated structure to

166
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,840
the other and the timing at which

167
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,240
various components fuse into one another

168
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:58,038
or disappear can be mapped as a barcode

169
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,598
and this animation illustrates as you go

170
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:02,598
from the tips down into the central

171
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:05,120
trunk and down the various components

172
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:07,639
start to disappear and get melded into

173
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,160
one and these can be portrayed as a

174
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,879
barcode and so what's what that allows

175
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,879
you to do is take many different

176
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,599
complicated branching structures and

177
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:18,479
mathematically distinguish them using

178
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:20,279
this barcode sort of architecture again

179
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,719
this is Mao's expertise certainly not

180
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,918
mine so I am exceedingly fortunate to

181
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,599
work with such experts Margaret knows

182
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:31,959
knows ma very well also um yes the

183
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:33,759
pepper that you had up there before

184
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:36,638
assuming that the instrument everything

185
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:40,240
is all set up how long does it take for

186
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,079
the machine to to do the scanning to

187
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,560
generate the information which then

188
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:47,000
ultimately leads to the video yeah so

189
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,720
the question is how long specifically

190
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,519
that bell pepper scan how long does it

191
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,960
take to image and for that particular

192
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,038
bell pepper it was about 30 minutes it's

193
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:58,758
relatively non-dense relatively easy

194
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:02,719
Imaging so a 30 minute scan typically

195
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:05,400
3600 4 4,500 projections we can do it

196
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,639
shorter it will be lower resolution we

197
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:09,239
can go longer higher resolution so

198
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,960
there's a window within which we work

199
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,120
but for something low density like that

200
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:16,638
uh 30 minute scan covered

201
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,399
that so jumping it back into persistent

202
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,598
homology it's a way to uh

203
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:25,560
measure all these unique 3D scans of all

204
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:26,639
these hundreds of of GRA uh ruses that

205
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,959
we l

206
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:33,440
so I provided all the 3D data to m she

207
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:35,478
ran these 3D shapes we extracted uh

208
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,760
surface volumes she put the surface

209
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:39,519
volumes through a persistent homology

210
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,879
measurement tool that she

211
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,039
engineered and then used linear

212
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:46,879
discriminant analysis to group these

213
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,599
persistent homology

214
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,439
measurements based on their

215
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,080
characteristics and what turned out was

216
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,440
this LDA grouping of all the phenotypes

217
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,920
all the different 3D measurements of the

218
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:00,680
grae ruses corresponded very nicely to

219
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:03,360
the actual genotypes and it mapped very

220
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:06,159
very well so the very broad range of

221
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,800
shapes actually linked very nicely to

222
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,958
the differences in the

223
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,958
genotype so Mao was really the the

224
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:13,559
spearhead of the analysis side of that

225
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:15,958
again I had the easy part I just kept

226
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:17,439
putting gra rases in and scanning them

227
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,239
and getting these wonderful data back

228
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,600
from ma showing what we were learning

229
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,440
from it uh but the other thing we wanted

230
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,040
to learn was you know can we use this in

231
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,120
a predictive sense can we scan actual

232
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,679
grape bunches and start to incorporate

233
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,159
the size of the berry and the

234
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:34,919
distribution of the berries along the

235
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:38,958
grape rakus to start to come up with

236
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:40,919
modeling rules for how does a bunch of

237
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,559
grapes form what are the rules that

238
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:44,958
govern the shape does it stop at a

239
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:46,599
certain point does it stop when it

240
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,719
contacts does it stop at a certain

241
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,440
weight and these are some of the the the

242
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,079
measurement data that went into this

243
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,680
paper that that Ma again wrote and and

244
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:56,239
Jason was part of I was a part of Dan

245
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:58,919
Chitwood a number of folks who really

246
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:04,519
contributed to understanding more about

247
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:04,519
the how these these objects occupy 3D

248
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:09,958
space um and so again this is just an

249
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,240
animation that Mao put together that

250
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:14,319
that illustrates using these rules how

251
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,759
berries might grow and how they form but

252
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,440
it begins with mapping the racus itself

253
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:21,120
and then adding the modeling component

254
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,120
that we got from the

255
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,160
berries sorghum panicles sorghum is a

256
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:29,120
very important crop for food Security in

257
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:32,159
many areas of the world it grows often

258
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,679
in in places where corn does not um from

259
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,958
the image here you can see that its

260
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,000
tremendous variability in panicle

261
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:39,679
architecture uh when I started at the

262
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,039
Danforth there were a few scientists who

263
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,838
had collections of hundreds and hundreds

264
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:47,039
of of different panicles from an

265
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,399
association panel and so we realized

266
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,240
that that an X-Ray Scan of an entire

267
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:56,000
panicle would give us a really data

268
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,600
Rich uh information to work with so not

269
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,879
only could we see every individual grain

270
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,959
but then we could also o see the

271
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:04,159
underlying architecture of of the

272
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:06,239
panicle itself all the branches that

273
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,078
hold on to the grains so again if you're

274
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,879
breeding sorum and you want more grains

275
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:12,078
you need to understand what the impact

276
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:14,879
is on the supporting

277
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,599
architecture and again we're very

278
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,838
fortunate to work with very talented

279
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,560
postdocs um Mao again was part of this

280
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,480
but Ray Shia who's now a scientist at

281
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:28,679
venan in the Netherlands um they took

282
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,959
all the data we scanned over 900 sorghum

283
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:33,359
panicles

284
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:35,719
and what they were able to do was to use

285
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,159
these scan data to as you can see from

286
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:42,040
this graph graph map where along the

287
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:43,600
panicle the most grains were deposited

288
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:45,919
was it most in the middle most at the

289
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,278
ends and how did that vary across the

290
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:51,159
900 in the

291
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:54,600
population zoom in and actually analyze

292
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:56,480
the shape of every individual grain how

293
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,320
round were they how spherical how

294
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,680
ellipsoid and how was that shape range

295
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,440
distributed across the 900 R uh

296
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:07,599
varieties and

297
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:10,040
then electronically remove every single

298
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,320
grain not by hand but electronically and

299
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:13,799
then leave behind the branching

300
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,720
architecture and map that so now these

301
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:19,198
are all mappable measurable 3D trait

302
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,639
data phenotype data that can be compared

303
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:24,359
using multivariant statistics amongst

304
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:26,240
all these 900 different varieties and

305
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,079
what they found that the conventional

306
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,159
wisdom was the shape of the panicle

307
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:32,479
dictated the genetics and in fact that

308
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:35,559
was not the case you could find the same

309
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,759
examples of panicle architecture across

310
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:40,159
all the genotypes so that was not the

311
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:43,278
measure of interest and again working

312
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:45,639
with with all stars like Toby Kellogg uh

313
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:47,399
in the field of grass and grass biology

314
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:50,000
is just one of the benefits of being at

315
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:53,440
the Dan for surrounded by just really

316
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,039
phenomenal people that raise your

317
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,120
game far more important than that is a

318
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:00,399
Distillery located in downtown St Louis

319
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,639
where a friend of mine d Wards makes a

320
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,120
really spectacular sorghum whiskey so if

321
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,159
you ever get to St Louis you have to go

322
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,799
to this Distillery it's just four blocks

323
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:10,159
from Bush Stadium if you go to the Ball

324
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:11,599
Game U and and he'd love to give you

325
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,159
samples of the Sorghum whiskey and you

326
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,199
can see off to the side uh some of the

327
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,879
Sorghum panicles so always some

328
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:19,240
practical input from from the Imaging

329
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:21,559
that we're

330
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,440
doing again I told you the top lab

331
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:27,198
started out looking at uh corn roots and

332
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,920
corn root biology so how does one

333
00:13:27,198 --> 00:13:31,319
actually measure and phenotype maze

334
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:35,039
Roots When obviously everything

335
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:37,639
important is happening below ground

336
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,639
so we've been breeding plants as humans

337
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:42,000
for thousands of years but only breeding

338
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:44,879
what we can see and improve and along

339
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,278
with that came root traits they are

340
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,399
there they vary but we've not been able

341
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,399
to work with them very efficiently so

342
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:54,679
when you look at these uh 15 different

343
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,958
maze root crowns it's a very informative

344
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:57,519
region right where the Roots come

345
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:59,239
together the Nexus right at the soil

346
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,440
line they were all grown in the

347
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,879
greenhouse in an artificial medium in

348
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,839
great big tree pots so the environmental

349
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:08,799
conditions were as identical as we can

350
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,360
practically make them so you see the

351
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:14,278
huge variety evident clearly the genes

352
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,639
are playing a big role in making Roots

353
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:19,879
decide how to occupy 3D space we want to

354
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,759
get a handle on those genes we want to

355
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:24,000
find a good strategy for doing that so

356
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,919
for us it begins with measurement so

357
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,278
we'll plant breeding populations out in

358
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:31,360
our research fields and then the whole

359
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,198
lab goes out there with shovels and lots

360
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,320
of coolers of water and and and all

361
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:37,278
sorts of bribes and it's literally

362
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,639
shovel oming a shovel will dig up a

363
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:41,600
useful volume right around that root

364
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:43,159
crown and then they all get brought back

365
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,199
to the lab they get washed we have

366
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:51,240
washing stations and dried and that

367
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:53,278
gives us really a very rich data source

368
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,360
that describes 3D architecture because

369
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,958
the maze root crowns are relatively well

370
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,839
signified at this stage they hold their

371
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:02,758
shape pretty well so comparison

372
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,519
between genotypes are are

373
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:07,199
valid so what we can do is a very rapid

374
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,000
three minute scan because we're not so

375
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:12,078
interested in the internal details but

376
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,198
it gives us a great model of the 3D

377
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:17,278
shape and that's what we're interested

378
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:21,799
in how can we get 3D trait information

379
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:24,278
about how Roots occupy 3D space and

380
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:26,559
again I get the easy part I get the fun

381
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:28,039
part I get to scan stuff and then dump

382
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,359
terabytes of data on our poor

383
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:32,278
computational science s who have to pull

384
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,959
information back out and what they've

385
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:37,639
been able to do is generate a number of

386
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,919
trait extraction pipelines these are

387
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,519
computational pipelines the first one

388
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:46,399
looks at overall how does that root

389
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:49,318
Crown occupy 3D space so n and Mao and

390
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,519
Tim and and Ry develop this this

391
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:55,318
computational pipeline which in stages

392
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:58,278
takes a 3D Volume and then bizes it

393
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:59,439
skeletonize it and then allows it to use

394
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:01,198
the geometry

395
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,680
tools available in many software

396
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:07,519
packages to map how this complicated

397
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:10,479
structure occupies 3D space and any

398
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,839
difference we see there we can assume

399
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,159
relatively equivalent environmental

400
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,279
conditions we can start to have

401
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,439
measurements that differ across

402
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:21,278
phenotypes the more measurement

403
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:24,839
differences we have in phenotypes let's

404
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:26,278
compare that to the actual DNA sequences

405
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,199
where we can obviously see differences

406
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,559
but we don't know which are the

407
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:33,078
important ones to what degree can we use

408
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:36,078
multivari statistics to map the measured

409
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:37,919
phenotypic differences onto the observed

410
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:42,159
sequence differences and start to zoom

411
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:44,759
in on potential genes that control root

412
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:46,240
architecture um we worked with

413
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,318
colleagues at Washington University in

414
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,519
the computer science program uh T's lab

415
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:55,719
and uh this was Dan's uh PhD work to

416
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:57,198
develop too rout which is a different

417
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,000
type of pipeline that starts with the

418
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:02,559
same data but now starts to look

419
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,919
individual High uh High Fidelity root

420
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:07,038
traits how are they branching where are

421
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,360
they branching how many branches and so

422
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:11,119
we have sort of different scales of

423
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:15,000
these pipelines to pull as much 3D trait

424
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:18,198
information out the other end as we

425
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
can it is possible to do live Plant

426
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,079
Imaging again we have the large

427
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,279
industrial scale

428
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:25,798
instrument and Alex actually got his

429
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:29,200
undergraduate degree here at Cornell

430
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:32,558
he's a PhD student in the lab he's got a

431
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:35,600
really interesting mutant that is um

432
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:39,519
altered in its ability to make nodal

433
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:42,000
Roots so we want to see where do nodal

434
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:44,079
Roots form or don't form if they don't

435
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,720
form did they never even start or did

436
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,519
they start in abort what's the Fate

437
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,279
what's controlling what's the morphology

438
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,960
of that so we can actually do in Vivo

439
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:55,200
x-ray Imaging because these are

440
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,558
relatively non-d Den tissues so that's a

441
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,000
living corn plant this is actually we

442
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:01,399
did this last week we're looking at that

443
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,558
region right at the soil line because

444
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,798
Alex is interested in nodal root

445
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:07,240
formation right in those first few nodes

446
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:09,960
right in under the soil and then the

447
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,960
first node above the soil so that's live

448
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,279
Imaging the scan was just seven minutes

449
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,079
long relatively low

450
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:20,519
energy but what it gives us is such

451
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:23,558
incredibly Rich detailed 3D information

452
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:25,759
that Alex this week is looking at Tiff

453
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:27,720
Stacks that go through all this and so

454
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:30,079
he has high resolution data through this

455
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,759
entire complicated region which will now

456
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:35,199
be pretty straightforward for him to

457
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:38,240
evaluate how many and where nodal roots

458
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,480
are or are not between the wild type and

459
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,798
the mutants so this is an example of

460
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,558
what we're doing immediately and and we

461
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:47,200
were fortunate enough to put together a

462
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:51,158
book chapter specifically on phenotyping

463
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,200
using this large format x-ray tomography

464
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:54,559
instrument but of course we're a root

465
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,600
lab we want to know what's going on

466
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:59,798
underground but short of our tornado

467
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,519
it's difficult to just sort of Peel back

468
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:03,079
what's going on to look directly at

469
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,400
what's happening without fundamentally

470
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:08,960
changing exactly what it is we want to

471
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:11,000
measure so we're devising systems to do

472
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,279
insitu imaging of

473
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,400
roots uh and this is what one of those

474
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,480
setups look like it's it's foam core PVC

475
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,000
it's relatively non-dense not the heavy

476
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,759
stuff for for construction but much more

477
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,480
lighter weight for for food and water

478
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:28,158
transport and we use a variety of

479
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,440
diameters um but when you look through

480
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:32,280
it this is an example of a live image

481
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,880
this isn't live but it's it's a a single

482
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:39,200
2D shot of a radaph and it's really hard

483
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,120
to see anything in this kind of view so

484
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,759
we'll take again thousands of images

485
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,639
through the entire volume and then use

486
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:47,158
computer reconstruction to rebuild the

487
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,000
volume so this is a flyth through

488
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:52,440
looking from top to bottom and with our

489
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,759
eyes it's relatively easy to spot the

490
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,440
roots certainly the primary roots and

491
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:58,720
the secondaries but trying to find the

492
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,000
laterals it starts to get more difficult

493
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,240
and that's always going to be the

494
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,440
problem is resolution I'll get to that

495
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,599
shortly but what this allows us to do if

496
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,519
I can see the roots then there is

497
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:12,558
software out there that allows me to

498
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,918
iteratively teach a computer how to find

499
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:17,678
and identify the roots how to identify

500
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:19,440
the soil how do I identify the air how

501
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,840
do I identify the sides of the pot

502
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,720
because I want everything removed except

503
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:27,279
to the roots because if we can do that

504
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,960
now we have effectively a root Crown we

505
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,359
have existing pipelines we can put that

506
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,159
root Crown in situ scan through that

507
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,359
Pipeline and start to pull out 3D root

508
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:37,440
trades

509
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:40,038
so that is the biggest purdle that

510
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,320
anyone in tomography has is segmentation

511
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:45,240
how do you teach a computer to only

512
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:47,158
measure what you want to see and

513
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,679
discount everything else we're getting

514
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:51,919
there I did this particular segmentation

515
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:55,759
but utterly impractically it took me

516
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:57,919
about three weeks for one volume um part

517
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:01,038
of that is the scan size this is about

518
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,679
45 G gabes because you need all that

519
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:04,079
information the more information the

520
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,840
better you can train the model but the

521
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:09,319
slower it goes so if you downsize you

522
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:11,038
now lose the resolution that you need to

523
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:14,720
train a model it's it's a horrible

524
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:17,519
tradeoff so one of the most frequently

525
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,240
asked questions I ever get

526
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,278
is what resolution can be achieved well

527
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,120
on the left on one side is a big pumpkin

528
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:26,798
that's very large on the right is an

529
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:29,079
acorn much much smaller uh the answer of

530
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,599
course is it depends the bigger your

531
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:33,599
sample the lower the resolution that's

532
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:35,278
true for all Imaging and microscopy uh

533
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:38,839
but specifically if we're talking about

534
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:41,200
insitu root Imaging the bigger the pot

535
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:43,798
the more dense the material the lower

536
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,759
the resolution so effectively what we're

537
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:47,879
going to do is choose different pots

538
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,519
based on the biology we want if we just

539
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:53,200
want to see where primary roots go we'll

540
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:54,720
use a big pot we'll never see laterals

541
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,038
to see laterals we have to use a much

542
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,159
smaller diameter but that is as unusual

543
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:00,679
as possible because the roots

544
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:03,080
immediately hit the sides and they

545
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:05,960
bundle up and and so you have to take a

546
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:08,439
variety pack way of approaching

547
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:11,120
different questions so resolution in uh

548
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:14,640
varies inversely with pot

549
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:16,199
diameter um scan time increases with

550
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,919
higher resolution like I said you can

551
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,038
increase the number of projections you

552
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,640
get better

553
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:24,839
resolution but you get gigantic file

554
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,200
sizes at least 40 gigabytes per volume

555
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:27,918
and and that's just a lot of heavy

556
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,600
lifting in addition to the massive

557
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,440
problem that we have have with data

558
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,959
management data storage we've got

559
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,278
hundreds of

560
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,798
terabytes just it it's we're actually I

561
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:41,720
think we're over a petabyte now just

562
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:44,200
with the X-ray stuff um and then what do

563
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,960
you grow the plant in ideally you want

564
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,360
to use field soil but that's really

565
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,720
dense so the more dense something is the

566
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:52,839
lower the resolution because you have to

567
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:55,120
blast more x-ray energy to get through

568
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:57,918
so you use various artificial media

569
00:22:55,119 --> 00:23:00,678
which are less dense but sort of

570
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,520
departing from from a natural field soil

571
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:05,559
so again lots and lots of tradeoffs

572
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:08,599
resolution versus size versus time

573
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:11,158
versus um the growth

574
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:13,240
medium and ultimately we want to get as

575
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:15,480
much as possible we've got this lovely

576
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,960
kelbach volume and the the handdrawn

577
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,919
images are just spectacular but again

578
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,720
we're getting a tiny Glimpse whether

579
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,679
it's excavated root crowns or a little

580
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,440
inue pot that we grow for two or three

581
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,038
weeks it's a proxy for what's actually

582
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,038
happening so we're always dealing with

583
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:33,480
tradeoff so root Imaging we can get lots

584
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:36,519
of useful information and we keep

585
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,319
sneaking up on what's actually happening

586
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:40,839
in in the field but we'll never get

587
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,759
there there's never a physical system

588
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:46,199
where you're going to be able to

589
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:48,240
grow field siiz plants inside the

590
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,278
cabinet of an x-ray chamber it's simply

591
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,960
you simply can't so we have to find as

592
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:55,919
many proxies as possible to inform um

593
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,240
inform what we're

594
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,278
doing the large format instrument does

595
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,400
hit a resolution limit when you want to

596
00:24:00,278 --> 00:24:05,240
see very very fine details and this is

597
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,720
exemplified by this um soybean axillary

598
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,798
bud system so the live imag is on the

599
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,278
the the phone imag is on the left it's

600
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:14,759
about the size of a a dime maybe but

601
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:18,960
it's very complicated it's a

602
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:20,679
very complicated uh intricate structure

603
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,200
lots of different small things going on

604
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:25,519
all in one small space there is no

605
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,399
microscope that will show you what that

606
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:31,599
looks like in 3D if

607
00:24:29,398 --> 00:24:33,798
intact any light microscope you'll have

608
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:35,959
to slice it squash it make it small

609
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:37,960
electron microscopy embed it in resin

610
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,640
and cut the little tiny blocks you'll

611
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,480
never get that intact structure and

612
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,600
that's where the X-ray microscope

613
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,880
absolutely

614
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:47,798
shines so we have this is what the

615
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,039
inside of the system looks like uh again

616
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:52,639
veent and their parent company sum Tomo

617
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:54,919
chemical were very interested in micro

618
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,600
risal fungi root soil microb

619
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:58,679
interactions as well as carbon

620
00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:00,719
sequesteration so they've been uh

621
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,038
generous supporters of the lab uh in

622
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,200
addition to the danor center itself

623
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:08,278
funding a third of of this

624
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,159
instrument and in fact you can see uh by

625
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:12,960
by the labels that there are actually

626
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,000
objective lenses that you swing into The

627
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,640
Beam path in order to magnify some of

628
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,240
the Imaging so it it's important to

629
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,038
compare

630
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,120
um how conventional xray tomography

631
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:26,798
generates an image uh with with the

632
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:28,719
X-ray microscope so recall that

633
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,918
conventional is just basic geomet R of

634
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,038
source sample detector and varying those

635
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,880
distances changes your magnification and

636
00:25:34,038 --> 00:25:37,119
your

637
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,120
resolution the X-ray microscope you

638
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:41,918
still also have an x-ray source which

639
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,959
projects x-rays through a sample but

640
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,640
what that does is the x-rays strike a

641
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,960
scintillator the scintillator converts

642
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,278
x-rays into light and that's mounted on

643
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,960
the front of an objective lens so that's

644
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:55,679
where you get the cator X-ray to light

645
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,399
mounted on the lens and that's how you

646
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,360
generate the 3D image it's un

647
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:02,239
fortunately for the lab based systems a

648
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:04,839
relatively inefficient process so the

649
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,558
scan times take much much longer again

650
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:09,759
always trade-offs but what you're able

651
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:11,440
to get out the other end is uh I never

652
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:13,119
get tired of it every single day I come

653
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,519
in I get to see something that no one on

654
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:18,599
the planet has seen before and often

655
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:22,038
it's just stunning so if we look at this

656
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:24,439
um uh the soybean axial Bud typically

657
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:26,319
it's fixed and contrast enhanced so it's

658
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,880
not typically live Imaging but with a

659
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:29,720
large format instrument this is about as

660
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,720
good as you get to look at it with the

661
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:35,558
X-ray microscope you just get a

662
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:38,880
different Universe of

663
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:42,359
data I've seen beautiful paintings and

664
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:45,440
drawings of of plant Anatomy throughout

665
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:47,158
my entire career but it was not until I

666
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,399
sat down at the workstation and saw my

667
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:52,159
first soybean fluet scan when I

668
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:54,759
actually

669
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,960
appreciated how the anthers are

670
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:59,240
distributed in 3D space right around the

671
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,880
stigmatic surface and how principle that

672
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:06,558
was but you never get that in 3D but

673
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,440
here you do developing ovules there

674
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,440
pollen packed anthers distributed right

675
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,840
around the reproductive surface it is

676
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,399
Contra it is fixed and contrast enhanced

677
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:17,000
so the only way you can do sort of

678
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:19,759
Developmental studies is if you fix them

679
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,960
over developmental time so Time and

680
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:25,519
Relative Dimension in Space for any

681
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,000
Doctor Who fans

682
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:29,720
Tardis um is is part of of what we have

683
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,240
to to try to get developmental series

684
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:35,120
using this this uh imaging

685
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,359
technology um I was talking to Margaret

686
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:39,918
earlier about how striking some of the

687
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,759
3D volumes are they're very impactful

688
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,440
but not necessarily scientifically

689
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:47,879
useful other than putting Zooms in

690
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,038
context of the whole organ but what

691
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,399
those 3D volumes represent is what we

692
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:56,000
call a flyth through you're looking at

693
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:58,599
an arbitrary Dimension slice by slice

694
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,240
and seeing every single angle through

695
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:03,798
this very complicated structure in very

696
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:07,278
high resolution Rich detail you can do

697
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:09,240
cell level resolution in a 3D space

698
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:11,200
using this kind of Imaging again it has

699
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,278
to be fixed and contrast enhanced and on

700
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,679
the side there are some pretty typical

701
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:17,880
contrast agents which with my background

702
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:21,679
in electron microscopy are routinely

703
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:24,480
used phosphotungstic acid iodine osmium

704
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,000
um yanic stadler's lab in 2013 was the

705
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,839
first one to publish any kind of survey

706
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,038
using a a lab based x-ray microscope and

707
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:33,278
they looked at a few different plant

708
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:37,240
samples and we use that as a jumping off

709
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:39,398
point to really expand what they first

710
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,480
introduced and really explore a wider

711
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:45,079
range of of plant samples and improved

712
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,919
instrument technology so yanx lab was

713
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:48,678
the one who started it and we sort of

714
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:52,320
benefited from their pioneering work to

715
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:55,519
really Branch out into into other things

716
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:58,158
um it's also very important um I was

717
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:00,200
telling Lynn earlier that I went to a

718
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:03,000
Botanical microscopy conference where

719
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,679
everybody there was a plant scientist

720
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,558
and an Imaging specialist so a pretty

721
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:09,360
rare group all of them knew who I was

722
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:11,000
they'd seen the papers in fact we

723
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:13,759
recognize each other on the plane over

724
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,159
this is at at the John inis Center they

725
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:18,119
knew what was going on they read the

726
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:19,840
paper but they still didn't get it until

727
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:21,879
I actually stood in front of them like

728
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,558
this and showed them the animations and

729
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,440
showed them how a sample gets presented

730
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:29,079
to the instrument before they could

731
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,360
realize what was possible so I want to

732
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:32,720
really spend some time showing you how

733
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,479
samples are prepared and how they're

734
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,240
presented to the instrument so you

735
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,679
understand the tremendous value of the

736
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,079
Imaging data that comes out the other

737
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:43,159
end so around the Dan forest center we

738
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:45,000
do not have a corporate lawn we have an

739
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:46,880
authentic Missouri Prairie which is

740
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,119
fantastic although the neighbors

741
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,120
complained that when are you going to

742
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:52,719
cut your lawn they just didn't get it um

743
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:55,239
now it's beautiful wild flowers and it's

744
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,038
much more mature but we have a scapus we

745
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,000
have milked everywhere so it was a great

746
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:00,720
example to illustrate

747
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,200
the the step-by-step process so if you

748
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,000
want to look at something again this is

749
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,759
about the size of a you'd cover that

750
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,519
with a

751
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:11,398
nickel large complicated flour that goes

752
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:13,319
into in this case uh an ethanolic

753
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:15,439
solution of phosphotungstic acid the

754
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:17,678
ethanol gets past all the hydrophobicity

755
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,080
of a plant sample and penetrates very

756
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,320
very well although it takes weeks this

757
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:24,599
is minimum about 21 days for the

758
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:27,119
phosphotungstic acid to penetrate and to

759
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:29,558
contrast well and then how do you

760
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:32,038
present this really delicate flimsy

761
00:30:29,558 --> 00:30:35,319
tissue paper like thing to a microscope

762
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:36,960
for 12 hours and not have it move around

763
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:40,000
low melting point

764
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,079
auros in all of our Labs we have plastic

765
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,240
tubes of a wide range of sizes so you

766
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:46,720
pick the tube that fits it best fill it

767
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,960
with melt and auros drop in your sample

768
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,440
after a quick rinse and it holds that

769
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,120
delicate complicated structure in place

770
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,759
for a long Imaging

771
00:30:53,119 --> 00:31:00,079
scan and what you're able to do is

772
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:02,240
generate again very very rich 3D volumes

773
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:04,398
where you can do multiscale imaging

774
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,599
without leaving the samples so low

775
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:08,599
magnification scan of the whole thing

776
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:10,759
identify a region of interest and then

777
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:13,278
zoom in for a higher resolution

778
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:14,480
scan never having touched the sample you

779
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:17,919
just leave it in the instrument and let

780
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,639
the computer do the work um again the 3D

781
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,360
Volume rendering has a great impact for

782
00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:24,359
for getting people to remember what

783
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:26,759
we're able to do to illustrate the

784
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:28,918
multiscale Imaging putting a high mag

785
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:31,798
region of Interest within the context of

786
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:34,278
the whole thing but much more impactful

787
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:37,319
is the flyth through you get that cell

788
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:40,319
level resolution of the entire structure

789
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:42,398
but totally shocking to me the beautiful

790
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:44,439
symmetry of the sample itself just

791
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:46,678
looking I get mesmerized watching this

792
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:49,320
movie and and it just makes me think of

793
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:52,440
spy graphs growing

794
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:54,119
up so a lot of the the the volumes I'm

795
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,278
going to show you will have the 3D

796
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:59,599
Volume rendering followed by the fly

797
00:31:56,278 --> 00:32:02,720
through to to impress upon you how data

798
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:06,278
Rich these volumes are um this is from a

799
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,519
paper we published in 22 um looking at

800
00:32:06,278 --> 00:32:10,079
uh nodule

801
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:13,278
formation these are our soybean nodules

802
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:15,079
formed by um Brady rium and again the

803
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:17,159
multiscale nature we can zoom in on

804
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:18,879
individual bacteroids and then put that

805
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:22,720
Zoom scan within the context of the

806
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:25,320
whole nodule where all the bids and the

807
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,440
vasculature are really really easy to

808
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:28,960
visualize and again with a competent

809
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,159
comput AAL

810
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,360
scientist you can identify all these

811
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:35,360
features once they're computationally

812
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:37,558
identified you can measure them and

813
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:39,439
start to then compare these measurements

814
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:41,480
between nodules between time points

815
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,600
between varieties you now have

816
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,798
measurements to go along with these with

817
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:48,439
these phenotypes and Gus did a great job

818
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:52,200
um segmenting

819
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:53,880
this um some of the other ranges of

820
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,000
studies we look at again that the Dan

821
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,720
for Center is very um well positioned to

822
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,880
look at Food security crops and TEF is

823
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,440
one of them it's very popular in Eastern

824
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,440
Africa great salt tolerance great for

825
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,798
Drought lousy agronomic traits a very

826
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:12,519
willowy stock and shattering is very

827
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:14,960
very bad the seeds quite understandably

828
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:16,480
want to disperse as easily as possible

829
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,639
but that's lousy if you want to actually

830
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,319
collect the seeds for Harvest so

831
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:22,798
shattering is a trait we wanted to get

832
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:24,798
rid of so the seed would stay put so the

833
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:28,038
Growers could Harvest and shattering is

834
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:30,359
a trait that we studied here again in 3D

835
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:33,960
uh in ways with intact samples that you

836
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:37,359
can't do just by embedding and

837
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:39,360
sectioning um luciia was a postto in

838
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:41,079
Malia gan's lab she's now across the

839
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:43,359
street at buer she's got a great job

840
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:46,918
there but she developed some mutants in

841
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:49,638
quinoa that showed some very good heat

842
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:52,320
tolerance and it's the inflorescent

843
00:33:49,638 --> 00:33:54,519
structures and the pollination timing

844
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:57,558
which is often most bad negatively

845
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:59,519
affected by by heat stress so what we

846
00:33:57,558 --> 00:34:02,319
want want to be able to do is first map

847
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,038
out in 3D what does normal look like the

848
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:06,119
normal complicated inflorescent

849
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:08,800
structure and then if you blast it with

850
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:10,519
heat how does that change the structure

851
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,760
and then if you have a heat tolerant

852
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:16,480
mutant how does it survive that all to

853
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,960
inform what heat tolerance genes can we

854
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,320
get our hands on how can we improve all

855
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,639
these different plant varieties by

856
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,399
identifying the genes that that are most

857
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:28,720
important and again the 2D flythroughs

858
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,559
just provide so much Rich detailed

859
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,279
information you can measure things now

860
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,960
you can answer questions using these

861
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,159
data you couldn't even ask before doing

862
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,760
this kind of work so it's really really

863
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:42,280
powerful

864
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:44,679
um will will Viana is got some great

865
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,480
Sater mutants he works in in Jose Den's

866
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:49,320
Lab at Stanford and they have some

867
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,119
mutants that are altered in their

868
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:55,919
ability to make uh root primordia in

869
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,880
sataria so what we're able to do is scan

870
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,440
the entire Nole that really important

871
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,000
Junction at the soil line where all the

872
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:07,440
vascular is coming together and look for

873
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,679
the origin or not of of root primordia

874
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,320
again a 3D Volume is great for context

875
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:13,799
but the power comes from the 2D slices

876
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,400
what they're going to be able to do is

877
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,920
segment every single cell measure and

878
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,519
map every single cell in the wild type

879
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,960
and the mutant and compare all those

880
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:25,599
measurements that is just a Priceless

881
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:29,639
way to get at phenotypic information

882
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,640
where you can link to sequence VAR

883
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,039
uh the top lab is getting into more

884
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:37,040
cover crop biology because of its its

885
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:38,920
potential for aiding soil health and of

886
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,559
course cover crops make beautiful

887
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:44,000
nodules great for nitrogen management to

888
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:46,960
what degree can we use multiscale xray

889
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,639
microscopy Imaging to inform nodule

890
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,679
development um again situating the high

891
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:54,318
magnification scan within the the full

892
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:56,639
3d volume is cool but the data the real

893
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:59,639
information comes from these 2D

894
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:59,639
slices

895
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:03,799
uh this is plant biology I'm not allowed

896
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:06,039
to get away without showing something

897
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,680
arabidopsis related so these are

898
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:12,199
developing a Rabbid opsis seeds inside

899
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:15,199
of selik um again just to illustrate the

900
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:17,078
the unique data that is available using

901
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:19,598
this kind of imaging

902
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:21,440
technology this is for Margaret this is

903
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,920
one of her samples that she left with me

904
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,200
before she left the Dan forest center

905
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,838
this is a two we old tomato seedling um

906
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:30,199
it's a flyth through but again what it's

907
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:33,078
telling you is if you're interested in

908
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:35,559
graft biology and graft whether it will

909
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:37,160
take or not graph compatibility this

910
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:39,119
will give you a road map of the

911
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:41,639
vasculature if you have a competent

912
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,160
computational scientist to map all the

913
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:45,358
vasculature but this is something you

914
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:49,118
have available

915
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:51,078
now sataria shoot apical marem again now

916
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,680
just examples all the different kinds of

917
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:56,640
biological tissue in 3D that we have

918
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:58,960
access to Young arabid Ops of seedlings

919
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:01,318
you want to do Fen in of an entire

920
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:05,240
structure this is

921
00:37:01,318 --> 00:37:09,519
available um developing sataria panicles

922
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:11,279
um anything that used to be 3D with or

923
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,920
us used to be with scanning electron

924
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,280
microscopy where you just get a 2d

925
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:19,760
photograph of a really cool 3D structure

926
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:21,800
you now have a full 3D map inside

927
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:25,240
outside upside and down any angle you

928
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,240
want to go through you have the 3D

929
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:29,199
information uh again important to sort

930
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:30,599
of remind you and point out the

931
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:33,000
different ways in which samples are

932
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:36,200
presented to the microscope it helps to

933
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,960
understand what the geometry is to see

934
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:41,039
how will it or perhaps won't it apply to

935
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,838
the kinds of questions I want to ask you

936
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:45,639
wouldn't put an ear of corn in there as

937
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:47,039
such but certainly a kernel it does have

938
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:48,519
the capacity for large things and I'll

939
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,440
show you that later but there's a range

940
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:52,920
of things that we can put in here so

941
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,440
this was uh a soybean root nodule it's

942
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,639
it's suspended in

943
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,480
auros uh we looked at uh Penny crest is

944
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:01,838
a very popular cover crop these days

945
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,679
we're working on uh with a company

946
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:05,880
called cover Crest at the Dan for Center

947
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:07,960
to breed Penny Crest to take advantage

948
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,599
of the agronomic traits and these are

949
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,960
dry seeds they're just sort of wedged in

950
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,440
the end of a pipet tip with poster putty

951
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,280
all sorts of creative ways just to

952
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,880
present your samples to the X-ray beam

953
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,599
and of course resin embeded resin

954
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,358
embedded plant tissue is is going to be

955
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:23,838
a main stay of what we do certainly for

956
00:38:22,358 --> 00:38:26,400
volume

957
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:28,838
em uh we do have a flat panel in the

958
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,639
instrument we can do in Vivo root

959
00:38:28,838 --> 00:38:33,480
Imaging so again we grow plants in these

960
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:35,559
PVC pipes this flat panel will allow us

961
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:38,039
to map the entire root structure at high

962
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:39,799
resolution in this case 26 micrometer

963
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:42,039
voxal resolution you'll definitely get

964
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,400
laterals with that and then if you find

965
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:45,960
a region of Interest swap in one of the

966
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,639
objective lenses and look at high

967
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,920
resolution High mag at a region of

968
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:52,559
interest uh we're hoping to use this

969
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,559
system now to adapt to looking at micro

970
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:56,000
risal fungi in these larger systems and

971
00:38:54,559 --> 00:39:00,440
I'll show some of the earlier work we

972
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,280
did with that uh shortly um I'm often

973
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,800
asked about phase contrast Imaging

974
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,079
certainly from the synchrotron folks

975
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,599
because phase can be very powerful at a

976
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,839
synchrotron when you're dealing with

977
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:13,280
samples of low uh low density and low

978
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:15,838
differential density we do have the

979
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,319
capacity to do phase contrast Imaging in

980
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:21,960
our system but we take a big hit in

981
00:39:18,318 --> 00:39:23,639
resolution um and Zeiss does develop uh

982
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,519
they've developed some AI tools to help

983
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:28,480
sort of clean up the noise that is

984
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:30,480
expected but still

985
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,559
this was a sample this was a a soybean

986
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,280
flower that was only fixed in ethanol

987
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:37,039
that immediately imaged no contrast

988
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:39,160
agent so it's possible to do imaging but

989
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:41,880
clearly you take a big hit in what you

990
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:43,679
can see relative to uh to contrast

991
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:47,280
enhanced

992
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:49,279
material a lot of my goal is to get more

993
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,319
people to think about and to take

994
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,839
advantage of of this technology and this

995
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:55,358
is actually a white paper that's that's

996
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:58,119
free to download you can go to the Zeiss

997
00:39:55,358 --> 00:40:00,400
website and download this uh it tells a

998
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:02,880
lot of the nuts and bolts of the methods

999
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,240
and the sample development for doing

1000
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,800
x-ray microscopy specifically for plant

1001
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:09,159
samples

1002
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,640
because many plant scientists have

1003
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:13,279
access to core facilities but don't know

1004
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:15,159
how to present the sample to it core

1005
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,200
facilities have x-ray microscopes they

1006
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:20,078
never work with plant SS I'm hoping that

1007
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:21,719
the Publications that we have will will

1008
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,440
bring a lot of that together and really

1009
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:29,318
expand what everyone is in a position to

1010
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:29,318
do um with with x-ray imag

1011
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,119
little over a year ago nature came out

1012
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:41,078
with Technologies to watch in 2023 and

1013
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:43,680
volume em volume electron microscopy is

1014
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:46,280
one of them and that is using

1015
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:48,838
various um electron microscopes where

1016
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:51,000
one can do physical sectioning in order

1017
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:53,639
to generate a 3D Volume at the nanometer

1018
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,318
scale so there's serial block face

1019
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:57,799
scanning electron microscopes where you

1020
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:59,318
have an actual physical microtome inside

1021
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,760
the instrument so you'll take a Diamond

1022
00:40:59,318 --> 00:41:04,440
Knife you'll cut one section image cut

1023
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,599
image and get maybe

1024
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:10,720
hundreds and you can get down to about

1025
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:13,318
50 60 nanometer in in section thickness

1026
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:15,799
the other alternative is is a plasma

1027
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:19,440
focused ion beam where you can actually

1028
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:21,119
use a laser to ablate the surface image

1029
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,880
ablate image and you can get down to

1030
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,559
about five or 10 nanometer section

1031
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,559
thickness so you can generate a

1032
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:29,239
beautiful 3D Volume at the organella

1033
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:31,559
scale and so volume em is something we

1034
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:34,759
want to use as a road map to

1035
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:37,039
drive volume em so what that looks like

1036
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,240
here's a sample of actually a tobacco

1037
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:41,599
leaf disc embedded in

1038
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:43,078
resin mounted in the X-ray microscope

1039
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,200
and we'll do a scan of the entire Leaf

1040
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:47,440
disc to get a road map and then you

1041
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:50,399
bring in some of the world's

1042
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,639
leading plant tissue specific Imaging

1043
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,760
folks this is Kirk zimic he was a postto

1044
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:56,159
in lab I was at a Dupont he's now the

1045
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,560
director of The Imaging facility at the

1046
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:01,799
danforce center

1047
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:03,920
and it's never just the instruments he's

1048
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,640
got some of the most talented

1049
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,800
microscopists in the world working with

1050
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:09,598
some of the best instruments on the

1051
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,519
planet so you bring expertise and

1052
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,359
instrumentation together and and what

1053
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:16,719
you can do is astounding so uh NASA

1054
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:18,279
genri and Lolita are just are brilliant

1055
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:21,598
so we're able to do some marvelous

1056
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:23,920
things um so this is a flyth through of

1057
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:25,720
the low magnification X-Ray Scan through

1058
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,720
the tobacco leaf

1059
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:32,078
dis and what Kirk and his team did was

1060
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:33,519
take my 3D scan and identify in green

1061
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,440
this region of

1062
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:38,039
interest and

1063
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,400
so we worked together I took the sample

1064
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:42,759
back and then did a much higher

1065
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:45,200
magnification scan of that region of

1066
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,160
Interest take the data hand it back over

1067
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:48,919
to them and they use it as a road map

1068
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:52,239
and they want to look at just these

1069
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:55,920
misil sections of misil cells indicated

1070
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:59,358
by the yellow box here and so that went

1071
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,920
actually to the um the sem which had a

1072
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:02,799
back scatter electron detector which you

1073
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,240
can actually use to invert the black and

1074
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,440
white and it looks like a

1075
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:10,078
tem that region of interest and then

1076
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,519
using their technology they zoom in on

1077
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,039
features that they want to look at like

1078
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,719
the purple box

1079
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:18,279
there and with serial block face Imaging

1080
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:20,199
they went zooming through this region

1081
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:23,440
and I think they collected about 250 or

1082
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:26,799
300 uh sections each as it indicates 50

1083
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:29,760
nmet thick and again you have a 3D

1084
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,559
Volume volum at very very high nanometer

1085
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,640
scale resolutions so again computational

1086
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:36,400
science is everything a good

1087
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:40,078
computational scientists now can

1088
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:42,200
identify and measure individual features

1089
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,760
so that you can see and measure

1090
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:47,000
distribution in 3D space total volume

1091
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:50,559
amount different changes uh everything

1092
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,199
is now measurable and accessible again

1093
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:54,359
the publication is out there the

1094
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:56,239
information is out there please please

1095
00:43:54,358 --> 00:44:00,519
look into it as something that you might

1096
00:43:56,239 --> 00:44:02,759
want to take advantage of um it is there

1097
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:04,679
uh I promised some specific work on what

1098
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,160
we're doing with mro risal

1099
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:09,558
fungi um most of you I'm sure understand

1100
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:12,000
that micro risal fungi form beneficial

1101
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:14,880
interactions with most plant roots in

1102
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,920
the in in the world they exchange

1103
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,160
nutrients and water with the plant for

1104
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,079
photosynthe photosynthetic sugars

1105
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:23,440
beneficial relationship for

1106
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:26,000
both from an Imaging standpoint we're

1107
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,519
interested in the purple bits all the

1108
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,960
fungal structures that are out in the

1109
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:31,759
soil that colonize the root and then

1110
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,599
start this nutrient exchange there has

1111
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:37,559
been some genuinely

1112
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:40,960
spectacular scientific research looking

1113
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:43,119
at the genes that play roles in

1114
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,800
governing these relationships the the

1115
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:47,680
the exchange of carbon who's benefiting

1116
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,000
Who's Cheating who's holding up their

1117
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:51,879
end of the bargain there's some really

1118
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,440
fantastic work that's been done all in

1119
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,800
vitro um there's been some great Imaging

1120
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,920
work Jen mol's at uh she's finishing her

1121
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,280
pH HD at Cambridge and she designed this

1122
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,119
beautiful microscope slide where the

1123
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,119
plant grows on the edge and you can

1124
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:08,000
train a single root that comes out

1125
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:11,599
between two glass slides very elegant

1126
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,599
you can do great Imaging work um and in

1127
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,318
real time do Dynamic Imaging work with a

1128
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,160
lot of the the fluorescent tools

1129
00:45:15,318 --> 00:45:21,239
available but it's always in vitro this

1130
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:22,519
is a difficult system to look at to

1131
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:24,799
understand how these things are

1132
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:28,318
naturally distributed in as sort of

1133
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:31,079
natural a system as you can energ

1134
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:33,480
engineer the hyy are transparent they're

1135
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:36,559
difficult to see these are a pack of hyy

1136
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:40,039
just stuck in auros at the bottom of a

1137
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:42,440
tube so how do we make these transparent

1138
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:44,159
structures contrasty enough to see with

1139
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,400
with the electron microscope with with

1140
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:48,639
the X-ray

1141
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:52,400
microscope and so we I we look back at

1142
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:54,799
our experience with using uh x-ray

1143
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:57,680
micros using electron microscopy and

1144
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,920
making things contrasty so osmium is is

1145
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:01,919
is clearly something that although

1146
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,838
challenging to work with is very very

1147
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,280
effective at making transparent things

1148
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:08,000
contrasty so with our invitro carrot

1149
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,559
root culture we were able to very

1150
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,318
clearly show that that the fungal

1151
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:14,599
structures both inside and outside the

1152
00:46:11,318 --> 00:46:16,119
roots were very well contrasted so we

1153
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:18,720
applied that to what we're calling a

1154
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:22,079
microcosm we can grow Alfalfa or braap

1155
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:23,679
podium in small 20 mil syringe barrels

1156
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,160
Roots will be

1157
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:28,399
colonized uh fungal structures will grow

1158
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:31,480
out into the Sur surounding medium and

1159
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,039
we can contrast them and image them so

1160
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:37,920
what you're seeing here in

1161
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:40,199
Orange is uh fungal spores and vesicles

1162
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,039
both inside and outside the root in the

1163
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:44,960
surrounding growth Medium as well as

1164
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:48,719
intra radical hyy and extra radical hyy

1165
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:50,960
so we've demonstrated this can be done

1166
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:52,439
um I'm going to speed up a little bit

1167
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:56,000
just to make sure we get through in time

1168
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,240
for questions um again at the Dan for

1169
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,440
Center we're surrounded by some

1170
00:46:57,239 --> 00:47:02,199
fantastic scientists and Armando's got

1171
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,920
great experience in Michael risal

1172
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:06,598
biology so he's developed a braap Podium

1173
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,880
system along with his with his senior

1174
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:13,160
Tech uh Mallette and so we're using that

1175
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:14,760
to look at colonization again in these

1176
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:17,440
microcosms

1177
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:19,000
how the better the Imaging the more

1178
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,760
successful we can actually train a

1179
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,800
computer model to identify the features

1180
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,599
we want to see so everything in yellow

1181
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,440
here is both internal spores as well as

1182
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:30,640
V

1183
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:33,200
inside a root we can quantify the amount

1184
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:35,639
of fungus that's inside a colonized root

1185
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:37,799
in situ so now this opens up some some

1186
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:40,519
really huge Avenues to start exploring

1187
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,960
basic biology to what degree can we

1188
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:46,679
quantify fungal

1189
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:48,240
biomass in a given genotypic interaction

1190
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:50,318
particular maze genotype particular

1191
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:53,959
braap Podium genotype how does that

1192
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:55,440
normal change with less phosphorus more

1193
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,440
phosphorus more nitrogen how can we

1194
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,440
change the environment and alter these

1195
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,760
measurable traits um we're also

1196
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:05,720
exploring other things in addition to uh

1197
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:08,079
osmium to see can we get away from a a

1198
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:09,558
heavy volatile toxic heavy metal as

1199
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,640
something to to visualize fungal

1200
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:13,280
structures so we're looking at at

1201
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:15,639
nanogold conjugates we can always

1202
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,319
conjugate things to to fungal structures

1203
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:19,000
can we stick enough gold particles on it

1204
00:48:17,318 --> 00:48:21,558
to be able to see with the X-ray

1205
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,838
microscope and of course we're prepping

1206
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:26,400
um a methods

1207
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:29,639
manuscript uh I'm going to wrap up with

1208
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,920
with a switch from the plant the roots

1209
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:33,279
and the fungi to actually the medium

1210
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,680
within which within which they're

1211
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,880
growing and that's the soil with the two

1212
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:38,480
instruments we can do a lot of

1213
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,160
multiscale Imaging so we can use the

1214
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,960
X-ray microscope to look at the

1215
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:44,719
microbial scale we can look at soil

1216
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,800
Aggregates and and again I was telling

1217
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:51,199
Lynn you know we're constantly learning

1218
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:53,839
new techniques and new Fields um I've

1219
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:56,159
had to learn soil uh physics over the

1220
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:59,159
past couple years and soil science so

1221
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:01,318
I've learned that the aggregate is

1222
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:03,558
essentially the lowest the smallest

1223
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:06,318
currency of agricultural soil if you

1224
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:08,200
took a shovel and scoop big agricultural

1225
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:11,519
soil and just shook it around the

1226
00:49:08,199 --> 00:49:13,838
smallest naturally occurring size of

1227
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:15,960
Chunk that comes out is a soil Aggregate

1228
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:17,719
and the size and the stability of that

1229
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:21,240
aggregate tells you a lot about the soil

1230
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:22,798
health so we can look at uh the actual

1231
00:49:21,239 --> 00:49:25,558
structure of soil aggregate with the

1232
00:49:22,798 --> 00:49:28,838
X-ray microscope and then we can look at

1233
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:30,680
a soil core from the same area put the

1234
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:32,279
context of the aggregate into the core

1235
00:49:30,679 --> 00:49:34,199
and then the core into the field so

1236
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,119
across scales we can study a lot about

1237
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:37,879
the

1238
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,680
structure of of actual agricultural soil

1239
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:42,039
we've got some great collaborators at

1240
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:43,480
Kate uh Chuck Rice's lab has been around

1241
00:49:42,039 --> 00:49:45,679
for decades and

1242
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,480
Carlos uh was spearheading this work as

1243
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:50,798
a PhD student he's actually he's just

1244
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:53,199
finished um and then Cody Mae Sarah and

1245
00:49:50,798 --> 00:49:56,318
Clara are the the Dan for scientists who

1246
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:57,879
are working on this as well and we're

1247
00:49:56,318 --> 00:50:00,239
comp comparing it to what would be a

1248
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:02,960
gold standard the kza Prairie it's about

1249
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:05,318
3500 hectares of undisturbed Tall Grass

1250
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,679
Prairie in eastern

1251
00:50:05,318 --> 00:50:10,719
Kansas and so what we want to ask is

1252
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:14,239
what can we learn about the 3D structure

1253
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:17,078
of soil across scales so Chuck's lab has

1254
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:19,000
been monitoring and managing some

1255
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:21,160
research fields for now over 34

1256
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,159
consecutive years they've been using no

1257
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:25,480
till compared to Conventional tillage

1258
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:28,279
they've been using conventional chemical

1259
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:30,599
fertilizer uh compared to using a high

1260
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:33,200
organic manure as a fertilizer so they

1261
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:35,318
collected soil cores and soil Aggregates

1262
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:36,480
and sent them to us for Imaging from all

1263
00:50:35,318 --> 00:50:38,679
these different

1264
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,159
treatments so this is a typical soil

1265
00:50:38,679 --> 00:50:43,039
core inside the large format x-ray

1266
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:45,719
instrument and and a typical image of

1267
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:47,358
what you'll see uh we subsampled the

1268
00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:48,879
middle to avoid some of the cracking

1269
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:50,798
artifacts on the side because we want to

1270
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:54,000
measure pore space those cracks are

1271
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:56,199
obviously going to to bias things

1272
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,079
um and so what we're doing and this is

1273
00:50:56,199 --> 00:51:02,199
work in progress um we're using these

1274
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:05,039
very high resolution 3D scans of a core

1275
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:06,639
to map out pore space can we

1276
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:08,519
differentiate between poor space and

1277
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:10,719
soil organic matter mostly the answer is

1278
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:12,119
no and this was always shocking to me

1279
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:13,439
I've gone to soil science meetings where

1280
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:14,838
everyone's saying here's all the poror

1281
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,880
space and here's all the soil organic

1282
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:19,440
material they've never seen the X-ray

1283
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,400
scans where the overlap is way too much

1284
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,960
to actually differentiate the two so

1285
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,798
they're losing a great deal so we're

1286
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,920
we've turned Ma Lee loose on this

1287
00:51:25,798 --> 00:51:29,400
problem so if anyone solve it she can

1288
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,559
but we're trying to map out what are the

1289
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,318
differences that we can observe

1290
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,839
structurally between the different field

1291
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:35,838
management

1292
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:38,119
practices and then drop down to a

1293
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:41,358
smaller scale look at an entire soil

1294
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:44,000
aggregate again map out the POR space

1295
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:46,199
map out the organic material and look at

1296
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,838
that over scale to what degree does the

1297
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:52,798
POR space map in the aggregate compare

1298
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:55,838
or not to the equivalent treatment but

1299
00:51:52,798 --> 00:51:57,798
at a larger scale in a soil core is one

1300
00:51:55,838 --> 00:52:00,719
predictive of the what can we learn

1301
00:51:57,798 --> 00:52:02,440
across scales um we've embedded some of

1302
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:04,118
the Aggregates in resin and we'd like to

1303
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:06,559
we've sent some samples off from x-ray

1304
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:09,000
fluorescence and ideally maybe work with

1305
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:11,079
a synchrotron to do some some Zanes to

1306
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,400
look at very subtle differences and and

1307
00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:16,599
Elemental mapping uh but then also we

1308
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:18,599
could use these for for volume electron

1309
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:20,160
microscopy and again that's so that's

1310
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:22,000
what some of this is the work is ongoing

1311
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:24,279
we want to compare soil pore networks

1312
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,039
across these treatments we have an

1313
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:29,319
elementar um Mass Spec system in the lab

1314
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:31,279
so we can look at and measure absolute

1315
00:52:29,318 --> 00:52:33,519
amount of carbon absolute amount of

1316
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,519
nitrogen uh and and Cody's really the

1317
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:39,599
one heading up um this manuscript and

1318
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:42,000
that was I could Lynn knows I could talk

1319
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,960
for hours but I won't I will spare you

1320
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,199
and I will stop here and happily take

1321
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:50,079
any questions so we're checking the chat

1322
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:53,159
to see if there are um questions from

1323
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:57,318
online otherwise we'll look here in the

1324
00:52:53,159 --> 00:52:58,838
room yes really great presentation

1325
00:52:57,318 --> 00:53:01,000
I was just wondering if this allow you

1326
00:52:58,838 --> 00:53:03,639
to see at a cellular level or is it more

1327
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,798
struct so the question is um can we get

1328
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:08,159
to the cellular level and the answer is

1329
00:53:05,798 --> 00:53:11,280
yes typically the samples have to be

1330
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:14,879
smaller but for example this sataria uh

1331
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:17,240
nodal plexus that sample was maybe 3

1332
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,838
millimeters tall by a millimeter in

1333
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:22,639
diameter easily achieving cellular

1334
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:23,679
resolution there with the soybean uh

1335
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:26,199
developing

1336
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:28,239
flowers you can see the entire structure

1337
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:30,159
but we could zoom in onto the developing

1338
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:32,399
ovules we could see synergids we could

1339
00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:35,399
see polar nuclei so it is possible to

1340
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:37,200
see at the cellular level in that regard

1341
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,960
a lot of them a lot of these cells in

1342
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:42,239
the plants are actually quite large um

1343
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:45,480
so a lot of the stock segments a lot of

1344
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:47,078
the grafting stuff um a lot of the

1345
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,880
inflorescence development there's a lot

1346
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:51,480
of complicated material there but is

1347
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:54,119
relatively large so we can achieve

1348
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:57,559
cellular level resolution there um the

1349
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:59,720
root nodules were another one um but at

1350
00:53:57,559 --> 00:54:02,200
the same time keep in mind that this is

1351
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:04,679
just a microscope the most powerful lens

1352
00:54:02,199 --> 00:54:06,879
we have is just 40x and even your

1353
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:09,960
tabletop microscope you multiply that by

1354
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:12,519
10 times from the ocular lens we just

1355
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:16,039
have a 40x lens so you will never see a

1356
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:17,480
bacterial cell you will see a bacteroid

1357
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:19,358
which is essentially a plant host cell

1358
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:22,760
that's been sort of taken over you will

1359
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:25,880
not see a bacterial cell we can see AMF

1360
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,760
spores if they're contrasted um it's

1361
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:29,200
difficult to differentiate the Hy if

1362
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,640
they're there unless they've got a ton

1363
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:34,759
of osmium on them so that's sort of the

1364
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:39,199
the the Fade Out

1365
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:41,480
range how how rapidly how rapidly um can

1366
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:43,399
you screen the little tubes with the

1367
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,920
braap podium micro

1368
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:47,400
isal fungi that were in there is that

1369
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,119
does that take a long time to do that

1370
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,400
scan yeah so the question is about the

1371
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:54,200
the microcosms looking at braap podium

1372
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:56,440
um and and also alphalpha how quickly

1373
00:54:54,199 --> 00:54:59,439
can we scan those so what I'll end up

1374
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:02,240
doing is I can do a relatively short

1375
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,159
scan which is 3 to four hours but that

1376
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:06,759
shows me the entire

1377
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:10,118
microcosm low resolution but enough for

1378
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:12,520
me to see the bright spots of fungal

1379
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:14,440
material and then I'll set up a a higher

1380
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:17,519
magnification scan that will be 10 to 12

1381
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:20,000
hours at least so those scans are quite

1382
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:23,038
long it's not good for high throughput

1383
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,519
or even medium throughput but it is

1384
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:27,480
genuinely unique in being able to see

1385
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:31,519
the distribution of mic risal structures

1386
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:34,318
in 3D in an undisturbed insitu rig it's

1387
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:37,000
not the field but no one else is in a

1388
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:40,000
position to do this kind of of 3D Inu

1389
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:43,599
Imaging and are you flooding that whole

1390
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,000
um syringe with OS yes and we're also

1391
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:47,559
taking advantage of the fact that osmia

1392
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,079
has a great uh Vapor potential so you

1393
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:52,400
can use osmium Vapors to also contrast

1394
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:54,160
material but the other benefit of that

1395
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,559
syringe barrel system is it's got a lure

1396
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:58,519
lock and so I can lock that I can parap

1397
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,480
film the crap out of these things and

1398
00:55:58,519 --> 00:56:03,239
make sure that it's very very well

1399
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,798
contained um what I am doing right now

1400
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:08,798
is I've got some some microcolumns that

1401
00:56:05,798 --> 00:56:11,318
I flooded with uh ethanolic phosphonic

1402
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:12,719
acid I had done in vitro that's

1403
00:56:11,318 --> 00:56:14,639
beautiful you can see individual

1404
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:17,519
arbuscules it's fantastic but it takes

1405
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:19,358
weeks and weeks so I've set these up it

1406
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:20,920
is absolutely flooded there's there's a

1407
00:56:19,358 --> 00:56:22,920
miniscus on the top I mean it is

1408
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,400
absolutely flooded in ethanolic

1409
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:27,079
phosphotungstic acid I'm going to look

1410
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:29,039
at it in a couple months from now

1411
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:30,240
because if I can get away from osmium I

1412
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:32,680
definitely want

1413
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:35,479
to but short of not being able to image

1414
00:56:32,679 --> 00:56:38,279
at all um the other step is going to be

1415
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:41,159
as I mentioned using um gold conjugates

1416
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:44,000
so Nano gold so lectin are very good in

1417
00:56:41,159 --> 00:56:47,639
vitro at sticking to micro risal fungi

1418
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:50,280
and in vitro we've shown that we can

1419
00:56:47,639 --> 00:56:52,879
stick enough uh wheat germal glutin in

1420
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:55,839
conjugated to Gold nanop particles so

1421
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,519
that we can see in vitro I don't know if

1422
00:56:55,838 --> 00:57:01,480
it's going to be enough to see in situ

1423
00:56:57,519 --> 00:57:01,480
it's just a bigger system and much more

1424
00:57:01,639 --> 00:57:06,358
dense question online so I know you said

1425
00:57:04,358 --> 00:57:08,199
there are resolution image issues with

1426
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:10,598
the large scale x-ray tomography what is

1427
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:11,960
the cut off does this extend to find

1428
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:13,880
roots and that's that's again that's a

1429
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:19,159
great question

1430
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:21,519
so we can engineer the pot to be able to

1431
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:22,719
see the biology of interest that we're

1432
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:25,079
interested in so if we want to see

1433
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:27,078
lateral Roots we'll grow something in

1434
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:30,200
nothing bigger than say 4 or 5 cm

1435
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:32,640
diameter pot and we might just even get

1436
00:57:30,199 --> 00:57:34,719
away from using field soil we use um

1437
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:36,038
ground up Clay like profile or turface

1438
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,439
these are commercially available

1439
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:39,960
artificial growth

1440
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:43,400
media we will be able to see lateral

1441
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:45,440
roots in in in that example if we look

1442
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:48,920
at a larger pot we will never see

1443
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:52,318
lateral Roots so we can adjust pot size

1444
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:55,159
and growth medium to allow the

1445
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:56,838
instrument to show us what's possible

1446
00:57:55,159 --> 00:57:58,480
there is an o excuse me there's an

1447
00:57:56,838 --> 00:58:00,400
overlap between the large format

1448
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:03,280
instrument and the X-ray microscope both

1449
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,599
have a flat panel option so you saw one

1450
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,400
of the images in here where I had a

1451
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:10,039
small corn plant in the X-ray microscope

1452
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:12,160
that panel is higher resolution than the

1453
00:58:10,039 --> 00:58:16,720
one in the large format instrument so

1454
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:18,318
even in that same 3 cm diameter PVC pipe

1455
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:21,159
we'll get better resolution in the X-ray

1456
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:23,838
microscope it's a longer scan and it's

1457
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:25,318
60 to 70 gigabytes again always the

1458
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:27,920
trade-off if you want to see small roots

1459
00:58:25,318 --> 00:58:30,159
in a big thing it's going to cost you

1460
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:33,119
but it is

1461
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:36,920
possible Margaret um I was just thinking

1462
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:40,798
about your your last part on field soil

1463
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:43,480
composition and your early work on root

1464
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:44,239
architecture and the plasticity of roots

1465
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:46,559
are

1466
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:48,838
you like thinking about a system where

1467
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:52,440
you can start looking at how the

1468
00:58:48,838 --> 00:58:55,440
heterogeneity of real soil systems is

1469
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:58,039
influencing that plasticity or is that

1470
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,280
yes absolutely abolutely and and I I was

1471
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:01,920
hoping to get the chance to say that

1472
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:04,200
we're working on a top soil in Chris

1473
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,680
Topps lab um we're working on an

1474
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:07,358
authentic field soil that is

1475
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:09,358
reproducible that we can use all the

1476
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:11,078
time because up till now we've only used

1477
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:14,639
the artificial media because that has

1478
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:17,440
been less daunting for segmentation

1479
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:19,400
field soil is so much more like a root

1480
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:22,119
itself it's just diff more difficult to

1481
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:23,838
teach the computer to find the roots but

1482
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:26,318
that is our goal this year especially is

1483
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:29,078
to demonstrate that in a number number

1484
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:30,759
of diameters we can grow two different

1485
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:32,240
maze genotypes where we know the root

1486
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,319
structure is different the root

1487
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:37,719
architecture is going to be different

1488
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:40,199
can we get good enough at segmentation

1489
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:42,798
where we can pull out those 3D volumes

1490
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:45,239
now they're root 3D volumes with nothing

1491
00:59:42,798 --> 00:59:48,038
around them and plug them into our trait

1492
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:49,838
extraction pipelines and actually see

1493
00:59:48,039 --> 00:59:52,640
that the the trait differences we can

1494
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:54,798
see by I we can also measure from the

1495
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:57,598
Inu x-ray sces so we need to demonstrate

1496
00:59:54,798 --> 00:59:59,280
that we can do that and then we can then

1497
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:01,519
step forward through all the different

1498
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,798
bi basic biology questions from genotype

1499
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:07,119
to

1500
01:00:02,798 --> 01:00:09,318
environment one last question one last

1501
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:12,039
question

1502
01:00:09,318 --> 01:00:14,679
yes is there any work being done to

1503
01:00:12,039 --> 01:00:17,000
build functional PL models things like

1504
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:18,679
that uh using especially like

1505
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,199
architecture

1506
01:00:18,679 --> 01:00:22,759
data yes there are computational

1507
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:24,598
scientists and modeling scientists who

1508
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:26,079
are taking some of these data and and

1509
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:27,680
sort of developing into different

1510
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:30,200
questions these are collaborators we

1511
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:31,960
have at at St Louis University as well

1512
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:33,960
as uh Washington University both in

1513
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:35,760
downtown St Louis so they are in

1514
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:39,039
computer science programs and very often

1515
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:40,920
they are starved for data sets we've got

1516
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:43,240
hundreds of terabytes of data sets

1517
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:46,318
please do as much as you can with these

1518
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:48,000
and a lot of that is modeling um T's lab

1519
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:50,519
really developed and this was again Dan

1520
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,880
xang did a great job developing a

1521
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:56,480
skeletonization protocol that sort of

1522
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,720
got around the problem of loop where

1523
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,559
things would loop back against one

1524
01:00:57,719 --> 01:01:01,719
another and you would the computer would

1525
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:03,519
lose it and so they've been able to

1526
01:01:01,719 --> 01:01:06,358
convert that 2D into 3D where you could

1527
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:08,679
actually track these these looping

1528
01:01:06,358 --> 01:01:10,000
structures so yeah a lot of that work is

1529
01:01:08,679 --> 01:01:12,279
being done we've got great colleagues

1530
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:17,199
who are following that

1531
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:17,200
up all right thank you

1532
