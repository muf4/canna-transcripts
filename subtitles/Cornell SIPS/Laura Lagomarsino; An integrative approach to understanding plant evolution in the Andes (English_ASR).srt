1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,399
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,399
university

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,759
awesome thank you so much chelsea that

4
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:11,279
is you know

5
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,599
at this point i've given quite a few

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,039
seminars but it's by far my favorite

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,559
introduction i've got i have like

8
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:17,599
goosebumps right now so that feels

9
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,839
really good

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,118
i'm gonna take the opportunity to invite

11
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,240
anybody who

12
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,759
um wants to you don't have to i want you

13
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,439
to feel no pressure but to turn on your

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,960
video just so i can have something to

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,640
engage with i have a whole

16
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,399
whole screen of names right now many of

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,799
which are familiar but many who aren't

18
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,759
so if you're in a place where or you

19
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,159
want me to see

20
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,479
your reactions to the research i present

21
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,159
absolutely turn your videos on

22
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,000
and so today i'm going to tell you guys

23
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,519
as chelsea alluded to

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,840
all about the research i've done on

25
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,600
neotropical plant evolution

26
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,840
before i dive into the andes i'm going

27
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,640
to paint a picture of

28
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,480
the neotropics writ large and so the

29
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,600
neotropics are the region of the world

30
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,679
between the

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,039
tropics of cancer and capricorn in the

32
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,119
western hemisphere

33
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,879
stretching from northern or southern

34
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,879
mexico in the north in chiapas down

35
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,118
through northern argentina and the south

36
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,560
wrapping around to include the the

37
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,640
caribbean islands

38
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,640
and for biodiversity they're an

39
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,680
incredibly important part of the world

40
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,519
uh there are between 90 and 110 000

41
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,479
species of vascular plants

42
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:24,079
that are native to the neotropics and to

43
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:27,280
put this into a broader

44
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:29,200
um global context this means that

45
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,118
the neotropics may hold more plant

46
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,200
species than the entirety

47
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,159
of the african and asian tropics

48
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,920
combined

49
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,759
so really quite stunning levels of

50
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,200
neotropical diversity

51
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,200
and because i'm in a plant biology

52
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,159
department i know you guys know

53
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,200
a bunch of plants from this region but

54
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,280
here are some

55
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,560
um some of the plants that are probably

56
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,320
more familiar to

57
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,240
to you but also maybe to the people who

58
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,239
aren't plant biologists in your life

59
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,478
a bunch of um charismatic tropical

60
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,679
fruits like papayas and pineapples but

61
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,560
also kitchen staples

62
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,600
like um potatoes and chilies and the

63
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,079
neotropics is

64
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,239
as many of the sort of uncontroversial

65
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:06,879
and controversially wonderful plants it

66
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:08,799
has

67
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,878
also has some more controversial ones as

68
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,760
well including the coca leaf

69
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,840
which is um so important for the medical

70
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:19,120
industry but is also quite infamous for

71
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,039
for the drug trade um but as a botanist

72
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,120
when i think of the neotropics

73
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,318
this is more like the plant diversity

74
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,159
that i think of

75
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,079
the neotropics are home to almost all

76
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,560
species of cacti

77
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,319
bromeliads and of course the heliconias

78
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,759
that i wet my teeth on as an underground

79
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,399
in chelsea's lab

80
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,120
um implants that might be less familiar

81
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,640
as well

82
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,239
including things like this big leaf

83
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,639
gunnera this

84
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,280
formerly topabaya now blackia species

85
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,399
being

86
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,039
pollinated by an orchidv and many many

87
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,360
species

88
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,799
of the primarily tropical order now

89
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,680
piggy hayley's including this

90
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,319
anthodiscus species here

91
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,159
and a major question that drives my

92
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:59,759
research but also plenty of other folks

93
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,598
research including i think

94
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,120
people in your department who are coming

95
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,840
at it from a totally different angle

96
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,840
than me

97
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,000
is what explains this neotropical

98
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,080
hyperdiversity

99
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,318
there are of course abiotic explanations

100
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,319
that include simply time and area that

101
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,560
the neotropics are both big and old

102
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:19,119
but also climate and aspects of the

103
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,158
landscape themselves including hydrology

104
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,840
and and mountain uplift and prominently

105
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:26,639
today my top will feature

106
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,878
andean uplift but there are plenty of

107
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,878
biotic factors as well that may underlie

108
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:31,759
diversification plant diversification in

109
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,199
this region

110
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,959
including things a little bit inherent

111
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,280
to the species like potential to

112
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,959
hybridize or deform polyploids

113
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,640
um also adaptations to soil

114
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,400
environments and other parts of the

115
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,719
abiotic niche and of course

116
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,400
biotic interactions whether they're

117
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,359
mutualisms with pollinators or seed

118
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,039
dispersers

119
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,080
or um antagonisms like the relationship

120
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,359
between

121
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,879
um plants and their herbivores and

122
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,959
if you know my research you know i'm

123
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:03,679
sort of stuck on one of these potential

124
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,360
or one of these uh biotic mutualisms

125
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,640
hummingbird pollination and i think this

126
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,879
is a really good example

127
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,158
of how the neotropics have just such

128
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,239
fantastic biolo

129
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:13,438
biological interactions ongoing

130
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,120
throughout

131
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,199
their entire landscape and so many

132
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,120
plants have converged

133
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,720
to take advantage of this particular

134
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,079
pollinator

135
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,680
and to get at um what drives me a

136
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,439
tropical plant evolution

137
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,800
my research program takes a clade

138
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,199
focused approach

139
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,360
um but is very integrative across

140
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,800
subclades of biology of especially

141
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,400
evolution and i integrate

142
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,160
macroevolutionary studies with

143
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,159
microevolution

144
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,360
with species ecology in my research

145
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,720
program sort of that

146
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,120
that happy zone right there in the

147
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,120
middle but importantly my research

148
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,160
is always conducted in a systematic

149
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,639
context so

150
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,400
understanding phylogenetic relationships

151
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,840
as well as having a solid understanding

152
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,799
of alpha taxonomy

153
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,879
underlies all the research that i do and

154
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,879
this of course means that herbarium

155
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,600
specimens are central to the work that i

156
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,680
do

157
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,879
um a lot of the data i will present to

158
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,560
you today came either

159
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,399
in part or in whole from our varying

160
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,120
specimens and so

161
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,519
they're just such an important source of

162
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,319
data for the evolutionary biologists

163
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,879
in addition to be an important um a

164
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,478
place for a taxonomist to really

165
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,399
get to understand a group in its

166
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:26,319
complexity

167
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:28,239
and so my my research program now that i

168
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,680
have my own lab at lsu takes a

169
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,240
two-pronged approach

170
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,720
my first prong is to go really deep into

171
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,720
a single model clay to try to understand

172
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,000
the evolutionary processes that give

173
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,479
rise to um

174
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,160
andy and biodiversity and here i use the

175
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,159
neotropical bell flowers

176
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,320
this will be the most of my talk today

177
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,600
but there's also a second prong

178
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:53,120
that in which i am trying to understand

179
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,879
taxonomy uh phylogeny and evolution of

180
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,439
groups that are totally understudied

181
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,719
the neotropics for being as species-rich

182
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,399
and um

183
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,560
rich in their interactions as they are

184
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:06,000
are surprisingly understudied

185
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,439
um from a phylogenetic perspective

186
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,038
so i'm going to hop in and tell you a

187
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,680
little bit about that first prong right

188
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,560
now

189
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,160
um the neotropical bell flowers are what

190
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,240
i consider emerging model clay to

191
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,800
understand indian plant evolution

192
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,360
they comprise about 600 species total

193
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,038
across

194
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,639
three different subgroups the core

195
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:23,918
genera that i'll spend most my time

196
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,680
talking about today

197
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,279
are center pogon burmystera and

198
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,680
cyphocampolis

199
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,918
collectively these genera are sister to

200
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,079
a group of high elevation endemic taxon

201
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,359
and the genus lysophonia

202
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:40,000
um and together those two are sister to

203
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,960
four species of lagelia down in chile

204
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,160
the the the tupas um it's a truly

205
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,638
neotropical group

206
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,960
going from mexico down through argentina

207
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,319
um but their species richness is by far

208
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:54,478
highest in the cloud forest of the andes

209
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,319
and this group across its about 600

210
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,560
species not surprisingly

211
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,840
is very diverse in its ecology and

212
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,839
morphology

213
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,839
and i think the floral diversity in this

214
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,758
clade really exemplifies that

215
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,359
here are some of the species that i've

216
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,199
been lucky enough to collect throughout

217
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,080
fieldwork aminotropics

218
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,759
um this is lysophomia that uh that high

219
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,279
elevation endemic i mentioned has a

220
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,080
teeny flower that's

221
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,000
probably bee pollinated but the rest of

222
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,879
the flowers on this slide are vertebrate

223
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,160
pollinated

224
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,719
whether they're pollinated by

225
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,840
hummingbirds in these bright colors here

226
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,479
or by bats in these more dull colors and

227
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,198
this

228
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,560
impressive floral diversity is paratune

229
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,598
equally impressive

230
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,360
though um maybe less colorful diversity

231
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:39,439
and overall growth form

232
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,520
and here again i'm going to mention

233
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,680
really fast this is lysophomia

234
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,918
shown here out in the wild and there's

235
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,759
some moss behind it for scale so it's a

236
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:50,159
really tiny little plant

237
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,120
um but it occurs in the same overall sub

238
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,080
uh clade

239
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,079
as hifocampus tunarensis it's not a huge

240
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,719
tree but it's still a tree with a pretty

241
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,719
substantial single bowl um

242
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,720
and growth form within this clade sort

243
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,639
of spans that entire gamut

244
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,639
whether we're talking about xerophytes

245
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,360
that are growing in the guiana shield

246
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,120
uh hemi epiphytes growing or hemiapple

247
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,160
fights in the genus for myscara

248
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,120
or um this sort of dr

249
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,479
seuss-like monocollis shrub thing that's

250
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,079
holding on to its

251
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:24,560
um sinest leaves so really

252
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,478
just a fantastic group to to get to

253
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,879
study evolution in

254
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:29,519
and as i alluded to systematics is at

255
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,840
the heart

256
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,718
of of my research so understanding how

257
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:34,799
these 600

258
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,399
species should be delimited and how

259
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,359
their species are related is really

260
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,000
important

261
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,839
so of course part of my research does

262
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,360
involve going into the field and into

263
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,640
the herbarium and describing

264
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,560
new species um but it also involves

265
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,159
establishing a phylogenomic or

266
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:51,599
phylogenetic and more recently

267
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,079
phylogenomic framework

268
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,720
to understand relationships that can be

269
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,240
used to then understand

270
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,920
macroevolutionary patterns so i'm going

271
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,759
to tell you a little bit about the

272
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:04,799
the work that i've done and establishing

273
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,159
the phylogeny of this group

274
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,559
sorry about that you probably saw my

275
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:12,079
twitter a little um

276
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:14,719
thanksfeyway um anyway so

277
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,920
the i'm gonna tell you about where what

278
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,759
i've done research i've done in

279
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:21,599
phylogenetics but also

280
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:23,120
um the the work that's ongoing

281
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,120
and this is i think a strand of my

282
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,159
research that will always have something

283
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,000
active going on

284
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,838
you know i will always be trying to

285
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,480
understand more and more about this

286
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,120
group of

287
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,959
species as i mentioned at the beginning

288
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,360
as a whole they can be

289
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,479
subdivided into three major clades and

290
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,039
it turns out

291
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,720
that geolo geography is really informing

292
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,480
relationships in this clade and

293
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,720
for example we found that caribbean

294
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,800
species of psycho campolos are actually

295
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,560
really distantly related from

296
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:53,039
other members of its closely allied

297
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:55,119
genera um in the mainland

298
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,399
and so this green clade i've highlighted

299
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,399
here is

300
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,919
what we've come to refer to as a central

301
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,879
paragon of clade and this is

302
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,679
the group of about 500 species that's

303
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,838
really

304
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,359
diverse in their um ecology and

305
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,480
morphology

306
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,278
here i'm showing you the phylogeny at at

307
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,200
the left

308
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,439
and you can immediately notice that

309
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,160
there's only only one monophyletic genus

310
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440
here

311
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:21,360
um burmystera um is

312
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,680
in green is monophyletic and this

313
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,639
monophyle is well supported

314
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,439
by um molecular phylogenetic analysis

315
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,480
but further

316
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,320
it's supported by um morphological

317
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,959
synaptomorphies as well

318
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,959
this includes a dilated anthra orifice

319
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,799
so unlike other lobelity it doesn't

320
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,278
close its anther tube

321
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,399
um that's an adaptation probably to bat

322
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:44,958
pollination

323
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,879
and as is this inflated corolla opening

324
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,000
that it has it also has iso diametric

325
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,120
seeds

326
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,839
you know well-established clay the other

327
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,320
two genera

328
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,720
however are polyphyletic and sort of

329
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,640
wildly so with respect to one another

330
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,000
with central pogon forming eight

331
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:04,399
separate subclades and cyphocampolis 11.

332
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,399
now this is a reflection of this

333
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,440
artificial taxonomy that's based on

334
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,078
fruit type

335
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,560
like burmeisters and true pogon produce

336
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,278
these

337
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,078
animal dispersed berries and cyphocampus

338
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:16,399
on the

339
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:18,399
other hand hand produces these capsules

340
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,159
that are abiotically dispersed

341
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,159
maybe wind occasionally takes them up

342
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,319
and and takes them far but mainly

343
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,480
they're probably just gravity dispersed

344
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,399
um aside from these two traits these

345
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,759
genera overlap and pretty much

346
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,919
all characters whether vegetative or

347
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,120
or reproductive so this striking

348
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,479
non-modified

349
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,039
um is not necessarily surprising

350
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,159
but it does underlie really interesting

351
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:44,319
macroevolutionary

352
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,319
trend which is that fruit evolution has

353
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,200
been incredibly dynamic within this

354
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,200
clade

355
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,759
from an ancestral um capsular state we

356
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,879
see the

357
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:57,919
independent evolution of of

358
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:59,759
berries about eight times independently

359
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,599
and each of these eight evolutions is

360
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,838
associated with the origin

361
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,440
um of a well-supported morphologically

362
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,480
well-defined clade

363
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,959
and just to show you sort of the end

364
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,600
product

365
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,399
of the um convergent evolution of

366
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,278
berries

367
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,240
um i've put up examples of five of those

368
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:18,720
sub planes here

369
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,079
these are all um either in burma sarah

370
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,600
here or central pogon

371
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:23,359
and i think these are useful in showing

372
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,360
the fact that yes these are all berries

373
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,320
they're all fleshy fruits with many many

374
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,120
seeds

375
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,040
um but that convergent evolution and

376
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,639
function is not necessarily a reflected

377
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,078
and convergent evolutionary form and

378
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,000
there's actually quite a lot of

379
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,958
variation in the in the form of or the

380
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,919
fruit morphology in this group

381
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:43,838
so we're continuing to build a

382
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,120
phylogenetic framework for this group

383
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,959
both at the broad level

384
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,399
and an undergraduate lauren frankel's

385
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,559
been really helpful there

386
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,320
and at more targeted lineages and my

387
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,759
graduate student janet mansery's been

388
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,320
working on establishing

389
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,679
the phylogeny of a subplate of central

390
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,839
pogon here

391
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,039
and my our current work uses targeted

392
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,680
sequence capture

393
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,919
um which is a method that is really

394
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,519
robust to low quality dna which is

395
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,439
important because

396
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,200
we use a lot of herbarium specimens as a

397
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,160
major source of dna

398
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,240
um because with 600 species even though

399
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,399
even back when field work was possible

400
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,639
it's really hard to get full sampling

401
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,799
across the neotropics via field work

402
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,759
and so this method has been really great

403
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,240
for us

404
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,799
even though herbarium specimens aren't

405
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,759
always

406
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,479
a panacea to getting really great data

407
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,559
they are

408
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:37,440
i'm useful so herbarium samples perform

409
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,359
poorly compared to silica dried samples

410
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,800
even in targeted sequence capture

411
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,720
we see that the total number of

412
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,198
assembled base pairs in our data set

413
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,240
is less in herbarium specimens as

414
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:48,240
compared to

415
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,360
um silica dried leaf tissue that we

416
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,519
sequenced from

417
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,680
the average conflict length is lower the

418
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,720
number of really long context similarly

419
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:56,559
is lower

420
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,639
but yet they've done a really good job

421
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,319
at allowing this method isn't a really

422
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,039
good job of allowing us

423
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,879
to put new species into the tree that i

424
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:07,278
failed at previously

425
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:08,240
and this includes these three species

426
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,360
here

427
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,159
um cyphocampulus planchonus

428
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,680
is a species that's endemic to venezuela

429
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,679
so even if i could go to the field right

430
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:20,000
now i wouldn't be able to collect silica

431
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:22,479
tissue for this species because of the

432
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,278
socio-political situation in venezuela

433
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,039
but

434
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,559
thanks to missouri botanical garden i

435
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,879
was able to incorporate

436
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,000
incorporate it into a phylogeny here

437
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:31,360
similarly we were able

438
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,519
to include a central pokemon

439
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,278
electrolophus a new species that i'm

440
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,759
describing with bruce stein

441
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,278
into into the phylogeny and as well as

442
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:40,958
my my white whale

443
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,720
on a psycho campus novelist i've been

444
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,319
trying to include in a phylogeny since i

445
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,278
was a graduate student because i just

446
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,040
love its linear leaves but wasn't able

447
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,320
to when i was using sanger sequencing

448
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,879
but we now have it

449
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,720
pretty well resolved i should say really

450
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,559
quickly that our phylogenomic analyses

451
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,800
really broadly agree with um

452
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,078
that the first phylogeny i showed you so

453
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,278
while we're continuing to add

454
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:03,599
information

455
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,198
the the overall story of evolution in in

456
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,680
the central background enclave is is

457
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:09,759
really consistent

458
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,838
so we've used this phylogeny to really

459
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,838
understand macroevolution in this clade

460
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,360
and i'll tell you a little bit about

461
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,600
how we've looked at the abiotic and

462
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,519
biotic drivers of diversification in

463
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,360
this clade especially in the context of

464
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,600
the andes

465
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,199
so i want to introduce you even further

466
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,680
to the tropical andes

467
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:28,719
which the andes themselves are a

468
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:30,879
continental

469
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,000
scale mountain range searching from

470
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,399
venezuela

471
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,759
down through patagonia but the tropical

472
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,958
andes sort of end at the

473
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:42,240
in northern argentina there are

474
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:44,879
global biodiversity hot spot that um

475
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,000
spans about or that encompasses about

476
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:49,360
1.5

477
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,679
kilometers million square kilometers um

478
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,519
which is less than one percent of the

479
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:56,159
world's terrestrial surface

480
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,278
however the tropical andes are home to

481
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,319
15

482
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:03,360
of all angiosperm diversity fully 40

483
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,240
000 species of angiosperms are native to

484
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,639
this region

485
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,519
and this high level of species richness

486
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,399
is paired with

487
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,519
high endemism so it's a really special

488
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,159
area

489
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,639
and the uplift of the andes geologically

490
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:16,240
is

491
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,959
pretty recent at least in the the

492
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,198
tropical um parts of the andes which

493
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,359
in northern colombia you can argue are

494
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,958
still uplifting and they definitely have

495
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,600
been very active in the last million

496
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,599
years

497
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,680
so this this process of really active

498
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,720
recent uplift has been invoked time and

499
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,198
time again

500
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,000
to explain elevated diversification

501
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:35,919
rates in

502
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,360
really distantly related clades

503
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,679
including um

504
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,959
hummingbirds glasswing butterflies and

505
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,359
these glass frogs

506
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,559
and in the plants world i think time

507
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,000
after time again this has been

508
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,319
established but perhaps

509
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,120
most famously we can think of the andean

510
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,079
lupines

511
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,679
which hopped down from mexico about one

512
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,599
and a half million years ago into south

513
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,399
america and diversified into more than

514
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,240
80 species pretty quickly

515
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,320
but i think it's important to consider

516
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,120
that the andes the tropical andes

517
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,880
are not one monolithic habitat type that

518
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,558
are instead have a whole lot of habitat

519
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,480
heterogeneity within them

520
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:11,838
and here are four of the distinct

521
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,240
habitat types that

522
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:15,359
characterize this region at the highest

523
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,880
part of the andes

524
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,279
there are high elevation grasslands

525
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,160
characterizes characterized by lots of

526
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,678
grasses and

527
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,640
sedges that form um that form tussocks

528
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,559
like this

529
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,839
and you know in the paramount in

530
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,160
colombia and

531
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,558
venezuela you have also these espaletti

532
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,880
this really charismatic plant genus

533
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:35,839
as you go on down the wet eastern slope

534
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,160
of the andes

535
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:40,319
um these grasslands including paramount

536
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,160
give way to cloud forests which are

537
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,200
where i've done most of my field work

538
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,279
and they're the world's most

539
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,480
species-rich habitat type

540
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:49,440
super verdant lush wet and cloud filled

541
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,679
throughout the year

542
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,679
and they're characterized by short trees

543
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,798
and shrubs that are absolutely full of

544
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,240
epiphytes

545
00:17:54,798 --> 00:18:00,798
including orchids mosses ferns

546
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,599
bromeliads like you see here

547
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:05,839
and as you keep on going down the in an

548
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,639
elevation that cloud forest gives way to

549
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:08,720
lowland

550
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,320
rainforest including the amazon basin

551
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,679
there on the western side

552
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:17,038
which um well maybe not a species which

553
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:20,798
is very um lush and vibrant and

554
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:22,160
absolutely um charismatic in its flora

555
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:26,000
and fauna

556
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:29,519
but not all andean landscapes are

557
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,279
green and lush there are lots of dry

558
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:31,599
habitats as well and in fact some of the

559
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,200
most

560
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:36,959
arid habitats are um in proximity to the

561
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,519
andes and this includes a lot of

562
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,079
seasonally dry forests and really arid

563
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:44,319
inter andean valleys and it can be so

564
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:48,480
dry that cacti can be a predominant

565
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:50,319
growth form so um as to be expected i

566
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,960
would argue diversification

567
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:54,079
is not um homogeneous across these

568
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,880
different habitats

569
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,199
and so we see that diversification has

570
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,440
been

571
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,720
really fast and really recent we have

572
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,840
clades that have

573
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,720
um originated in the last million years

574
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,199
and less

575
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,720
in the paramose which makes sense

576
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,600
because they're the top of the andes

577
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,279
they're the most

578
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:14,000
the youngest habitat type in this in

579
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,960
this region um

580
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,720
and so this is the world's most fastest

581
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,679
biodiversity hot spot

582
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,720
but we also know that the drier areas of

583
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,600
the andes are a little bit more

584
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,558
relictual

585
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,279
and the clades that they have are that

586
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:29,519
they house

587
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,839
tend to be old and relatively slow

588
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,720
evolving

589
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:36,079
a relatively few cloud forest clades

590
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,400
have been studied in the context of

591
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:40,319
diversification i think in part because

592
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,240
there are lots of unwieldy clades that

593
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,879
are native here lots of just

594
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,599
very high species richness hard to hard

595
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,160
to infer

596
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,599
phylogenys here that make the subsequent

597
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,480
inference of diversification rates

598
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:52,159
difficult

599
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,759
but here we use the neotropical bell

600
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,720
flowers as a model

601
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,319
to look at neotropical or andean

602
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,798
diversification

603
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,759
and first we establish a time calibrated

604
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:04,319
phylogeny

605
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:06,640
we showed that from the origin of the

606
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,639
clade about 15 million years ago

607
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,480
until about 5 million years ago

608
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,600
diversification rates remained

609
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,919
relatively flat and relatively slow but

610
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:18,399
at 5 million years ago

611
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,080
diversification rates exploded and we

612
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,600
see that net diversification

613
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,879
rates um ticked up super quickly

614
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,439
coinciding with the origin of the

615
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,480
central cargonic plate this group of 550

616
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,360
species

617
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,360
and in fact this is a really special um

618
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:36,000
clade in terms of diversification rate

619
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:38,079
we see that the the rates that we have

620
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,359
estimated for central pogon are

621
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:42,798
higher than other um andean lineages

622
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:44,319
with fast diversification rates

623
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:46,798
including hummingbirds and those

624
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:49,200
espaledia that i showed a few slides ago

625
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,400
and similarly they're also higher than

626
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,480
um many

627
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,120
famous rapid radiations in the hawaiian

628
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,519
islands another area characterized by

629
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,839
sort of

630
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:58,558
young geology and rapid diversification

631
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,959
rates

632
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,399
and in lineages those lineages include

633
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,440
hawaiian drosophila

634
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,480
and the hawaiian silver swords but what

635
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,480
explains

636
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,480
this this really elevated

637
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,558
diversification rate

638
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,798
well applying um state dependent

639
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:15,279
diversification models we found evidence

640
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:17,918
that an

641
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,319
association with vertebrate pollinators

642
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,480
um

643
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,599
results in a six-fold increase in net

644
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,599
diversification

645
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:25,839
rate rates as compared to invertebrate

646
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:29,119
pollination and similarly

647
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,639
that relationships with fruit dispersers

648
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:33,119
probably small

649
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,840
small bats and birds is associated with

650
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:35,759
the higher rate

651
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,038
at diversification than those capsular

652
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:37,759
fruits that just sort of drop their

653
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:39,359
seeds

654
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:41,279
and this suggests that mutualism

655
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:42,319
specifically with verdigris

656
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:46,000
are really important to the

657
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:49,678
diversification of this clique

658
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,839
but we also found evidence for

659
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:56,640
um for the abiotic environment

660
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:57,199
also driving diversification and here we

661
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,038
see

662
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,319
here we we're really excited about this

663
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,158
model because it's one of the first

664
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,200
times geological data has been

665
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,480
incorporated

666
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,159
into a model of diversification um

667
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,519
and so we thought this was really

668
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,320
exciting and novel

669
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:12,960
on this side you see a model of anion

670
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:16,079
pascal

671
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,880
ambient elevation through time and at

672
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:18,558
the right

673
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,320
you see the results of our analysis

674
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,319
which is basically an extension of a

675
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:25,599
birth death model but instead of

676
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:27,038
modeling through time we model against a

677
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:29,519
time dependent variable

678
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:31,919
so the elevation here in our best

679
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,759
fitting model we find that extinction is

680
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,120
not a significant parameter we have a

681
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,200
pure birth model

682
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:38,959
we see that speciation instead it seems

683
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,720
to be very tightly linked to past

684
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,519
elevation of the andes

685
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,279
a really exciting result and though not

686
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:46,960
surprising because again this has been

687
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:50,558
about time and time again across

688
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,079
other enclaves as well this result was

689
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:54,558
corroborated by

690
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,240
two other busy analyses one showing that

691
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:57,279
andy and taxa have higher rates in that

692
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,960
diversification

693
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,119
than taxes that occur outside of the

694
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,159
andes and similarly those at higher

695
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:03,519
elevations

696
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,520
um have higher rates in a

697
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,200
diversification than those at lower

698
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,798
elevations

699
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,038
and so across these series of

700
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:13,119
diversification analyses we're able to

701
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:16,480
show that it's a complex interplay

702
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:19,678
of both abiotic factors um climate

703
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,079
and which i didn't show but climate hand

704
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,080
andy and uplift but also biotic factors

705
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,000
those relationships with mutualists

706
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:27,918
that underlies rapid diversification and

707
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,440
neotropical bell flowers

708
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,520
and i would argue that's probably going

709
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,159
to be true in most lineages that occur

710
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:37,679
across this really heterogeneous

711
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:40,320
topographically complex area um clades

712
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,278
are able to have so many species because

713
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:44,399
of the scale

714
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:48,079
of this mountain range and because of

715
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,240
the the many different um

716
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:51,439
uh sort of ecological interactions that

717
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,480
can happen within this

718
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,120
this matrix uh attacks are able to

719
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,798
locally adapt and you have what results

720
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,119
are these morphologically

721
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:04,158
diverse species-rich clades that

722
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:06,399
characterize the tropical andes and

723
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,200
we're beginning to see a similar pattern

724
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,360
across

725
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,600
other taxa as well in which

726
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:15,199
diversification often a very

727
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:16,719
um morphologically rich uh clades begins

728
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,000
in the late maya scene and this

729
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,360
coincides at the time

730
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,038
at which those mountains were tall

731
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,278
enough to begin to capture

732
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:24,720
moisture coming in from the amazon basin

733
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:25,919
forming the clouds that gives cloud

734
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,600
forests their names

735
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,520
and so we see this in bromeliads

736
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:32,719
blueberries passion flowers

737
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:34,798
viburnums and even lycopods

738
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,319
and as i mentioned before i really do

739
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:39,038
think that the evolutionary

740
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:39,599
ability of different lineages to for

741
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:42,558
example

742
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:44,000
converge on unhummingbird pollination or

743
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:46,079
to shift fruit type to

744
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,798
fit a different disperser has allowed

745
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:51,839
the coexistence of so many species

746
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:53,599
and this allowed us to

747
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,038
with this framework i was able to sort

748
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:57,359
of meld

749
00:24:55,038 --> 00:25:00,079
macroevolution of species ecology to

750
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:02,558
understand at a macroevolutionary scale

751
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:04,399
how evolution of pollination syndromes

752
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:05,759
has proceeded in neotropical bell

753
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,440
flowers

754
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,119
for those of you are unfamiliar with

755
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,558
pollination syndromes there are suites

756
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:12,239
of floral characteristics that are

757
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:14,079
associated with the attraction of a

758
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,839
particular floral visitor

759
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,480
in this clade hummingbird pollination

760
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:19,759
and bat pollination are relevant

761
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,759
they actually share quite a few

762
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:24,400
characteristics and bell flowers

763
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,158
flowers going to be tubular tubular and

764
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,759
produce a lot of nectar because both

765
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,840
hummingbirds and bats

766
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,679
are warm breaded pollinators that need a

767
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:33,678
lot of energy to survive

768
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,200
the hummingbird pollinated flowers tend

769
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,720
to be brightly colored

770
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,679
to match sort of the high visual acuity

771
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,278
of hummingbirds

772
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,960
they're flowering during the day or they

773
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:44,960
have diurnal emphasis

774
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,640
they don't have a floral odor and that's

775
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,360
because hummingbirds don't smell very

776
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,480
well

777
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:54,079
and most importantly so for pollination

778
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,038
efficacy they have really narrow floral

779
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:57,359
openings

780
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:59,278
and hummingbirds are best at visiting

781
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:01,839
the most narrow possible

782
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:03,119
aperture within the constraints of their

783
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:05,918
um

784
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,759
bill size so functionally this is a very

785
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,840
important trait

786
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,278
fat pollinated flowers on the other hand

787
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:12,558
tend to be pale at color they might

788
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,599
stand out a little bit

789
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:16,399
um at night which of course when bats

790
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,278
are active and

791
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,480
why we see a night flowering flowers or

792
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:23,278
nocturnal emphasis

793
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,200
in bat pollinated groups they also tend

794
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,440
to have unpleasant floral odors

795
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,480
or at least tend to be very sulfurious

796
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,038
so um

797
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,120
kind of kind of skunky and they have

798
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:34,879
importantly a wide floral opening

799
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,479
and i like to think these bat pollinated

800
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,840
flowers are sort of bat head shape

801
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,679
because the bats just put their whole

802
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:41,519
head in when they visit

803
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,919
and so i'm going to really quickly show

804
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,759
you guys a video about pollination

805
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,600
because i think it tends to be the least

806
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:48,640
familiar pollination syndrome that i

807
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:50,480
talk about

808
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,320
so here's central pogon niagara cans

809
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,120
it's flowering in the cloud forest of

810
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,079
ecuador

811
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,519
you can see it's a really wide flower or

812
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,678
corolla opening there

813
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,359
and these are its big old stamens just

814
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,519
waiting to put pollen on

815
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:04,959
the anurai fish gelato bat that's about

816
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:07,918
to visit it

817
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,120
you see as the bat puts its head in it

818
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,600
reaches its tongue

819
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:13,519
all the way to the base of this 10

820
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:16,319
centimeter long flower

821
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:17,918
and as it's doing that uh pollen's being

822
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:20,720
placed very specifically

823
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,480
at the nape of this fat snack so just a

824
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,919
really fantastic interaction

825
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,399
maybe even more impressive when you

826
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,880
realize that this fat has the longest

827
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:29,599
tongue

828
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,600
per body size of any vertebrate which it

829
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:33,839
has evolved to um

830
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:35,839
two it's a practical evolution with

831
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,759
center pogo night or cans it's

832
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:39,519
the only bat that's able to get to the

833
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,839
bottom of this

834
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:44,079
um very long flower and subsequently

835
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:44,398
centripetal cancer relies on this bat

836
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,519
for

837
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:48,158
for reproduction and so we're really

838
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,319
interested

839
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,760
in how pollination syndromes evolved

840
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:53,519
across the clay not just within a

841
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:54,158
species and so we collected a bunch of

842
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:56,480
data

843
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,480
relevant to pollination biology from

844
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,319
herbarium specimens

845
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,319
and the first thing i did with that data

846
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,960
was to pop it into a phylogenetically

847
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:07,278
informed principle components analysis

848
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,640
this is a a beast of the slides i'll go

849
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:10,640
ahead and walk you through it

850
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,320
but the overall take home is that

851
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,080
pollination syndromes were really well

852
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:17,599
supported in this claim

853
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:20,398
here we see bat pollinated uh flowers

854
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:21,599
uh morphosphere bat pollinated no we

855
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:24,319
have flowers

856
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,000
um that are bat pollinated and green

857
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:27,119
hummingbird pollinated flowers and

858
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,679
either pink

859
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:32,158
or white and species for which we know

860
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,559
from really good pollination ecology

861
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,200
we know their pollinators have blue

862
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:40,240
around the outside

863
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,080
um so the first pc axis is mainly

864
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,159
capturing size variation and it doesn't

865
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,439
do a great job of splitting hummingbird

866
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,600
versus bat flowers

867
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,200
which is not surprising because they're

868
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:50,879
actually pretty similar in size these

869
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,120
how many birds and bats

870
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,480
however the second pc axis does a really

871
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:56,398
good job of splitting

872
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,399
um bat from hummingbird pollinated

873
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,719
flowers and this axis

874
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:01,678
not surprisingly is capturing more shape

875
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,640
variation

876
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,000
we go from flowers that are wide and

877
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,840
relatively short and have

878
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,240
big anthers um on this part of the axis

879
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:14,879
to flowers that are longer narrower and

880
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,599
have small anthers up here

881
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,840
a third pc axis further separates

882
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:20,719
species that are obligately pollinated

883
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:22,398
by this

884
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,720
wonderful hummingbird species here

885
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:27,439
eutoxaries the sickle bell hummingbird

886
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,880
and this axis is capturing variation in

887
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,720
curvature

888
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,919
when we put these results onto that

889
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,839
phylogeny we see

890
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,360
just like fruit evolution pollination

891
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,119
syndrome evolution has been really

892
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:39,519
dynamic in this clade

893
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,639
we see that ancestral pollen that

894
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:42,798
ancestrally

895
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,960
this clade was hummingbird pollinated

896
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:47,440
and here i'm showing you the product

897
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,120
or the i'm showing you six species that

898
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,919
are plesiomorphically hummingbird

899
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:51,519
pollinated

900
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,278
meaning from the base of that tree all

901
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,960
the way to the present their lineage is

902
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:56,000
inferred to have been hummingbird

903
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,600
pollinated

904
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,359
and so i just want you to notice that

905
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:00,959
the flowers well there is quite a bit of

906
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:02,639
variation within them they are sort of

907
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,399
overall similar in their in their bowel

908
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,240
plan

909
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:08,158
within hummingbird pollination we have

910
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,359
this origination of an obligate

911
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,120
pollination by a sickle bill

912
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:14,240
hummingbirds this lovely guy

913
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:16,000
a single time but it's um

914
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,919
not an evolutionary dead end this

915
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,319
obligate specialization and instead we

916
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,000
see multiple occasions in which an evil

917
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,480
relationship with this bird has been

918
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,640
lost

919
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,120
and fantastically we see that that

920
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,320
pollination has evolved about 14

921
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:35,759
14 times independently within this clade

922
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:38,558
and here i'm showing you seven so if we

923
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:39,839
um examples from fully half of those

924
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:40,798
independent evolutions of that

925
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,240
pollination

926
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:44,079
and compared to those hummingbird

927
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,038
pollinated flowers you can see the

928
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:48,079
convergent

929
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:51,038
um origination of those flowers here and

930
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:52,639
they tend to be um overall similar and

931
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:54,000
those traits that we measure that are

932
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,679
functionally really important

933
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,359
but there's a lot of personality to

934
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,080
these flowers as well across the

935
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:01,678
different

936
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:02,639
um uh originations and so not

937
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,600
surprisingly

938
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,799
there's a suite of adaptive traits uh we

939
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:09,439
we see

940
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:10,240
evidence for evolution and pollination

941
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,919
syndromes

942
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,720
via the application of these ornstein

943
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:17,120
ulumbak models that allow us to look at

944
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,640
um correlated evolution within

945
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:20,879
pollination syndromes

946
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,960
so what this means as lineages shift

947
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,360
from hummingbird to bat pollination

948
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,000
their traits change simultaneously as

949
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:28,158
well

950
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,119
so for example as we go from flowers

951
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,519
that are long

952
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:35,518
long and have short peduncles this is

953
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,558
important in hummingbird pollination

954
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,640
we um as we shift to bat pollination

955
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:42,240
flowers simultaneously get wider

956
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,159
and get those long put uncles that are

957
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,759
so characteristic of that pollinated

958
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,000
flowers

959
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:49,519
and but despite this really dynamic

960
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,119
pattern of

961
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,880
pollination syndrome evolution and this

962
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,918
evidence for the macroevolutionary

963
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,559
importance

964
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,000
of um of these pollinators and driving

965
00:31:56,558 --> 00:31:59,519
morphological evolution

966
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,119
we don't see any differences in

967
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,798
diversification rate

968
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,959
between hummingbird and bat pollinated

969
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:07,918
lineages um

970
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,360
and so i would argue that instead like i

971
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,200
said a few slides ago so this clay's

972
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,119
ability to shift so readily

973
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,038
between the pollination syndromes that

974
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:18,398
has allowed this clay to

975
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:21,278
host so many species and this

976
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:22,798
observation really motivated uh my next

977
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:25,038
research question which is what role do

978
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:27,200
pollinatorships play in speciation

979
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:29,599
within this clade and this bit allows me

980
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,440
to to put together the microevolution

981
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:34,639
and species ecology

982
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,919
parts of that venn diagram and

983
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,120
to so to get at this we we studied a

984
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,278
system in bolivia

985
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:42,158
of three different um central pokemon

986
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:44,398
species

987
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,799
central pogon britonianes centro pogo

988
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:48,558
mendonas and central pogan and canis

989
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:51,359
shown here a little worse for the wear

990
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:54,720
after a day of riding in the car with us

991
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:56,558
um so they're all all these species are

992
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,720
endemic to bolivia but they have really

993
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,960
different ranges within bolivia

994
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,720
central pogon brittonians and mendonas

995
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,840
they're both high elevation species

996
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,839
they're occurring at

997
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:08,558
the highest extent of cloud forest right

998
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:10,639
before it transitions to grasslands

999
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:11,839
but brittonianis it's a very narrow

1000
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,759
endemic

1001
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,319
it's just found in you know a handful of

1002
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:18,158
populations outside of la paz

1003
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,398
central program mendonas on the other

1004
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,320
hand is this widespread taxon

1005
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,879
that's found throughout this elevational

1006
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:27,200
band throughout bolivia

1007
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,519
center pokemon and canis is sort of like

1008
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,840
brittonians it has a relatively

1009
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,759
um narrow distribution though not nearly

1010
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:35,839
as narrow as brittonianis

1011
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:37,038
but importantly it's occurring lower on

1012
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:38,879
the mountain slopes

1013
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:42,879
than brutonians and mandona so this is

1014
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,960
sort of a low cloud forest species

1015
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,919
and this was a really interesting study

1016
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,919
system for us

1017
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:52,240
because of where one of the species fell

1018
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,840
within the

1019
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,278
morphological space and we see that

1020
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:59,439
center program mandonis which we

1021
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:03,359
inferred to be hummingbird pollination

1022
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:05,440
pollinated based on its red flower color

1023
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:08,239
however it was falling sort of on the

1024
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,039
outskirts of fat morpho space

1025
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:12,319
and so that led us to ask is this what's

1026
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:14,480
what's the better signal

1027
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,480
color or shape or is there something

1028
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,199
more complex going on

1029
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,398
so we set up a bunch of cameras and and

1030
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,078
um

1031
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:24,159
to see what was happening with the

1032
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,480
pollination of these three species

1033
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,320
and center pogon and canis with its big

1034
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,519
white flowers we predicted would be bat

1035
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,399
pollinated

1036
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,280
and we do see in fact that bats were

1037
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:35,759
really good and

1038
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:39,280
regular visitors to this species down at

1039
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:42,320
those lower warmer elevations

1040
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,000
we saw we saw um

1041
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,240
hummingbirds visiting these flowers as

1042
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,320
well i want you to notice however that

1043
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,918
when this bird is going into the flower

1044
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,760
it's not always making contact with

1045
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,598
those reproductive organs

1046
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,280
and in a second here it's going to zoom

1047
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,838
down to this flower down in the bottom

1048
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,200
left

1049
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:59,440
and i want you to pay attention it's

1050
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:02,159
going to enter that flower from the side

1051
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,320
totally issuing any sort of contact with

1052
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:06,639
the reproductive organs and so

1053
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,720
this hummingbird well it is a floral

1054
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,078
visitor is often acting as a nectar

1055
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:13,279
robber in the system

1056
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:15,760
it's costly to this plant so not

1057
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,200
not as good a visitor as that last bat

1058
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,839
who even though it was a real quick

1059
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,358
visit

1060
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:21,358
did a really good job of transferring

1061
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:23,358
pollen

1062
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:24,960
so of course we were most interested in

1063
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:26,078
what was going on in central pogan

1064
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,960
mandonis

1065
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,560
and we saw that hummingbirds do in fact

1066
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,440
visit this flower so

1067
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:33,519
you know that's sort of what we

1068
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,358
predicted based on the flower color but

1069
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,039
with that morpho space we also thought

1070
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:40,239
bats might be good visitors and

1071
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:44,239
to my delight they were

1072
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:47,519
um and and so across

1073
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:49,519
uh 243 hours of video we see

1074
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,119
that there's a gradient of pollination

1075
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:53,119
specialization in this clad from

1076
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,000
primarily bat pollination

1077
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,480
in central pogon in canis to a pretty

1078
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,400
balanced

1079
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,159
generalist in central pokemon mendonas

1080
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,559
which relies on both hummingbirds

1081
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:04,399
and bats for effective pollination with

1082
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:06,480
central pogon britonianis sort of

1083
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,400
in that middle zone its primary

1084
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,240
pollinator is certainly bats

1085
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,320
though hummingbirds are important

1086
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:14,399
secondary pollinators

1087
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,480
and this was of course a really fun

1088
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,119
result for us because what this meant is

1089
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,320
that

1090
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:23,599
um mandonis as us balanced generalists

1091
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:26,640
that color and shape mismatch

1092
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:29,039
were sort of underlying its

1093
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:30,480
ecological generalism so this really

1094
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:32,719
sort of interesting result where we're

1095
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,000
able to use macroevolutionary analyses

1096
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:36,719
to actually predict something about

1097
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,000
species ecology normally it's sort of

1098
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:41,919
done the opposite way of course

1099
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,079
being an evolutionary biology a

1100
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,200
biologist i put this in a phylogenetic

1101
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,079
context

1102
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:49,199
and it's actually it gets even more

1103
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,119
interesting

1104
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:52,879
these are each other's closest related

1105
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,079
species and this is strong support in

1106
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,160
the entire phylogeny

1107
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,119
as a whole if we zoom on into just the

1108
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:59,838
subclade

1109
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,358
we see that central programmer tonyanis

1110
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:03,599
and central program mendonas

1111
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:04,559
are sister species that occur in

1112
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,800
sympathy

1113
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:08,719
that are sharing pollinators which is a

1114
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,800
really sort of stunning result

1115
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:12,399
and their sister to central pelagon and

1116
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,760
canis was whom they share one of their

1117
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,760
key pollinators

1118
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,359
and maybe individual pollinators too

1119
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,079
bats can certainly go up and down in

1120
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:21,199
elevation

1121
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,280
in a way an individual plant can't um

1122
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:26,000
and and this and canis is of course

1123
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,400
occurring in parapatria to them

1124
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,639
and so this is a really stunning result

1125
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,599
with very close relatives sharing

1126
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:34,639
pollinators

1127
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:37,039
in close geographic proximity

1128
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:39,358
it's further this pattern is further

1129
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:41,679
supported by phylogeographic results

1130
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:44,078
and we find whether we're applying sort

1131
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:44,799
of this astral species tree framework we

1132
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,240
see

1133
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,320
we have really strong support for

1134
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:51,199
monofilament of each of these species

1135
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,079
and we do a pca of the snip data as well

1136
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:54,078
we see that

1137
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,359
they're really sort of in different

1138
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,400
parts of

1139
00:37:55,358 --> 00:38:00,000
of that pca space so real strong support

1140
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,400
for monophylee

1141
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,320
but when we analyze the snip data in a

1142
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,280
population context look for potential

1143
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,200
intragression

1144
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,119
we don't see a whole lot of evidence of

1145
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:11,118
introgression within this system

1146
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,720
sure there might be some cases of

1147
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,760
individuals that are

1148
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:18,000
um maybe the product of hybridization

1149
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,240
or introgression but it doesn't seem

1150
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,880
like hybridization is swamping out

1151
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:23,118
everything

1152
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,680
in the system like you might predict if

1153
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,800
um these were closely relative

1154
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:30,719
related species sort of swamp um that

1155
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,400
didn't have reproductive isolation

1156
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:34,000
involved and so of course

1157
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,480
we want to know whether or not at this

1158
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,880
point if this is if these individuals

1159
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,320
reflect recent introduction or maybe

1160
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,800
this is sort of

1161
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,320
ancestral sorting um and we're still

1162
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,320
analyzing this data

1163
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,640
but a really interesting result that we

1164
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,000
have that's sort of hard to reconcile

1165
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:52,239
with that last slide

1166
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,400
is that using a method that looks at

1167
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:56,000
phylogenetic invariants to find

1168
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,440
hybridization or evidence of

1169
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,159
hybridization we find really strong

1170
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,000
support for

1171
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:02,159
hybrid origin essentia program and

1172
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,159
donuts just sort of

1173
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:05,679
um counter-intuitive too because it's

1174
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:07,598
the species that's sort of

1175
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:09,759
the most different i was actually

1176
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:13,440
expecting that this species might be

1177
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:15,040
a hybrid but if this is the case

1178
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,800
a pattern that would be consistent with

1179
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:20,239
our structure results

1180
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:23,039
on the last slide here and this is a

1181
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:25,759
pattern in which um central pokemon

1182
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:27,119
mandonis arose via aloe polyploidy

1183
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,880
between two species

1184
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,559
and then through time was able to evolve

1185
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,119
sort of these private snips

1186
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:33,920
um and of course if aloe polyploidy is

1187
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,920
invoked

1188
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,599
is actually what's at play reproductive

1189
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,079
isolation would have happened at the

1190
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,760
time

1191
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,839
of origination and so this is a

1192
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,160
potential um

1193
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:46,159
that we are currently investigating into

1194
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:48,480
what may be allowing these three species

1195
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:51,679
to co-exist

1196
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,119
but as we continue to analyze this data

1197
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:55,199
we still have strong evidence that

1198
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,599
whether or not reproductive they're

1199
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:58,319
completely reproductively isolated or if

1200
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,359
it's

1201
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:04,000
um or if they are still

1202
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:05,920
able to have gene flow we do know that

1203
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,679
pollen transfer is being minimized by

1204
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,200
morphological traits

1205
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:10,879
here we see that center pogon

1206
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:13,039
brittonianis and mendonus have

1207
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,680
significantly different stamen lengths

1208
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:14,880
and this is

1209
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:17,519
of course important because it

1210
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,440
determines placement of pollen on those

1211
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:21,119
fat and hummingbird bodies

1212
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,599
but this difference is very much

1213
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,880
exaggerated in sympatry

1214
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,640
we have about ten percent shorter

1215
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,920
statements than central poverty of

1216
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:30,400
central program mendonas when it

1217
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,000
co-occurs with brittonianis

1218
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,920
and so in this system it seems like

1219
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,920
there's differential pollinator use

1220
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,119
that's mediated by key differences in

1221
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,240
floral shape

1222
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,400
um and and likely in competitive

1223
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:44,799
uh reproductive incompatibility that's

1224
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,280
due to potential hybrid origin of one of

1225
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,119
the

1226
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,480
players here that allows these three

1227
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:51,200
species to

1228
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,880
co-occur in close geographic proximity

1229
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:55,199
in this really complex region

1230
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,240
providing some insight into what at a

1231
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:58,439
clade level

1232
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:59,598
may be driving this pattern of rapid

1233
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,079
diversification

1234
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:04,318
and sort of high species richness in the

1235
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,640
andes

1236
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:08,239
we're continuing to look at this

1237
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:09,519
intersection of microevolution and

1238
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:11,838
species ecology

1239
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:13,920
in the context of pollinator evolution

1240
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:15,440
in in this clade and here we're really

1241
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,358
interested especially

1242
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,639
in that origin of the obligate

1243
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:19,679
interaction with the sickle-built

1244
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:20,960
hummingbird

1245
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:23,039
and in this case we're not just

1246
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,639
interested in the relationship between

1247
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:26,960
central or central pogon and the

1248
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:29,759
hummingbird but its entire

1249
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,119
um suite of food plants which also

1250
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,119
includes heliconia

1251
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,960
which again i study as an undergrad of

1252
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,599
chelsea and so

1253
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,240
um two members of my lab janet and laura

1254
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,680
are busy

1255
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:41,519
working on the system janet's

1256
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:43,358
establishing a phylogenetic

1257
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:45,280
framework for this clay they use central

1258
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:47,279
paragonic clay that's pollinated

1259
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,400
for the most part but not exclusively

1260
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,640
bicycle bills

1261
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,200
and laura's been really diving into it a

1262
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:55,519
system within costa rica

1263
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:57,519
here we have central pogon granulosus

1264
00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:01,199
this curvy flowered species

1265
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:02,880
sister to center pokemon celenofolius

1266
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:04,399
these two species have really different

1267
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,079
floral well different enough floral

1268
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,318
morphology that it suggests

1269
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,760
that sense of prolonged granulosus

1270
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:11,920
relies on a single

1271
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,160
um hummingbird within its pollinator

1272
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,720
community whereas the lanifolius might

1273
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:19,440
rely on up to six species of

1274
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:20,239
hermit hummingbirds with curved bills

1275
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,079
and

1276
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:25,358
um and again we have this situation

1277
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,039
where we have sister species

1278
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:28,159
co-occurring with these really important

1279
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:31,199
differences

1280
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:34,000
in floral shape and so laura

1281
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:36,078
wanted to understand what might be

1282
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,838
allowing these two species to co-occur

1283
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,760
so she took measurements across

1284
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:42,159
uh from herbarium specimens that have

1285
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,480
been collected in monte verde costa rica

1286
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:46,239
uh where these two species occur they

1287
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,318
overlap at mid elevations but

1288
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:50,479
centripetal and celenofolius these

1289
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:52,800
circular dots goes higher up on the

1290
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,800
mountains than centropogon granulosus

1291
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,039
the squares which go lower down the

1292
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,000
mountains and laura did see a little bit

1293
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:00,559
of overlap in the

1294
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
floral amorphous space between the two

1295
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:04,000
um

1296
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,239
you see sort of especially around here

1297
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,719
you see a little bit of overlap between

1298
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:10,318
those circles and those squares however

1299
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,959
where species do co-occur in the

1300
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:13,119
mountain

1301
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,159
we don't see any overlap we see this gap

1302
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,318
in morphology

1303
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:17,598
and so this is again a pattern

1304
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:19,920
consistent with

1305
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,440
um character displacement following a

1306
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,079
recent speciation

1307
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,280
and had everything on the way that we

1308
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,200
had expected

1309
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,119
um and i wasn't giving a talk on zoom

1310
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:31,118
today we would have been in

1311
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,358
in costa rica over the summer collecting

1312
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,200
pollinator data and population genetic

1313
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:36,480
data for the system to really test that

1314
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:39,279
hypothesis

1315
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,000
but hopefully soon and we really think

1316
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,079
this is a great

1317
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,239
system to integrate macro and micro

1318
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,359
evolution with ecology

1319
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:47,358
and again because we know the

1320
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:50,400
systematics we're able to ask some

1321
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:52,318
really focused questions

1322
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,400
and so most of my talk so far is really

1323
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:57,440
focused on that first prong that really

1324
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,800
deep um dive into a single clade and i'm

1325
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,800
just gonna end my talk

1326
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,240
by um telling you a little bit of the

1327
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,280
research you're doing on more of that

1328
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,598
broadside and

1329
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,000
the taxonomy and evolution of nature

1330
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:11,359
understudy neotropical plant lineages

1331
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,440
including these guys here so my lab is

1332
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:14,159
busy establishing the first phylogenys

1333
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,880
for these

1334
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:17,679
clades here fresiera and the pentaphilic

1335
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,680
casey

1336
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:21,199
in the eric haleys a lot of people don't

1337
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:23,919
know that family

1338
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:25,679
marissa casey or otoba in the nutmeg

1339
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,880
family marissa casey

1340
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:31,199
uh helia and pele correa in the um

1341
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,440
coffee family rubiaceae in this high

1342
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:34,799
elevation endemic genus of millistones

1343
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,159
and brachiodam

1344
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,160
and these groups are really good

1345
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:38,799
compliments to neotropical bell flowers

1346
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:40,879
because they have

1347
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,880
different natural history different

1348
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,039
environmental preferences different

1349
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,000
ecological interactions and so we'll be

1350
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:49,279
able to

1351
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,159
compare how they're responding to

1352
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,560
the different aspects of the neotropical

1353
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:57,759
landscape to really begin to understand

1354
00:44:54,559 --> 00:45:00,559
a more integrated um perspective

1355
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,240
on on the a tropical plant evolution and

1356
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:03,039
i'm just going to quickly show you a few

1357
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:05,039
of

1358
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:07,759
the examples of the impact of the andes

1359
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:10,079
on diversification in this group

1360
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,760
so for example in brachiodam that diego

1361
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,318
is working on

1362
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,800
he sees that species ranges to be really

1363
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:18,000
really

1364
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,640
narrow um even those fema species tend

1365
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,079
to be

1366
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:21,920
really really different in close

1367
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,440
proximity and what this suggests to us

1368
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,639
these species ranges

1369
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,720
is that once diego finally gets that um

1370
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:29,920
that phylogeny he's currently working on

1371
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:32,239
that we're gonna see

1372
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,039
that's um the andes have been a real

1373
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:37,358
motor for speciation that alopatry

1374
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:39,119
um in durian mountain uplift and

1375
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:41,920
plasticine glaciations has probably

1376
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,720
driven evolution in this clade

1377
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,559
however in other lineages such as otoba

1378
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:47,519
which is more of a low cloud forest

1379
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:49,440
clade

1380
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:50,800
we see that the andes instead are really

1381
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,599
important biogeographic

1382
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,119
barrier since the evolution of this the

1383
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:57,680
origin of this clay that hopped over

1384
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:00,000
from africa about 5 million years ago

1385
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:01,358
um it's only been able to cross the

1386
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,039
andes a single time

1387
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:05,039
which makes some sense these are really

1388
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:06,639
big big fruits that are

1389
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:08,639
pollinated by big body birds and

1390
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:09,838
primates so those don't cross mountains

1391
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:12,000
very often

1392
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:13,440
but the single time otoba has been able

1393
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,599
to hop over the andes

1394
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,440
it became very well established and has

1395
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,240
become one of the 10 most ecologically

1396
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,960
dominant

1397
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:26,479
sp um genera in the western amazon

1398
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,000
and of course and helia that my grad

1399
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,400
student lemon lemon's working on

1400
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,318
she has really good evidence that the

1401
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,920
different ecological interactions that

1402
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:36,318
these species can have

1403
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,200
are really different depending on what

1404
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:39,519
the environment

1405
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:42,000
within the neotropics you're in and sort

1406
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:44,000
of unlike in central pogon where we see

1407
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,199
hummingbird and bat pollinated species

1408
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,239
going crazy

1409
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:50,719
in cloud forests instead she sees that

1410
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:51,919
um hawk moths gonna be really important

1411
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:54,639
pollinators

1412
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,559
in cloud forests which really gets to

1413
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:57,920
the fact that while we are searching for

1414
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:00,239
generalities

1415
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,358
in in andy and plant evolution

1416
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:02,479
throughout our research

1417
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:04,719
there are also going to be a lot of

1418
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,039
wonderful idiosyncrasies that we find

1419
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:06,799
and

1420
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:08,960
it's really by comparing differences

1421
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:12,318
between clades that will be able to tell

1422
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,519
a fully integrated um story of andy and

1423
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:15,279
plant evolution

1424
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:17,519
but i hope i've convinced you that the

1425
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,000
andes sort of their continental scale

1426
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:20,960
and that opportunity for local

1427
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,599
adaptation

1428
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,720
and tons of aloe patriot is really one

1429
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,240
of the key reasons

1430
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:31,519
why the neotropics are so diverse

1431
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:34,159
and while i love to do fieldwork in this

1432
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:36,159
amazingly beautiful part of the world i

1433
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:38,879
actually end up spending more of my time

1434
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:41,519
in herbaria and today i told you about

1435
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,000
taxonomic data morphological data

1436
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:44,800
distribution data and dna sequence data

1437
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,199
that i got

1438
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,640
all from herbarium specimens herbarium

1439
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:51,519
specimens are so important

1440
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:52,000
in becoming literate in a group to be

1441
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:54,000
able to

1442
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,679
ask to pose these these big mac

1443
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,119
revolutionary questions and they're

1444
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:00,960
continuingly broad source of data um

1445
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,680
of very different types as well and so

1446
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:06,720
it's been really great being able to be

1447
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:07,919
um to spend time in her barrier and so

1448
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:09,679
with that i'm going to say

1449
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,039
thank you including to those

1450
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:12,960
institutions that

1451
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:14,639
i visited to be able to collect the data

1452
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,358
those are very listed below

1453
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:18,239
i want to acknowledge my amazing lab

1454
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:20,799
whose

1455
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:22,399
um sort of diverse perspectives and just

1456
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,920
the ways they approach science have

1457
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,079
really pushed me as a scientist

1458
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,000
and as a mentor and of course i also

1459
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:31,119
have fantastic co-authors

1460
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
and have had luck in the field and with

1461
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:34,880
funding

1462
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,480
and so with that i have no idea if i oh

1463
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,079
i think i might have time for questions

1464
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,000
i can take any questions if you don't

1465
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:40,800
want to ask a question in this public

1466
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,199
zoom format

1467
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,119
feel free to shoot me a question um at

1468
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:45,838
my email address up here or find me on

1469
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,800
twitter

1470
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:50,639
um and i'm happy to talk one-on-one as

1471
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,920
well

1472
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:55,199
so thank you i think i have to leave

1473
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,680
this to see if there are any chat

1474
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:57,679
questions

1475
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,720
this is um the clap emojis make me happy

1476
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,079
yeah so if anyone wants to ask any

1477
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,639
questions feel free to unmute and ask a

1478
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:16,240
question

1479
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:19,519
um or uh you can place it into the chat

1480
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:21,039
i i have a question uh hi hi laura can

1481
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:24,159
you hear me

1482
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:27,920
i can't uh this is gaura hi

1483
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:28,719
hi um so we uh in our discussion we

1484
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,880
spoke about

1485
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:33,118
how self-compatibility has evolved in

1486
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,440
insulin hybridities in this area

1487
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,640
and actually there are two species that

1488
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,159
have passed the

1489
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:41,039
amount of zone again in solanum which

1490
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:43,199
have

1491
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:44,719
evolved from self-incompatibility to

1492
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:46,078
compatibility

1493
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:48,719
because they have been moving through

1494
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,760
the andes and i was wondering what is

1495
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:52,799
the general

1496
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:55,920
frequency of of shifting from

1497
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,800
not just the pollination modes but also

1498
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,119
from self-con

1499
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,318
incompatibility to compatibility in in

1500
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:03,599
different systems

1501
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:06,079
if you come across that information

1502
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,800
that is such a good question and one of

1503
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,160
those so

1504
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,839
this morning when we were talking i was

1505
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:11,358
like i wish i had that data for all

1506
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:13,440
these species because the system you're

1507
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:15,838
working on you do have so much data

1508
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:18,000
unfortunately i don't have all that data

1509
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:21,039
but i can tell you that in general

1510
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,400
species of labelity tend to be

1511
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:27,920
um self-compatible but they tend to not

1512
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,358
be self-pollinated often because of the

1513
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:33,358
morphology of their flower

1514
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:35,358
and so um these are um

1515
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:36,480
two-phase flowers first we have it in

1516
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:38,799
male phase

1517
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,159
and that's first this is actually really

1518
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,359
early female phase

1519
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:44,239
but um when i wonder if there's a better

1520
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:46,078
slide for this

1521
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:47,759
well we're gonna use this pretend that

1522
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,800
and you don't see that sigma

1523
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,359
popping out there and so there is a this

1524
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,160
phase

1525
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:54,719
where pollen's gonna be taken out of the

1526
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:58,558
flower

1527
00:50:54,719 --> 00:51:01,118
first and um only after that

1528
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:03,359
do we see the the stigma coming out and

1529
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:05,599
opening and being receptive and usually

1530
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:09,039
that stigma doesn't come out until

1531
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:11,838
pollen has been um shed

1532
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:12,880
completely and in fact it's part of part

1533
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:16,719
of like the

1534
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:19,119
a constraint of growth of that um

1535
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:21,598
the stigma column is that it's pushing

1536
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:25,119
against pollen and until pollen release

1537
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:27,200
is is released it can't really grow out

1538
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,720
and so that's sort of my frustrating

1539
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:30,159
answer is i don't think shifts are going

1540
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:32,239
to be super important

1541
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:34,639
but it has definitely not been studied

1542
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:36,719
in much detail i can tell you that there

1543
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:39,279
are hybrids between species so it looks

1544
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:42,639
like it can be fairly hard to evolve

1545
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,839
or it's not always speciation

1546
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:46,000
isn't always associated with

1547
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:48,078
reproductive isolation in this group

1548
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,318
and i think that my postdoc advisor

1549
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,200
nathan muchal is looking at these sort

1550
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:53,199
of

1551
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:54,719
potential for hybridization across

1552
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:55,358
species which might give some insight

1553
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:58,399
into that

1554
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:59,519
but we really don't know anything about

1555
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,880
median system in

1556
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:06,000
in this group thank you

1557
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:09,119
yeah i wish we did that hi laura

1558
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,920
this is joyce can you hear me i can how

1559
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,440
are you doing hi

1560
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,880
thank you for that great talk that was

1561
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,760
really inspirational it's really nice to

1562
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,240
see you

1563
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,440
um i wrote down two questions one of

1564
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:18,719
which you answered

1565
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,800
while you were talking which is always

1566
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:23,439
great and then the second question

1567
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,640
um was about the the the three species

1568
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,000
that you looked at

1569
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:28,558
uh with the red yellow and white colors

1570
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,920
and then

1571
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,760
it's really interesting results there do

1572
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,440
you ever the first question

1573
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,280
pertaining to that is do you see

1574
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:38,159
intermediate colors between those three

1575
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,280
species um that's one question and i

1576
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:42,000
asked that because

1577
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,400
uh you said this kind of briefly that

1578
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,280
when

1579
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,000
two of those species are in sympatry um

1580
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,079
the

1581
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,119
the stigma length are are more

1582
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:50,880
exaggerated

1583
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,720
could do you also see other floral

1584
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,318
traits related to their pollination

1585
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:55,439
syndrome that are also exaggerated such

1586
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:57,039
as the color

1587
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,240
or is that data not really possible

1588
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:00,318
because you're mostly working with

1589
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,959
herbarium specimens to get like kind of

1590
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:03,599
enough

1591
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,519
enough data that's a that's a really

1592
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,599
great question and i will say that there

1593
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:09,199
is a lot of color variation within these

1594
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:10,240
species i'm going to come right back to

1595
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:12,639
the play but

1596
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:14,799
really quickly to show you sort of this

1597
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:16,960
is all variation within central pogon

1598
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,280
britoniana so it can be

1599
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,318
and and you know the other extra like it

1600
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,160
can be

1601
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:24,318
pure cream and it can go all the way to

1602
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:26,799
like trying to look like mandonis

1603
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:28,000
but plenty of more characters support

1604
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,720
that so there's a lot of variation

1605
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,920
within inbridge honeanus which and i

1606
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:33,598
wouldn't be surprised

1607
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,200
we did see quite a few hummingbirds and

1608
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:38,480
bats visiting the species

1609
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:40,879
and um and i do think in this

1610
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,159
you know in our data it was hummingbirds

1611
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,240
bats were both important so i think

1612
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:46,000
that's being a signal here

1613
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:47,598
but flower color was also something we

1614
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,239
were hoping to look at a little bit more

1615
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,440
in detail

1616
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:55,039
in this um incandesce species as well

1617
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:56,639
um so initially in my postdoc i wanted

1618
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:59,039
to go you know

1619
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:01,039
do what all young optimistic

1620
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:02,960
evolutionary biologists want to do and

1621
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:06,400
go show that there's some patrick

1622
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,920
evolution sympatric speciation going on

1623
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,200
because when i was a graduate student i

1624
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,880
collected these two

1625
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:15,039
individuals in the same um popular well

1626
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,318
in the same habitat like basically very

1627
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:18,159
next to each other

1628
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:20,480
and this had wide flowers that were

1629
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:22,078
stinky and white and this had narrow

1630
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,559
flowers that were pink

1631
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:26,240
and so um unfortunately when i went back

1632
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,119
to bolivia to do field work this had

1633
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:29,919
been taken

1634
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:31,358
over by canna actually hannah bengia and

1635
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,559
others under bureaus

1636
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:36,159
um and so it just you know that that

1637
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,720
question the ability to ask that

1638
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:39,838
question

1639
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:42,159
specifically disappeared in between 20 i

1640
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:44,078
think 2010 and 2015.

1641
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:45,759
but i think that color evolution and

1642
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,000
color being a signal is really important

1643
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:51,520
in this group and in other lobilioids

1644
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,679
um including closely related burmeistera

1645
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:54,719
also in iocroma and salinase the

1646
00:54:53,679 --> 00:54:56,798
different

1647
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:58,480
colors seem to be playing a signal to

1648
00:54:56,798 --> 00:54:59,280
the pollinator so i think it's super

1649
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,358
important

1650
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,798
and i think that in this clade for

1651
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:04,318
whatever reason the peruvian and

1652
00:55:02,798 --> 00:55:07,519
subpleta central pogon

1653
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:10,719
it does seem that it is particular part

1654
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:12,960
particularly labile and very likely

1655
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:14,879
might be one of the reasons why

1656
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,519
floral morphology can be pushed in one

1657
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,200
direction because of that plasticity

1658
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:21,838
would love to spend more time with this

1659
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:21,838
system

1660
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:26,719
thanks yeah thank you

1661
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:31,920
hi laura thanks for your talk and

1662
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,119
showing all those

1663
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:39,440
nice pictures that feel like home to me

1664
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:42,000
and i have a question about the

1665
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,559
phenology for example in that case where

1666
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,480
you have

1667
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:46,960
all these sympathetic species do they

1668
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,798
show like different

1669
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,318
time for flowering or something like

1670
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:53,920
that or they are like just

1671
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:56,960
simultaneously flowering

1672
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:58,960
um so

1673
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,039
we haven't looked at that with that much

1674
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,559
detail i can tell you so i went to the

1675
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:06,239
field twice for this research

1676
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:07,839
and in december and canis isn't flower

1677
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:08,879
and mandonis is in flower and i don't

1678
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:10,159
think for tony anna's

1679
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,640
so i do think there's a little bit of

1680
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:15,759
phenology going on but when we went back

1681
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:19,039
in march they were all in flower so

1682
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:20,720
it's not 100 um like you know

1683
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:22,318
it's not this perfect one goes on and

1684
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:24,239
the other comes on and they're sort of

1685
00:56:22,318 --> 00:56:27,119
temporally isolated

1686
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:27,919
um there is definitely overlap and we

1687
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:30,240
tried to look at

1688
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,639
herbarium specimens to see if there is

1689
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:34,719
good evidence of phases

1690
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:36,558
but there just isn't the bulk of data

1691
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:37,358
you need to really do that but i think

1692
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,720
that would be

1693
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:40,318
you know if i had more time in this

1694
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:42,239
system in addition to color i think

1695
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:44,480
looking at a full year's phonology would

1696
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:48,239
be super important as well

1697
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:50,798
and and another like quick one is

1698
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:51,519
did you find that uh like i don't know

1699
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:54,000
for example

1700
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:56,000
how how specific are those those

1701
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,159
pollinators for each species do you get

1702
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,559
like i don't know ten species of buds

1703
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:03,759
visiting the same the same species and

1704
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:07,040
the same thing for hummingbirds

1705
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,880
yeah so um we unfortunately weren't able

1706
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:10,639
to look at the bat

1707
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,480
get that species of identification

1708
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:14,639
because i didn't actually collect any

1709
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,760
um pollinators unless we didn't have the

1710
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:18,078
permits for that

1711
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,119
so but there are two species of bats

1712
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,400
that occur in the area

1713
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:24,640
and my post sacrificer who is a bat guy

1714
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:26,240
um thought that it was just one species

1715
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:30,000
but like that's only speculation

1716
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:33,039
but with the two um with

1717
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,719
with the hummingbirds uh there's only

1718
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:36,880
one species that visited

1719
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,919
uh the low elevation species and then

1720
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,599
there are two different

1721
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,440
hummingbird species that visited

1722
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:42,798
britonians and mendona so we think

1723
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,400
those two species might have been the

1724
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:46,400
entire hummingbird community at these

1725
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,400
two because it was pretty high elevation

1726
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,838
those are the only two we saw um i

1727
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,559
talked to some bird people who

1728
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:53,358
sort of confirmed that it seemed likely

1729
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,640
um

1730
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:56,960
generally i don't really think these are

1731
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:58,400
super specialized for any specific

1732
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,159
pollinator i don't think

1733
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,240
that happens often though i've touched

1734
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:04,399
on two cases in which

1735
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:06,639
there is sort of that co-evolutionary

1736
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,240
link that occurs and one would be that

1737
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:09,759
that that video i showed you from

1738
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:12,239
national geographic

1739
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:14,160
with in ecuador so cinderpoke on

1740
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:15,679
agricans with 10 centimeter long flower

1741
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:16,558
which like take out your ruler and look

1742
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:19,199
at that sometimes that's

1743
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:21,280
long that's a long flower so that's like

1744
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:24,318
a convolutionary ratchet that happened

1745
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:26,480
where there is real good specificity and

1746
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:29,759
then the other case of course is in the

1747
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:31,358
center pogon heliconia sickle bell

1748
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,280
system where it's

1749
00:58:31,358 --> 00:58:35,199
probably a one-to-many relationship

1750
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:38,240
between one bird and

1751
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:39,679
maybe five or six individuals species

1752
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:42,159
and five music species within a

1753
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:42,159
community

1754
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:48,798
that's great thank you yeah thank you

1755
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:50,318
well we're we're out of our time but i

1756
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:52,000
just want to thank laura again for

1757
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:53,599
coming and giving us this

1758
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,358
inspirational seminar i think it was

1759
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:58,000
fantastic to see so many

1760
00:58:55,358 --> 00:58:59,519
bright pictures as we move into our fall

1761
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,719
season and our bright leaves that we're

1762
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:01,838
going to have it's great to see all the

1763
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:05,519
flowers

1764
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:07,279
and um if anybody has any questions as

1765
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:09,920
laura said feel free to email her

1766
