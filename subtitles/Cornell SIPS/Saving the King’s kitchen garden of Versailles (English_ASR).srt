1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,080
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:12,798
University I'm going to uh how to I'm

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:15,559
going to take you on on two Whirlwind

4
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:18,160
tours of the garden one that

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:21,560
shows the weaknesses of the

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,278
garden and one that I hope shows our

7
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:26,439
strengths I'll then try to slow

8
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:28,920
down and talk a little bit about the

9
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:31,079
context uh of this Garden both in the

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,280
past and today

11
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:36,238
and the last part uh I hope that Don REO

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,879
will appreciate it the last part is of

13
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:42,759
my presentation will be about our

14
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:45,199
attempts to to Res to respect the past

15
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:47,320
and prepare the future that is to say

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,039
how how do we cultivate this space how

17
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,600
do we cultivate a historical garden and

18
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,198
why do we do it that

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,160
way what is it the same as in the past

20
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:58,238
or not in some sense it's public garden

21
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,919
management so here's for a whirlwind

22
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:03,478
tour of the garden first first with its

23
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,478
weaknesses then with it with its

24
00:01:03,478 --> 00:01:07,438
strengths first weakness is when you

25
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:10,319
work in the garden that's what you

26
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,879
see if you walk up the ramp that's what

27
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:15,959
you see if you walk down the steps on

28
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:18,000
the other side that's what you see if

29
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,759
you go look up that's what you see above

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,118
the peach trees if you keep walking you

31
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,519
go through a door and you see a wall

32
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:27,438
without trees that seems to be falling

33
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:28,759
well not let's say just unkempt if we go

34
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:29,919
to the back of the garden you start

35
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:31,599
seeing that the tops of the garden

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,840
Gardens the tops of the walls are not so

37
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,839
good either the bottoms of the walls

38
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,000
neither I'm not that's not good English

39
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,320
but I'll

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,040
survive the walls are

41
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:47,078
separating when we're against the trees

42
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,118
we haven't taken off the ferns or the

43
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:51,118
Mosses if you're at the bottom of the

44
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,560
wall sometimes you're not quite sure you

45
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,319
should walk through the

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,960
door if you look up you understand why

47
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:00,718
the bottom of the door is not working if

48
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,399
you walk to the very back

49
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,640
you notice I I shouldn't point this out

50
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,478
but I'm going to anyway we still have

51
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,598
asbestos in the

52
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:12,680
garden it's covered by Moss

53
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,719
though um but we have we'll have to get

54
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,680
rid of it one day this is what our

55
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:19,280
garages look

56
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,980
like we haven't replaced all the windows

57
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,919
the car model is from the

58
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:25,079
[Music]

59
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:27,079
1970s if you try to leave the garden you

60
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,640
start to see there were some reparations

61
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,519
but some of the edges are not all that

62
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:33,679
good and this is what's left of our last

63
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,439
Greenhouse from the 19th century the the

64
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,560
others were

65
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:40,919
destroyed sometimes walls actually fall

66
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,439
down this was a year ago this is the

67
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:44,238
same wall from the other

68
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:45,719
direction this is what it looks like

69
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,000
today we're getting

70
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,318
there uh it's actually a type of Youth

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,878
build program that we're going to

72
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:53,238
rebuild the wall this Summer concretely

73
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:54,039
that means I didn't spend any money to

74
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,319
do

75
00:02:54,039 --> 00:03:00,598
it uh because the entire Garden which is

76
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:05,079
I have to remember this uh 24 Acres 9 .4

77
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:08,119
hectares is um we I manage it with

78
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,200
€40,000 uh not counting salaries but the

79
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,799
total investment of how to say

80
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:15,759
functioning money is $40,000 so let's

81
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:19,879
say $50,000 for 24

82
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:22,878
Acres so and I still have to mention a

83
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:25,158
another uh another big

84
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,479
problem oh I I forgot I want to mention

85
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:30,560
something else

86
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:33,560
uh this presentation is rather

87
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,000
General and for those of you who would

88
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,039
be interested in a history of plant

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,318
selection in fruits and vegetables you

90
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:40,239
have to stay for Soho afterwards just

91
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,158
wanted to mention that and I also wanted

92
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,878
to mention that I was an undergraduate

93
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:45,598
and that when I was an undergraduate

94
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:47,798
here I never imagined I'd be coming back

95
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,639
for a second time to give a talk here

96
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,920
just thought I'd have to mention

97
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:53,438
that the biggest problem is actually not

98
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,199
all what I just showed you the biggest

99
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:57,199
problem is this the biggest problem we

100
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:00,039
have in this Garden is

101
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:02,878
drainage it was built on an old swamp

102
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:06,878
and they put in a massive drainage Pro

103
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:09,239
um system in the 17th century it hasn't

104
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:12,518
been properly kept up and so we're faced

105
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:15,439
with some real questions of uh rudis

106
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:18,079
ciation and

107
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,680
um other difficulties of that

108
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,240
type so that's those are the problems

109
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,280
but you'll notice that I use this as a

110
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,519
punctuation it's how I change from one

111
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:27,879
suff to

112
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,079
another what of our strength so let's do

113
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:30,800
another Whirlwind tour of the garden but

114
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,079
this

115
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,800
time a little bit better and we're going

116
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:40,519
to start in an early winter morning and

117
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,560
we're going to go to a late fall

118
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:46,038
afternoon so if I go towards the

119
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,600
sun I find myself in the Alleyways we're

120
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:50,000
in a regular Garden created at the end

121
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,560
of the 17th century this whole system of

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,560
perspectives of straight lines but that

123
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,079
aren't all that controlling if I go

124
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,918
forward I go toward

125
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:01,879
spring for me it's the most anxious

126
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,399
ridden part of the year I think it is

127
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:06,519
for any fruit grower uh it's not the

128
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,799
moment where I'm working the most but

129
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:11,079
it's the moment where I sleep less least

130
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,840
if I go through the door and I take a

131
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:15,399
right I go toward

132
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:17,879
summer it's the king's gate in the in

133
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:19,439
the back King's gate is the last

134
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,038
original gate this gate is the last

135
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,959
original gate of the palace ofite we're

136
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:26,240
going to see more General later you'll

137
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:28,279
see this is still the Whirlwind tour um

138
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,600
if I go around the central Basin and I

139
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:31,679
look the other way I see the cathedral

140
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,199
next door which is younger than the

141
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,639
garden the cathedral dates from 1742 the

142
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,319
garden dates from 1678 or was begun to

143
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,879
be constructed in 1678 and when and

144
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:44,080
generally when I look at this

145
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:45,959
church the first thing I want to do and

146
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,918
the only thing I really want to do in it

147
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:49,918
is go to the

148
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:52,799
top that's what the garden looked like

149
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,279
when I arrived about 10 years ago you'll

150
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,759
see a lot of

151
00:05:54,279 --> 00:06:01,198
dirt if you look at more or less the

152
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:03,960
same time of year a few years later it's

153
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,038
changed it's gotten there's a lot more

154
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:09,000
grass a lot less dirt visible a lot less

155
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:10,839
herbicide use we're going to talk about

156
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,360
that if we go towards

157
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:15,279
Autumn you can see some of our fruit

158
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,199
tree shapes some of our cabbage patches

159
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:20,679
that if you look at more closely this is

160
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:23,199
a a bardi it's a 19th middle 19th

161
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,840
century uh parat tree alth the the

162
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,079
variety of middle 19th century the

163
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:30,719
actual tree is about 140 years old a

164
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:32,439
five tiered flat isia tree we have 68

165
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,800
different fruit tree shapes in the

166
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:37,120
garden this is going towards the Autumn

167
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,360
the colors change and this is the

168
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,038
setting sun behind the creator of the

169
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,080
garden whose name was Batista

170
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:46,038
Cantini

171
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,038
punctuation those are my two Whirlwind

172
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:51,000
tours now let's try to get a bit more

173
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:54,478
specific and try to give a context try

174
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
to understand the old uses and the New

175
00:06:54,478 --> 00:07:02,360
Uses of this

176
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,720
Garden so this is of this is the palace

177
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,720
and the kitchen Garden is right

178
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,639
here a close and you see the Grand Canal

179
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:15,399
and a closer look that was a early 18th

180
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,918
century map this is a middle 19th

181
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:20,120
century uh map just because it has a

182
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:21,839
nicer closeup and nicer colors you can

183
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,399
see the kitchen Garden better you can

184
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,878
see the extent of the palace you should

185
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:26,918
realize just this is the only thing

186
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,360
that's really new about well this is a

187
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:30,318
bit mean of me to say the only thing

188
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,800
that's really new about

189
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:36,560
basically is that when you go when you

190
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,879
walk this you've walked 600 M so you've

191
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,680
walked not quite half a mile but that's

192
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:44,599
a single facade the basic innovation of

193
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,680
VSA is its size uh after that there are

194
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:49,959
some technical innovations about how to

195
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,478
make flat glass how to drain but the

196
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:54,598
basic thing about valide is just its

197
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:57,399
size so it ends up with a kitchen Garden

198
00:07:54,598 --> 00:08:00,918
which isn't an acre or two acres but 24

199
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:02,000
Acres what does it look like today

200
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:04,120
that's what it looks like today an

201
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,079
aerial view from a few years ago you can

202
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,840
see the size of the palace you can see

203
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:13,680
the the oranger which has approximately

204
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:15,839
2,500 potted large potted plants that go

205
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,120
in and out and you have the kitchen

206
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:22,839
Garden here huh with the school that's

207
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,519
in the garden along the buildings

208
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:28,560
because today it's a

209
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,719
school we'll get to that this is just

210
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,839
just to try to point out how the garden

211
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:37,479
changes this is a mid 18th century it's

212
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:39,320
upside down but you'll see why uh this

213
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:43,240
is a mid 18th century

214
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,519
map this is a mid 19th century

215
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,440
map the big difference is that aren't

216
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,959
all that obvious

217
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,000
okay here you have three Gardens it's

218
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:56,359
going to become one or

219
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,559
two here you have diagonal walls they

220
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,159
will disappear you have 11 Gardens here

221
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:03,199
we still call them the 11 Gardens but

222
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:04,919
there's only five because because some

223
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,720
of the walls got taken

224
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:11,679
out okay there are other differences but

225
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,000
basically the shape has stayed the same

226
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,519
the big difference you can see here is

227
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,879
the number of glass

228
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:19,879
houses in the mid in the mid 18th

229
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,519
century there was lots of glass uh glass

230
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:25,120
jars glass Bells I don't know you call

231
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,959
them in English CL you say CL I should

232
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,399
have know I should have known

233
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,518
that uh and lots of hot beds but there

234
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,078
weren't much there weren't many green

235
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:34,560
houses actually I think you see one on

236
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:37,000
the on the image the only Greenhouse

237
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,078
that existed at the time was right

238
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,120
here and in French the word for

239
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:44,799
Greenhouse is s s e r r e and everyone

240
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,200
thinks that that's a greenhouse

241
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,039
originally a is a place where you which

242
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,160
means that you

243
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:55,278
you reorganize no you store things and

244
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:57,559
this was the but it's not a

245
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:00,278
greenhouse it's where everything was

246
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:02,039
stocked so this this map why is it

247
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:05,200
important although it's upside down

248
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:08,199
because in 1874 which is when mid 19th

249
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,000
century I exaggerate second half uh is

250
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,440
in 1874 a a school was created in the

251
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,958
garden and since 1874 the kitchen Garden

252
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,519
is no longer under the administration of

253
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:21,559
the palace so it's been 140 years now

254
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,720
that this Garden is separate from the

255
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:26,039
palace always in a school when it was

256
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,160
first created it was the national school

257
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:33,240
of of French horiculture today it is the

258
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:35,199
uh uh national school for landscape

259
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,959
architecture this is the map we show

260
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,800
today that we give to our

261
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:42,159
visitors the idea is you come in over

262
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,559
here this is the entrance today although

263
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:47,958
the historic entrance is here you come

264
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:50,679
in here the departure is always here for

265
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:53,518
the visits but 2 three four and we take

266
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:53,519
you around the

267
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:57,480
Garden today it's no longer the

268
00:10:55,958 --> 00:11:00,039
Landscape Horticulture school it's the

269
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,360
landscape architecture school

270
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:05,599
and the logo for the school National

271
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,200
School of superior means higher

272
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,040
education it doesn't you know it doesn't

273
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,959
mean that Superior to

274
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:14,679
others it simply means that it's it's

275
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:16,958
not Elementary or secondary school after

276
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:19,838
secondary scho com super universities

277
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:22,479
are superior okay so it's part of the

278
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,120
University system uh but the logo for

279
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,800
the school is a

280
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,159
um my my English is

281
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:32,439
terrible uh is a stylized version of the

282
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:34,360
of the Central Square of the kitchen

283
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,519
garden and that for me is very important

284
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,200
because it's a question of how do you go

285
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,320
from garden to

286
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,040
landscape uh and the

287
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,200
pedagogical how to say the the

288
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,159
educational progression of the students

289
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,800
in the landscape architecture school go

290
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:52,480
from a first year about Garden creating

291
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:54,639
Gardens to a second year about larger

292
00:11:52,480 --> 00:12:00,079
Urban spaces or larger spaces and a

293
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:02,680
third year working on Coastal or uh

294
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:05,919
railroad tracks that that that that that

295
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:08,199
cross entire Landscapes so the the idea

296
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:10,719
is to go from small to large from

297
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,920
microcosm microcosm to

298
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,959
macrocosm the school is present in the

299
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:16,039
garden but you do have to understand or

300
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,919
realize

301
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:21,039
that there's some kind of fundamental

302
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:24,360
contradiction between a historical

303
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:26,519
garden and a landscape architecture

304
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,600
school

305
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:32,919
um they think of themselves as as

306
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,759
conceptor artists creators often at

307
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:38,078
least in France I'm not sure for

308
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,838
here uh they're not

309
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,239
gardeners and on the other hand there's

310
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,480
a historic Garden that tries

311
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,039
[Music]

312
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,159
to that communicates with them but in

313
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:50,559
which essentially they come and see

314
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:53,719
things occasionally here they discover

315
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,719
what soil

316
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:58,078
is and three days a year they actually

317
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,159
work in the garden this is a rare

318
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:03,000
picture

319
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,278
this is three days a year okay actually

320
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,759
it's three days a year the first year

321
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:08,320
two days a year the second year one day

322
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:11,120
a year the third

323
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,680
year so one of the main projects in

324
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,159
terms of restoring this garden and I do

325
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,120
like Landscape Architects don't get me

326
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:19,000
wrong I just want them to be more aware

327
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,120
that once they've created something you

328
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,559
have to manage

329
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,759
it uh there's a landscape architect in

330
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:27,239
France you might have heard of whose

331
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:29,480
name is j clo who had a phrase one day

332
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,959
that I really liked he said Landscape

333
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,079
Architects shouldn't be paid until 10

334
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,078
years after they've given their

335
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:38,600
project but I don't think landcape

336
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,278
artics would agree and I understand that

337
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,040
they wouldn't agree so what how do how

338
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:47,519
do how can we make these things work

339
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:51,078
together well if I try to zoom simply on

340
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,720
this picture I see this behind it and

341
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:55,319
the project to try to make this school

342
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,800
work together work with the garden

343
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,278
together is in that building in those

344
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:02,879
two buildings to take some of the spaces

345
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:05,799
that are in them and use them to create

346
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:08,480
a residency for international Landscape

347
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:10,399
Architects where they both will be

348
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,519
interested in what the in teaching with

349
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,278
the students of the school and also in

350
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,839
working with the garden the ideas that

351
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:20,240
they come and we find a space within the

352
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:22,440
garden to work with them try to to do

353
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,759
the two together so we're in the process

354
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,639
of actually raising money for this and

355
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:31,720
we've raised not that much but

356
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:32,799
some and we will start uh we're we're

357
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,399
looking for

358
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:37,000
essentially €3 million EUR and we've

359
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,000
already raised over half of it so we're

360
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,320
getting there it's not a we're well on

361
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,958
the way and we'll start construction

362
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,360
we'll start redoing because you don't

363
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,879
see it very well in this picture but

364
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,680
we'll start redoing some of the problems

365
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:52,278
on the Windows uh and at the end of the

366
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:54,319
summer and installing some of the spaces

367
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:57,120
we'll all be we we will already be

368
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,240
receiving some International artists uh

369
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,240
this fall

370
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:05,919
that's the aerial view and as usual my

371
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:07,278
punctuation because all this is very

372
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:10,198
important

373
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:12,679
but what's most important to

374
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:14,838
me is not just the

375
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:16,838
students it's the

376
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:18,959
gardeners because the space doesn't

377
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:21,079
exist without gardeners without a you

378
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,000
know a garden doesn't exist unless there

379
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:26,120
are gardeners you can have a forest you

380
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,759
can have spaces without gardeners but

381
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,560
you can't have a garden without

382
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:32,240
gardeners and and what they do when I

383
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,039
arrived in the garden 2004 both these

384
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,560
men were working Jac and fris and in

385
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:40,958
2007 2008 they retired both of

386
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,278
them and they had to be replaced well

387
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,838
the idea was to replace them before they

388
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:45,600
left so that there would be some

389
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,240
transmission and they were replaced

390
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,759
essentially by these two young

391
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,879
men who've grown a bit older since this

392
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:53,919
picture to do the same things that were

393
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,159
being done

394
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:57,278
before so we have 68 different fruit

395
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,679
tree shapes this is one that's

396
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:00,000
particular has each one has a name by

397
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:01,599
the way

398
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,120
and there actually there's we have a

399
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,199
list of over 250 that we would like to

400
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,240
make but got to keep all of them going

401
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:10,919
this is one that takes a good 25 years

402
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,318
to make it's called the

403
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:17,479
vas so that's an early 20th century

404
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:19,919
picture this is an early 21st century

405
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,519
picture this is a fruit variety from the

406
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,039
middle of the 17th century one of the

407
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:27,039
ones that was uh originally cultivated

408
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:28,278
by lantin so the creator of the garden

409
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,559
and that we still have in the Garden

410
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:33,318
today

411
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:36,239
this is a uh and that was that this is a

412
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:38,639
mid- 18th century print but this is a

413
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,159
17th century pair that we still have in

414
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,759
the Garden today and that I chose to

415
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,240
show with our

416
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,759
450 uh different historic well not just

417
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,079
historical 450 different fruit

418
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:52,318
varieties if I go to vegetables the

419
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:55,078
person who is now responsible generally

420
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:57,799
responsible what I call the the captain

421
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:59,120
is Christine Christine du I always feel

422
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:00,879
like I don't do my job properly if I

423
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,360
don't talk about the gardeners they're

424
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:05,318
the ones who are outside when it's cold

425
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,480
not me I'm here with you I hope to come

426
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:08,558
back here with this summer with her

427
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,120
we'll see if it works or

428
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:13,279
not uh somehow or rather I'm in the

429
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,678
position of a coach I try to give a

430
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:17,279
perspective I try to create a plan I try

431
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,439
to make sure that they can work but

432
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:22,359
she's the one who gets the work done

433
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,759
what do they do well with uh she's

434
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:26,639
particularly on vegetables but she also

435
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,400
takes care of the fruit uh this is the

436
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,360
the the vegetable team in their

437
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,679
different

438
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:34,359
areas of predilection whether it be

439
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,320
herbs greater production or tropical

440
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:40,759
plants for

441
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:46,038
David we use old cataloges not so much

442
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:48,759
to um recreate but to find to have ideas

443
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:53,798
about what worked then what works now so

444
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:56,839
in 1909 among the most popular tomato

445
00:17:53,798 --> 00:18:00,839
fruits were this one here uh which one

446
00:17:56,839 --> 00:18:00,839
the laa the

447
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:06,000
there it is five

448
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,200
what I'll get it and we still have it in

449
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,839
the garden

450
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,000
now we have generally we don't we every

451
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,519
year I was talking to Mr Christopher

452
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,839
Dunn this morning about how he functions

453
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:17,720
with the vegetable garden and we do much

454
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,678
the same thing actually we can't do

455
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,319
everything every year it's not possible

456
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,240
so we have about we try to have a

457
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:25,960
selection of between 300 and 400

458
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,200
vegetable varieties every year and the

459
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,759
idea is to have some that what we are

460
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,558
what we call collection we try them out

461
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:34,038
and some that we are producing and

462
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:37,759
you'll see why I talk about that in just

463
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:37,759
a moment because we sell everything we

464
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,080
produce I'm forgot where I was so we

465
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,319
have some in collection some in

466
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,558
production anywhere between 300 and 400

467
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,918
varieties every year every two years we

468
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:51,440
try to choose one that we get to know

469
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:53,759
better so we will do one year 80 tomato

470
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,640
varieties but generally we do between 25

471
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,879
and

472
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:01,080
30 we do the same thing for example for

473
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:03,440
for beans this is a late 18th century uh

474
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:05,399
drawing we have beans just want to

475
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,440
remind you that it was a tropical plant

476
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,159
at one point uh we did one year we had

477
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,480
had over 100 varieties of beans and

478
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:12,559
everybody thinks that these are in terms

479
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,120
of the people who come to visit the

480
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:17,158
garden yes they're also for the

481
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:19,519
gardeners because for them to know about

482
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:21,640
being they have to try them out and if

483
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,759
we want to be able to answer questions

484
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,360
from our from our visitors we have to

485
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,000
have the knowledge so if we only stick

486
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,798
on the 15 or 20 Bean varieties we're

487
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,440
used to we can't answer the questions

488
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:35,558
that people come to see us so every year

489
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:38,960
we try to take eggplant or Peppers or

490
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:42,798
scallions onions we try to do every year

491
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,919
try to try out as many as we can find

492
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:46,079
but generally in terms of what we

493
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:49,840
produce for

494
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:52,199
regular um production we're we're about

495
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:54,558
100 varieties but we go up to 300 or 400

496
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,480
depending on on the Year we're doing but

497
00:19:54,558 --> 00:20:00,119
we're not just fruits and

498
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:04,720
vegetables there is a small group one or

499
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:07,359
two gardeners who work on General uptake

500
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,880
we have a small do you say

501
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:12,199
Rosary you say we have a small Rosary of

502
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,520
about 60 different varieties we have

503
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,400
about 800 different taxons of ornamental

504
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:19,960
plants on purpose or not on purpose

505
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,679
they're there the older person who was

506
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,038
there in 2004 the younger person who's

507
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,159
there

508
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:29,480
now we have a young team what do they

509
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:35,679
take care of well we have this 200 long

510
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:37,798
meter Terrace that has two sides of

511
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,720
boxwood that's what it looks like in

512
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:42,679
Winter that's what it looks like in

513
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,720
summer that's already a bit of work and

514
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:46,600
there's box in many other parts of the

515
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,279
garden as well that needs to be taken

516
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:49,279
care of is there a boxwood blight here

517
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:51,918
as

518
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,839
well I I want to tear them up

519
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,440
anyway they smell like piss in the

520
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,720
summer uh in the

521
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,120
spring and they're totally unproductive

522
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,400
and they're not existent in in this

523
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,519
Garden in the 17th century they were

524
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,000
introduced in the 19th and I want to

525
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:08,519
replace them by herbal uh aromatic

526
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,640
herbal borders the gardeners are in

527
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:13,519
revolt against me uh because it's more

528
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,278
work and basically that's the only thing

529
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,879
I can say about box is that the reason

530
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:20,200
box exists is it's less work than the

531
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,760
rest I hope the people who like box

532
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,679
don't disagree too much but I haven't

533
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:27,679
found another reason for box

534
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:29,320
yet we have a fretum which is in some

535
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,919
sense what's left over from the

536
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:33,119
Horticultural school when it was there

537
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,679
and these are two of my favorite plants

538
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:37,038
in the fruit ofum we have so 174

539
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,798
ornamental shrubs that are stuck in a

540
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:44,200
corner of the garden that's a zanto

541
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:45,400
simul which is a Sichuan pepper and a P

542
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,038
with my French

543
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:51,278
accenta so ponus whatever all the orange

544
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,679
trees are are grafted on but it makes

545
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:59,038
great yellow fruit that you can grate or

546
00:21:53,679 --> 00:22:00,600
use to aromatize to ARA to flavor

547
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,400
uh jams and I'll talk about that in a

548
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:05,079
little while too but the real point of

549
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,159
all these gardeners is

550
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:08,439
this the real point of this kitchen

551
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,880
Garden has always been to be a kitchen

552
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,400
Garden because so far that's not what

553
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,360
I've shown

554
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,360
you we produce about 40 tons of fruit we

555
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:18,038
produce about 20 25 tons of vegetables

556
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:19,000
and it all gets sold in a small space at

557
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:21,839
the

558
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,440
entrance some people think that's a lot

559
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:27,439
I think it's very little for 24

560
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,200
Acres uh the gardeners think it's a lot

561
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,880
of work and I understand that

562
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,640
but I did a simple calculation just the

563
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:38,278
other day if I take 40 tons of fruit and

564
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:42,038
I transform about 15 into juice and

565
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:47,038
jam that only leaves me with 25 tons if

566
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:49,038
I have a 10% loss 20% loss storage

567
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:51,720
everything else I'm down to 20 tons and

568
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:53,759
if I try to do that over 52 weeks I come

569
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,079
out with only 1 kilos a

570
00:22:53,759 --> 00:23:00,440
week that's not that

571
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,439
much so 40 tons is not right

572
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:08,639
oh I'm I'm I'm I talked about jams um I

573
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:11,360
have a present for

574
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,600
Don and I have a present for Soho but

575
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,558
they'll have to choose how they want to

576
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:19,158
work this is our mug and this is two of

577
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:20,879
our Gams two pair varieties so you'll

578
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:24,320
have to choose afterwards but that's

579
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,600
what we do that's what we do that is you

580
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,639
know that is how we make our money

581
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,639
that's how we equilibrate our budget our

582
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,880
budget it's it's a public garden owned

583
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,038
by the state but we have to make a

584
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,600
living and I think that's very important

585
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:38,519
uh in terms of public garden management

586
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:40,918
the idea that a garden can be productive

587
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:44,359
can be visited and can

588
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:46,759
produce produce we do everything jams we

589
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:50,678
make the jams ourselves we also dry our

590
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:52,519
own Peppers our own uh we make our own

591
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:55,400
provance mix and we even have

592
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:57,200
Partnerships with uh a Tea Company this

593
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,038
is our mug we even have a partnership

594
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,880
with a Tea Company where where there we

595
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,119
have a particular apple variety which I

596
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,520
adore which is called and it's called

597
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:09,798
Canada Canada but nobody wants to buy

598
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:12,158
anymore in France because it's wonderful

599
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:14,000
cooked but people don't cook apples

600
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:17,320
anymore they always want to eat them

601
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,679
fresh and they want to eat them raw it's

602
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:21,798
very difficult to sell several tons of

603
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,919
this apple but it has a wonderful flavor

604
00:24:21,798 --> 00:24:25,879
and a great Aroma we found a solution we

605
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,360
sell it to a Tea Company they extract

606
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:31,278
the aroma they use it to flavor their

607
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:31,278
teas it's our biggest

608
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:38,918
seller I'm trying to remember what I

609
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:43,359
haven't told you

610
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:45,919
yet and in terms of the time

611
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:49,000
okay and once I talk about

612
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,799
food the what I think is probably the

613
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,880
most important

614
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:55,359
thing people come to this Garden because

615
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,799
it's a historic Garden they come there

616
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:59,599
because it's ver they come because Louis

617
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:02,480
the 14 and there's this image there's

618
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:04,480
this there's this

619
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,880
trademark here you have David the one

620
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,798
who likes tropical fruits and who's also

621
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,640
one of our best

622
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:11,798
ambassadors they come for that reason

623
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,679
but we want them to leave with a better

624
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:16,480
understanding of today's contemporary

625
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:19,000
Stakes

626
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,960
for fruit and vegetable production and

627
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,919
consumption how does it function I mean

628
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,880
I I I've taken groups of I used to think

629
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,759
this wasn't true but I've taken groups

630
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,240
of not so young children into the garden

631
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,038
and shown them the potato plant and had

632
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:35,558
them say to me where's the

633
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:37,960
potato and I've shown them uh pea plants

634
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:39,720
and and I've even taken adults into the

635
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,600
garden and showed them a spinach plot

636
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,960
and the person said I wear the spinach

637
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:46,278
and I realized that the person could

638
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,640
recognize it when it was on a on a shelf

639
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:50,038
because it was separated it was only

640
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:52,120
spinach but when it was mixed in with

641
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:54,119
galinsoga or with something else and it

642
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:55,519
was close to the ground they couldn't

643
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,439
recognize it so basically when they come

644
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:58,918
in the garden they come to see historic

645
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,120
Garden we want them to leave with a

646
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:01,480
better understanding of fruits and

647
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:05,439
vegetables so that's what I'm going to

648
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:08,038
try to do now this is David talking to a

649
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,798
group this is what we try to show to our

650
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:13,079
groups this is an exhibition I did in 20

651
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:16,319
we did in 2007 about fruit varieties it

652
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:18,839
was an ex we took uh three editions of a

653
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,278
book a s a book from 1768 was

654
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:22,398
republished in the early 19th century

655
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:24,398
and we tried to put the varieties that

656
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:26,439
were in the book out and we tried to

657
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:28,599
show that the three versions of the same

658
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,960
book didn't describe them the same way

659
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:31,359
and that somehow or other people should

660
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,159
give up on trying to give a specific

661
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:36,639
name to a

662
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:38,360
variety we did an exhibition about beans

663
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,159
where I discovered something rather

664
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:43,719
important for me at

665
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:46,278
least industrial how to say those beans

666
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,640
string green beings that were breed to

667
00:26:46,278 --> 00:26:50,720
flour at the same time be harvested at

668
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,840
the same time to stand up

669
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:57,038
to uh transformation into whatever are

670
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:58,720
often not good when you eat them after

671
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:00,000
transformation but but when they're

672
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,159
actually out there and you eat them

673
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
fresh you can pick them yourself they're

674
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,120
actually excellent so the problem really

675
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,640
is on the the processing side because

676
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:10,398
some of the the industrial varieties

677
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,440
that everybody is screaming about that

678
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:13,558
they're not good when they're in the

679
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,880
processed food can be excellent when

680
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:18,038
they're in the field and that was I

681
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,720
thought that in terms of trying to

682
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:22,000
understand how our agriculture functions

683
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:25,399
that's an important point to say that

684
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
modern varieties are not necessarily bad

685
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:28,879
they can have some real interest

686
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,599
including taste the question is how

687
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,200
they're used afterwards so maybe we have

688
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:36,558
to not just yell at the farmers we have

689
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,919
to try to educate people to cook

690
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,398
better we did an exhibition this was

691
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:42,559
purely for the landscape architecture

692
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:44,398
students this was my this was this is

693
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:46,759
what I call thumbing my

694
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:50,719
nose we did an exhibition about

695
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:53,200
pollination because I was tired of

696
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,079
getting comments about Landscape

697
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,319
Architects who didn't know about plants

698
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:58,319
being

699
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:00,319
allergenic and I did a presentation in

700
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,839
front of the Board of Trustees of the

701
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:05,398
school and I mentioned a landscape

702
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:07,759
architect who had populated a who had

703
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:10,158
planted a school yard with lots of beach

704
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:12,038
lots of birch trees and birch trees are

705
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,559
among the most allergenic what I didn't

706
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:15,278
know when I did this presentation was

707
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:18,398
that the president of the Board of

708
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:20,679
Trustees was that landscape

709
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:22,158
architect but it still went over fine

710
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:24,519
because the students did learn that

711
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,519
plants were

712
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,720
allergenic how to bring people to the

713
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:32,200
garden we have we've been having this

714
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,720
will be be our eighth or ninth year we

715
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,880
have a it's a school it's a school of

716
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,960
landscape architecture we have a a

717
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,039
festival a modern art festival in a in a

718
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,159
historical Garden every year it's

719
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:45,480
essentially dance it's essentially

720
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,080
conceptual

721
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,880
dance uh in a movement in France called

722
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:52,480
non

723
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,960
dance and I think that's wonderful I

724
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,120
think it's a great example of bringing

725
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,558
people to a historical space to remind

726
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:59,398
them this historical space is always

727
00:28:57,558 --> 00:29:01,798
about being being new it's not about

728
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:04,199
being old and when it was created it was

729
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:05,839
created to be new so let's keep using it

730
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,880
as a space that's

731
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:11,439
new every year we have a annual Harvest

732
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,919
Festival you can't do without it it's

733
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,278
the moment of the Year where we have the

734
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:18,120
most amount of things to sell and so we

735
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:19,960
need a lot of people to buy them and

736
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:22,678
it's also the moment where we can show

737
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,720
the most diverse things of what we do so

738
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:28,679
every year first weekend of October we

739
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,640
try to present the 70 or 80 varieties of

740
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:32,600
fruit that are still available that we

741
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,799
can sell at that point and as many

742
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:37,319
varieties of

743
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:39,599
vegetables this is an example and this

744
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:42,398
is where we get to how do we cultivate I

745
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:42,398
look at the hour

746
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,720
we most people will see Lou burn which

747
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,200
is one of my favorite pairs on the left

748
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,399
and Cal blon which is one of my favorite

749
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,278
apples on the right I often compare Cal

750
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:56,719
blon to Jonah gold as the example as the

751
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:59,159
difference between bordo and

752
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,038
California uhoh I I got myself into a

753
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:02,760
now I tell you why I I do I don't

754
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:07,000
usually say that one

755
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:10,200
but California wine this was where there

756
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,079
no there he is for me it's big juicy

757
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,798
fruit right away it's wonderful it's

758
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:16,879
it's it's it's how to sayon it's a it's

759
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:18,839
explo it's an explosion and if you're

760
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,720
used to

761
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:23,798
California and you drink a generally

762
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,278
you're disappointed it's like what you

763
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:29,639
know it's not as big it's

764
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:31,079
not Jonah gold you taste it it explodes

765
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,679
in your mouth it's a it's it's a

766
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:35,759
wonderful Apple you taste the Cal and

767
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:39,200
the first thing you say is oh it's an

768
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:41,519
apple and then 30 seconds later you say

769
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,840
wait there's still a taste there there's

770
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:45,720
a little bit of fennel there's there's a

771
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:47,639
little bit of mint but there's the apple

772
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,839
is strong and then 2 minutes later it's

773
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,559
still in your nose and you're saying

774
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:52,759
what what's it still doing

775
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:55,879
there that's the difference between a

776
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:58,919
California cab and a bordo

777
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,880
cab Cal but that's not I see I'll show

778
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:03,240
you what I see I hope that some of you

779
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,240
see it

780
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:09,678
too how many people see apples repairs

781
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:13,158
on the market with

782
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:15,480
scab that's what we do all the time and

783
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:16,480
I hope that people can get used to it

784
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,720
we're not

785
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,519
organic but we do spray and even if we

786
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,079
do spray with non with Organic they

787
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:28,638
still have to get dressed up that way

788
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:31,278
and uh we call it our chernobil suits

789
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:33,398
and how do you do that in a public

790
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:35,440
garden above and beyond I do not know

791
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:38,959
the the the regul the how to say the the

792
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,639
rules in the States but in our case uh

793
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,600
there's even on copper sulfate there's a

794
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:47,278
24-hour limit before going on to how do

795
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:49,038
you do that in a public garden that's

796
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:51,159
open seven days a

797
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:53,599
week and how do you do it when you're in

798
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:55,639
a public garden that produces fruits and

799
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:57,359
vegetables and next to the trees you

800
00:31:55,638 --> 00:31:58,558
have strawberries and just stay on

801
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,479
copper sulfate if I remember right it's

802
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:03,158
21 days before Harvest what do you do

803
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:05,079
well you can say you sprayed the trees

804
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:06,278
and not the the strawberries so you can

805
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:10,638
still bring the strawberries to the

806
00:32:06,278 --> 00:32:13,638
store ethically I'm not up for it

807
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:15,798
okay how do we do it well we find

808
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:17,398
Solutions one way or another our first

809
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:19,119
solution is we no longer treat the

810
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:20,879
Central Square where the fruit trees and

811
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:23,119
the vegetables are in the same place I

812
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:28,120
have not asked for an organic label

813
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:30,038
we've noted a 60% lowering in Harvest

814
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:31,398
uh but we're still making it and we're

815
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:35,638
going to probably do something that's

816
00:32:31,398 --> 00:32:37,719
going to shock not you but shock the the

817
00:32:35,638 --> 00:32:39,240
people I work for or the people who are

818
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,000
guarantees in terms of the state for the

819
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,440
preservation of historic monuments I'd

820
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,798
like to tear out the pear trees and put

821
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,480
in plum

822
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:49,720
trees slightly different shape two

823
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,440
arguments first of all it'll give us

824
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,919
time to know how to cultivate pear trees

825
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,080
without treating them because for the

826
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:59,559
moment we don't

827
00:32:55,079 --> 00:33:01,798
know uh and plum trees only last 20 25

828
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:02,798
years in espell shape so it's just a

829
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:05,319
time

830
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:06,720
period and the second reason is because

831
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:08,158
palm trees we can treat them during the

832
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,679
winter when we don't have many

833
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,600
visitors and they are vigorous enough to

834
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:14,519
survive most attacks until we Harvest

835
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:19,319
them in

836
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:22,240
July we'll see but it has been 320

837
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:23,319
340 years now that it's been the Central

838
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,359
Square has been cultivated with pear

839
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:26,759
trees and some people take me to be a

840
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:29,000
bit

841
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:30,638
radical the other choice of course is to

842
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
find solutions to phyto that's what I

843
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:33,439
worked on when I was here at Cornell I

844
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,880
spent hours in the lab trying to go

845
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,080
through to try to find mutant

846
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,880
spores well we do treat them with copper

847
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:43,158
sulfate but we do it very specifically

848
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,440
in specific situations and not all the

849
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:48,200
time and sometimes we even do it when

850
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,720
visitors are there because it's a way

851
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,558
for them to go and to talk to them

852
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,519
because in the states if I remember

853
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,839
right only 2% of the population is

854
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:59,359
agricultural today in France it's not

855
00:33:56,839 --> 00:34:01,839
that much more it's for

856
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:04,278
there is a a huge

857
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:07,038
educational Diffy

858
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:10,838
um challenge in terms of getting people

859
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:13,239
to know where what they eat comes

860
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:15,239
from it's also when and this is I tell

861
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:19,239
on purpose four here galinsoga is North

862
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:22,559
American Plant this is a curbit also an

863
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:26,638
North American Plant or American Plant

864
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:27,918
uh where where are the squash in there

865
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,079
have to get people used to seeing see

866
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:32,559
that too and even the gardener is happy

867
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,560
when he finds

868
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:37,440
one they react poorly to this they react

869
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:40,039
poorly to the one

870
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,320
before this is my favorite way of

871
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:45,759
dealing with weeds in a garden at least

872
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,240
in our garden I think it's perfectly

873
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,879
fine I think that if we did the entire

874
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:53,199
Garden in black plastic that's woven

875
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:54,319
though uh and biodegradable but I don't

876
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,358
think people would appreciate it either

877
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:02,039
but this is how we deal in a historic

878
00:34:56,358 --> 00:35:02,039
Garden with uh producing tomatoes

879
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:09,078
peppers we do some green

880
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:11,319
manure And when they see this they don't

881
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:12,880
understand when they see this they

882
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,119
understand a bit better but I'm not that

883
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:19,079
much more satisfied because if we have

884
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:21,519
too much filia fil whatever in the fall

885
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:22,720
we we create problems for our honey bees

886
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:25,199
because they're going to be harvesting

887
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,959
later they're not going to be able to to

888
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:28,919
dry out the nectar as long and we're

889
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,039
going to have honey that freezes so we

890
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,920
have to be careful about our green

891
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:33,920
manure as

892
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,880
well people complain when they come to

893
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,400
the garden and they see this I

894
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,920
complained to the Garden when I arrived

895
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,838
and I saw

896
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,358
this because that's how it was dealt

897
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:46,239
with before we're now at zero herbicide

898
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:48,119
use but we do have more

899
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:50,598
grass and I think the next three

900
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:52,318
pictures are probably what I would like

901
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:55,480
to show you most and probably the whole

902
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:55,480
presentation was just for these

903
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:02,479
three wonderful fruit tree shapes what

904
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:03,719
do we do with our soil this is herbicide

905
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,400
used since

906
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:09,239
1969 that's when Jack who I showed you

907
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,880
on the first picture arrived he spent a

908
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:14,919
year with a hoe in his hand and he got

909
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,960
sick of it and he started using

910
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,920
herbicides the garden was cultivated

911
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,639
with herbicides almost entirely up until

912
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,760
2004

913
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:26,118
2005 in 2006 we said we have to

914
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,160
stop but we had to find

915
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:31,720
solutions that was the first

916
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:33,358
idea but it took a lot of work

917
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:36,598
geotextile the idea was to have

918
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,799
something clean underneath the plant

919
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:40,480
something where we could still still

920
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,839
continue to see the tree because we're

921
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,039
also dealing with

922
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:45,759
Aesthetics the solution we have today is

923
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:48,079
this

924
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,720
one uh because we found a machine for

925
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:54,680
mechanical cultivation under the trees

926
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:58,000
that we adapted from fruit from Vineyard

927
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:59,719
culture we still have to mow the lawn

928
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,039
but we have other ideas for that where

929
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:03,439
we let them some of them flower but the

930
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:06,759
basic question is what are we doing in a

931
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,838
historical Garden how does this function

932
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,599
are we a professional Fruit Growers

933
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:13,559
searching for solutions for professional

934
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:17,200
fruit growing are we a historical Garden

935
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:22,078
trying to be faithful to what the people

936
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:24,838
did 300 years ago and my answer is

937
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,440
both we have to find solutions to both

938
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:28,519
300 years ago they were already

939
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:31,240
producing in large quantities for the

940
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:33,599
king's table today we have to continue

941
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:36,159
producing in large

942
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:39,079
quantities 300 years ago they had

943
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:41,039
visitors today we have visitors we have

944
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:44,119
to keep those two together we both have

945
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:46,759
to take into account modern techniques

946
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:48,960
modern uh limits and we also have to

947
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,119
remember the intentions with which it

948
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,119
was

949
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:59,039
created and for me what here the

950
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,040
difference between

951
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:05,679
this oops sorry

952
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:07,440
this picture and this picture is a

953
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:10,318
difference in how we relate to our

954
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,838
environment in the first picture we're

955
00:38:10,318 --> 00:38:14,960
producing fruits that's it we have fruit

956
00:38:12,838 --> 00:38:18,279
tree shapes we're producing fruit in

957
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,920
this picture we're managing a space and

958
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,079
as soon as we start managing a space

959
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,559
that has ideas about production we're

960
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:28,119
also producing other things we're also

961
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:29,719
taking care and this is very easy to say

962
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:31,240
and I'm sure you've heard this lots of

963
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:34,399
times but we're taking part of an

964
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:37,279
ecosystem and we're taking part of both

965
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:40,880
cultivated and wild this is one this is

966
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:43,280
the largest wild uh French solitary bee

967
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,720
Zila cook this is we have a huge

968
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:49,359
population of this

969
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:51,078
uh Med uh that nobody really understands

970
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:52,679
why we have it we have it in the garden

971
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:55,119
and I've tried to study it a little bit

972
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:58,358
and it's an interesting conundrum we

973
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,318
have it because we used herbicides

974
00:38:58,358 --> 00:39:02,960
because it likes sandy soil that doesn't

975
00:39:00,318 --> 00:39:05,880
have plant on it they want to make its

976
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,240
Burrows to make its nests and so when we

977
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:11,200
no longer use herbicide we are in part

978
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:13,039
eliminating this wild beam we'll find

979
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:16,159
we'll have to find some

980
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:20,480
solutions beneficial insects of course C

981
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:22,799
up I couldn't resist sorry for the

982
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,800
Eternal ladybug and it's

983
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,599
strawberry I always thought the walls in

984
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,079
the garden were there for

985
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,119
had to say heat that's what everybody

986
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,200
when I arrived in this Garden everyone

987
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,440
told me the walls are there to

988
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:36,399
accumulate heat I think the walls are

989
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,679
there to accumulate beneficial insects

990
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,800
and vertebrae that eat the ones we don't

991
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:43,598
want because I think in terms of the

992
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,079
heat it works it works even better when

993
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,519
you prob put the tomato plants out in

994
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:48,560
the middle of the garden and you put the

995
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:50,920
tomato plants against the wall even a

996
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:52,480
North facing wall you still have

997
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,599
healthier tomato plants I think it has

998
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,400
to do with its

999
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,960
environment we even have a hawk that I

1000
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,079
found that I got a picture of the other

1001
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,079
day so I had to include

1002
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:12,399
it I'm going to go very quickly this is

1003
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:15,519
you have to the Garden is inserted in

1004
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,920
the town on the one we have one side

1005
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:20,119
this one side is the park the three

1006
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:25,000
other sides are in the

1007
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:28,640
city so if we use some kind of General

1008
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,000
mem or uh a pyra or when we used to be

1009
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:32,440
have to use rootes you're always blowing

1010
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,400
excuse my language you're always blowing

1011
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,519
all the insects away and we have no way

1012
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,000
of recuperating them other than within

1013
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:41,679
our own garden so when you're in this

1014
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,358
kind of how to say Urban desert on one

1015
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:45,799
side or diversity desert on the other

1016
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:48,440
you have to find ways of creating

1017
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:51,400
diversity within the garden itself this

1018
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:53,559
is the fruit of Sedum this the where we

1019
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,358
have all the different shrubs that's

1020
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:56,960
part of it it looks a bit more unkempt

1021
00:40:55,358 --> 00:40:57,759
than you can imagine Vite to generally

1022
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,159
be

1023
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,520
well that's the garden I work in we've

1024
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:06,318
included some uh within the fruit

1025
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:09,759
growing areas we've included some uh

1026
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:11,199
nonproductive Hedges and we can we

1027
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,240
really see the difference between the

1028
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:14,598
side and it's not proven scientifically

1029
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:17,959
though I'd love someone to come study it

1030
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:19,760
with us uh we the impression the

1031
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,519
gardeners and I have is that the side

1032
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,119
towards the shr towards the

1033
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:26,239
nonproductive Hedge is less attacked

1034
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,680
than the one that's

1035
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:31,559
not and we've had that same experience

1036
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:33,078
with our prairies that we've sometimes

1037
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:34,119
replaced the grass with because we got

1038
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:37,240
sick of

1039
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:39,200
mowing um or rather the budget couldn't

1040
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:41,199
deal with all the mowing in this case we

1041
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:43,960
intervene three times in the year once

1042
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:46,838
to prepare once to seed and once to mow

1043
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,199
as opposed to mowing every 12 days and

1044
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:51,440
we do that in several

1045
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:53,000
places throughout the garden this is my

1046
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,280
favorite current experiment this was a

1047
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,639
picture from just 3 weeks ago um this is

1048
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:01,319
our I trans formed a space that was just

1049
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:05,159
below the offices of the director of the

1050
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:06,639
school that used to be a a lawn okay uh

1051
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:09,559
and just below the windows of the last

1052
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:12,799
year students into a permaculture

1053
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:14,759
experiment uh and it's quite I shouldn't

1054
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,839
say I the GU after working with some of

1055
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,079
the students of the school and the

1056
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:21,159
gardens this is how we transformed

1057
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:25,599
it uh so we're working and actually it's

1058
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:28,118
based on a kqu

1059
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,359
um I someone nodding their head I'm

1060
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:32,838
trying to remember his name f there's a

1061
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:34,519
a vegetable producer just outside of

1062
00:42:32,838 --> 00:42:36,799
Quebec who's written a book in both

1063
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:40,519
French and English that takes up on

1064
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:42,400
Elliot Coleman's uh book and we're using

1065
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:44,639
some of those techniques there Elliot

1066
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,800
Coleman and fan using books from the

1067
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:49,838
middle of the 19th century from Parisian

1068
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,880
gardeners we even have some not just

1069
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:55,000
insects but some geese and some chickens

1070
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,880
that help out I call them their they're

1071
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,159
our gardeners as well we have some sheep

1072
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,680
that we I hope you're not going to be

1073
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:03,199
shocked by this that we regularly kill

1074
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,598
and

1075
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:08,039
barbecue

1076
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:11,200
uh that's also part of educating in

1077
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:13,719
terms of food

1078
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:16,199
um it always gets me angry when people

1079
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:18,318
only want they don't want to see the

1080
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:19,558
carcass the angry is not the right word

1081
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:21,400
disappoints me I think we really have

1082
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:24,559
food education to be done I don't think

1083
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:26,838
everyone should be Carn carnivorous my

1084
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:28,680
companion is a vegetarian it's not a

1085
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:30,960
it's just just think about knowing where

1086
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:33,239
things come from before making

1087
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,000
decisions this is my dream actually this

1088
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:36,959
is I'm almost finished I've been pretty

1089
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,719
good uh people often think we do

1090
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,079
exhibitions for people to see outside I

1091
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:43,799
do exhibitions for I want the gardeners

1092
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,079
to see what we're doing or where we we

1093
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,960
should be going I think we could

1094
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,240
probably eliminate some of our tractors

1095
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,159
we have small garden tractors with some

1096
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:54,000
donkeys and I think we'll get there in

1097
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:55,318
the next two or three years actually

1098
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,280
because it's a it's a different

1099
00:43:55,318 --> 00:43:58,960
relationship to the space it's a

1100
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,599
different way of working and it's a

1101
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,240
great way to try to make more people

1102
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:07,318
come to this Garden to see how we do

1103
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:10,279
it don't forget it's about

1104
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:13,239
food it's about

1105
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:16,620
gardeners it's in a wonderful space and

1106
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:22,598
it will always be a school thank
