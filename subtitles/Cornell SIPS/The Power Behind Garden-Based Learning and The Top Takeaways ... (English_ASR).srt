1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,679
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,679
University so today we'll sort of have

3
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:22,879
three portions um the first portion uh I

4
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:26,599
will focus on why Garden based learning

5
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:28,079
is so important um followed by Roger's

6
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:30,518
portion where he'll talk a little bit

7
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,759
about the Cooperative Extension intern

8
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:34,878
program and then Megan will sort of wrap

9
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,759
things up with her experience from her

10
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:39,479
internship this summer in Skylar County

11
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,640
and then we'll have some time for

12
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:44,159
questions so at this time I'd really

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,480
like to know who is an attendance so if

attendance so we can talk a little bit

40
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,319
about why gardening uh kind of goes hand

41
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,520
inand with Cooperative Extension so

42
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:57,398

44
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:01,960
community Through Partnerships and our

45
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:04,239
cor Cornell garden-based learning

46
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:07,078
mission is to provide Educators with

47
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:09,478
inspiring research-based gardening

48
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:11,519
resources and professional development

49
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,160
to support engaging empowering and

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,239
relevant learning experiences for

51
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:17,639
children youth adults and

52
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,480
communities uh we do follow the 4

53
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:21,479
Mission in empowering youth to reach

54
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:23,719
their full potential working and

55
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:25,878
learning in partnership with caring

56
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:28,639
adults so you can see that these

57
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:32,439
missions really go hand inand um and we

58
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:35,039
really lean on each other it's a great

59
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:37,719
partnership so in my portion um this is

60
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,959
Fiona speaking I will really like to lay

61
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:42,239
down some sort of research based

62
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,158
findings on why garden-based learning is

63
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,920
so important so before I start I'd like

64
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:48,639
to sort of see why do you think this

65
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:50,839
work is important if you could just take

66
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,799
a moment to share why you believe Garden

67
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,840
based learning uh is Meaningful in in

68
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,439
your work or your personal

69
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,719
life you can type that into the chat box

70
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:02,280
it would be great

71
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,799
awesome thank you

72
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,959
Colleen people learn more when doing

73
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:09,560
handson work and are more willing to

74
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,560
come to learn to appreciate appreciate

75
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,920
our environment hopefully we conserve it

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,920
so

77
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,719
true Megan any people anytime people can

78
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:23,598
get out into nature and get hands-on

79
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:27,400
experience they appreciate

80
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,399
more now they're coming in

81
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:34,399
fast can I you people back to their food

82
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,519
source from Paulina thank you Jen says

83
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,840
it encourages healthy eating and teaches

84
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:40,000
where food comes from these are all

85
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,239
wonderful

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
points April said kids learn best by

87
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:50,200
doing non-traditional Learners can grft

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,199
Concepts that may struggle with from a

89
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:57,078
textbook you can teach anything through

90
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:00,280
growing and preparing food I agree April

91
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:00,280
thank you

92
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,079
awesome thank you

93
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,799
everybody so really Our Hope for this

94
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,760
future generation is that they respect

95
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,760
and care for the natural world I think

96
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:16,918
we can all agree upon

97
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:19,319
that but the reality is that there is a

98
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:21,719
extreme disconnect with nature in this

99
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:21,719
future

100
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,799
generation children are inre

101
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,279
increasingly disconnected from nature

102
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,319
due to overstructured schedules loss of

103
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:32,519
Green Space parental fear and the

104
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,519
prevalence of

105
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:36,120
electronics and if children are losing

106
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:38,240
their connection with

107
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,079
nature who will care enough about

108
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,400
wildlife and Open Spaces to advocate in

109
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:45,839
10 or 20

110
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:47,679
years if children don't have direct

111
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,918
intimate experiences with nature they

112
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,680
will not care if it goes away they need

113
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:55,240
good times in the outdoors to realize

114
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,918
how wonderful it is to dig in the mud to

115
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,600
eat fresh berries to appreciate the hard

116
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:04,478
work of bees this in time with nature

117
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:07,240
should start early and continue through

118
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:10,000
life what we're experiencing is nature

119
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:14,560
deficit disorder sort of coined by

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,560
Richard BL um it's real and it's

121
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,198
happening I actually found this

122
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,799
yesterday uh from the big book of nature

123
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,038
activities a year round guys to Outdoor

124
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,439
Living um and it just sort of States

125
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:31,599
some really interesting figures for us

126
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:33,600
to look at so 2500 is the number of

127
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,160
advertising messages a child Encounters

128
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,960
in one day that is

129
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,520
crazy

130
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:42,560
2738 is the number of hours the average

131
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:45,719
North American child sits in front of a

132
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,038
glowing screen per year

133
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,880
wow 183 of the number of hours a child

134
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:54,439
spends outdoors in unstructured play per

135
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:55,759
year wish that figure was swapped with

136
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:58,839
the one above

137
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,000
it and 300 is the percentage that

138
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:03,519
obesity has increased over the past 20

139
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,879
years for children age 6 to

140
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,359
11 it's just

141
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:10,959
astonishing 300 is also the number of

142
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,680
corporate logos the average child can

143
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,159
identify but only 10 is the number of

144
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,560
native plants and animals that the

145
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,599
average child can

146
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,598
identify and I feel like these figures

147
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:23,680
you know aren't just appropriate and

148
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:26,199
sort of relevant to children but also

149
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,199
our society as a

150
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:32,520
whole so our job is to really bring that

151
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,520
connect Back To

152
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,240
Nature so our hope our children will be

153
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:41,758
physically active and healthy the little

154
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,759
girl is so cute on her Barbie

155
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:47,318
bike but the

156
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,639
reality is something much different half

157
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:51,400
of American kids do not meet the

158
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:54,199
physical activity

159
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:56,758
guidelines they get 46 hours of video

160
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:59,240
games or television play a

161
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:03,038
day that means there's less time for

162
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,840
them to outside exploring playing

163
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,839
getting muddy and dirty finding trees

164
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:10,198
and falling out of them all those really

165
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:12,638
important sort of pieces to

166
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,240
Childhood I do feel that childhood is a

167
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,079
critical time to establish healthy

168
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,720
lifestyle

169
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:21,159
habits another hope is that our children

170
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,240
will be nutritionally healthy and food

171
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,160
secure which means they can access and

172
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,280
consume safe affordable culturally

173
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,240
appropriate nutrient filled

174
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:33,598
Foods there the reality is that they're

175
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,918
nutritionally

176
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,878
deficient factors include poor access

177
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:41,079
lack of

178
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:43,160
affordability convenience and habits

179
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:45,758
many youed live in food deserts and have

180
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:49,680
limited access to healthful

181
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:53,319
Foods approximately 18% of Americans Age

182
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,360
2 to n years are obese and obesity is

183
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,240
the number one Health concern among

184
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,360
parents in the United States that's TS

185
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:04,360
drugs and smoking that's

186
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,759
crazy our hope is that our children will

187
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,639
have the education that they need to

188
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:11,879
feel empowered to establish leadership

189
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,879
and

190
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:16,719
confidence this is such an important

191
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,759
foundational time to establish these

192
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,520
things and to try new things and to ask

193
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:27,639
questions but the actual

194
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:31,478
is kind of fallen into a fit or fail

195
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:34,479
school system I education has become

196
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:37,000
streamlined teaching has become to hit

197
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,240
the standards and the standardized tests

198
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,320
it's not for the

199
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,159
individual and really memorization has

200
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,680
taken over

201
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:50,039
Mastery there's less time for critical

202
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,039
thinking creativity and

203
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,600
Imagination education has become rigid

204
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:57,360
and

205
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,120
strict and I can definitely Echo this

206
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,680
portion where I felt like

207
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,759
you know when I was in school it was

208
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,399
more about jumping through hoops and

209
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,679
memorizing things for an a rather than

210
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,320
really using my critical thinking

211
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:15,439
skills so to fuel the future of kids we

212
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,440
have to think about their entire entire

213
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,599
lifestyle I hope that wasn't too much

214
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,519
Doom and Gloom for you but it's really

215
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,320
important to share that this information

216
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:29,560
it's critical at this point in time in

217
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,560
our society

218
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:38,278
and now to the B stuff that Gardens are

219
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,519
a wonderful gateway to learning and

220
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:42,000
Discovery for the whole child look at

221
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:44,039
that Garden I wish I was there right now

222
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,078
it's so

223
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:49,199
beautiful so let's talk about some of

224
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:49,199
the positive effects of

225
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:56,799
gardening so children who Garden are

226
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,759
more comfortable with the outdoors have

227
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,278
increased awareness and appreciation for

228
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:03,838
the natural world

229
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:06,439
world have ownership responsibility they

230
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,800
become environmental stewards they

231
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,640
establish that important sense of wonder

232
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:13,599
and desire to ask

233
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:15,159
questions you there have been studies

234
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,879
that show that the love of gardening is

235
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:17,879
not so much about gardening but about

236
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:19,838
making

237
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:21,480
decisions having the freedom to make

238
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,399
your own decisions is incredibly

239
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,399
powerful and this can happen in the

240
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,399
garden I love this John brough's quote

241
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,879
that knowledge without love will not

242
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,839
stick but if love comes first then

243
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:38,639
knowledge is sure to

244
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,240
follow we need to connect kids back to

245
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,240
that love of

246
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:50,278
nature children who Garden also have

247
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,320
improved nutrition and health

248
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:55,600
awareness healthy eating can help

249
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,360
prevent or delay chronic conditions and

250
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,519
Studies have shown that kids who plant

251
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,440
it eat it or at least try it

252
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:04,200
these healthy food choices start during

253
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:08,639
childhood and will continue through

254
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,639
adulthood early exposure is

255
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:21,359
key there have also been studies that

256
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:23,278
children who Garden have higher learning

257
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,159
achievements they have higher test

258
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:28,879
course especially in science and

259
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,759
math they also discover unique personal

260
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,838
strength

261
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,838
and feel more I can and I

262
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,800
belong they learn to make decisions and

263
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:50,799
problem solves they gain greater

264
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,879
self-esteem they learn interpersonal

265
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:59,519
skills teamwork and I'm more likely to

266
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:00,879
build stronger relationships with others

267
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,959
and they're more engaged in their

268
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:07,120
communities which I think is really

269
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:07,119
important and

270
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:16,399
wonderful gardening in schools it

271
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:18,679
increases achievement scores increases

272
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,799
parental involvement and Community

273
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:23,319
involvement really supplements that

274
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:25,439
Hands-On learning that might not be

275
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,320
already be in the school

276
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,519
system enhances storytelling written

277
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,600
expression read and comprehension and

278
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:37,360
spelling just overall it's

279
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,079
wonderful and gardening might provide

280
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,639
you know that type of learning that's

281
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:45,759
more Hands-On and experiential so there

282
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,759
really is something for

283
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,879
everyone and the benefits of gardening

284
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,040
aren't just for youth therefore all ages

285
00:12:55,879 --> 00:13:01,600
uh it enhances mental health helps

286
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:03,799
reduce stress lowers your blood pressure

287
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,720
it leaves muscle tension and helps

288
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:09,319
combat obesity I know that when I've had

289
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,519
a hard day at work or somewhere else

290
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:14,040
that when I get home once I start

291
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,078
weeding and pruning and caring for my

292
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:18,319
plants I feel a whole lot better it's

293
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:18,319
just

294
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,120
therapeutic here's a quote from a child

295
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,480
that I think just about sums everything

296
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:34,000
up gardening makes me happy it makes me

297
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:38,278
proud of me gardening makes me feel

298
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,639
healthy I can garden with family and

299
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:41,639
friends I love

300
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:48,958
it so as you can see in our garden we

301
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:51,919
are growing way more than plants this

302
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:54,239
work is important this work is real we

303
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,639
are cultivating passion and empowerment

304
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,839
with the Next

305
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:59,839
Generation we are empowering both Youth

306
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,639
and adults to become more

307
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,120
to become environmental stewards and to

308
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:05,680
care for their natural world we are

309
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,959
inspiring Youth and adults to make

310
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:11,359
healthier choices and Lead healthier

311
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:13,479
lives all right well I hope that sort of

312
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,519
gave you a good foundation of why Garden

313
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,720
based learning is so powerful and uh

314
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:24,480
especially critical at this moment of

315
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:26,800
time um now I'd like to turn it over to

316
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,440
Roger all right thank you

317
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:33,240
Fiona um let's TR for over here to make

318
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:36,199
sure we can I can work these slides for

319
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,360
youall uh and good morning thank you for

320
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:41,198
being here today um my perspective here

321
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,639
is a little bit from a cooperate

322
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:46,838
extension uh educator and how we have

323
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,039
this is our second year with

324
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:52,199
uh College of agon Life Sciences um

325
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:54,639
intern so we've gone through the program

326
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:57,439
now I think we applied four years and

327
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,159
we've won an intern for two years so I

328
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,199
wanted to share and I apologize my first

329
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:02,559
slides are going to be a little bit on

330
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:04,359
the boring wordy side but it's how we

331
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:06,000
wrote for our intern because I thought

332
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,000
it was more important for me to share

333
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,919
with you the wording uh that we use

334
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,958
because I believe that's important on on

335
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:15,198
how you're developing your program to

336
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:18,239
make it fit a course for yourself but

337
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:20,240
also how that it works uh for Cornell to

338
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,320
be able to provide one of these interns

339
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,120
uh which has just been a blessing um

340
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,800
having Megan this year and Britney last

341
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,318
year if anybody sat through Britney's

342
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,919
presentation last year uh these are both

343
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:34,000
great youth and and really benefited our

344
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:36,559
program beyond what I can put on these

345
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,399
slides so let me go to my first slide

346
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,399
here and I apologize again it's going to

347
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,600
be a little wordy but maybe you can use

348
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,440
this in when you're

349
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,600
writing so the project summary and

350
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,680
intended outcomes that we identified

351
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,440
were the interest in gardening is

352
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,599
growing throughout New York State and

353
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,920
CCE continues to explore the most

354
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,319
Innovative avenues for which to educate

355
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,679
and Inspire

356
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:01,679
citizens demonstration Gardens have

357
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:03,758
proven to be an important arena for a

358
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,799
number of significant learning

359
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,039
opportunities Skyler CCE has identified

360
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,479
the need for a continued a strengthened

361
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:13,399
approach to a local demonstration garden

362
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,120
as a way to help hundreds of local

363
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:18,519
residents learn more about ptic culture

364
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:21,679
and area Educators learn from our

365
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:24,198
success so it's also about sharing you

366
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:27,000
know and everything so sorry oh that's

367
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:29,758
all right that's all right thank you

368
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,159
f so and a pict of I'll just explain a

369
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,000
little bit on you know some of our

370
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:34,879
different things there um before I go on

371
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,039
the reading this side so there are some

372
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:39,000
must strawberries that we have from a

373
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:42,360
specialty collector that we got some

374
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,399
strawberries donated and that's our figs

375
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,839
uh growing in our garden uh Chicago

376
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,198
hardy uh so we do some weird things and

377
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:51,079
we do a lot of common things in the

378
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:53,758
Coronel vegetable trials things like

379
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:56,599
that so um we try to mix a lot of

380
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,199
different things in for the uh intern

381
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,360
experience um so part two of the project

382
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:03,758
summary and intended outcomes here on

383
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,120
this slide this Garden based learning

384
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,519
intern will help Skylar CCE build upon

385
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:11,519
the success of last Summer's internship

386
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:13,240
to further develop utilize and maximize

387
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,639
the educational benefits of the

388
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,120
attractive spacious teaching Garden

389
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,919
which lies adjacent to the CCE office

390
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:21,678
complex and was established five years

391
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,199
ago as an outdoor

392
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:28,919
classroom um the initial progress of our

393
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:30,160
garden was a um a grant um a health

394
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:33,320
Department of Health Grant from our

395
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:36,160
local community uh we adopted the grant

396
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:37,759
to fit um the proposal for our garden

397
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,519
and got us established which I'll show

398
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:43,319
you some slides here later um so we're

399
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:46,720
trying to to keep this teaching Garden

400
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:48,240
idea um we call it teaching Garden arc

401
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,319
when they come to visit they call it the

402
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,319
Learning Garden because of what they get

403
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,119
out of working with us in the Community

404
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,519
Partnerships that we've

405
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:59,079
developed so

406
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:00,798
next I want to spoil us and show us a

407
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:02,519
little bit of winter here because I know

408
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:06,000
we're so excited about getting through

409
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:07,240
summer uh so this is I think this year

410
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,759
this is going to be the best time in my

411
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,679
garden is a feel that nice snow out

412
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:15,158
there uh so continuing on the summary

413
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:17,320
and intended outcomes here the summer

414
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:20,159
intern will begin with an overview of

415
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:23,279
important initiatives such as

416
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:26,039
sustainability diversity and inclusion

417
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:28,759
as well as practical guidance related to

418
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:31,919
stakeholder needs assessment and success

419
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:34,038
uccessful program development processes

420
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,960
help develop and deliver a season long

421
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:38,359
curriculum with input from the

422
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,798
leadership share the results of the

423
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:42,519
approach through diverse documentation

424
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:45,279
which will include a web-based success

425
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:46,960
story uh to be distributed through CCE

426
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,720
news in the Cornell Garden based

427
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,960
learning blog and potentially host a

428
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,919
regional Workshop to share with other CC

429
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,798
educators are learnings from the

430
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,880
trajectory of a two-year internship

431
00:18:55,798 --> 00:19:01,158
experience of a growing audience base so

432
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,600
this is that part there where the

433
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:06,559
regional Workshop to share uh with you

434
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,359
other Educators uh what we have learned

435
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:09,918
and that's my goal here today and we'll

436
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:12,678
have plenty of time for questions at the

437
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,320
end uh because we want you to to take

438
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:17,679
this we feel really blessed that we were

439
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:20,480
uh awarded an intern two years in a row

440
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,519
and we've made so many strides with our

441
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,480
garden due to that intern of working

442
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:27,279
with audiences that uh in the past I I

443
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,480
was not a full-time Horticulture

444
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,678
educator so how would we could pull this

445
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,120
off with just a part-time and and now

446
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:39,080
luckily this year event I'm back

447
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:42,959
fulltime um has worked to our benefit so

448
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:42,960
next okay the students

449
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:49,038
roll too

450
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,480
far okay so the brief description of the

451
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,158
student interns role and

452
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,360
responsibilities

453
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:03,159
so under the supervision of the

454
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,240
collaborators listed above that would

455
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:08,720
have been in our in our writing for our

456
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:11,798
intern um we will participate in a

457
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,759
preparation session which I think Fiona

458
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:16,519
and Marsha worked with Megan to get her

459
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:19,119
started and give her a little background

460
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:21,038
about the garden based learning develop

461
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,119
and deliver targeted educational

462
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:26,240

evening um they were a lot of fun and 4

472
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,519
as a teaching garden with guidance in

473
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,919
intentionally adapting uh Cornell

474
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:54,639
garden-based learning

475
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,159
curricula create enhance and Lead

476
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,360
activities which support the maintenance

477
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,919
of the garden observe how volunteers are

478
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:04,079
developed supervised and rewarded and

479
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,880
work with Educators to implement two

480
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:09,599
volunteer trainings and gain experiences

481
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,159
monitor for pests collect data and

482
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:14,038
variety trials we're always getting

483
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:16,240
plants donated um the most recent ones I

484
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:18,919
can think of were the Ruckers cranberry

485
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,960
trials that we did but we did straw Bell

486
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:24,600
trials you know variety trials so we're

487
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,519
always getting some things from Cornell

488
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:28,879
um strawberries and so on like that and

489
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,599
lastly they're reporting share the

490
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,278
results regionally and Statewide to

491
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:35,519
educate and Inspire others uh Megan's

492
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:38,079
part of this is going to be the the most

493
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:40,158
beneficial to all you uh of all the

494
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:43,480
projects hopefully that we've given her

495
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:47,360
successfully through this

496
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:49,519
year what qualifications were needed uh

497
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:51,879
so in writing for the intern we had to

498
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:54,558
identify those so the candidate will

499
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,400
need to ex need excellent written and

500
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:59,678
oral communication

501
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,000
skills a genuine desire and documented

502
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,919
interest in working with people is

503
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
necessary she or he should be intended

504
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:09,038
of detail and should possess a general

505
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,119
knowledge of and enthusiasm for

506
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:13,599
gardening and home food

507
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:15,759
production and lastly there a desire to

508
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,399
work with a variety of audiences and an

509
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:19,278
interest in the ability to perform

510
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,840
physical work in outdoor

511
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:23,558
conditions um all these are really

512
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,079
crucial and I'm just going to step back

513
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:28,558
through these one more time um written

514
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:30,759
and oral skills uh for Megan has been

515
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:33,399
her blog and her ability to write

516
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:36,480
articles for us that have just been

517
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,200
exceptional uh working with people

518
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,159
you're working with Garden volunteers

519
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,200
one minute you're working with an

520
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:46,720
audience of maybe youth at risk uh the

521
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:50,840
next moment so she was put in various uh

522
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,600
programs that she'll talk more on um an

523
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:55,879
enthusiasm for gardening I think

524
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:58,839
whenever I interviewed Megan uh she had

525
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,120
worked for a CSA last year um and had

526
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:03,319
really shown even though Megan she'll

527
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:05,639
tell you more of it she's from a animal

528
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:07,678
Science Background really had a love of

529
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,360
plants along with that and that was

530
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:13,120
necessary for this to work out really

531
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:14,879
well uh and in that last one they

532
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:17,000
working with a variety of audiences and

533
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,840
interest to perform physical work in

534
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,919
outdoor conditions this year working

535
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:24,079
outside in the garden if you didn't like

536
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:29,000
a little bit of heat it would not have

537
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:31,278
worked at all so so Megan uh

538
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,159
has this Keen ability to be able to work

539
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:38,000
in the heat more than probably I was

540
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:40,080
even able to um uh so it was

541
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,679
extraordinary to find a youth that that

542
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:45,399
really tolerated all right so next uh

543
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:49,120
benefits and skills that we could

544
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:51,159
hopefully even provide our intern so we

545
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:53,239
said to increase knowledge of CCE

546
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:55,559
successful program development process

547
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,919
we bring that to the table basic

548
00:23:55,558 --> 00:23:59,240
gardening and local food production

549
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,759
experience

550
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,319
uh volunteer

551
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:06,440
development written and oral expression

552
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,599
in turn will gain significant experience

553
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,159
and facilitating learning experiences

554
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:13,240
both all adult and youth audiences in an

555
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:15,320
outdoor classroom environment through

556
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,240
the co-leadership of numerous classes

557
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:20,599
and activities so we just try to develop

558
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,120
uh a listing of what we're giving back

559
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:25,319
um we take a lot from an intern probably

560
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:27,079
in any of the programs but what are we

561
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:31,439
giving them back that they can take with

562
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:33,158
them Beyond um uh her experience here

563
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,159
and for Megan I think I signed her

564
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:39,440
farewell card with uh if you grow others

565
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:41,600
you grow yourself and so that sort of

566
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,798
follows with Fiona's little tagline

567
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:48,558
there that we we do more of it just grow

568
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:50,960
plants uh the audiences that we reach

569
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:54,440
really have this need to learn gardening

570
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,519
and it's so neat to see an intern work

571
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:00,159
with those audiences and and hopefully

572
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:03,119
we we provided that

573
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,320
opportunity so here is my welcome slide

574
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:06,558

platform you I'll have a little better

614
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,359
picture of so as I said a couple years

615
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:39,558
ago Department of Health in Skyler

616
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:42,918
County uh had this

617
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:46,240
grant um why you have connections in

618
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:48,520
your community is they contacted us that

619
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,798
nobody had applied for this grant uh

620
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:53,240
that's like not heard of anymore there's

621
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:56,200
probably people fighting over grants so

622
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,599
they said Roger we know you're new but

623
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,640
we've heard you want to establish a

624
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:02,839
garden this was a big grass plot out

625
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:05,640
along the road uh they said we can help

626
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:07,720
you do that if you write for this grant

627
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,120
you are pretty much the only person so

628
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:13,278
far uh so I wrote for this Grant and

629
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:17,719
this was not to be uh taken lightly this

630
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:19,919
was $7,500 I think to start it um we

631
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,558
used it for infrastructure we be we

632
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,399
built this teaching platform and you'll

633
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:25,038
see an arbor that we put over top of

634
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:27,000
some picnic tables that were out in the

635
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,079
middle of nowhere nobody would come out

636
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,480
and sit because the three picnic tables

637
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:34,359
we're in the baking sun and we also put

638
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,919
a little Arbor for our entrance uh and

639
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:37,798
you'll see this packed gravel that's

640
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,159
around here this is all wheelchair

641
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:42,918
accessible and also the raised beds were

642
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:46,880
made for wheelchair height um we did all

643
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:49,440
that with the initial I would say 95% of

644
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,720
the plants were all I wrote different

645
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,558
companies and they were all more than

646
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,759
willing to donate plants so we have paid

647
00:27:53,558 --> 00:27:58,519
for very little of the plants um and I

648
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,839
feel blessed at this point my I have a

649
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:02,120
little Nursery at home that I've been

650
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:03,678
able to donate some plants this year uh

651
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:07,079
to help the garden along because it's

652
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,320
really my passion uh so I did donated

653
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:14,519
some fruiting plants this year so we

654
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:16,918
just keep adding as we go so here is I

655
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:20,480
think the first couple weeks after it

656
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:23,038
was developed um with the raise planners

657
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,038
the um teaching platform in the middle

658
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:28,558
which is sort of an Old English style

659
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:30,440
Amphitheater the Big Arbor down at the

660
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,558
end we beefed up because we put Hardy

661
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,120
kiwi on top of those and off to the

662
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:37,038
right of the picture you can't see would

663
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:40,278
have been our uh wheelchair entrance off

664
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:41,879
of the main uh walkway coming in um

665
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:44,960
because we wanted to make sure this

666
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,760
Garden was developed for all folks to to

667
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:51,000
be able to participate in our

668
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:53,119
programs this was probably now about two

669
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,159
years back Megan was laughing at me she

670
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:57,398
said if you took this picture today you

671
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:59,159
couldn't see through any of this cuz

672
00:28:57,398 --> 00:29:01,119
that big Quinn in the foreground and his

673
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:03,679
elderberries have probably doubled that

674
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,558
size uh the grap Vines have taken over

675
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,320
that whole Arbor so you feel like you're

676
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:10,759
in an inclosure uh now that they have

677
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:13,158
grown um so the garden has really taken

678
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:14,919
off and this is all just volunteer

679
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:18,480
because like I said I was only part-time

680
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:20,278
as of last year um so volunteers our

681
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,319
first three Master Gardeners came out of

682
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:25,640
Tomkins County last year so we didn't

683
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:25,639
even have a Master Gardener

684
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:31,519
program uh so yeah Megan loves this

685
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:34,480
picture I caught her right when the bug

686
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:37,359
bitter uh but so this is some of our

687
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:41,200
like Master Gardeners our G our garden

688
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:43,839
volunteers our uh nutrition staff and

689
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,240
Megan working on a ladybug adoption

690
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:49,199
night where we Department of animology

691
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,120
was donating or not donating but um had

692
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,240
bred the nine spotted ladybugs and we

693
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:56,359
had a adopt them and release them in our

694
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,798
garden night uh so you know this is a

695
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:00,839
good diversity because it is four

696
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:03,079
different groups together working in the

697
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:06,079
garden at one

698
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:07,839
time this is something uh and I said I

699
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:09,678
won't be labor these because Megan's

700
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:14,319
going to show you uh this is a lot of

701
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:17,720
her work this is her ladybug adoption um

702
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:19,599
flyer we make the interns we we teach

703
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,480
them and then we make them do everything

704
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:26,839
that we would do create Flyers book

705
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,720
rooms uh help with the speakers uh with

706
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:31,359
the ladybugs she went along we picked

707
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,558
them up up at Cornell uh it was a cool

708
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:36,158
experience of videotaping the ladybug

709
00:30:33,558 --> 00:30:38,119
larve um so this was just one of her

710
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:41,600
Flyers that she created she'll talk more

711
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:43,759
about that later she did this trifold

712
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:46,959
which was just a real creative uh all

713
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:49,000
about ladybugs for kids uh we gave that

714
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,720
out the night that the folks came in and

715
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,319
adopted and I think we had as many

716
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:57,038
adults as kids adopt ladybugs that night

717
00:30:53,319 --> 00:31:00,000
it was really just a cool um educational

718
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:03,119
event and in the

719
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,638
garden okay Community groups U we Mar we

720
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:08,558
talked about Arc this is the arc group

721
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:11,798
that was out in the garden um uh pins

722
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:14,359
diversion is youth at risk uh we we all

723
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:16,319
know wck had Start programs in our

724
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:18,798
building office for the Aging in our

725
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:22,319
building department of social services

726
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:24,240
has a work crew that we have worked with

727
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,918
uh and they have expressed like how

728
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,638
great it is to learn gardening skills

729
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:32,120
when they're already teaching their

730
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:33,759
participants work related uh skills so

731
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:35,638
they really appreciate coming out to our

732
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:38,839
garden and this just a little history

733
00:31:35,638 --> 00:31:43,278
behind this slide is the folks from Arc

734
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:45,398
had gone to a Rain Barrel um building

735
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:47,679
workshop uh somewhere else not at our

736
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:49,599
garden they loved our garden so much

737
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,720
you'll see the water is light there they

738
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,719
donated their Barrel to our garden uh so

739
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,558
it's really incredible that they thought

740
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,399
about us uh and we love working with

741
00:31:57,558 --> 00:32:04,079
them Megan will talk more about

742
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:06,959
that of course uh on our previous slides

743
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:09,879
uh Megan has worked on uh her internship

744
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,000
blog it is amazing she'll talk more

745
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,799
about it there please go on

746
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,679
there I'm not nearly that creative of

747
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:21,240
putting videos into my blogs I'm lucky

748
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:24,798
and I could just type A a simple letter

749
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:28,000
to you guys so uh so these youth bring

750
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:29,359
other skills that that I I feel bad that

751
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,359
I don't know

752
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:35,918
better our plant Sines is our CL the

753
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:38,398
fame in our garden um Megan was thrown

754
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,480
right into any new varieties you'll see

755
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:44,719
some of these were from my farm um

756
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:47,519
donated uh we Tred to get the newest

757
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,679
plant material that we see that is

758
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,278
available that folks want to learn and

759
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,240
these are some bush cherries from

760
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:57,519
University of New Hampshire uh the meter

761
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,720
program I believe um so when we bring

762
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,440
that in

763
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,399
automatically gets a signp put on it

764
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,519
because the garden is 247 open folks

765
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:08,599
come there to learn they're welcome to

766
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:11,278
taste tests it is just of course the

767
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:15,000
deer visit as much as people do uh we're

768
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:16,839
working on that um but so the signage is

769
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,880
the most important thing so Megan got to

770
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:21,519
do a lot of signs a lot of research on

771
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,159
the varieties um it's a lot of work

772
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,038
researching where they came from giving

773
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:29,559
credit

774
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:33,158
um designing the so

775
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:35,519
on uh along with our signage is our

776
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:37,440
nutrition I believe and Megan would

777
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,240
probably talk more about it that there's

778
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,360
12 um sort of like those brochure

779
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,759
holders that you would get for an open

780
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:47,278
house at a home that's for sale they're

781
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:49,720
clear with a flip top lid we have them

782
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:51,960
space all around our garden and we try

783
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:55,000
to put them either with timely planting

784
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,120
information or here some of our uh

785
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
nutrition

786
00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:01,119
education um one slide you saw our

787
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,798
nutrition educator Lisa is just

788
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:05,599
part-time and she's at Camp during the

789
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:09,000
summer we have no other nutrition staff

790
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:11,039
so without an intern I would not be able

791
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,918
to look up recipes and get them out to

792
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,519
the Garden I just would not have time

793
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:17,480
for that so so she was able to get

794
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:20,358
timely recipes out there when crops were

795
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:23,719
coming ready obviously here kale and

796
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:25,878
rhar were in season in the garden uh so

797
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:28,118
she kept up with that and we and we did

798
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:29,918
some monitoring and Meg talk more about

799
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:32,000
like how many do we put out there how

800
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:36,039
many were taken you know things like

801
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:39,239
that we did some some um recordkeeping

802
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:41,599
also this is um Master Garden program is

803
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:45,519

804
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:48,480

805
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:50,280
Master Gardener we want you kind of deal

806
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,240

807
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:56,079
like Uncle Sam you know or or we had a

808
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:58,319
Batman theme for R be a superhero be a

809

master Garder in Skyler County

810
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,400
so we worked long and hard on uh

811
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,000
developing uh because our Master

812
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:08,079
Gardeners go out to local farmers

813
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,440
markets and stuff on like how do we find

814
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,519
past present and future Master Gardeners

815
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,119
to our program so we developed this on

816
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:16,880
there

817
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:19,640

820
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,719
out with our youth educator Paula so

821
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,960

but just wanted to share that we do

826
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:42,799
outside events get our intern out of the

827
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,119
garden so she's not out there sweating

828

00:35:56,358 --> 00:36:01,719
but we keep up with this little drawing

834
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,960
every time you um put new plants in they

835
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:07,078
get uh updated on here and when we had

836
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,159
some permaculture tour go through last

837
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:12,440
year they were really impressed uh that

838
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:15,559
a garden map existed they go to a lot of

839
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:18,000
deat gardens but nobody really puts

840
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:19,880
where the plants are for you to find

841
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,559
them you just sort of randomly come

842
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:25,519
across them so the Garden map was really

843
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:27,880
uh a great thing uh for for folks who

844
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:30,639
visited us

845
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,960
um so I think Megan it's your turn so

846
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:33,920
thank you everybody I'll take questions

847
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,240
at the end

848
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,200
then right uh hopefully you guys can

849
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:41,559
hear me okay

850
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:44,879
um as Roger and Fiona said my name is

851
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:46,519
Megan uh I was the Skyler County summer

852
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,000
intern and I'm just here to talk about

853
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:51,400
my experiences with the program what my

854
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,159
big takeaways are and why other

855
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,160
extension programs um like what some of

856
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:58,039
you guys work for might uh consider

857
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:59,719
wanting an intern

858
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:01,880
uh going into this job I really didn't

859
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:04,318
know didn't know what to expect my major

860
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,838
is animal science as Roger said so I had

861
00:37:04,318 --> 00:37:08,400
pretty limited experience with

862
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:10,199
horiculture but I worked on a farm the

863
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,720
previous summer so I was interested to

864
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:15,559
see what the extension office had in

865
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:17,480
store for me um initially my job just

866
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:20,480
inail fixing up the garden weeding

867
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:22,240
mulching making new signs uh and

868
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,039
facilitating the many bi-weekly

869
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:28,358
workshops with Arc that Roger mentioned

870
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:29,800
before um and any other community group

871
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:32,119
and helping out with various projects

872
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:35,200
around the office but it ends up being

873
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:37,200
so much more than that and um I'll break

874
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:40,118
it down into a few categories because it

875
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:42,159
it ended up extending Way Beyond Way

876
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:45,800
Beyond the initial

877
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:49,000
scope so first um the

878
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:51,359
garden uh I most the entire plot I took

879
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,639
out a ton of weeds and this all took

880
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:58,199
this is just kind of the the general

881
00:37:54,639 --> 00:38:00,719
labor of it it all took a longer than I

882
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:02,799
thought uh mulching it and just taking

883
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:05,598
down all the old signs putting up new

884
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,240
signs um I took like lot the before and

885
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,160
after picture so you can kind of see the

886
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:13,000
progress that there was throughout the

887
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:15,399
summer uh I planted a ton of new seeds

888
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,199
uh we acquired a big donation about

889
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,358
halfway through the summer that had tons

890
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:22,679
of like tomatoes peppers cucumbers and

891
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:25,039
cantaloupe plants um as Roger said he

892
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:27,598
donated several of his own plants

893
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:29,639
including a goji berry bush a couple

894
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,039
blueberry varieties and three blush

895
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:35,199
cherries uh that I planted with members

896
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:38,279
of Ark updated all the garden signs made

897
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:40,519
new ones and put together um some

898
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,480
healthy garden relevant recipes that we

899
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:44,079
put in the garden flyer holders for

900
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,960
passbys to

901
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:49,560
take oh sorry I'll slow

902
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,639
down um and I'm so happy with how the

903
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:53,119
garden looks now obviously I could

904
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:55,199
continue to work on it forever because

905
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,519
there's always something to do but I

906
00:38:55,199 --> 00:39:00,199
think it's taught me most of what it can

907
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:03,960
for the meantime which is invaluable

908
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:05,919
enough um I'll go back to

909
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,159
this

910
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:11,680
secondly uh working with Community

911
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:14,358
groups each Tuesday and

912
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:16,279
Thursday all out each Tuesday and

913
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:18,000
Thursday one to three members of Ark

914
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,960
would come and their caretaker and I

915
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,800
would facilitate a garden activity with

916
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,119
them and sometimes it would be something

917
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:27,200
simple like we just plant seeds or read

918
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:29,079
water or read weed um and then sometimes

919
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:32,118
I would prepare a more intensive

920
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:33,800
activity beforehand uh like we made

921
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,280
Turtle Sprouts which is the picture

922
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,640
right in the middle and it's sort of

923
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,359
like a very easy atome chiaia pet um and

924
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:42,799
I did that with the summer W program and

925
00:39:40,358 --> 00:39:46,719
I did it with Arc and I think both of

926
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:49,200
them uh really liked the activity and

927
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:51,239
benefited from it we extended the

928
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:53,759
opportunity to work with Wick and pins

929
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:56,039
diversion but um never heard back from

930
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,440
Wick we had one evening where we worked

931
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:02,000
with pins diversion about a group of

932
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:05,200
maybe 15 boys um and they were great

933
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,400
they were really uh into the garden and

934
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:08,159
even though we were dis mishing we

935
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,880
weren't doing anything necessarily

936
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:13,960
exciting I think they really enjoyed it

937
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:17,200
and then finally I worked alongside

938
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:19,838
Paula the picture to the far right um

939
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:21,598
doing the summer wreck program where her

940
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:24,480
and I would put together hourong

941
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,640
activities for the adessa central school

942
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,318
um that took place each Tuesday for a

943
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:30,239
month and the activities were all Garden

944
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:34,119
based and the kids ranged from

945
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:36,279
kindergarteners to sixth graders um and

946
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:38,920
the activities would get like a little

947
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:41,200
harder with each age group but I'll

948
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,119
discuss more of that in a moment and

949
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:45,078
then

950
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:47,960
finally uh working on stuff in the

951
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:50,000
office made a ton of signs all for the

952
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,920
garden u a lot of them was just updating

953
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,519
older signs and then sometimes I made

954
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:58,800
new signs for do plants that we had um I

955
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:02,000
had a bigger hand in in like advertising

956
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,280
and marketing than I expected um so like

957
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,760
the ladybug option for instance put

958
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,760
together several Flyers uh the trifold

959
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,800
poster that you see in this slide as

960
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:13,400
well as like a

961
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:15,318
brochure um and along the way learned a

962
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:18,400
ton about ladybugs I could talk your ear

963
00:41:15,318 --> 00:41:22,239
off about ladybugs for an hour not that

964
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,920
anyone wants that um but this was just

965
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:26,879
an example of Duties that I ended up

966
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,639
having that I didn't necessarily expect

967
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,640
but I'm happy that I was able to

968
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:36,838
contribute uh so now I'll talk about the

969
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:36,838
takeaways Sor I'm gonna kind of go

970
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:45,639
back uh I realized the power a garden

971
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:50,760
can have um it provides an affordable

972
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:53,358
way to grow fresh produce um I and I

973
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,760
discovered just an absolute passion for

974
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:59,039
it I love horiculture now and I'm

975
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:02,200
considering pursuing that that further

976
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:05,000
um but as you can see the garden really

977
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:07,078
evolved over time it's it has all its

978
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,159
signs which like Mark different areas of

979
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:11,680
the garden now um fully mulched and

980
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:13,480
weeded the Head Start Garden looks

981
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:16,358
absolutely amazing although that's a

982
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:19,719
good part um K in one of our Master

983
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:22,078
garders uh planted a cayenne pepper bed

984
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:24,279
two of those from the donation that I

985
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:28,119
received from um a woman who works for

986
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:30,280
Ark Roger nine made these

987
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:32,680
netted raised beds so that the deer

988
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,240
couldn't get to them deer were the

989
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:37,440
absolute bait of our existence this

990
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:40,558
entire summer they ate everything but um

991
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,280
this like netted bed was it it's

992
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:46,280
producing tons of tomatoes um because

993
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,200
the deer weren't able to get to it uh as

994
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:51,640
you can see everything just it it like

995
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:53,318
looks a a lot more put together but um

996
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:56,318
my pride and joy from the summer for

997
00:42:53,318 --> 00:42:56,318
sure

998
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:06,039
okay um so the the big

999
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:08,800
takeaways uh a garden is it's so much

1000
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:10,119
more than just plants it's and and I

1001
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,119
kind of thought this is cheesy going

1002
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:14,720
into this but like it's absolutely true

1003
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:17,000
a garden is helpful in so many different

1004
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:20,959
ways that you wouldn't even expect uh

1005
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,400
obviously it produces a lot of food um

1006
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,199
it provides an affordable way to grow

1007
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,920
your own fresh produce which is really a

1008
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:28,118
valuable tool especially for like lower

1009
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,838
income families who sometimes can't

1010
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:33,838
afford all the fresh produce that they

1011
00:43:29,838 --> 00:43:36,440
need um for the final installment of the

1012
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:39,239
summer wreck program we made a garden

1013
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,920
salsa where we used ingredients either

1014
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:43,159
found in the garden or we had to

1015
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,800
supplement some uh from a grocery store

1016
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:47,838
because we didn't have enough for the

1017
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:50,119
entire group of kids but um getting to

1018
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:51,920
like see the kids like like actually

1019
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:54,880
working with like the tomatoes and

1020
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:57,159
onions and peppers that we had grown

1021
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,599
ourselves was exciting it's like they

1022
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:00,759
can do that too they can grow it and

1023
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:02,720
then they can make a delicious snack out

1024
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:06,359
of everything that they harvest from

1025
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:08,639
there um it provides a source of

1026
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:10,119
Education working in the garden just

1027
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:12,558
personally has taught me so much this

1028
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:15,318
summer I've learned a ton about plant

1029
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:16,839
and insect insect life that I probably

1030
00:44:15,318 --> 00:44:20,719
never would have gotten as great of

1031
00:44:16,838 --> 00:44:24,000
detail it um about if I've just taken a

1032
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:26,118
course um I believe anyone who has a

1033
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,400
garden even if it's just for like

1034
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:31,318
Leisure or pleasure would inevitably

1035
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,119
learn so much over time uh luckily I

1036
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:35,480
have Roger to thank for sharing his

1037
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:38,480
expansive knowledge um about plants with

1038
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:40,880
me which in turn I tried my best to pass

1039
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,440
on to either the children or the ark

1040
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,960
members that I worked with over the

1041
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:47,318
summer um just learning the basics about

1042
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,559
soil health and how cents grow what bugs

1043
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:51,119
are pests like etc those are things

1044
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:54,960
that'll stick with you and be useful

1045
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:57,519
like your entire life um just with the

1046
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,679
kids we would of course do garden

1047
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,639
related activities which were fun like

1048
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:05,358
the turtle Sprouts or we played bug

1049
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:07,118
Bingo but um I think from each of those

1050
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:09,358
activities there was a takeaway where

1051
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,559
the kids could remember something like

1052
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:14,078
oh this insect is especially bad on this

1053
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:16,480
plant like in the future if they're just

1054
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,760
out in nature and they see that bug like

1055
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,079
I hope that they'll remember the things

1056
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:24,000
that we taught them even if it's totally

1057
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:27,079
small uh like Fiona was saying earlier

1058
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,358
gardening is incredibly therapeutic um

1059
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:31,200
um I've been told several times that

1060
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:33,199
members of Ark who came to the Garden

1061
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:35,358
frequently for the workshops that I did

1062
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:37,558
with them really benefited from the

1063
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:39,838
experience and I could even see it week

1064
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:41,280
to week like a few of the members who

1065
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:43,558
continually came back throughout the

1066
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,200
summer would come and they'd be so

1067
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:46,920
excited to see me they'd like come out

1068
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:49,759
of the car and be like what are we doing

1069
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,920
today what have you got planned um and

1070
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,920
it was really exciting to see like that

1071
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:58,318
Weekly progression that they were

1072
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:00,280
actually thrilled to keep coming back um

1073
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:02,639
and by the end of the summer some of the

1074
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,200
members were like so excited that uh

1075
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:07,039
when I told them that I was leaving they

1076
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:09,759
actually got really sad and I'm sad that

1077
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:13,079
I can't continue working with them um

1078
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,079
just because it was such a beneficial

1079
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:17,079
experience personally I would just use

1080
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:18,640
the garden as an escape fat a lot of my

1081
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:20,680
mind or wasn't having a good day and

1082
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:22,400
like Tia said just an hour or so out in

1083
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:25,118
the garden I would feel infinitely

1084
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,599
better uh as far as self-fulfillment

1085
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,880
it's I mean gardening is work work it's

1086
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,880
fun and it's relaxing but it's

1087
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,599
definitely work you'll weed and you'll M

1088
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,240
Mulch and you'll sweat and you'll get

1089
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:36,838
incredibly discouraged when things that

1090
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:38,799
you plant die or when a deer eats

1091
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:41,759
something that you just like put in the

1092
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:44,119
ground um but the gratification that

1093
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,760
comes with seeing like the first tomato

1094
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:49,318
that you planted ripen or the Sprouts

1095
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:52,119
coming up that you planted um it's

1096
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:53,800
unbeatable and it's it's really

1097
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:56,079
fulfilling and I tried to point out this

1098
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,800
progress to especially the ark members I

1099
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,760
worked with because we planted a lot of

1100
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,160
seeds so each week they came back I

1101
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,960
would take them back to where we planted

1102
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:04,480
the seeds be like look the just seeds we

1103
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,880
planted and now they're scrubed and

1104
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,440
they're coming up and one day they'll be

1105
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,240
flowering um and the fact that they can

1106
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,760
have even just that small amount of

1107
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:18,439
ownership over the garden and its

1108
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:21,400
success is a great accomplishment um and

1109
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:23,400
finally uh Garden can be and at least in

1110
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,920
my experience this summer The Perfect

1111
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:28,639
platforms for forming connections both

1112
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,480
with nature and other people um there's

1113
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:32,118
something so essential with connecting

1114
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,240
with plants and the Earth that a lot of

1115
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:36,440
people lose nowadays like Fiona was

1116
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:39,159
talking about uh you cultivate an

1117
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:41,639
appreciation for the Earth and how we as

1118
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:46,440
people work with it and communicate with

1119
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:48,440
it and that's really invaluable um and I

1120
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,318
I also truly believe that everyone can

1121
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,200
enjoy a garden even if they're not

1122
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:54,639
someone who particularly likes being

1123
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:57,039
outside like everyone can find something

1124
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:58,960
about it that they enjoy and and number

1125
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:01,759
of people I've met and befriended in the

1126
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,159
garden is truly uncountable like just

1127
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,520
people who walked by The Garden or

1128
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:08,719
walked through it I would talk to them

1129
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:10,480
for 10 15 minutes and and just see that

1130
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:14,239
like they really appreciated the beauty

1131
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:16,599
of the garden um so whether my role was

1132
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:18,078
as a facilitator or teacher like with

1133
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:20,160
Arc or the kids or just as like a

1134
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:22,760
helping hand like with my co-workers or

1135
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:24,358
the master garders I can honestly say I

1136
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,520
won't forget the people I've connected

1137
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:29,558
with this summer and I hope that they

1138
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:33,559
think of the garden as fly as I

1139
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:35,480
do uh so to kind of close up um I know

1140
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:39,880
we're sort of running out of time here

1141
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:42,838
but why have an intern for all of you uh

1142
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:44,240
people listening if you're considering

1143
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:47,279
having an intern or applying for an

1144
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:49,959
intern in the future um I I'd like to

1145
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,599
just share my own experience uh so that

1146
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,358
you can know that it it really can make

1147
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:58,280
a difference both to the intern and to

1148
00:48:54,358 --> 00:49:01,318
your program um

1149
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:03,720
regardless oh sorry uh an intern Can Be

1150
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:05,719
A New Perspective I was lucky in that

1151
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:07,159
Roger gave me a lot of freedom to atten

1152
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:10,078
to the garden and plan activities with

1153
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:12,118
Ark as I saw fit and as a result a lot

1154
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,400
of new ideas evolved I like created new

1155
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:16,880
beds in the garden and signs dividing it

1156
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:20,559
into easy to follow sections like the

1157
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:23,200
butterfly garden raspberry patch um but

1158
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,559
I had minimal uh prior experience with

1159
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:27,399
gardening and working with Community

1160
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:30,040
groups so I learned as I went

1161
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:33,079
and hopefully I was able to look at

1162
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:35,599
everything from a fresh point of view um

1163
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:37,839
also a intern can be a helping hand in

1164
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,960
tons of in tons of ways as I said

1165
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:41,599
earlier I ended up having a lot more

1166
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:44,079
duties and helping out with things that

1167
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:46,559
I didn't expect which was great um

1168
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:49,318
because I helped out Roger Kathy Paula

1169
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:51,319
the people I work with um all on a

1170
00:49:49,318 --> 00:49:53,279
number of different projects while still

1171
00:49:51,318 --> 00:49:55,639
routinely working in the garden and as a

1172
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:58,400
result got so much accomplished and

1173
00:49:55,639 --> 00:50:00,400
really gained tons of new skills in like

1174
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,559
different areas that I didn't expect

1175
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,838
over the course of Summer um and finally

1176
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:07,119
like having an intern you could really

1177
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:09,119
change the students life I was really

1178
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:11,838
indecisive about what I wanted coming

1179
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:13,720
into this um summer which is I mean

1180
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:15,838
clearly why I'm an animal science major

1181
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:17,959
in an internship pretty unrelated to

1182
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:19,599
animals but uh working with the

1183
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,639
incredible people in the extension

1184
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,720
office and connecting with so many

1185
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:26,759
community members I began to get a

1186
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:28,759
better idea of what I love to do um of

1187
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,480
course I'm still unsure about a lot but

1188
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:33,720
just this summer has convinced me uh to

1189
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:36,079
at least pursue a minor in horiculture

1190
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:38,318
um because I wouldn't trade the

1191
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:40,839
experiences I had for anything and while

1192
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:45,159
the summer was hard I don't regret a

1193
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:47,239
single part of it and I loved it um so

1194
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:50,239
thank you to everyone I worked with to

1195
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:53,039

1196
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:56,759

1200
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:05,838
those ladybug cupcakes were

1201
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:08,639
amazing they were like the highlight of

1202
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:10,798

last few minutes so now is your time to

1210
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:31,000
sort of um ask any questions that are on

1211
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:32,959
your mind or um yeah we'd really like

1212
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
this next we we blocked off the next

1213
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,358
half hour or so so there's plenty of

1214
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,400
time to um you know have a lively

1215
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:42,318
discussion don't be shy so you can

1216
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,519
either type your question into the chat

1217
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:48,960
box or I believe you can raise your hand

1218
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:48,960
and I can um unmute you

1219
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,119
uh so ktie I think I can answer that one

1220
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:04,519
how did you protect your sence from the

1221
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:09,000
elements out in the garden they really

1222
00:52:04,519 --> 00:52:12,798
only um our color isn't stay fast yet we

1223
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,880
were we are trying to figure that out um

1224
00:52:12,798 --> 00:52:17,599
so the pictures of like the apples and

1225
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:21,280
so on do not last too long but the Black

1226
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:23,039
Ink um on a card stock has last of this

1227
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,680
pretty much for a year till we replace

1228
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:27,358
them again but the color fad really fast

1229
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:30,039
so we have not been able to solve that

1230
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:33,159
one there yet so if anybody ever has a

1231
00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:35,119
good color fast printer ink or something

1232
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:37,118
um we're we're trying to work on that

1233
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,599
but the black on the card stock has has

1234
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,838
lasted

1235
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:42,559
fine great looks like you have another

1236
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:45,719
question from Paulina where do you get

1237
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:49,680
most of your funding from um sort of as

1238
00:52:45,719 --> 00:52:52,959
stated in the um presentation um all the

1239
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:56,639
plants were donated uh so that is 100%

1240
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:58,880
or 95% um we had a little pot of money I

1241
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:01,239
think $300 each year was set aside from

1242
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:05,039
copper extension for the Garden in our

1243
00:53:01,239 --> 00:53:07,558
budget so we purchased tools and

1244
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:10,119
knickknacks and things like that with at

1245
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:14,599
$300 um but like I said everything that

1246
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:16,880
was built came from the initial um uh

1247
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:18,838
Department of Health Grant was all the

1248
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,000
major construction and we really never

1249
00:53:18,838 --> 00:53:23,199
did any more construction after that one

1250
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,559
I wish we had but uh we never finished

1251
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:26,558
our one walkway

1252
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:33,240
let's see far back are we on colen said

1253
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:36,079
um oh hang

1254
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:38,199
on do you plan on only having College

1255
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,119
interns or do you plan on using High

1256
00:53:38,199 --> 00:53:42,199
School

1257
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:44,000
interns um we'd like to have uh

1258
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:45,679
additional interns I know we were really

1259
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,480
blessed to get two years through the

1260
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:50,838
cows program probably be lucky to ever

1261
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,480
get a third year U because I heard two

1262
00:53:50,838 --> 00:53:57,000
years was pretty pretty incredible um

1263
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:59,400
we're always looking for interns um

1264
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,599
it's hard sometimes uh because we are

1265
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:04,798
out uh especially for like Megan she had

1266
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:08,039
to drive out each day uh from from Etha

1267
00:54:04,798 --> 00:54:10,039
where she lived um Britney last year

1268
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:13,358
lived in Watkins Glenn that was really

1269
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:15,159
close so maybe a high school one uh or a

1270
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:18,000
high school program that actually has

1271
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:19,920
some youth uh we could also take a look

1272
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,559
at Elmyra college and some local

1273
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,639
colleges where some youth might have to

1274
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:26,760
do a little bit of intern um before they

1275
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:30,798
graduate so we'll have to do a lot of

1276
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:33,960
exploring over this winter of some other

1277
00:54:30,798 --> 00:54:35,759
options awesome uh and a followup from

1278
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,798
Colleen said if funding or interns are

1279
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,680
not available in the future how will the

1280
00:54:37,798 --> 00:54:44,599
garden be sustained or kept alive okay

1281
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:46,159
so Colleen's questionnaire um interns

1282
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:48,200
are going to be a question mark so we

1283
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:50,358
know we have three Master Gardeners that

1284
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:54,358
completed the program up at Tomkins with

1285
00:54:50,358 --> 00:54:55,679
Pat we uh plan on sending a couple more

1286
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:57,519
uh folks that are interested in the

1287
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:59,399
master Garden program and they've been

1288
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:02,119
really reliable in helping with our

1289
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:04,358
garden uh Debbie who is one of our

1290
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:06,720
Master Gardeners actually has to take a

1291
00:55:04,358 --> 00:55:09,519
bus because she cannot drive twice a

1292
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:11,199
week she comes almost all year long she

1293
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:13,440
is really dedicated so we have

1294
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:15,399
passionate people also a lot of our

1295
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:18,000
volunteers that aren't Master Gardeners

1296
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:20,760
just love the community engagement in

1297
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,440
the garden because it is very focal and

1298
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,119
and they like to just come out there and

1299
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,760
just help out and when I put a call out

1300
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:26,838
for help like the weeds are getting a

1301
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,520
little big

1302
00:55:26,838 --> 00:55:30,719
how can we get a weeding party together

1303
00:55:28,519 --> 00:55:34,559
they show up it's just incredible the

1304
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:39,000
interest level we have um

1305
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:41,440
so I I don't believe that interns are

1306
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,559
going to be I think like I said before

1307
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:46,679
two years was pretty lucky um but maybe

1308
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:48,839
we'll develop other ideas I am also

1309
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:50,279
full-time now so be able to help out

1310
00:55:48,838 --> 00:55:53,038
especially when Megan leaves I'll be

1311
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:55,680
doing the arc uh tours twice of the week

1312
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:57,240
and stuff so uh she's made a good base

1313
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:59,399
for us to keep it running for the rest

1314
00:55:57,239 --> 00:56:01,719
of the fall and then we have the winner

1315
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:04,200
to to regroup and go from

1316
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:06,480
there great another sign question were

1317
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:08,879
the signs laminated in house or sent out

1318
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,240
to a printing company um that was

1319
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,079
actually a project for Megan she

1320
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:16,879
laminated actually she blew up one of

1321
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:18,880
our laminators uh this year so so we

1322
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:23,039
know the amount of laminating we did but

1323
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:25,960
we uh we we burned one up so so uh we do

1324
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:28,640
a lot of laminating uh on those signs um

1325
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:30,318
so so um she did everything from

1326
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:32,798
developing some brand new ones to

1327
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:34,759
printing out the old ones uh to

1328
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:38,759
laminating them and then we had this

1329
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:41,839
whole little system where we um have a

1330
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:44,240
um uh try to Soil and Water uh

1331
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:46,838
Department puts in fencing and they

1332
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:49,919
split a bunch of uh pressure treated

1333
00:56:46,838 --> 00:56:51,880
poles when they're pounding they donate

1334
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,200
those to us and we cut them into little

1335
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:56,039
uh angled sign holders that sit out in

1336
00:56:54,199 --> 00:57:00,480
the garden I should have did a close-up

1337
00:56:56,039 --> 00:57:02,400
one for you um so we put a little dab of

1338
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,280
silicone behind where the staple is

1339
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,079
going to be the sign goes on and then

1340
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:08,359
the staple goes through and then a dab

1341
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:11,240
of silicone on the outside of the staple

1342
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:12,880
so water doesn't ruin our signs and then

1343
00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:16,159
like I said we are really pretty good

1344
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:18,760
except for color making one full season

1345
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:20,798
before we have to replace them back out

1346
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,680
there and we we just consider that part

1347
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:24,679
of our budget for the garden putting the

1348
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:26,679
sage out there because that is our

1349
00:57:24,679 --> 00:57:29,358
silent salesperson if we were selling

1350
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:31,318
something but it is one of those folks

1351
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:33,078
or one of those projects where we see

1352
00:57:31,318 --> 00:57:35,719
folks in the garden when I'm leaving at

1353
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:37,880
night sometimes at 9 o' there might be a

1354
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:40,558
family out there picking some fresh

1355
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:42,160
raspberries and reading the signs uh and

1356
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,359
then the same in the morning if there's

1357
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:46,519
joggers they'll stop and look at what's

1358
00:57:44,358 --> 00:57:49,279
that Quint tree I've never seen

1359
00:57:46,519 --> 00:57:51,280
something like that so people always and

1360
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:53,559
we just had Megan's farewell meal out in

1361
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,599
the garden yesterday and when we went to

1362
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:57,599
come in I had three questions in a row

1363
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:59,200
of folks sto because somebody was in the

1364
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,119
garden and they asked the garding

1365
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:03,118
related question that they may not have

1366
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:05,400
come in our building for because you

1367
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:07,280
come through security and it's just a

1368
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:09,119
little spooky to some folks to have to

1369
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,760
come through sheriffs and stuff so when

1370
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,519
you're out in the garden you get like

1371
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:16,160
Megan said you get approached by tons of

1372
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:18,920
community members uh asking what this is

1373
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:20,558
how do I solve this you know I have

1374
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:23,159
trees dying from the drought how do I

1375
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:24,880
water them properly so it's that

1376
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:27,318
connection when you're out there is

1377
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:29,760
really good for that

1378
00:58:27,318 --> 00:58:32,639
awesome thank you um I have a question

1379
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:35,280
for both Roger and Megan but also for um

1380
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:37,598
everyone else that's attending um does

1381
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,240
everyone have sort of like a top garden

1382
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:41,720
based Learning Resource or a top

1383
00:58:39,239 --> 00:58:45,838
activity that they find uh works really

1384
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:48,078
well um it could be anything um yeah

1385
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:51,920
feel free to

1386
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:55,000
share um uh I mentioned it a few times

1387
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:57,639
and this is the turtle Sprout activity

1388
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,318
but it's a Act I pulled from Cornell's

1389
00:58:57,639 --> 00:59:02,759
Garden based learning website and it's

1390
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:05,440
meant for uh believe ages like

1391
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:08,559
kindergarten to maybe like fifth grade

1392
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:10,200
or something but um it it kind of has

1393
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:12,599
all the essentials of gardening packed

1394
00:59:10,199 --> 00:59:14,598
into one and it's fun like kids get to

1395
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:16,440
like draw their own turtle uh and then

1396
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:20,559
you fill just the stocking with some

1397
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:24,039
grass seed with Ark I believe we we did

1398
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:26,559
Dill instead but um so you just put some

1399
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:28,720
sort of like seed

1400
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:30,480
in the bottom that's small enough where

1401
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:32,919
it'll come up through the panty hose and

1402
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,679
then soil on top and tie it off and you

1403
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:38,318
just water it every other day it's very

1404
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:40,399
simple and then it starts growing um and

1405
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:42,759
unfortunately I wasn't able to see the

1406
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,280
kids that I did this activity with a

1407
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:46,520
second time like a week later because I

1408
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,960
would have loved to ask them if they

1409
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:51,000
like kept up with it if it actually

1410
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:53,519
started sprouting um but I think that's

1411
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,440
just like a a fun activity really

1412
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:58,679
affordable and like we did it we did it

1413
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:01,760
in Mass amounts we had like 30 kids plus

1414
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:04,960
I did several more the next day with Arc

1415
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,839
and it was very cheap um and fun and

1416
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,679
taught them a decent amount about

1417
01:00:06,838 --> 01:00:11,358
gardening in a short amount of

1418
01:00:08,679 --> 01:00:13,318
time yeah I'll chime in with another one

1419
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:16,199
um along those same lines of being very

1420
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:19,358
affordable and very easy and sort of not

1421
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:22,038
too material intensive um in this one

1422
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:26,159
you can call them seed bombs or seed

1423
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:28,119
balls or seed anything really so um you

1424
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:31,318
pretty much just take a large chunk of

1425
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:33,720
clay and each um person gets a a small

1426
01:00:31,318 --> 01:00:37,079
piece of it they flatten it out and in

1427
01:00:33,719 --> 01:00:40,318
the middle of um sort of the clay Patty

1428
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:42,240
you put some soil and some seeds they

1429
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:44,599
can be wild flower seeds they can be

1430
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:47,919
really any type of seeds I've done that

1431
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:52,160
with basil before um and then you smash

1432
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:54,920
it all into a ball and um it's just so

1433
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:57,399
easy the kids love the tactile kind of

1434
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:59,559
fun getting dirty part of it um but

1435
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:02,200
they're also taking Seeds home with them

1436
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:03,960
to plant then or plant at a later date

1437
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:05,480
so that's another really easy one that

1438
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,639
you can set up you know if you didn't

1439
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:09,400
know you had a group coming oh wait we

1440
01:01:07,639 --> 01:01:12,639
can always do seed balls because those

1441
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:14,039
are really easy to set up and and fun if

1442
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:16,358
we scroll down we might have somebody

1443
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:18,599
after Katie maybe oh good point let's

1444
01:01:16,358 --> 01:01:18,598
see

1445
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:28,440
here um so somebody asked about gravel

1446
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:30,679
uh for our Pathways you think landscape

1447
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:35,798
fabric instead you feel gravel was

1448
01:01:30,679 --> 01:01:38,239
better so um our walkways have fabric

1449
01:01:35,798 --> 01:01:40,199
underneath so that is like part of the

1450
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:42,598
answer and then a little bit chunkier

1451
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:44,439
Stone and then a really fine I think

1452
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:47,200
they called it stone dust from our

1453
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:50,000
landscaper and when that packs it is

1454
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:55,000
hard as cement with just a little loose

1455
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:57,039
on top um so wheelchairs uh strollers uh

1456
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,559
even walkers go through it really really

1457
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:02,039
well because of how it packs uh so but

1458
01:01:59,559 --> 01:02:03,640
it is all three levels in there so the

1459
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:05,039
fabric is below to keep weeds from

1460
01:02:03,639 --> 01:02:07,278
coming up I only get a little

1461
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:09,559
transitional weeds at the edge that try

1462
01:02:07,278 --> 01:02:11,358
to come in but they pull really easy out

1463
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:14,119
of that it's probably a good two inches

1464
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:18,038
thick of that stone dust uh and that was

1465
01:02:14,119 --> 01:02:19,480
put in from our landscaper and um I like

1466
01:02:18,039 --> 01:02:21,039
I said if I could ever afford to do the

1467
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,440
other half of the garden so there's an

1468
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:25,000
exit back out on the other end uh we

1469
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,559
would continue with that stone dust

1470
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,039
because it has works so well for

1471
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:31,640
wheelchairs on

1472
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:33,079
there and uh Pauline has question do you

1473
01:02:31,639 --> 01:02:34,960
have principal worksheets for that

1474
01:02:33,079 --> 01:02:36,720
activity um I'm not sure if that is

1475
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:39,440
directed towards the turtle Sprouts or

1476
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:41,358
the seed balls but um I know the turtle

1477
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:44,519

1487
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:06,759
thankfully I remembered it's really easy

1488
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:08,640
to forget um once I am able to download

1489
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,440
uh the webinar and sort of transfer it

1490
01:03:08,639 --> 01:03:12,838
to a different format I will then upload

1491
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:15,480
it to YouTube so if you have any

1492
01:03:12,838 --> 01:03:17,358
questions and are able to find it um in

1493
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:20,639
the next few days you can always email

1494
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:24,440
me uh my email address is up there

1495
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:25,879
Fiona I wanted to share um if you ever

1496
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:29,240
uh some of you probably have the old

1497
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:31,599
project wet uh curriculum um in there is

1498
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:33,838
the water cycle game it is a little bit

1499
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:36,599
more CU I had to build it and laminate

1500
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:38,759
the the dice that you roll but the

1501
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:42,160
little beads that the kids get in

1502
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:44,278
through the water cycle game um and then

1503
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:46,480
they share that bracelet at the end with

1504
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:48,599
their friends and they can see they got

1505
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,278
five of the dark blue in a row because

1506
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:53,119
they were stuck in the ocean it's where

1507
01:03:50,278 --> 01:03:56,159
the water droplet travels so sometimes

1508
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:58,960
like if it's like coming out of an as

1509
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:00,679
you're in it's only like one time that

1510
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,159
you're there but sometimes you maybe get

1511
01:04:00,679 --> 01:04:05,399
stuck in the cloud or in the ocean

1512
01:04:03,159 --> 01:04:06,960
multiple times and you may get seven

1513
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:10,200
beads in a row because you don't leave

1514
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:11,760
that station so they really grasp the

1515
01:04:10,199 --> 01:04:13,759
understanding of where that water

1516
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,240
droplet and oh that makes sense that it

1517
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:18,119
wouldn't be there very long versus yeah

1518
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:20,239
I'd be stuck as a water droplet in Ocean

1519
01:04:18,119 --> 01:04:23,200
for a long time and they all talk up

1520
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:25,959
their beads to each other at the end and

1521
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:28,239
ask what color is that I would never

1522
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:29,920
green I was never in a plant my little

1523
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:31,439
water droplet never made it there you

1524
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,559
know and something like that so it's

1525
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:36,480
really cool the way they share it

1526
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:37,920
afterwards which is a really win for me

1527
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,278
that that they understand it enough to

1528
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,400
share with their friends and talk about

1529
01:04:40,278 --> 01:04:44,119
you where they were in that cycle a

1530
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:47,400
little more prep work because you got to

1531
01:04:44,119 --> 01:04:50,119
buy the beads um and and the U make the

1532
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:51,358
little dice but but it is a fun water

1533
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:54,640
cycle

1534
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:56,838
game awesome are there any other

1535
01:04:54,639 --> 01:05:00,000
