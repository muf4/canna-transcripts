1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,360
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,839
University um today I'm going to be

3
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:12,480
talking about tea and the taste of

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:16,198
climate change I've been studying the uh

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,960
tea System since 2006 for me tea is a

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,000
really interesting way to examine human

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,118
interactions with the environment

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,079
because it is a plant system that humans

9
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:27,198
have managed for hundreds if not

10
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,759
thousands of

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,880
years um and I'm specifically focusing

12
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:34,878
on on um the impacts of climate change

13
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:37,159
on tea um as we know climate change is

14
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:39,039
impacting agroecosystems and farmer

15
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:41,359
livelihoods as well as the health

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:44,039
benefits consumers get from agricultural

17
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:47,799
products around the

18
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:50,359
world um for example um a longer

19
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:54,198
frostfree growing season can help

20
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:57,640
increase the production of specific

21
00:00:54,198 --> 00:01:00,320
crops um and as previous Scholars have

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,159
shown um this really depends where you

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,680
are located geographically in the world

24
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:07,478
and it also depends on the specific crop

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,040
um that you're speaking about whether

26
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:14,118
it's rice or soy each plant behaves

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,520
differently and most previous Scholars

28
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:19,400
have documented or focused on looking at

29
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:22,759
the impact of climate change on crop

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,759
yield this is relatively well

31
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,920
documented um and what my study focuses

32
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,560
on with my collaborators is looking at

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,079
the impact of climate change change on

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:37,200
crop quality um which is a lot less

35
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:40,000
acknowledged um and the way I am looking

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,600
at this is through a coupled natural and

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,399
human systems approach where we have our

38
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:48,239
natural system of biotic and abiotic

39
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:51,519
factors um and then we have our human

40
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:54,118
system um of Traders and consumers and

41
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:56,399
Farmers um and sort of the link between

42
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:59,200
that is the Agro agroecosystem or our

43
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,599
food production system and the feedback

44
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,118
loop between the natural system and the

45
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,158
human system that I'm focusing on in

46
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:09,038
addition to yields is really crop

47
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,319
quality um and then the way that the

48
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:14,559
human system sort of takes that response

49
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,878
and then feeds into the natural system

50
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,519
is through their actual adaptation and

51
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,598
management of

52
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,319
agroecosystems um and then obviously

53
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:25,799
these agroecosystems do not exist on

54
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:28,479
their own they're impacted by exogenous

55
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,080
change such as climate change policies

56
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:34,119
as well as markets um and so that's sort

57
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,280
of the overall uh socio eological system

58
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,560
which I'm looking at um and really a

59
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,080
focus on crop

60
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,360
quality and crop quality is important um

61
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,200
as I mentioned before um because it's

62
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,879
not only yields that are important for

63
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,959
food security uh or for the amount of

64
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:55,199
money Farmers receive from selling crops

65
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,878
it's also the actual quality of those

66
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,479
products um so if you're thinking about

67
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:03,158
all of these sort of diverse food and

68
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,039
vegetables um it's not only calories but

69
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:07,798
it's also the micronutrients and these

70
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,359
micronutrients vary based on management

71
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,360
of the Agro

72
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,640
ecosystem um for example um a carrot

73
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,200
grown in an organic system versus a

74
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:20,279
carrot grown in a conventional system

75
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,119
may have varying levels of um the

76
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,039
secondary metabolites that provide the

77
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,239
main health benefits from consuming

78
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:26,239
these

79
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,640
carrots um and so if you're consuming a

80
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,080
carrot that has relatively low

81
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,919
concentrations of these secondary

82
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,400
metabolites you're also not going to be

83
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:41,798
getting the same health benefits and

84
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:44,400
have to consume more um of the same

85
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,200
product and um so I've sort of taken

86
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,680
that framework and applied it to looking

87
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:52,479
at the te system um to see the impacts

88
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,159
on um te in my study but really thinking

89
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:57,318
about Botanical quality more broadly of

90
00:03:55,158 --> 00:04:01,719
both food and medicinal plants uh which

91
00:03:57,318 --> 00:04:04,399
are Central to ethnobotanical system

92
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:07,079
so the overall objective of my study is

93
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,840
to provide quantitative data how and why

94
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:12,239
T qualties vulnerable to changing

95
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,120
climate conditions um and that's at the

96
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,000
natural level of the system and then the

97
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:23,079
resulting linkages to uh the social

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,079
system both economic as well as um

99
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,520
cultural um so I'm just going to go

100
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:30,519
through the main objectives of this

101
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,519
study

102
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,959
um and today I'm going to share how um

103
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,879
climate is impacting T quality and yield

104
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,879
I'm going to share some data from field

105
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,918
sampling as well as manipulative

106
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,918
Greenhouse experiments so I've been

107
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:50,038
using extreme climate events in the

108
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:52,000
field as a proxy measure for climate

109
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:55,038
events that are supposed to become more

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,478
prevalent with climate change um and of

111
00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:58,639
course there's a lot of confounding

112
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,439
factors that occur with field sampling

113
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,720
and so I'm also coupling that with

114
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:05,478
manipulative Greenhouse experiments that

115
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,840
mimic um climate predicted or expected

116
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:09,879
climate factors um and then I'm bringing

117
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,839
those samples back to the lab to look at

118
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:15,959
the phytochemical

119
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:18,719
variation the second um objective is

120
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:22,120
then to take those same t- samples and

121
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,600
see the way the consumers are responding

122
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,120
to that variation in secondary metabolic

123
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,360
chemistry through sensory

124
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,959
analysis um and my collaborative we're

125
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:36,560
also doing agricultural economics

126
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:38,758
modeling um to look at how um climate

127
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,560
variables are impacting yields on a

128
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,038
larger

129
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,319
scale and the third objective is looking

130
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:49,759
at the way farmers are responding to

131
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:52,280
variations of clim climate variability

132
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,680
in their t- systems uh both based on

133
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:58,719
their direct observation as well as the

134
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,519
way they are responding to markets um so

135
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,520
if consumers are are perceiving sensory

136
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:06,839
variation in Te how does that impact

137
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:08,560
consumer buying decisions and then how

138
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:11,318
does that impact the way farmers are

139
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,639
managing their agroecosystems and what

140
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,759
decisions are they making based on um

141
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,360
consumer

142
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,038
responses and then finally the goal is

143
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,680
to take all of this varied

144
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:25,598
socioecological data and to construct a

145
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:29,759
model where we'll be able to simulate

146
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:33,159
the response of um T quality to variable

147
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:36,560
climate factors um and the goal of this

148
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:40,000
is to develop plans and policies um that

149
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,560
we can provide to tea Farmers um and

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,439
land use managers to better um adapt and

151
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,598
mitigate for climate

152
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:51,319
change so when I'm talking about te I'm

153
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:54,719
specifically talking about Chamilia

154
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:58,520
sensus and the the family um that is the

155
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:02,160
commercial Source um for all white green

156
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:05,000
oolong black and puer te so it comes

157
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,960
from this one single species and it's

158
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,680
the variation in the processing that

159
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,719
results in this diversity of flavor

160
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,199
profiles that we get but it is from the

161
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:18,879
same species um and census has two main

162
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,400
cultivars or two main varieties excuse

163
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,560
me the census variety which is a small

164
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:26,959
leaf or variety that grows in more

165
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,639
tempered areas and the ASA variety which

166
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:32,239
is the broadleaf variety which is is

167
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:36,199
considered the original variety that um

168
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:40,038
grows in tropical and subtropical

169
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:42,199
areas um and in addition to those

170
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:45,079
varieties there's also a lot of

171
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:47,439
diversity with lots of farmer land races

172
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:49,680
and Cult of ours the reason um

173
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,639
particularly in yam Province um in

174
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,240
southwestern China which is considered

175
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:57,879
the birthplace of the tea plant um so

176
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,199
unan borders Myanmar Vietnam and la and

177
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,800
in this area you see not just chamia

178
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:05,120
senses growing in the wild but also 11

179
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,158
other species that are closely related

180
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,399
to chamia senses um that farmers use the

181
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:13,918
germoplasm in their te systems for

182
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:16,279
ingression resulting in a lot of um

183
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,959
genetic diversity and having this area

184
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:19,878
be sort of the center of genetic

185
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:23,318
diversity for the tea

186
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:26,158
plant um these are a few farmer land

187
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:29,639
races so um with my background I would

188
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:32,519
say these are all chamia census for RIA

189
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,278
um and DNA barcoding would confirm that

190
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,519
um however the farmers that I work with

191
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:39,519
in unan have a different name for each

192
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:41,080
of these different um land races and

193
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,799
they also have different sensory

194
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,360
attributes or uses um for these even

195
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,639
though I'm saying they're all Chamilia

196
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,120
andensis variety OFA there's a lot

197
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:52,159
deeper ecological knowledge and use uh

198
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,600
by the farmers that are managing these

199
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,439
systems and they may have 15 to 20

200
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,519
different land races of tea within a

201
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,040
single Tea Garden of just a hectar so so

202
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,639
a lot of diversity and if you sort of

203
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:06,679
compare that to um our main um food

204
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,120
crops in the world um it's really

205
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:10,439
fascinating to see why and how Farmers

206
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,000
manage this

207
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,399
diversity um and um so tea plants can

208
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,919
you know tea leaves can grow to

209
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:22,360
different sizes um imagine one of these

210
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:24,159
tea leaves and furling in your teacup um

211
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,959
and that probably wouldn't happen so

212
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,240
much over here because usually when te

213
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:30,239
commercialized it's the young the new

214
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,639
bud and the adjacent two leaves are the

215
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,839
Harvest units for

216
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:35,439
commercialization however in indigenous

217
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,600
communities that have been managing tea

218
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,839
for hundreds of years um farmers do

219
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,000
harvest the older leaves which they use

220
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,399
to make tonics uh for immune boosting

221
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,240
and that's this is an example of that

222
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:52,720
Harvest um so tea in its native state

223
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,600
grows to be a a Tall Tree about 15 to 20

224
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,480
M tall and it grows in these beautiful

225
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:02,680
biodiverse forests um in southern Yan on

226
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,399
into Northeastern India in Burma and in

227
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:07,599
La um and then with human management

228
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,720
that sort of traditional Forest system

229
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,320
has transitioned so this over here is a

230
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,839
tagro forest um it still looks a lot

231
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,720
like a forest system um however it's

232
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:20,560
been intensified for tea production um

233
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,480
and some of the Woody plant species have

234
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,278
been removed from the system however a

235
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,639
lot of food and medical plants are still

236
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:30,439
maintained I had done an inventory of

237
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:33,159
about 20 m x 20 M plots and I found over

238
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:36,160
200 um food and medicinal plants that

239
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:39,319
were conserved within the space um by

240
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:42,360
the community for various needs um this

241
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,160
over here is a mixed crop system and um

242
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,919
it has tea and it's intercropped with

243
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:49,679
grains um however tea in most parts of

244
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:52,399
the world grows in monocultural Terrace

245
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:54,759
plantations um really for consistent

246
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,399
product and high yields um and so

247
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:58,039
there's a lot of different management

248
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,000
and obviously based on the different

249
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:03,399
management the phychem qualities of tea

250
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,399
also

251
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,720
vary and just another note on the

252
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,360
management of these systems an agro

253
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,320
Forest because it's relying on a forest

254
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,639
structure um doesn't need to have

255
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,440
agrochemical inputs like pesticides and

256
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,519
fertilizers because it's relying on

257
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,800
ecosystem Services provided by the

258
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:27,000
forest structure whereas monocultural

259
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,479
plantations even if they're organic

260
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,120
generally have agrochemical input

261
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,120
pesticides and um herbicides

262
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:40,120
Etc and as I mentioned um we're not

263
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,440
necessarily consuming tea for in large

264
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,278
quantities for yield um it really

265
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:48,360
depends on the the quality um and so if

266
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:51,240
you're a black black tea drinker versus

267
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,120
a green tea drinker um that variation is

268
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,278
because of the change in chemistry that

269
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,519
occur during processing um you might buy

270
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:02,159
high mountain teas versus low Mountain

271
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:04,639
teas um because you really uh have a

272
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,639
preference uh for specific

273
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,799
phytochemistry um so the main

274
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,200
phytochemicals um for tea that give its

275
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,958
health benefits are the polyphenols with

276
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,800
egcg being sort of the star antioxidant

277
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:19,719
compound which is gotten a lot of press

278
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:22,039
um and advertisement um and all those

279
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,360
different phytochemicals including the

280
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:26,559
polyphenols um and methyl xanthine

281
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,320
caffeine which gives tea stimulant

282
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:32,439
properties um theanine which makes tea

283
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,360
sort of a relaxant um all of these have

284
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,360
a specific taste which consumers are

285
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:41,079
able to perceive um such as Bitter Sweet

286
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,519
or bitter and sweet um and this really

287
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:45,559
varies again as I mentioned with

288
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:47,320
Environmental Management um and just a

289
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:49,879
little note over here on the bottom um

290
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,440
this shows sort of the evolution of tea

291
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:54,720
the historic use of tea was is

292
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,519
considered to have been medicine and um

293
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,720
sort of transition from medicine to a

294
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:02,440
tonic and eventually to a beverage

295
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,959
um tea leaves are consumed as a food in

296
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,600
some parts of the world um sort of like

297
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,599
a like a

298
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:13,399
salad um and T um I find it a really

299
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:16,120
compelling study system because it is

300
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:19,120
the most consumed beverage in the world

301
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,360
after water so it has really quite

302
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,039
widespread um utilization there's

303
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,039
hundreds of years of management and it

304
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:29,278
also plays an important role in public

305
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:32,240
health um because it provides a a

306
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:34,838
notable source of antioxidant

307
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,360
phytochemicals um and these are linked

308
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:40,920
to um different uh benefits in the human

309
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,199
body such as um

310
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:46,360
anti-inflammatory um prevention against

311
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:48,679
cancer as well as um for

312
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:52,720
cardiovascular um

313
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:54,120
health so T was um traditionally sort of

314
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,600
this the center of diversity as I

315
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,120
mentioned was in southern unon which is

316
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:02,560
over here um and because of these health

317
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:05,839
benefits provided by tea um it became uh

318
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:08,439
requested or uh demanded in communities

319
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,480
That Couldn't grow it so over here um

320
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,920
this red line basically is the um torse

321
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,839
Road um which is the book that Dr

322
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:20,439
Rodriguez had showed um and this is the

323
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:22,399
oldest te trade route of uh in the world

324
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,360
um and over here this is the Tibetan

325
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:28,240
Plateau this is Lassa over here um and

326
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,600
communities in the Tibetan Plateau um

327
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,000
live in pretty hard conditions where

328
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,720
it's really hard to grow fruits and

329
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,399
vegetables and they came to utilize tea

330
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,839
as a substitute for fruits and

331
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,879
vegetables um and that really is what

332
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:45,160
spurred the creation um off this old

333
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:46,919
historic Road um which Not only was tea

334
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:50,919
traded but lots of other

335
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:53,399
spices and medicines um and um and that

336
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:55,639
was sort of the first spread of tea um

337
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,440
and then as more and more communities um

338
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:00,480
began to know of tea and it was really

339
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,959
through Buddhist monks um um that spread

340
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,399
the consumption of tea um more and more

341
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:08,559
people began to incorporate into their

342
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,559
daily um

343
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:17,679
routine so I'm just going to share some

344
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,920
photographs from the torse road to give

345
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:23,039
you a better cultural context of this

346
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:25,479
area um this is an AKA Village it's a t

347
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:29,159
farming community in southern Yan where

348
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,680
I've been working since 2006

349
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:33,000
um and just some pictures of the torse

350
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,000
road

351
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:58,360
itself um so the last picture is um tea

352
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,880
being consumed um by Tibetan households

353
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,480
and it's been ched with butter um Yak

354
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:05,600
butter specifically so this is yak

355
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,360
butter tea has anybody tried Yak butter

356
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,600
tea yes how what's the flavor profile

357
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,600
for

358
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,599
you acquire

359
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:20,518
taste um and so I was mentioning earlier

360
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,039
how the uh the quality of tea varies um

361
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,120
based on environmental conditions and

362
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:27,078
this is just one example if tea is

363
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,639
harvested from um a low elevation versus

364
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:30,958
sort of at the top of the mountain um

365
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,480
data suggests that there is

366
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:36,000
phytochemical variation um and this is

367
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,639
why a lot of consumers um seek out high

368
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,559
mountain teas um and also the prices of

369
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,879
those are notably

370
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:45,919
higher um again we're looking at the

371
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,559
aagra forest versus a monoculture um and

372
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,639
some of the work that I had done for my

373
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:51,799
doctoral dissertation was to sort of

374
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,120
analyze um the difference the

375
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:56,958
phytochemical variation so this is an

376
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,399
Agra Forest um in an AA community and

377
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:02,359
this is um a

378
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:05,480
monoculture Plantation nearby um at the

379
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,279
same elevation and um we found that

380
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:11,759
there was um more than twice the amount

381
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:15,038
of um key catak and compounds for tea

382
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:16,959
procured from the Agro Forest um and

383
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:18,959
this may be because of many reasons it

384
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,839
may be because there's a lot more pest

385
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,640
pressures in an Agra Forest um or

386
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:24,958
because of shade trees or because of the

387
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,079
height of trees so a lot of different

388
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,919
factors which we're now looking at the

389
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:31,599
specific mechanism through Greenhouse

390
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,679
studies

391
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:38,558
H oh cakin are polyphenolic compounds um

392
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,600
that provide antioxidant um activity in

393
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:44,599
humans so it's sort of the link to the

394
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:44,599
health benefits um of green

395
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:52,879
tea and um these um so this is just the

396
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:55,519
variation based on the production system

397
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,440
and then based on geographic region or

398
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:02,279
the spe specific cultivar um the

399
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,759
photochemical is also vary in tea um so

400
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:08,319
in blue here we have all the different

401
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,319
sort of tea producing areas within

402
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:15,639
China and then as I mentioned before um

403
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,880
when you process tea from white tea to

404
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:21,000
black tea or post fermented po tea um

405
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,000
there's also a change in phytochemicals

406
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,558
um based on all the different processing

407
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,919
factors um so the main processing that

408
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:31,558
happens once tea is harvested is um

409
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:34,440
steaming it or pan frying it and this is

410
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:37,119
to deactivate the polyphenolic oxidase

411
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,080
that oxidizes the kaken compounds

412
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:41,000
rolling it to break down the cell walls

413
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:43,678
and remove moisture content and then

414
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,038
drying it and this really helps preserve

415
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,240
um the health compounds attributed to

416
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:51,079
the different teas and then variation in

417
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,519
these different processes um results in

418
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:54,519
all of these different types of

419
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,640
tea and um my previous work has shown um

420
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,640
as well as that by a lot of other

421
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,240
scientists that consumers can perceive

422
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,320
changes in t secondary metabolites um

423
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:11,400
and so this is a ranking of te 100

424
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:13,678
different teas and um the more the less

425
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,038
intensely rated tees also had lower

426
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,798
amounts of cakin as well as the methyl

427
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:20,079
xanthine

428
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:22,519
caffeine um and now I'm going to talk

429
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:26,439
about the cup of tea that specifically

430
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:28,918
drove my research um on the impacts of

431
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,360
climate change and tea um this is during

432
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:34,679
one of my first field seasons in 2007

433
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:37,119
and I was in a AKA household um drinking

434
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,559
tea after a long day of ecological

435
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:42,158
sampling um and then I returned to that

436
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:44,798
same house about 3 days later and the

437
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:47,360
East asiia Monsoon had hit um and we

438
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:49,639
were drinking tea again and um the head

439
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:52,399
of the household female says it has

440
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,880
changed the taste has changed um and I

441
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,600
was really curious what she meant um and

442
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,120
then her husband also drank the tea and

443
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:59,319
he also confirmed that the tea had

444
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:02,079
changed

445
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:04,759
um and uh what they were referring to

446
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,240
was that the East Asian Monsoon had hit

447
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:07,879
um and so they had sort of transitioned

448
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,038
from a spring Harvest to a monsoon

449
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:13,720
Harvest which is really attributed to

450
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:16,519
when the rains come um and uh and then

451
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:19,079
quality drops notably um and the prices

452
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:21,319
farmers get for their tea also drops um

453
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:23,158
and then when the Autumn Harvest is

454
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:25,558
basically determined by the retrieval of

455
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:28,039
the East Asian Monsoon and at this stage

456
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,720
the quality is perceived to increase as

457
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:32,839
well as the price that farmers get for

458
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,880
their tea so it really is an issue just

459
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:36,798
not just of the phytochemicals that

460
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,520
we're consuming but also the livelihoods

461
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:40,519
that farmers are getting from their

462
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:48,000
crop and after her husband um tested the

463
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,080
tea he determined the price to be about

464
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,279
half of that of the spring

465
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:56,158
Harvest um and this is just some data

466
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:59,038
showing how there's a drop in prices um

467
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,720
based on the different seasons

468
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:03,158
and that really made me start thinking

469
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,038
about the role that precipitation has in

470
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:08,919
Te quality and what does this mean uh

471
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:11,038
with increase or decrease precipitation

472
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:13,799
um that's occurring with um climate

473
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:16,599
change um and so the central tenant of

474
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:19,679
my study is um sort of looking at te as

475
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:21,959
an indicator species for climate change

476
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,679
and what this can tell us about other um

477
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,200
plants that we're using specifically for

478
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:30,080
the leaf um and then thinking about

479
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,720
taste um as a sense of climate change

480
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,119
and and its effects on food quality so

481
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,679
really thinking about the individual

482
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:38,319
consumer and the the role that they're

483
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,720
playing in um sensing climate change

484
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:40,720
based on

485
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,159
taste um and now I'm going to share some

486
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,360
data from the natural side component of

487
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,240
this

488
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:52,918
study um and so for the field sampling I

489
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,558
am working with my collaborators and

490
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:56,880
we're sampling at three different sites

491
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:59,079
in China or three different regions in

492
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,320
China which are different sort of

493
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:03,038
um kind of capture the different um

494
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:05,798
climatic conditions of major tea

495
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:07,759
producing areas in China um at each site

496
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:10,079
we have or location we have two sites a

497
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:12,400
high elevation and a low elevation site

498
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:16,079
we try to choose the elevations to be

499
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,960
somewhat the same um and um also the

500
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:21,918
cultivar that's in each of the systems

501
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:25,519
um is also uh We've accounted for and

502
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:30,320
we're sampling basically from 2012 till

503
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:32,720
2016 so it's a 5year study um um and um

504
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:35,359
you know and multiple Seasons within the

505
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,200
year and the goal eventually is then to

506
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:40,759
take all of the data on T quality and

507
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:44,519
yields um from these five years and

508
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:46,679
these uh six different locations um and

509
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:48,278
combine them to eventually um construct

510
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,360
our

511
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:54,558
model so I'm going to share data from

512
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:56,599
one of our sampling years um and this is

513
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:59,200
our very first sampling year and so this

514
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:01,759
was taken in just one location

515
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,440
uh where we sample basically across 15

516
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:08,558
days during an extreme drought period um

517
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:12,558
as well as the onset of the monsoon and

518
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:12,558
then during an extreme Monsoon

519
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:19,400
period um and over here we're looking at

520
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:21,519
the response of leaf biomass um from

521
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,480
during the drought to the monsoon so we

522
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:26,798
see an increase in both Leaf length as

523
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,640
well as um

524
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:32,359
weight um and then concurrently there is

525
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:35,480
a significant reduction in secondary

526
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:38,678
metabolite concentrations um from the

527
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,919
spring drought to the monsoon um so the

528
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:45,200
major antioxidant compounds that

529
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,200
determine T quality were shown to

530
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:51,359
decrease um and that work I I did in the

531
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,519
lab using um

532
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:57,359
hlc um as well as um some basic

533
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:59,879
bioassays and antioxidant assays um I'm

534
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:02,359
not a chemist and so that's why I find

535
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,000
collaboration um really to be um the

536
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:07,439
spice of life and very promising um and

537
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,400
fulfilling in my research um and so I'm

538
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,120
collaborating with some chemists who are

539
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:16,440
experts um at GC gcms um and so they

540
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:18,399
also um are looking at the same samples

541
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,759
um where they've developed this really

542
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,480
comprehensive tea library and um they're

543
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:26,278
looking at the specific volatiles or

544
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,759
Aroma compounds that determine T quality

545
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:29,079
and they also found that there were a

546
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:31,640
few more

547
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:33,839
um Aroma compounds um in the spring

548
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,038
samples or the drought samples compared

549
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:39,079
to the monsoon

550
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:42,240
samples um and so we found an inverse

551
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:46,639
relationship overall um in terms of our

552
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:50,919
Leaf weight um to secondary metabolite

553
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:54,080
concentrations um and um this suggests

554
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:58,240
um either a dilution effect and or uh

555
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:58,240
water stress to the plant

556
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:05,480
um and what does this sort of mean that

557
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,278
was just a seasonal study so what does

558
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:11,200
this sort of mean for larger climate

559
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:13,440
change um looking at um precipitation in

560
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,759
the field site shows that there really

561
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,600
has been historically um this looks at

562
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:22,558
data from 1980 to 2010 there really

563
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:25,599
historically has been this variation um

564
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,678
of uh precipitation throughout the year

565
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:30,879
and overall there seems to be a downward

566
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:33,759
Trend in precipitation at the study site

567
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,360
um which suggests that tea quality could

568
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:38,119
actually be getting better with climate

569
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:40,439
change however plants do have their

570
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:42,678
thresholds as we know um and so

571
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:46,440
precipitation becomes too low um this

572
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:50,720
may just um be detrimental to the plant

573
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:53,679
overall um and then looking at um that

574
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,600
was sort of annual precipitation um and

575
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:59,360
now looking at seasonal precipitation um

576
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:03,398
overall spring precipitation has

577
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:08,079
increased um since 1970 um about 15 to

578
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:11,239
20% of the study site um and then at the

579
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:12,439
same time um Monsoon precipitation has

580
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,000
also

581
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:18,840
increased um and the the decrease in PR

582
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,079
precipitation was during the Autumn

583
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:23,199
season and that's when um farmers are

584
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:26,199
not harvesting as much

585
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:29,038
tea um and then looking into the future

586
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:32,840
um future climate scenarios for the 2050

587
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:34,919
to 2079 period um shows that

588
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:37,519
precipitation is expected to decrease

589
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:40,720
during the Spring season so again

590
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:43,798
perhaps um this may impact te quality

591
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:46,798
positively if it doesn't cross the plant

592
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:48,319
threshold um and then during the monsoon

593
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:51,158
season it's supposed to be getting

594
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:53,839
wetter and so basically farmers are

595
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:56,399
going to be seeing variable impacts on

596
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:58,720
their te- systems um and that was only

597
00:26:56,398 --> 00:27:02,119
just for one year sampling at once study

598
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:05,558
site um and our goal is to take that

599
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:08,319
sort of coupled uh climate and uh T

600
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:10,319
quality data for five years um at these

601
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:11,918
six locations towards really having a

602
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,359
better understanding and making a

603
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,960
stronger statement um of climate effects

604
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:16,959
and te

605
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,000
quality um and I had also only shown

606
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:29,000
data from one site and this is looking

607
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,398
at tea production across China

608
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,079
um and this is looking at temperature so

609
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:36,000
there's been an upper trend of

610
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:39,119
temperatures in all T producing sites in

611
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,640
China um there's also been um while

612
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:42,599
temperatures are increasing

613
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:46,320
precipitation overall in tea producing

614
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:48,839
sites in China is decreasing um and then

615
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:51,639
overall yields have been increasing and

616
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:52,959
this is um taking into consideration any

617
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,000
changes in

618
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,960
technology for tea

619
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,919
production um and

620
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,200
um in the field we've only sort of

621
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:05,759
looked at

622
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,278
precipitation um and um temperature

623
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:08,839
however there's multiple dynamics that

624
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:11,880
are happening of course in Agro

625
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:14,959
ecosystems and farmers are reporting for

626
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:17,440
example um changes in pest pressures um

627
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,440
different weeds um and then changes in

628
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,360
pollination Dynamics within their

629
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,000
systems um so in the future we plan to

630
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:27,199
look at these um a little bit more

631
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,359
carefully um and we're going to be doing

632
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,759
that also in manipulative Greenhouse

633
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,918
experiments and I find these experiments

634
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:35,960
really wonderful to um engage

635
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,519
undergraduate students because we don't

636
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,840
have to take students all the way to

637
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:42,038
China which is also a great thing to do

638
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:45,558
but we can also um have a little Tea

639
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:45,558
Plantation right there in the

640
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,839
greenhouse um and one of the

641
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,159
undergraduate um research projects

642
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:54,839
looking at um different variables

643
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:58,640
actually found that the interaction of

644
00:28:54,839 --> 00:29:01,240
her biver with precipitation of set the

645
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,799
increased precipitation um and so when

646
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,000
we're just looking at a single climate

647
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:06,079
variable we may have one conclusion but

648
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,200
we when we actually look at the

649
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:11,759
interactions that are happening within

650
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:15,120
Agro ecosystems um one effect May offset

651
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:19,000
another effect um and interestingly some

652
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:22,599
farmers are um accounting for um pest as

653
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,798
a promising um strategy for when their

654
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:27,678
tea quality decreases so there's a

655
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:29,398
specific tea that grows in Taiwan um and

656
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,759
with the increased precipitation that's

657
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:34,518
happening during the monsoon season um

658
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:36,240
the quality is considered so low however

659
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:38,440
pest pressures are also increasing in

660
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,720
that area and instead of putting

661
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,720
pesticides as Farmers usually do they're

662
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:46,038
now actually letting the pests Pro

663
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,360
proliferate in their tago ecosystems um

664
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:49,119
because it sort of results in a

665
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:51,079
different change in secondary metabolic

666
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:54,319
chemistry and actually giving that tea a

667
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:55,519
slightly peachy or honey like Flavor um

668
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:57,558
and so these are all these different

669
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:00,319
sort of adaptation strategies that

670
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:03,119
farmers are taking um in response to

671
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:05,079
climate change or climate

672
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:08,158
variation um and now I'm going to share

673
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:12,119
some data from the human

674
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:14,480
system um so one thing that one of the

675
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:17,000
major components of the sensory analyses

676
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,519
and I don't have the data to share right

677
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
now um but I wanted to just show the

678
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:24,038
different types of sensory analysis that

679
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
we're doing so we're actually going to

680
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:28,038
be speaking to five different

681
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,480
populations um since there's a lot of

682
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:33,480
human variation and cultural variation

683
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,159
um on uh the way we respond or perceive

684
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,278
taste and our preferences so um one

685
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,840
population are tea Farmers Traders and

686
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:43,519
connoisseurs in China another one is an

687
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:45,959
expert tea panel at the te Research

688
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:49,599
Institute of China that's been trained

689
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:52,240
to really uh measure tea quality um and

690
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:54,879
then we are coupling this with um te

691
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,558
populations in the United States um one

692
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,679
is a tea panel at T University um and

693
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:02,918
then Western tea consumers um and

694
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:06,360
Western tea experts so really getting a

695
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:08,639
diverse group of consumers um to see

696
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:10,519
maybe only tea farmers and tea experts

697
00:31:08,638 --> 00:31:12,719
are able to perceive this difference

698
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:14,440
maybe uh Western consumers aren't or

699
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,759
maybe they are so these are sort of the

700
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,639
experiments that we're doing right now

701
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:20,200
to see how notable are um who's actually

702
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:23,959
able to discern these changes in

703
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,960
phytochemical quality

704
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:32,879
um and another major component of the

705
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:35,278
research is really looking at the way

706
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,360
farmers are perceiving um climate

707
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:40,119
impacts on their t- systems so I'm going

708
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:42,398
to share some a little bit of

709
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:45,000
information from three sites in the bong

710
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:47,879
mountains of southwestern China uh where

711
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,720
I conducted semi-structured surveys with

712
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:53,480
three different indigenous groups um the

713
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,600
bulong the LA lahu and the

714
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,519
AKA and then I took that survey data and

715
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:00,839
um carried out cultural conent ensus

716
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:03,200
analysis um to look at variation within

717
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:05,599
a community and between communities um

718
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,519
and these are some overall patterns that

719
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:11,599
we have seen um farmers are reporting

720
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:13,960
that there is increased rainfall um

721
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:17,199
unpredictability as well as increased

722
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:20,639
temperatures um and uh farmers are also

723
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:23,120
saying that um they really perceive that

724
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:25,079
rain impacts te quality however they're

725
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:28,398
not really sure how temperatures

726
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:30,599
increase um or impact te quality

727
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:35,319
um and that's some information that um

728
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:35,319
perhaps our T project will be able to

729
00:32:35,798 --> 00:32:40,879
show and um within these three different

730
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:43,720
indigenous groups um that all are in the

731
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,919
bong mountains we did find high degree

732
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,360
of informant agreement um on the effects

733
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:53,360
of climate change uh more recently I've

734
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:56,158
started to interview um T farmers and um

735
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,959
that aren't that don't own the land or

736
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,679
um these three indigenous communities of

737
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,558
managing tago ecosystems or their

738
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,278
communities have for hundreds of years

739
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:07,200
um so they really have this ecological

740
00:33:04,278 --> 00:33:09,000
knowledge that that has been passed down

741
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,480
um and more recently in Eastern China

742
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,159
I've been interviewing tea Farmers that

743
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,839
are more landless laborers um that have

744
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,880
only been some of them only recently

745
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:19,798
introduced this tea system and they have

746
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,480
a very different understanding of the

747
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:23,879
way climate is impacting their tea

748
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,639
systems so it's not that all farmers are

749
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,080
aware of this um I'm really seeing that

750
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:30,359
it's you know the indigenous Farmers

751
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:33,359
have a very different understanding um

752
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:35,359
compared to um Farmers that have not

753
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:37,558
necessarily managed an aggro ecosystem

754
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:41,479
for that

755
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:43,319
long and um the farmers you know that do

756
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,200
that that are aware of it are also very

757
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:49,038
concerned on the impact that it has um

758
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,558
on tea prices um so we were seeing this

759
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:54,879
inverse relationship of precipitation

760
00:33:51,558 --> 00:33:54,879
and T price

761
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,759
historically um and so how are Farm

762
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:03,199
responding to these different changes um

763
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:05,440
over here I've sort of summarized from

764
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,440
the coding of the data um some of the

765
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,240
different farmer responses to climate

766
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:13,559
change um so some Farmers have started

767
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:15,878
to um substitute different varieties and

768
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:18,279
make their Tea Gardens more diverse um

769
00:34:15,878 --> 00:34:19,799
others are actually planting other crops

770
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:23,560
um just so they aren't putting all their

771
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:25,760
eggs in one basket um there is some U

772
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:28,358
modification of the environment with

773
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,800
technology and management for example in

774
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:31,960
places where they have really intense

775
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:35,000
droughts um farmers are starting to

776
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:37,559
think about having irrigation systems um

777
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,119
I had mentioned the example of um

778
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:42,878
letting pest proliferate in the field um

779
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:45,480
there's also alteration of post Harvest

780
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:47,918
processing um and so during processing

781
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,760
you can really also change the chemistry

782
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:52,158
um so some tees that were historically

783
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,040
processed as green teas are now being

784
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,760
processed as oolongs or blacks where

785
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:59,039
they're really taking advantage of

786
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,280
processing to um enrich in the flavor um

787
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:05,039
there's also some repurposing of the end

788
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,160
use of the product um and overall in

789
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:09,079
certain communities people are very

790
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:12,358
active in sort of thinking about hard to

791
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:15,560
how to Market um their products

792
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:17,960
differently um and then in some

793
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:21,679
communities people are abandoning their

794
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:24,079
tea systems um or they're uh relocating

795
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:26,199
the locations maybe to higher elevations

796
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,640
in the mountain um which they perceive

797
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:31,118
as having or being more of resilient to

798
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:31,118
climate

799
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:35,719
effects um and so I previously had

800
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,679
talked about these two different systems

801
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:40,000
um the Agra forest and a t monoculture

802
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:43,559
and a lot of the farmers who do manage

803
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,358
both systems um this this uh monoculture

804
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:47,440
system has really been promoted

805
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:50,639
throughout China um through government

806
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:53,720
extension the grain for green program or

807
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:56,239
policy actually gave Farmers um

808
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:58,159
incentives to um have this sort of

809
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,118
system and so in some communities you

810
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:02,920
see Farmers managing both an Agra Forest

811
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:04,480
as well as a monocultural plantation um

812
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,358
and the farmers that manage both will

813
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,838
say how their Agra Forest are more

814
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:10,559
resilient to different climate variation

815
00:36:08,838 --> 00:36:15,078
that happens from year to year or from

816
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:18,639
season to season um and so looking at um

817
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:22,280
the drop in tea quality there was a

818
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:25,920
slightly smaller drop or notably um

819
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:28,280
smaller drop in Te quality um for Agro

820
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,838
Forest compared to the mon culture and

821
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,800
this is only sampling over one year so

822
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:37,078
we're going to be continuing this um to

823
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,079
see this trend uphol in more

824
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:44,119
sites um an Agra Forest also you know

825
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:46,000
provide a lot more economic benefits to

826
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:48,160
Farmers so this the blue line over here

827
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,760
is looking at the market price um at

828
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:53,879
this field site for Te from an Agra

829
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:56,480
forest and the Orange is looking at um

830
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,160
during the same season price for um

831
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,119
Terrace or modern culture for Plantation

832
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:02,399
tea so farmers really do have an

833
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:05,838
economic incentive um not just an

834
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:09,240
ecological incentive to um grow this to

835
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:11,159
grow teen Agro forests um and then some

836
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:13,598
of my previous work also showed that

837
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:15,838
Agro forests have um a little bit more

838
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:19,880
genetic diversity or notably more

839
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:19,880
genetic diversity than than Terrace

840
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:26,800
plantations um and so taking all of um

841
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,160
this all of this information that I

842
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,400
presented today

843
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:34,039
um just having you think as an audience

844
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:36,358
of the role of taste um as a um censor

845
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:39,199
of climate change and I'm not sure if

846
00:37:36,358 --> 00:37:42,358
you personally or have had relatives or

847
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:44,639
friends um say that oh this fruit or

848
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:46,838
vegetable used to tast really different

849
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:48,920
before when I was younger and some of

850
00:37:46,838 --> 00:37:51,159
that might have to do um perhaps with

851
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,480
the way it's cultivated or some of that

852
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:55,920
might actually have to do with climate

853
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:58,838
variables um so just something to think

854
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,920
about um and then specifically I'm

855
00:37:58,838 --> 00:38:03,239
thinking about tea as an indicator

856
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,559
species of climate change but what other

857
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:08,679
crops um can we look at to be an

858
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:11,639
indicator species for climate

859
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:14,838
change um and then the role of adaptive

860
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:17,879
capacity in determining the um extent of

861
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:20,358
climate effects um and so there's one

862
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:23,280
body of work that really focuses on

863
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:25,719
mitigating climate uh change and the

864
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,400
other um work that really focuses on

865
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:29,759
adapting to climate change um so what

866
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,119
would it mean for

867
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,480
sustainability um if monoculture

868
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:37,400
plantations um transitioned to systems

869
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:42,440
like

870
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:44,838
this um and overall um I've been

871
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:47,318
starting to use this coupled model to

872
00:38:44,838 --> 00:38:50,480
look at other systems as well not just

873
00:38:47,318 --> 00:38:53,079
te quality um so I leave you with a few

874
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,400
questions is climate change changing the

875
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:59,119
taste and quality of our favorite and

876
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,119
our local foods

877
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:03,519
and what does this mean for Farmer

878
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:05,759
livelihoods and what does it mean for

879
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:08,639
the health benefits that we derive from

880
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,920
the specialty crops and for food

881
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:14,480
security um and more re recently as I've

882
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,000
been expanding my research uh using the

883
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,719
socio eological model I've started to

884
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
look at the impacts of climate change on

885
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:23,318
maple syrup quality um and I know

886
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,760
there's some really great research

887
00:39:23,318 --> 00:39:28,199
happening here at Cornell um looking at

888
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,800
the impacts of climate change um on

889
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:34,480
maple syrup um and uh recently um my

890
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,560
collaborators and I got a USGS Grant to

891
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,199
look at this uh which is specifically

892
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:40,519
focusing on the impacts on quality

893
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:43,919
versus

894
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:46,480
yields and then in Montana where I teach

895
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,280
um I'm also starting to look at two new

896
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,838
systems which are huckleberries um and

897
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,359
fad cherries which are two agricultural

898
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:57,838
products that um the state really prizes

899
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:59,559
for its cultural identity

900
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:02,000
um and so I just wanted to thank you as

901
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:03,599
an audience for being here today um and

902
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,880
thank you so much Dr Rodriguez for

903
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:10,720
hosting me um and to Terror for all the

904
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,960
the coordination of this event um and um

905
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:13,399
also wanted to acknowledge my

906
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,358
collaborators it's a very

907
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:18,800
interdisciplinary collaborative project

908
00:40:16,358 --> 00:40:21,358
um and that's very much uh determines

909
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,280
the nature of my work um students and

910
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:26,799
undergraduate students are huge parts of

911
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:29,319
of the research um as are the farming

912
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,359
communities that I work with um and then

913
00:40:29,318 --> 00:40:33,519
of course um the National Science

914
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:35,719
Foundation for making the work possible

915
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:35,719
thank

916
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:45,079
you a change in the taste of tea over

917
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:48,160
the past like 15 years in green tea and

918
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:51,760
for the better and I'm curi well maybe

919
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:53,879
it's climate change but I um I'm curious

920
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,560
um does it come from different places

921
00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:01,000
what's available to us here now

922
00:40:57,559 --> 00:41:04,358
come from and does it come

923
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,119
from um less tasty

924
00:41:04,358 --> 00:41:09,559
places so more and more for the United

925
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:12,358
States tea has started to come from um

926
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:15,679
South America like Argentina as well as

927
00:41:12,358 --> 00:41:18,159
in Africa so a lot more tea is being um

928
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:20,838
sort of redirected from Asia to new tea

929
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:23,358
producing areas um so that's could be

930
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:25,159
one reason um is just like the change in

931
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:28,480
Geographic um

932
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:31,399
location could be one factor

933
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,960
and I guess also from where um companies

934
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:36,119
are sourcing um the quality of the tea

935
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,119
they're

936
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:44,800
sourcing yes the um I a study somewhere

937
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:49,440
where the rates of uh uh cancer of the

938
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:53,519
esophagus was was very high in in China

939
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,800
and it was partly related to the teeth

940
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:58,719
that they were creeping and and if I'm

941
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:02,280
correct the way they prepared is they

942
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:04,000
use extremely hot water is that is that

943
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,319
right so it really depends on the

944
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,079
specific type of tea but a lot of times

945
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:10,599
when people are on the goow they'll just

946
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,480
grab really hot water and put tea leaves

947
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:14,838
into like a thermos um and if people are

948
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,838
sort of drinking tea at home it's

949
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:19,440
usually not like that so there is a lot

950
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:21,400
of a lot of population that's sort of

951
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,318
drinks tea where the water is really hot

952
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,599
yeah

953
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:27,480
because basically the conclusions were

954
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:30,559
there was because they drank the tea so

955
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:33,480
hot plus of course the cat kins

956
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:36,040
themselves which can be quite damaging

957
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:40,000
so I'm just wondering whether you did

958
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:42,599
see any kind of high ratees of cancer uh

959
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,639
among this tea drinkers for example the

960
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:47,160
I guess I would say

961
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:49,400
inverse um in the communities that I

962
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:53,759
work with they they really don't have a

963
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:55,240
prevalence of cancer um yeah and and

964
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,720
it's not really something that's come up

965
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:59,598
in my research I'm not actually very

966
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:03,318
familiar with that specific study but

967
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,680
overall I would say the meta analysis

968
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:07,400
and reviews that have been done on

969
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:09,399
health benefits of tea um usually have

970
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,160
shown that it's been beneficial for

971
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,358
various Health outcomes obviously

972
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:15,279
depends on the type of cancer um so I'm

973
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:18,759
not actually familiar with that

974
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,359
study y whatever you call milk is

975
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:23,160
actually very beneficial in the fact

976
00:43:20,358 --> 00:43:25,199
that it that's that's why the bricks you

977
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:28,118
know when they add added milk they had

978
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:30,000
less rates of cancer of the Esopus and

979
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:32,318
it was apparently related to the fact it

980
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,318
was precipitated some of the kakin and

981
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:37,079
they were not as as tox toxic so I'm

982
00:43:35,318 --> 00:43:38,519
just wondering whether yeah so that's

983
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:40,640
interesting because a lot mostly the

984
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:45,400
cakin are linked to the health benefits

985
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:49,679
of the te so I would have to like that

986
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:53,240
yeah um while your data shows that there

987
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:56,279
are changes in precipitation patterns

988
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:59,479
during the monsoon season monsoons have

989
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:02,920
always happened so I would assume that

990
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:05,358
the quality and therefore the price of

991
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:09,000
tea harvested during or after the

992
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:11,480
monsoon has traditionally dropped for

993
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,559
Farmers yeah so I think it's always

994
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,358
there's always been sort of a variation

995
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:17,720
and it sort of now seems that the

996
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:19,880
variation is becoming larger with more

997
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:21,919
variation in climate event so it is

998
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,519
something that's always happened um but

999
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,920
it seems like it's becoming a little bit

1000
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:27,920
more very

1001
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,358
involved yeah

1002
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:35,559
you showed a huge variation in price

1003
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:38,078
between the plantation te and the Agro

1004
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:43,240
Forest almost 10

1005
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:47,599
fold what is driving this very high

1006
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:49,598
price for the Agro forestry te and do

1007
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:54,000
you see this difference when you do your

1008
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:56,760
GC Mass sple absolutely so about more

1009
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,519
than 99% of the tea produced in the

1010
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:02,599
world is in Terrace Plantation so it's

1011
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:05,280
less than 1% so one is just Supply it's

1012
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:07,359
very low Supply there's very little AG

1013
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,760
Forest te it's a system that's really

1014
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:12,598
been replaced in the last 50 years um

1015
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,720
and so the supply is really low and you

1016
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:17,079
can't just create an AG Forest overnight

1017
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:19,439
so even though monocultural plantations

1018
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:21,680
par far might see oh that's really

1019
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,559
attractive you can't suddenly have all

1020
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:28,318
these in your system so what what are

1021
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:31,200
the purchases valueing

1022
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:35,440
what are the purchases valuing what what

1023
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:38,480
makes a person 10 times more I know it's

1024
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,800
scarcity but okay most people won't do

1025
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:43,920
that just CU it's scarce there's

1026
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:46,359
something there must be appreciated

1027
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,079
right so I had just briefly showed sort

1028
00:45:46,358 --> 00:45:50,519
of the the difference in the figh

1029
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:52,318
chemicals so these are just the patens

1030
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:55,960
that are attributed to the flavor

1031
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:58,519
compounds um and so um the flavor is a

1032
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:00,639
lot more intense from AG Forest um and

1033
00:45:58,519 --> 00:46:03,039
you can I can definitely perceive it one

1034
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:06,679
of the indicators of really high quality

1035
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:10,318
tea if you don't have a gcgc or hlc um

1036
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:12,239
in your kitchen is um The Taste lingers

1037
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:15,079
a lot more when you have a tea from an

1038
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:17,399
ior Forest it's called gone um and a

1039
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:19,760
really high quality tea might have that

1040
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,639
honey like taste back in your throat for

1041
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:26,240
more than an hour um and so you can sort

1042
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:28,159
of you know it resonates for a while um

1043
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:32,558
and so that was one and then the second

1044
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:36,000
one is around 2002 2003 and as you can

1045
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:38,280
see the price of um Agro Forest T also

1046
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:42,039
hasn't always been the same it's really

1047
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:44,280
increased since 200 um two over here so

1048
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:47,960
prices have really been increasing um

1049
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:50,200
and in that period between 2002 and 2003

1050
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:52,800
um there were a lot of reports in Taiwan

1051
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:55,558
and Hong Kong of um Health negative

1052
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,559
health effects uh from drinking tea

1053
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:59,319
physiological respon

1054
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:02,640
um and they were attribute to pesticides

1055
00:46:59,318 --> 00:47:04,039
and herbicides um in tea plantations so

1056
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:07,239
it was really during that period that

1057
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:10,039
people began to sort out organic tea um

1058
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:12,598
and the U Agro Forest have absolutely no

1059
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:14,279
chemical input and so um it was really

1060
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:17,079
you can it tastes a lot better and then

1061
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:19,040
people felt safer um and then te you

1062
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:20,920
could you know there's High pesticides

1063
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:24,000
it makes your throat sort of feel dry

1064
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:27,720
instead of w

1065
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:32,079
High what is the TCC

1066
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:36,318
value for white tea versus the let's

1067
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:38,599
sayong the other the value so really so

1068
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:41,039
I had done um a study looking at there's

1069
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:43,318
a lot of variation on tea so like not

1070
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:45,199
all white te te's are the same not all

1071
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:47,960
green tees are the same not all oolong

1072
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:50,719
are the same within let's say just one

1073
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:52,559
type of white tea like Silver Needle

1074
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:55,078
depending on the manufacturer and how

1075
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:57,839
long it's been for there's significant

1076
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:59,519
variation um so a lot of the Main cins

1077
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:02,039
and antioxidant compounds and tea

1078
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:03,719
degrade after 6 months so those of you

1079
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:06,880
who have a closet of tea that you've

1080
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:09,480
been storing remember fresh is best um

1081
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,720
unless it's poor tea which actually

1082
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,240
supposed to get better with age what's

1083
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:15,919
the best way to

1084
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:17,558
store right so it's sort of the

1085
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,400
traditional things for uh preserving

1086
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:22,720
phoch chemicals which is sort of a cool

1087
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:25,400
temperature um removing as much of the

1088
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:27,159
air so kind this nice sealed um

1089
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,880
container if you have a bag I usually

1090
00:48:27,159 --> 00:48:30,759
sort of like remove as much of the air

1091
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,079
in the bag as possible if it's in a

1092
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:34,319
really big container it's only a little

1093
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:36,160
bit of tea put it in a smaller sort of

1094
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:39,519
airtight container and then keep it out

1095
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:39,519
of the dark keep it out of the

1096
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:42,639
light

1097
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:52,000
than this has been a production of

1098
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:55,000
Cornell University on the web at

1099
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
