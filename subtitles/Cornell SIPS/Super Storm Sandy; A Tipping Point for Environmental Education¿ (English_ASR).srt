1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,760
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,960
University um and thanks Don for

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,400
inviting me and for you all for coming

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,719
and also thanks for your cont

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,080
contributions to e capacity we're really

6
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:18,160
excited Don's going to be teaching an

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,118
online course he's had several grad

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,118
students helping him and also it's in

9
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:24,920
collaboration with ch Chicago Botanic

10
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:27,559
Gardens and um American public gardening

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,679
Association so that'll be in starting in

12
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:30,599
February right January January okay

13
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,159
great

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,159
so

15
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,920
um like probably a lot of you in this

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,120
room I actually think quite a bit about

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:46,160
climate change and um I really like

18
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,519
winter and cold weather so I always feel

19
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,198
you know kind of sad when we have those

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,039
slushing events or what we call

21
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:56,358
ithacating events in the winter I'd

22
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:58,800
rather see snow but I hadn't really done

23
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:01,559
much about climate change education

24
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,518
professionally um um for a long time and

25
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:05,679
I I kind of considered myself almost as

26
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:07,280
a climate change denier and not like a

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,479
denier and that I don't believe that

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,000
climate change is occurring but a denier

29
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:12,920
in that I kept wishing that it would go

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,560
away and that somebody else would would

31
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,719
you know help solve would solve the

32
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,799
problem I wouldn't have to worry about

33
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:20,519
it but when Hurricane Sandy occurred a

34
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,040
couple of years ago and I was in itha so

35
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,319
I wasn't down in New York City but the

36
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,640
images and thinking about people I knew

37
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,919
going through this um some of you know

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,400
Gretchen fens who recently retired from

39
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,719
Cornell Cooperative extend she was in

40
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,040
Far Rock ways just taking the brunt of

41
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:38,000
the storm um and then the media attenion

42
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,640
really made me sort of think about

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,879
climate change education I think in a

44
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,719
way it was a Tipping Point for me in

45
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:47,839
terms of my profession and especially

46
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:49,158
since as Don mentioned I direct epa's

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,520
National Environmental Education

48
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:53,240
training program it's a large

49
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:56,359
Cooperative agreement with um EPA five

50
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:58,000
years 11 million and so I felt like as a

51
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:59,519
leader in the field I really needed to

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,959
take more responsibility than I was

53
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,640
taking

54
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:08,560
and so

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:12,680
um my presentation today is U sort of

56
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,439
about um my search for what we should do

57
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,879
in terms of the field of Environmental

58
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:18,479
Education and how we should be

59
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:20,000
addressing climate change education um

60
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,560
because I don't know all the answers but

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,400
I'll be talking about several projects

62
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,479
that are helping me to find the answers

63
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,200
and we should have time plenty of time

64
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:29,199
for discussion at the end so I'm hoping

65
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,759
that that that some of these ideas will

66
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,759
generate some

67
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,560
discussion okay so you know you saw the

68
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:40,560
images um really kind of disturbing

69
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,560
scary do you need to turn down the

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,000
lights a little bit that would

71
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:51,199
help it's all the way in the back anyway

72
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,199
East 34 Street the Midtown

73
00:02:53,878 --> 00:03:00,120
Tunnel okay looks good thank you um and

74
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:02,039
then there was as you know a a lot of

75
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,480
media attention to climate change as a

76
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:07,000
result of Hurricane Sandy and especially

77
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:09,158
Bloomberg uh I think was is really a

78
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,919
leader in taking action in terms of

79
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:14,199
Mayors nationally and

80
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,878
internationally so you you kind of knew

81
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:18,479
that people are going to rebuild they're

82
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:20,679
going to uh restore sites like this

83
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,919
community garden uh before it was

84
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,400
restored after and then after it was

85
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:26,759
restored so this is immediately after

86
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,640
Hurricane Sandy but we didn't really

87
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:31,079
know how they'd rebuild and if if the

88
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,438
sort of event would make them rebuild in

89
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,280
different ways if they would adapt and

90
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:37,719
think about things differently as a

91
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,719
result of this major

92
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:43,639
event um and I'm particularly interested

93
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:47,399
since I'm in Environmental

94
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:49,079
Education about interested in the

95
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,480
learning opportunities that occur

96
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,400
through Community gardening or through a

97
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:55,639
another stewardship or Civic ecology

98
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,158
practice like this one which is Dune

99
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:00,759
restoration after Hurricane Sandy so

100
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:03,120
people are planting uh uh Dune grasses

101
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:05,158
to try and restore the dunes to protect

102
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,200
from high water

103
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:10,078
events but before I talk about uh

104
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:11,679
Hurricane Sandy and how people reacted

105
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,000
in in particular environmental Educators

106
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,640
I wanted to give you a quick primer on

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,160
Environmental Education for those of you

108
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:21,240
who aren't familiar with the field and

109
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,439
basically Environmental Education is

110
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,759
about increasing knowledge and attitudes

111
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:28,399
about the

112
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,280
environment but it's also about

113
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:34,839
increasing people's ability to make

114
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:34,839
informed decisions and take responsible

115
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:43,519
action so as a l Grant University we do

116
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,280
a lot of Science Education and we kind

117
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,758
of think of our mission as extending the

118
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,519
science based knowledge to the people of

119
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:50,439
the state and Beyond so we more stick to

120
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,038
science

121
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:54,800
knowledge and Environmental Education

122
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:56,240
also incorporate science knowledge we do

123
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,120
a lot of environmental Sciences

124
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,160
education so to speak but we add on Civ

125
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,240
engagement and it's also a very

126
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,800
normative or values driven field so

127
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,960
we're doing this for a purpose and that

128
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,000
is to hopefully encourage environmental

129
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:13,038
responsible behaviors and then increase

130
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,759
Environmental Quality so I think that's

131
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:16,918
a bit different from Science Education

132
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,919
per

133
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,759
se but there's a couple of problems with

134
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:24,519
Environmental Education and I think this

135
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,600
one also applies to Science Education

136
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:28,879
and so that that is that basically

137
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,960
knowledge even though we assume that say

138
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,519
if people know more about climate change

139
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,959
then they'll act according to the ways

140
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:37,318
we'd like them to act so but knowledge

141
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,918
doesn't necessarily lead to action so

142
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:43,479
these two figures are taken from a paper

143
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:44,918
by Dan cayan who's at uh Yale University

144
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:47,240
and so if you look at this first one on

145
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:48,799
the y axis you have climate science

146
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,759
intelligence so how much they know how

147
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,478
many correct responses they get on a

148
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:56,240
survey or a test of about climate

149
00:05:53,478 --> 00:06:00,360
science and if you look across here it's

150
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,960
people's positions on global warming

151
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,720
so whether you believe your position is

152
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:07,239
that there's no warming occurring

153
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,639
warming is naturally caused or warming

154
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,918
is human induced doesn't have any

155
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,000
correlation with how much you know about

156
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,680
climate

157
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,639
science and if you can see this bottom

158
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,639
graph

159
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,199
here it kind of explains what does

160
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:23,680
determine our positions on climate

161
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,400
change so how much you proceive global

162
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,800
warming as a risk whether it's extremely

163
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:30,679
high risk or not a risk at all has a

164
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,598
whole lot to do with whether you

165
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,800
identify yourself as a very liberal

166
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:37,000
strong Democrat or a very conservative

167
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,319
strong Republican right so it has less

168
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,959
to do they've actually had some other

169
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:42,240
graphs in this paper that show that the

170
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,959
Republicans may have just as much

171
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,160
knowledge as the Democrats but how they

172
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,598
react is determined by our identity

173
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,800
essentially what political identity that

174
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:51,800
we

175
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,918
assume and another another problem with

176
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,319
knowledge um the assumption that

177
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,240
knowledge leads to action can be viewed

178
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,400
through this lens of Terror management

179
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,560
Theory I don't know how many of you know

180
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:09,279
my colleague Janice Dickinson she wrote

181
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:13,319
a paper in 2009 it's an ecology and

182
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:16,359
society and she synthesized a whole

183
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,960
bunch of empirical studies about ter

184
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,840
that are uh going through the L using

185
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,439
the lens of Terror management Theory and

186
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:24,878
then she applied that to how we think

187
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:27,199
about or how we react to climate change

188
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,400
so the whole idea here is that if I were

189
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,879
to tell you that global warming is a

190
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,519
occurring it's a disaster you know we're

191
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:34,960
not going to be able to produce that the

192
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,878
crops we're producing in New York state

193
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,359
we're going to have droughts we're going

194
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,199
to have flooding and what's more we're

195
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,120
going to have diseases and it's going to

196
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,800
be total devastation then I might make

197
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,759
you feel vulnerable so what you want to

198
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,199
do is then make yourself feel Invincible

199
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:51,038
less vulnerable I mean we see this with

200
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,680
I I apologize this is a little sexist

201
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:54,878
but you know guys when they get to sort

202
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,038
of be the midlife crisis they like to

203
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,520
buy SUVs or trucks or nice little sport

204
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:02,839
car convertibles um they they may be

205
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:04,680
feeling with age a little age related

206
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:08,598
vulnerability and they want to be

207
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:11,360
Invincible well when Sarah Palin and her

208
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:13,038
colleagues or her supporters you know

209
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,759
they were getting sort of bombarded by

210
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,839
sort of drilling in Alaska and

211
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:18,158
environmentalists well they really made

212
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:21,359
themselves feel really strong and

213
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:23,279
Invincible by talking about drill baby

214
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,840
drill and I don't know how many of you

215
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,719
can see this guy here but he looks a lot

216
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,038
to me like Vladimir

217
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,200
Putin and we all know how close Russia

218
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:33,799
is to Alaska so maybe he was there and

219
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,120
he probably believes in drill baby drill

220
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:39,439
too so but the idea is this um teror

221
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,038
management theory is that we might have

222
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,560
reactions unintended or people might

223
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:45,240
have reactions that we didn't intend

224
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,119
when we tell them how bad things are

225
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,600
because they want to make themselves

226
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,600
feel less

227
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:55,799
vulnerable okay so another problem with

228
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:58,039
Environmental Education is that the type

229
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:00,559
of action that Environmental Education

230
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:01,399
often not always but often sort of tries

231
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:05,039
to

232
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:06,600
Foster is individual behaviors usually

233
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,078
not always but it's often like okay

234
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,240
reduce water while you're taking a

235
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:13,039
shower while you're brushing your teeth

236
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,680
um walk to work instead of drive to work

237
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:16,480
and when you consider the scale and the

238
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:19,958
magnitude is sort of the timing that

239
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,800
it's here already um global warming as

240
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,319
well as the magnitude of the issue I

241
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:24,479
think there's a bit of a scale mismatch

242
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:29,640
and some of the behaviors that we

243
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,759
promote and what's needed and then also

244
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,958
the idea of mitigation versus adaptation

245
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:37,519
so Environmental Education has almost

246
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:39,278
totally been focused on mitigating our

247
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,839
impact on global warming right so we're

248
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:45,919
reducing our energy use we're reducing

249
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,959
um our use of plastics for example we're

250
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,439
recycling so we're trying to mitigate

251
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:53,000
human impact on climate change or on the

252
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,480
environment but given what we know about

253
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,799
climate change that is already here uh I

254
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,639
think the field really needs to think

255
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:59,639
about

256
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,958
adaptation and

257
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:02,360
this is one of the reasons I avoided

258
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,278
this for a long time is because for

259
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,639
adaptation almost like you're being a

260
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:07,600
turn Cod if you're an environmental

261
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,799
educator or you're sort of giving up the

262
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,959
fight because you're all of a sudden

263
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:13,919
saying that you know we're not just

264
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,599
going to try to conserve what we have

265
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:19,399
we're also going to face reality and

266
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,399
adapt to what's already

267
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,200
happening so just in summary three

268
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,278
issues that I think face our field of

269
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,000
Environmental Education and are why we

270
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,519
need to think about changes in our

271
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,360
practice of Environmental Education or

272
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,839
in our discipline and they are that

273
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,759
knowledge doesn't necessarily lead to

274
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:42,360
behavior change scale mismatch of the

275
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,519
actions that we Foster or promote versus

276
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,159
what's occurring with global warming and

277
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:50,519
then the need to consider

278
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:50,519
adaptation so I'm going

279
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:59,759
to so but I don't really know how we

280
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:01,480
should change

281
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,600
so one of the things I did I like to

282
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,839
think of it as crowd sourcing there's

283
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,959
three projects that I'll discuss today

284
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,720
that we're using to help us figure out

285
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,759
how our field might evolve or change and

286
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,360
the first one is actually a research

287
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,600
project where we looked at New York City

288
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,919
environmental Educators who experien

289
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,240
Sandy and then I'm going to talk about

290
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:24,599
uh it's really an Outreach or extension

291
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,079
type project climate change

292
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,480
Environmental Education fellows and then

293
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:31,479
we also convened a panel of national

294
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,120
experts in global warming and

295
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,680
Environmental Education to help us

296
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,519
understand what they thought the field

297
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,919
should be

298
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,720
doing okay so the first one we looked at

299
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,838
New York City environmental Educators

300
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,759
after Sandy and the question we asked

301
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:49,079
was how did their programs respond to

302
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:52,559
the event to the

303
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:54,479
superstorm and out of a sample of over I

304
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,119
think it's about 2,000 environmental

305
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,200
stewardship organizations in New York

306
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,679
City and these have been documented and

307
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,920
mapped by the US Forest Service Urban

308
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,278
Field Station Urban research station in

309
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,039
the city and they include everything

310
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:09,480
from you know major sort of policy

311
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:10,838
organizations to these small scale

312
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,039
Community Gardens so that's why there's

313
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:17,680
a lot and we took a sample of

314
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:19,078
45 that we thought it was a purposeful

315
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,000
sample that we thought were most likely

316
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:23,039
to be engaged in Environmental

317
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,799
Education and we interviewed them

318
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,679
open-ended interviews conducted site

319
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,559
visits and then uh analyzed these

320
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,519
open-ended responses to look at what

321
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:33,039
themes might come out and I should say

322
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,159
that the majority of this work was

323
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:38,639
conducted by a person who works for me

324
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:38,639
in New York City and his name is Bryce

325
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:45,559
Duo okay so we found two kinds of

326
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:47,198
changes one was in the programs the

327
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:49,119
actual Environmental Education programs

328
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:51,759
that people were conducting and the

329
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,679
other was in the organizations that were

330
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:56,958
doing these programs and I'm just going

331
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:59,799
to talk about the first the program

332
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,919
changes and there were three that

333
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:04,559
emerged through these interviews one was

334
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,759
that uh organizations or programs were

335
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,638
reinforcing existing

336
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:11,278
content second was that they were

337
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:14,240
conducting new types of stewardship or

338
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:16,000
restoration activities and the third was

339
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,799
that they were incorporating this notion

340
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,799
of resilience quite a bit into their

341
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:27,199
programs so an example of reinforcing

342
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:29,599
existing activities green map is an

343
00:13:27,198 --> 00:13:32,679
organization in New York City and they

344
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,959
map Green spaces green places around the

345
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,278
city so that people if they want to

346
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:38,479
visit a community garden or they want to

347
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:40,639
go to Highline um the Highline park or

348
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,480
they want to go to another small or

349
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,519
large Park they can kind of know where

350
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,240
these green spaces are and after

351
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:49,480
Hurricane Sandy they simply imposed

352
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,639
places that were

353
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,000
impacted um by Hurricane Sandy on their

354
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,839
maps and also thought of them as

355
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,240
opportunities where they might restore

356
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,040
some of this green

357
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:03,720
space so um this sort of idea of really

358
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,480
reinforcing what you're already doing uh

359
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,480
was quite common and I think another

360
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,240
example is a school and it was in Queens

361
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,278
and they had been teaching about energy

362
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,600
for and um water resources and they

363
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,439
simply used Hurricane Sandy then as

364
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,959
examples for what they'd already been

365
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,759
teaching about because kids were very

366
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:25,518
aware of energy um since their energy

367
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,519
was cut off sometimes for several

368
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:32,159
weeks so a second type of change was new

369
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,838
environmental stewardship activities

370
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:36,000
this one's with the Breezy Point green

371
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,600
committee and again for those of you who

372
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,159
know gret and farens this is her

373
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,360
neighborhood in the Rockway and she was

374
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:45,600
a leader of this activity and I showed

375
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,839
another slide earlier but the idea of

376
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,879
trying to restore Dunes to reduce the

377
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,880
impact of future High Water

378
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:58,078
Events and um we weren't really

379
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,440
surprised that people were engaging in

380
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:02,039
the stward activities not just because

381
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,519
they think it can protect them against a

382
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:06,319
future event but because our past

383
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:10,159
research and this is Keith tidball and

384
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,959
my lab and myself we've um seen over and

385
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,879
over again how after a disaster or

386
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,559
during times of conflict people often

387
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,759
turn to gardening and other forms of

388
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,479
Greening as a response and it's more

389
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:22,039
sort of their individual psychological

390
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,839
resilience in a lot of cases although

391
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:25,679
they may also say it's going to bring

392
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,639
their neighborhood or their ecosystem

393
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:32,078
back so just as other examples after um

394
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:34,560
911 we saw a lot of Memorial Gardens

395
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:37,159
sort of spontaneously created they might

396
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,799
take um a median strip and plant there

397
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:42,278
or take a community garden and add some

398
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:44,078
daffodils to it as a memorial garden and

399
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:45,679
uh Keith worked a lot after Hurricane

400
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:48,719
Katrina and New Orleans and he found a

401
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,359
lot of um tree planting and tree care

402
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,720
which is consistent with New Orleans and

403
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,519
the idea of the Live Oaks and how

404
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,319
important they are to the identity of

405
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:59,399
the city and as as Don mentioned we

406
00:15:56,318 --> 00:16:00,838
captured all that in this examples

407
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,360
really from around the world we have

408
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:03,839
this is an edited volume but we have

409
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,839
somebody from Berlin who talked about

410
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,160
The Greening of the Berlin wall after

411
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,600
the fall of Communism so and there's

412
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:13,078
lots and lots of examples of this

413
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,079
Greening in what we call Red

414
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:21,479
zones so the Third Kind of change was

415
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:24,039
this incorporation of resilience and

416
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,639
resilience speak into these programs and

417
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:29,078
these are a couple examples upros is a

418
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,079
community organization in Brooklyn and

419
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:34,239
they created a climate Justice Community

420
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:36,519
resilience Center and then green map or

421
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,198
excuse me grow New York City they

422
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:39,959
created this resilient New York City

423
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:43,120
Community Gardening Guide so it's how

424
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:46,078
people can address issues like um

425
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,839
saltwater inundation of their soils and

426
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,519
trees falling in the middle of their

427
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,519
Gardens and so

428
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,440
forth and it's probably not surprising

429
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,278
that people are using this term

430
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,079
resilience because

431
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:02,759
uh

432
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:05,480
Bloomberg actually created this new

433
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,240
resilience guide as part of plan New

434
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,838
York City which well he's no longer

435
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,000
there as mayor but was his

436
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:13,879
sustainability plan for the city but

437
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,480
also this term resilience is really

438
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,880
popping up everywhere and I I think that

439
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,798
people often don't know what they're

440
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,959
referring to because it's such a the

441
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:23,480
term has so many different meanings

442
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,959
there's individual or psychological

443
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,279
resilience there's um ecological

444
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:28,960
resilience there's engineering

445
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,200
resilience and there's social ecological

446
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,880
systems resilience just to name a few

447
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,038
and so Bryce DUIs and I now were

448
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,120
following up with some of these groups

449
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:38,119
in New York City to determine what they

450
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:40,759
really mean by

451
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:43,519
resilience um and I was in New York City

452
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:46,319
giving a talk last Friday and somebody

453
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:48,480
said that the term resilience is very

454
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:51,798
resilient and then we had a resilience

455
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,200
workshop last Friday at uh that Doos put

456
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:57,679
on in man library and somebody said the

457
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,960
same thing so but just to show you how

458
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,480
much this term is catching on I was

459
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,880
reading the journal our own itha journal

460
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,599
this morning oh actually it's USA Today

461
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:12,039
itha Journal but anyways um and they

462
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:14,678
say Hoboken New Jersey Paul finds that

463
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:17,119
neighborly neighborliness

464
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:19,120
matters neighbor helping neighbor trust

465
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:22,558
in a community looking out for each

466
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:24,798
other an Associated Press and orc Center

467
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:27,279
for public affairs research survey

468
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:28,839
suggests that those factors collectively

469
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:31,119
termed social

470
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:33,558
resilience have a big impact on how

471
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:37,038
prepared communities feel for disasters

472
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:39,319
such as super storm Sandy 37% of

473
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:41,720
residents in areas reporting high levels

474
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:43,918
of neighbors helping each other are very

475
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,759
or extremely confident their

476
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:49,000
neighborhood would recover quickly from

477
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:51,679
a disaster compared to 22% in areas with

478
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,400
lower levels of neighborhood neighborly

479
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,559
cooperation I think they probably would

480
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,038
have called this social capital or

481
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:58,480
social connections or something else a

482
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:00,759
few years ago but now it's becoming

483
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,759
social

484
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:06,440
resilience okay

485
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:13,119
so my question that I addressed in this

486
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:14,839
part of the talk was whether Hurricane

487
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,038
Sandy was really a Tipping Point for

488
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:18,038
Environmental Education and

489
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:20,119
environmental Educators in New York City

490
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:22,279
and sort of whether it stretched the

491
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:23,959
limits of what they were doing and they

492
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:25,798
went over sort of broke with what they

493
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,600
were doing in the past and I would say

494
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:30,319
that there's the answer is probably no

495
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,759
there were a bunch of small Innovations

496
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:34,279
but it wasn't as I'd sort of maybe hoped

497
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:38,038
for that they came up with all the

498
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:41,599
solutions of how we should address um uh

499
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:43,480
global warming in Environmental

500
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,038
Education so I'm going to turn to the

501
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,319
next project and this is a project

502
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:48,919
that's part of that National

503
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:52,038
Environmental Education training program

504
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:53,679
that Don mentioned and we have a fellows

505
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:55,679
program they're called Community climate

506
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,679
change fellows and what we did we have

507
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,360
26 people they were selected from a

508
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,880
group from across the country and in

509
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:04,158
Mexico and

510
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,039
Canada and we did a workshop with them

511
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,240
for a week they came together and as a

512
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:09,558
result of this workshop and the

513
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,798
resources we're putting into them

514
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:13,918
they're supposed to do some local

515
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:16,119
community climate change

516
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,640
interventions and so again we're kind of

517
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:19,158
looking for what do these practitioners

518
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,520
in the field come up with and what can

519
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:23,280
we learn from

520
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:26,158
them so what I want to do now is share

521
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:28,839
with you here's um just some of the

522
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,720
fellows as I mentioned we have 26

523
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:32,558
but I wanted to share with you a couple

524
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,640
of the projects they came up with so

525
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:36,319
this one's by Jason Davis and he's in

526
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,200
Boston he's actually a

527
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:41,798
musician and he came up with this idea

528
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,080
of recording climate change stories and

529
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:45,359
I want to play one for you and I want to

530
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:48,759
ask you to think about whether this

531
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:50,479
story feels impactful to you about you

532
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:52,599
know how you think about climate change

533
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,839
and and whether it

534
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:57,038
might move you or maybe even make you

535
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,279
think differently or want to do

536
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:01,319
something differently

537
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,720
my name is Fred small I'm the senior

538
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:06,720
minister at First Parish in Cambridge

539
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,679
Massachusetts unarian Universalist one

540
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,600
of the special places to me is the coast

541
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:14,159
of Maine uh where my wife's family has

542
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:18,480
uh had a place for Generations uh on

543
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:22,520
ponam Bay uh my wife and I have kayaked

544
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:26,159
uh all along the main coast and up U uh

545
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:29,319
off Nova Scotia I grew up in New Jersey

546
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:32,440
which is not that dissimilar a climate

547
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:34,639
and uh I'm a Four Seasons guy it's the

548
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,200
changing of the seasons that that

549
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,240
excites me there's something about that

550
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,880
that cycle of Seasons that is H very uh

551
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:48,200
nourishing to me reading Bill mckibben's

552
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:50,799
book the end of nature in 1989 was um

553
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,960
painful for me and and many of us I

554
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:57,839
think it it just began uh a a decades

555
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,840
long season of grief so that what might

556
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:02,199
have have been a

557
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:05,278
beautiful um sometimes called Indian

558
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,720
summer day uh just a kind of gift like

559
00:22:05,278 --> 00:22:09,599
wow you know it's what a beautiful day

560
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:13,200
it's so warm and pleasant here in

561
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:17,199
October or November or December uh then

562
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,840
becomes a uh an omen uh something

563
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,759
disturbing my daughter is 11 and she's

564
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:25,720
already said that she wished she had

565
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:28,480
been born earlier um because she doesn't

566
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:31,759
look forward to what is in store for her

567
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:35,278
and and her generation and as a parent

568
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:38,879
you know that that breaks my heart uh to

569
00:22:35,278 --> 00:22:40,440
hear bad things are going to happen but

570
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,840
bad things have happened before in human

571
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:47,240
history very very bad things uh you know

572
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:51,798
the the Great Plague in in in Europe uh

573
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:55,558
uh the Holocaust uh slavery uh uh you

574
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:58,639
know all kinds of suffering some uh if

575
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:59,918
you will natural some perpetrated by

576
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,480
human

577
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:05,440
depravity uh that isn't to minimize it

578
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:08,319
but to say that we do have the capacity

579
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,558
to get through this but what I think is

580
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:16,200
crucial is that we've got to do it with

581
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:19,839
with love and not lose our spiritual

582
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:23,200
center or our moral compass as we go so

583
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:25,119
for me as a as a religious leader the

584
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,480
question is not are we going to win or

585
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:29,319
are we going to lose because in a sense

586
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,200
we've all already lost we've lost

587
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:36,240
tremendous amounts of of of people and

588
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,679
species and good things that we will not

589
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,880
be able to recover and I think it's

590
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:44,679
going to get worse so the question is

591
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:47,278
not winning or losing but if you will

592
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:50,000
how we play the game do we

593
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:51,480
stay loving do we stay compassionate do

594
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,119
do we treat each other well do we treat

595
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,880
our enemies well do we love our enemies

596
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:59,879
as Jesus challenged us to

597
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:03,600
do

598
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,559
so you could my name is Dennis oops

599
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,558
sorry about

600
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:08,558
that

601
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,278
stop unless you all want to hear some

602
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:17,158
more but you can see that he has a bunch

603
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:18,720
of um he's he's recorded a bunch of of

604
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:20,600
these climate change stories from people

605
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,120
in in the US and Canada there was one

606
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:24,399
from Poland and you can go onto his

607
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:26,639
website and listen to others if you

608
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,960
think that they're worthwhile and then I

609
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,120
wanted to play you this one's to 2

610
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:34,159
minutes 22 seconds uh one of our climate

611
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:36,038
change fellows Maria too just made a

612
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,320
video of herself it's kind of pieces of

613
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:38,759
different lectures and she covers a lot

614
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:42,398
of the points that I think are important

615
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,398
so I wanted to show that one

616
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:52,038
also so this is a difficult topic the

617
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:54,200
topic of climate change and maybe more

618
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:56,200
specifically global warming but it's

619
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,919
also a difficult topic because if you

620
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:04,480
think about it there's no place to go to

621
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:08,000
work on not the science to work on you

622
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,640
know these human questions of how can I

623
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,079
relate to this every Workshop that I do

624
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,960
is is tailored for the group that I'm

625
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:17,199
presenting to but I want us to work

626
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,120
together to expand our concept of what

627
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,080
it means to be a climate change activist

628
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:25,158
traditional presentations I would now

629
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:28,000
bombard you with you know the worst news

630
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:29,840
imaginable and you would think oh my God

631
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,558
I wish I hadn't come here this morning

632
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:35,079
how much weight do do the people you're

633
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:37,158
trying to reach give to what scientists

634
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:39,398
have to say what role does that play in

635
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:41,600
their life I think we often operate

636
00:25:39,398 --> 00:25:43,519
under the assumption that everybody's

637
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:45,759
ready to hear through the scientific

638
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:48,960
Channel maybe there's a part of you that

639
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:51,720
wants to just kind of reach in and do

640
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,640
something and do something on you know

641
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,278
the a scale appropriate to the size of

642
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,200
the problem business as usual is built

643
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:02,599
into the the very way we perceive the

644
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,360
world around us our social workspaces

645
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:07,079
show us the world as a place where we

646
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:10,199
should preserve and maintain our

647
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:11,079
personal status quo if we can change our

648
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,640
social

649
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:15,798
workspaces we can change our perception

650
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,520
of reality and when we change our

651
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:21,278
perception of reality our actions will

652
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:23,398
change we need urgently to let go of the

653
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:26,599
idea that it's the stressed

654
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:28,719
overscheduled individual in each of us

655
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:31,038
who needs to wake up single-handedly

656
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,640
activate her moral conscience step up

657
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:35,398
and take action instead we need to look

658
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,880
at the social workspaces we're already

659
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:39,678
sharing with others and ask what kind of

660
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,720
potential is there here for transforming

661
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:45,880
them what would it take for you to join

662
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,360
a non-violent resistance movement on

663
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,278
climate change there is no easy solution

664
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:51,639
but there is something we can do and I

665
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:54,720
want to argue that that's something we

666
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,960
can do is join the movement help create

667
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,640
a powerful Grassroots movement that

668
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,399
moves the

669
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:04,320
needle okay so those are just two of our

670
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:05,798
fellows Jason Davis and Maria too and

671
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,879
each one as I mentioned is doing a

672
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:09,079
different project and um if you're

673
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,159
interested in more I could share with

674
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:12,359
you some of the other projects that

675
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,360
they're

676
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:18,359
doing there we go so so to conclude this

677
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,640
is the second project is you know the

678
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:22,319
question is what is the impact of each

679
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,000
of these individual projects and is

680
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,119
there a way really we can make a larger

681
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,759
project through the group of fellows

682
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:30,158
along with our um staff on the E

683
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:32,879
capacity projects and we have lots of

684
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,278
other collaborators across the

685
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,278
country I found that those both those

686
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,880
both the video and the and the audio

687
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:41,839
were very impactful but whether it makes

688
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,519
an impact at sort of a larger level I

689
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:45,480
think is a

690
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,278
question okay so now I'm going to go to

691
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,519
the third and the final project and that

692
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:52,200
is that we convened a panel of national

693
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:54,599
experts and we asked them to address the

694
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,880
question is Environmental Education that

695
00:27:54,599 --> 00:28:00,719
focuses on small individual action

696
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:04,278
appropriate given the scale of climate

697
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,798
change so here are our experts we had

698
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:09,240
John KY who's a freelance environmental

699
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:10,558
journalist John Fraser who's an

700
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,839
environmental Ed and science Ed

701
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,440
researcher in New York City well he

702
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:16,918
works nationally Carrie Fulton who's

703
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,798
with the environmental justice climate

704
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:22,038
change initiative in Washington DC and

705
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,319
Caroline Lewis who I think a number of

706
00:28:22,038 --> 00:28:25,158
you know I don't know if anybody knows

707
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:28,038
her besides Don but she work used to

708
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:30,080
work at Fairchild botanic garden and and

709
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:31,640
um now in Miami and now she started her

710
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:33,960
own organization climate leadership

711
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,960
engagement opportunities or Cleo again

712
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,519
operating in Miami which is Ground Zero

713
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,399
as you probably know of climate change

714
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:42,880
and of sort of the mix of very

715
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,599
conservative uh politics and people who

716
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:49,480
are addressing Climate Change Daily and

717
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:51,359
in fact the mayor of um South Miami um

718
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,599
aunds because Miami has all these little

719
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:54,918
cities that are sort of part of the

720
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:56,759
larger Metropolitan he's trying there's

721
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:58,038
a movement down there for them to seced

722
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:01,119
from the state of

723
00:28:58,038 --> 00:29:03,158
Florida because the people in Northern

724
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,719
Florida don't believe in climate change

725
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:06,840
but they see it in their everyday lives

726
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,038
with all the flooding and and I mean my

727
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:09,959
daughter lives there so I know on her

728
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:12,319
way to work she's often walking through

729
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,319
water and then Billy Spitzer from the

730
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:16,639
New England

731
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,960
Aquarium and there's I think there's

732
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,320
five themes that came out of this

733
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,840
workshop and I should mention there were

734
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:22,240
about 90 people from New York City

735
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:23,599
environmental Educators and related

736
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,278
professionals so this came out of the

737
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:28,359
discussions amongst the experts and with

738
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:31,359
the people who participate

739
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:33,000
and the first is about emotion and that

740
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,678
Environmental Education should really be

741
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,278
considering how we help people cope with

742
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,880
emotions and these emotions can be the

743
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:40,679
sort of feelings of vulnerability and

744
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,480
climate change denial that I discussed

745
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:44,798
earlier when I mentioned CL uh Terror

746
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,360
management Theory but they can also be

747
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:50,440
these feelings of sadness and loss I

748
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:53,558
think as the minister in that video in

749
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,960
the audio talked about and it's really

750
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:57,359
hard when you think about you know are

751
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,600
you just telling say young people about

752
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,839
the signs of climate change and what's

753
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:02,918
going to happen and then you have to

754
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:05,480
sort of what do you do about how they

755
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:05,480
react to

756
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:11,120
this so the second is environmental

757
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:13,038
justice and I find this one really

758
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:14,959
interesting not only because it's sort

759
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:16,119
of about a movement and that there's

760
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,319
already an environmental justice

761
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:20,518
movement and that we can join forces

762
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:23,079
with them and then maybe have a larger

763
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:24,720
impact but it's also really interesting

764
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:27,519
because I think the civil rights

765
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,120
movement has something has possibly some

766
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:33,000
lessons for us in dealing with climate

767
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:35,000
change so um you know I mean you can

768
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,558
imagine what a sort of overwhelming

769
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,599
problem civil rights or racial

770
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:42,798
inequities were to people in the 60s and

771
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:44,158
50s and yet there was a really well

772
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:45,599
organized sort of starting at the

773
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,399
Grassroots movements that made

774
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:50,719
incredible changes in our society so

775
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:53,119
there may be things we can learn about

776
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,600
how they organized and how they

777
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:58,638
worked okay third is collective action

778
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:00,558
and this is the idea that we need to

779
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:02,119
think about not just these individual

780
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:04,398
Behavior changes that we've thought

781
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:08,079
about in the past like you know changing

782
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:09,719
our water use at the home level but also

783
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:11,879
more collectively how we can make a

784
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:15,240
change and Maria too really spoke about

785
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,600
that in the video I think that if we're

786
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,638
going to do think about Collective

787
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:20,480
action one of the things we might do is

788
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:23,638
think about what the research is largely

789
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,159
coming out of Sociology that talks about

790
00:31:23,638 --> 00:31:27,398
what are the elements that are usually

791
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:29,559
present before Collective action occurs

792
00:31:27,398 --> 00:31:31,879
and one of them is social capital or

793
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:33,519
trust and connections between people as

794
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,000
well as social norms so instead of sort

795
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,359
of starting an environmental Ed program

796
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,038
with what is you know climate change and

797
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:41,398
global warming you might start a program

798
00:31:40,038 --> 00:31:43,558
with thinking about well how do we

799
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:45,599
create some social connections and Trust

800
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:49,079
amongst the people and how do we create

801
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:50,480
strong social norms and then the theory

802
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:52,558
would predict that people have more

803
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,759
capacity to act collectively to address

804
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:54,759
these

805
00:31:55,798 --> 00:31:59,960
issues um

806
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,559
advocacy education and this one is

807
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,159
really the most controversial so it's

808
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:05,158
not just controversial for science

809
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:07,159
Educators it's also really controversial

810
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:09,480
for environmental Educators and part

811
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:11,399
because the field has been criticized

812
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,839
extensively for being Advocates and

813
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:15,319
being you know leftwing socialist

814
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:19,319
Communists whatever and so the reaction

815
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:21,240
has been to really uh Retreat from any

816
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:22,480
of this normative stuff and just say

817
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,558
well we're going to teach the facts and

818
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,798
then we're going to help people to make

819
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:27,599
their own

820
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:29,440
decisions and yet I think given the

821
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,918
scale again of the problem I think we

822
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,240
should reconsider this and and again I

823
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,360
think we can look back at the Civil

824
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,240
Rights Movement so think about us as a

825
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:41,079
landr institution and think about the

826
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,759
50s or 60s and you know we would think

827
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:45,319
well our role is to do and it's too bad

828
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:47,398
um Scott Peters isn't here because he

829
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:51,119
would have a lot to say about this but

830
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:52,719
um our role is just to is to sort of uh

831
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:55,319
you know transfer what's known about

832
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,159
race or something like that based on the

833
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:59,599
science and if you look back on it now

834
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,880
we might say that would have been quite

835
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:06,359
irresponsible or even immoral so is

836
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,360
there a parallel here with climate

837
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,320
change and then the last is climate

838
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,319
change is The New Normal I talked about

839
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:18,599
that earlier explicitly acknowledging

840
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,398
that the Earth has changed and we can't

841
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:22,079
really conserve our natural heritage at

842
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,638
least in many cases as we might have

843
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:27,319
tried to do

844
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:28,759
before so I said I'd present three

845
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:30,480
different projects but I'm going to do a

846
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:32,519
little bit more in depth on this last

847
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,558
project in particular I want to talk

848
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:35,880
about adaptation in relation to climate

849
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:38,839
change as The New

850
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:41,240
Normal so climate change simply means

851
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:44,038
adjustments in ecological social or

852
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:46,079
excuse me climate adaptation means

853
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:50,119
adjustments in ecological social or

854
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:50,119
economic systems in response to climate

855
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:59,199
change and if you look at the ipcc

856
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:01,480
report that just came out this year they

857
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,038
have three different major categories of

858
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:06,038
adaptation options so there's physical

859
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:07,798
structural social which has to do with

860
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:09,599
Equity issues and then institutional

861
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:11,559
which has to do with changing government

862
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,838
agencies or nonprofits or International

863
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:17,398
organizations but within each of those

864
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:18,960
categories they have subcategories that

865
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:20,199
I think and I've just chosen the ones

866
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,398
that I think are most consistent with

867
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:24,519
Environmental

868
00:34:21,398 --> 00:34:26,638
Education so ecosystem based under

869
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:28,800
physical structural Community Based and

870
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,119
educ ation under social and engagement

871
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,119
under

872
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:36,199
institutional by the way this I just

873
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:38,960
picked up last night I think it was on a

874
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:41,598
BBC article and it's about it's Boston

875
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,800
reenvisioning itself as Venice so this

876
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:48,320
is actually or

877
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,320
Amsterdam yeah they mentioned Amsterdam

878
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:53,878
also okay so ecosystem based adaptation

879
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:56,559
is a use of biodiversity and ecosystem

880
00:34:53,878 --> 00:34:59,159
services to help communities and people

881
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:02,039
adapt to climate change and so we can

882
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:03,719
think of again this falls under physical

883
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:06,119
structural so we can think of seaw walls

884
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:08,879
or putting all our you know utilities on

885
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:10,599
the second floor of buildings where

886
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,920
they're on flood zones or high watera

887
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:15,640
zones but we can also think about sort

888
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,119
of plantings oyster reefs oyster

889
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:19,319
restoration there's a huge effort on

890
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,640
oyster Restoration in New York City

891
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,400
Estuary right now as sort of more

892
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:25,799
consistent with the environmental values

893
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,480
of Environmental

894
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,519
Education and community- based

895
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,920
adaptation which are locally driven

896
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:34,320
adaptation strategies that operate on

897
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,920
our learning by doing bottom up and

898
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,079
empowerment Paradigm and here I like to

899
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:42,400
think of Community Gardens as a really

900
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:44,560
good example of a community-based

901
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,320
adaptation and the reason is because I

902
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:48,400
think Comm people in Community Gardens

903
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,440
they they engage in these kinds of

904
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,440
discussions as Megan knows and has

905
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,039
helped them with um and they have to

906
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,318
make a lot of decisions right so they

907
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:59,639
have to decide okay how how do we decide

908
00:35:57,318 --> 00:36:01,039
who gets a plot how do we decide on

909
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:02,838
whether pesticides are allowed and if

910
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:06,039
somebody lets their weeds grow what kind

911
00:36:02,838 --> 00:36:08,279
of sanctions are we going to have and um

912
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:09,920
there's been some work done by um Erica

913
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,839
senson in New York City at that Forest

914
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,079
Service Urban research station looking

915
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:17,119
at how what goes on this decision-

916
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:19,560
making in these little bit little kind

917
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:22,000
of interventions and the empowerment

918
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:23,400
that people get how it scales up so

919
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,119
these are I like to think of these as

920
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,920
kind of training grounds and a lot of

921
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,400
times the people that are in community

922
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,358
are immigrants and they may not have

923
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,760
participated in Civil Society previously

924
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:35,480
and then you know sometimes people that

925
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,599
have been in these Gardens and been

926
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,480
decision-making roles or participated in

927
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,400
these discussions then go on and they

928
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:46,199
become Advocates at a larger scale like

929
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,200
for preserving Green Space in New York

930
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:52,679
City um so I think that there's a lot of

931
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,200
these kinds of Civic ecology practices

932
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:57,159
or Greening practices that we can think

933
00:36:55,199 --> 00:37:00,279
of as combining ecosystem based

934
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:02,078
Community Based and education adaptation

935
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,880
in other words they provide

936
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,720
opportunities for environmental learning

937
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,119
even though they're not not be a formal

938
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:10,039
education program there and these can be

939
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:13,480
things like restoring wetlands and salt

940
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:15,759
marshes to buffer against sea level rise

941
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,240
and installing green infrastructure such

942
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,560
as this uh Green Roof Garden in New York

943
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:23,039
City as well as porous Pavements and

944
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:23,039
Community

945
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,240
Gardens so um getting back to my

946
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:31,199
originally question was superstorm Sandy

947
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:34,318
a Tipping Point for Environmental

948
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:36,118
Education probably not but I do think

949
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:38,920
that there's a lot of new ideas being

950
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:42,880
generated that we can follow up

951
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:44,559
on and so we are seeing changes in E and

952
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,358
some of the major changes I think we're

953
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:50,239
seeing are the use of the terms

954
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:53,039
resilience and people starting to think

955
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:55,598
about ad adaptation these environmental

956
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:59,239
stewardship like the Dune restoration

957
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:02,559
practices um more thinking about

958
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:04,679
Collective action and then reconsidering

959
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,679
the notion of advocacy given the scale

960
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:08,919
of the

961
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:11,559
issues so with that I'd like to thank my

962
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:14,000
colleagues Bryce Dubois Judy Brouse and

963
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:16,000
Ferguson and John Fraser who have helped

964
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,679
me think about some of these issues as

965
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,480
well as my funders but because I talked

966
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:21,960
about advocacy views expressed are not

967
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,519
necessarily those of the funding

968
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:28,519
agencies so thank you so much Mary thank

969
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:28,519
you

970
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:37,879
this has been a production of Cornell
