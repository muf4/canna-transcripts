1
00:00:00,549 --> 00:00:05,310
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:05,309
University

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:13,339
and I'd like to thank balls laying hands

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,750
of visiting scholar program for hosting

5
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:17,300
me here today and of course all the

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:21,948
folks at Cornell who always give me such

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:25,010
a warm welcome when I visit so light is

8
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:27,410
the most important environmental factor

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,570
for photosynthetic organisms and I

10
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,940
thought I understood it I've worked with

11
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,670
plants all of my life I did graduate

12
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:38,079
studies on light acclamation of week and

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:40,640
also light acclamation and photo

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,780
protection in an Antarctic green algae

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,808
so I knew light but it wasn't until 2007

16
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,730
when I joined Helio spectra that was

17
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:52,640
founded by plant physiologist there were

18
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:56,328
the two of us working with LEDs and it

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,908
was then that the light came on and we

20
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:01,338
grew a small engineering team along with

21
00:00:58,908 --> 00:01:03,319
with a couple of plant physiologist and

22
00:01:01,338 --> 00:01:07,298
that's when I started fusing engineering

23
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:07,299
into my plant physiological research

24
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:16,760
so this is a photograph of the different

25
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:20,420
colors of the sky and when I saw this it

26
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,910
prompted me to start experimenting with

27
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:27,439
spectral compositions to see if I could

28
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:30,409
replicate these colors and below is the

29
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,209
panel of photographs I took a styrofoam

30
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:35,118
in the back of a growth cabinet where I

31
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:37,728
did these experiments so it showed one

32
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:40,728
that we can replicate these colors and

33
00:01:37,728 --> 00:01:44,868
two we have a really powerful tool now

34
00:01:40,728 --> 00:01:48,920
to create any kind of spectral condition

35
00:01:44,868 --> 00:01:52,430
that we want I wasn't the first person

36
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,799
to be obsessed with light quality this

37
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:58,130
is a cyano meters that was invented by

38
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,228
de Sousa and he used it in the Swiss

39
00:01:58,129 --> 00:02:03,739
Alps to measure the blueness of the sky

40
00:02:00,228 --> 00:02:07,539
it was also used in 1802 by Alexander

41
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:10,459
von Humboldt when he characterized the

42
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:12,860
South American volcano he did a complete

43
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:16,340
physical and botanical characterization

44
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:19,100
of the Balkan volcano and he was able to

45
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:23,000
classify the color of the sky as he

46
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:26,959
ascended the volcanoes and on the same

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,449
note and light changes and I think when

48
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,930
I saw this figure that was published by

49
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:35,419
new Albright I it was shocking Lew

50
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:37,909
showed that there is a large annual

51
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:41,569
variation in daily light integral on any

52
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:43,759
given day in Ithaca New York and this is

53
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:48,319
an annual variation this is a 14-year

54
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:53,840
study so light is variable the ppfd is

55
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:56,750
variable and on a shorter timescale it

56
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,170
can be seen here that light and ppfd

57
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:02,689
sorry it's watts per square meter on the

58
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:05,149
y-axis there but we also see really

59
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:07,489
short-term fluctuations in the Sun now

60
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:10,900
these studies are usually performed to

61
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:13,670
understand and improve performance

62
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:16,060
estimations for solar energy systems and

63
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:17,988
so they look at these very fast

64
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,060
fluctuations in the Sun to see how

65
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:23,299
they're going to affect the grid so here

66
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,539
we've got seconds on the x-axis and you

67
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:26,239
can

68
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:29,209
see but the if you take the average of

69
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,218
the three hour long fragment it's 450

70
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:34,640
watts per meter squared but we can see

71
00:03:31,218 --> 00:03:37,068
that it jumps from 100 to 700 watts per

72
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:40,068
meter squared in a matte in less than a

73
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:43,128
second so this may not have implications

74
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:46,729
for solar energy systems but plants can

75
00:03:43,128 --> 00:03:48,768
certainly be Texas and and it's made me

76
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:51,229
really interested in dynamic lighting

77
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:55,519
and fluctuating lighting for controlling

78
00:03:51,229 --> 00:04:00,018
a crop growth so at the same time that

79
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:02,090
PFD is is fluctuating the spectrum

80
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:04,938
fluctuates as well throughout the day as

81
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,859
the clouds pass over you get a blue and

82
00:04:04,938 --> 00:04:09,138
rich spectrum under that piece of cloud

83
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:11,719
and then when that moves it comes to a

84
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:14,480
more flat spectrum this is a greenhouse

85
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:17,060
in Sweden that I lived in for three days

86
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,709
with my assistant measuring light and

87
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,439
the physiological state of the plant

88
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:23,598
there basil was getting to the grocery

89
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,728
store Hofstede and they didn't know

90
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:27,709
whether it was happening at the end of

91
00:04:25,728 --> 00:04:30,649
you know the it's life in the greenhouse

92
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:32,750
or during transportation so we monitored

93
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:34,399
light for three days and just examined

94
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,899
the environment did physiological

95
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,029
testing and found out it was a

96
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:41,478
temperature the delivery truck so but

97
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:44,689
during that time I was able to study the

98
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:48,439
spectrum and PFD during the day under

99
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:52,668
shade around our thermo curtains etc and

100
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:54,769
that was a really useful study so plants

101
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:58,370
have evolved for 400 million years under

102
00:04:54,769 --> 00:05:02,060
fluctuating light and and this can be on

103
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:05,990
a long or short-term time scale so why

104
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:09,439
not utilize this in our in large scale

105
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:13,129
growing also why not use the intrinsic

106
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:15,439
properties of LEDs to modulate our crops

107
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:19,908
so how is this done well there are two

108
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:23,149
systems and plants that sense detect

109
00:05:19,908 --> 00:05:25,459
light and then signal to the plant what

110
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:29,089
to do and I'm just going to quickly go

111
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:31,310
through them here so the first one is

112
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:32,369
the photoreceptor system that we're all

113
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:36,709
familiar with

114
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:39,360
and it induces responses ranging from

115
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:41,549
immunity and defense right up to

116
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,020
flowering there are 15 different

117
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:49,710
photoreceptors we've got the you loops I

118
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:53,310
did the button which like but there we

119
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:56,879
go so we've got the UV r8 here which is

120
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:59,490
the UV photoreceptor primarily involved

121
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,219
in defense and photo protection we've

122
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:05,280
got the cryptochromes which absorb from

123
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,470
blue up until the green and they're

124
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,109
involved in biochemistry as well as

125
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:13,710
circadian rhythms primarily the photo

126
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:16,110
tropen our movement there another blue

127
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:19,500
photoreceptor family and the site loop

128
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:22,080
is a timekeeper also absorbing in the

129
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,639
blue we've got the phytochromes which

130
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,399
are just so well known and well

131
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:31,500
characterized and they absorb and are

132
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:33,299
activated across the spectrum a couple

133
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,430
of these are reversible most of them are

134
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,579
reversible but primarily cryptochromes

135
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:41,160
and the phytochromes are reversible

136
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:43,649
using different spectra of light and so

137
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:48,630
they really do provide a molecular

138
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:50,879
switch for us so here we have the same

139
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:53,038
the same diagram we have the

140
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:56,000
photoreceptors here there is no green

141
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,930
photoreceptor elucidated yet but

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,069
phytochrome absorbs and the green as

143
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:04,110
well as cryptochrome so in a way they do

144
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:06,990
function in photo receptions in the

145
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:09,720
system so we've got the photoreceptors

146
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:12,240
we've got the action so these are the

147
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,700
peaks maximum for the action spectra for

148
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,668
the various photoreceptors and you can

149
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:20,728
see that it goes down from 280

150
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:24,750
nanometers which is the UVB so area

151
00:07:20,728 --> 00:07:27,959
right up to 733 nanometers for the far

152
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:32,399
red spectrum except right here there's a

153
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:34,978
gap from about 600 to 660 nanometers

154
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,259
which is kind of interesting but I came

155
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:39,899
across a paper describing the option

156
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,719
spectrum of PS to a photosystem ii photo

157
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:42,729
damage

158
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,770
and it occurred right in this area so

159
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,870
maybe that has something to do with this

160
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:48,939
I'm not sure

161
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:50,949
looking at the activation time so I work

162
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:53,290
in engineering so we're always looking

163
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:56,500
at rate constants and timing and trying

164
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:58,990
to do things as fast as possible and so

165
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,759
they work relatively quickly when you

166
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,379
see the next sensing system you'll see

167
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:08,769
that this might be even be a little

168
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:11,759
sluggish so this brings us to the

169
00:08:08,769 --> 00:08:14,079
photosynthetic sensing system or

170
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,230
photosynthetic control as we know it and

171
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:19,359
when I did my PhD in masters I worked in

172
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,420
the lab where we looked at this in

173
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,379
various organisms from cyanobacteria

174
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:27,250
right up to poplar and and looking at

175
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,740
photosynthetic control of these

176
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:32,740
organisms so what does it elicit it

177
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:35,830
elicits a lot of responses that help

178
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:37,930
sustain photosynthesis in a changing or

179
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:40,090
fluctuating environment so you've got

180
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:43,949
light capture photosynthetic efficiency

181
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:47,110
and co2 assimilation you've also got

182
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:49,200
rapid accumulation of pigments to help

183
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:53,370
protect the photosynthetic machinery and

184
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:56,440
when you grow under conditions where

185
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,450
photosynthetic control is active then

186
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,220
you also have protection and defense and

187
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,990
in long term you can actually adjust the

188
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:05,889
height and other morphological factors

189
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:10,659
so what is this so here is my very

190
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:13,750
simple schematic and photosynthesis we

191
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:15,730
have two photosystems photosystem 2 and

192
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:18,700
photosystem 1 that work

193
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:22,089
electrochemically in series we've got a

194
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:24,070
mobile plasto quinone electron carrier

195
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:26,650
that transports the electrons from

196
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:28,660
photosystem 2 where they're extracted

197
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,730
from water and brings them through a

198
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:35,829
series of carriers to photosystem 1

199
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:39,009
where they reduce an ADP to NADPH at the

200
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:41,950
same time plus the Quinton pool drops

201
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:45,819
off protons into the lumen and that this

202
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:49,830
drives in ATP A's to generate ATP so

203
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:52,720
you've got the two chemical energy

204
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:55,530
components that the plant cell uses

205
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,420
so what is photosynthetic control

206
00:09:55,529 --> 00:10:02,620
anytime you have a situation where you

207
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:05,469
have light energy exceeding chemical

208
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:08,230
energy utilization by the plant you have

209
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:11,710
an upset and that upset triggers

210
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:14,889
hundreds of genes and one and twenty six

211
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:17,019
different pathways that will help

212
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:23,319
protect the machinery against of energy

213
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:25,569
and balance so typically this is done by

214
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,129
subjecting the plant to highlight

215
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:30,580
because then you're increasing the

216
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:32,950
energy input at low temperature it works

217
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,900
as well because you're decreasing the

218
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,570
reaction rates of photosynthesis that

219
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:39,639
you end up with excess energy again and

220
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:42,160
when you have a nutrient deficiency

221
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:44,529
you're limiting the number of electrons

222
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,419
sinks so again you're pushing this

223
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:50,049
energy balance in the chloroplasts out

224
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:55,629
of whack and that is going to signal all

225
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:57,849
of these responses so in during

226
00:10:55,629 --> 00:11:00,000
photosynthetic control you've got the

227
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:02,409
two main signals it's the Delta pH

228
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,679
across we fly the Koide membrane and

229
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:08,740
reaction oxygen species and the redox

230
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,599
state of ferredoxin and thyroid auxins

231
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:16,450
and there's a few others as well that

232
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:18,940
aren't on here so we control the size of

233
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:21,390
balance using the spectrum as well so

234
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:24,280
this is where our LEDs can come in so

235
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:26,939
ps2 we call it p 6a v absorbs

236
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:30,129
preferentially at 680 nanometers and

237
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:33,100
photosystem 1 is p 700 those absorbs

238
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:35,289
preferentially at 700 nanometers now we

239
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:39,909
have something that we call PS 2 light

240
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:45,399
PS 2 light over excites PS 2 compared to

241
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:49,539
ps1 and this is wavelengths below 680

242
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:52,509
nanometer so any red or blue LED fixture

243
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:55,029
used in plant growth is basically giving

244
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:56,889
the plant PS to light how does the plant

245
00:11:55,029 --> 00:12:00,429
deal with this it will adjust the

246
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:03,129
stoichiometry of PS 2 PS one unit so

247
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:05,399
they'll have more PS one relative to PS

248
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:10,139
2 to deal with

249
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:12,899
like you never see it in nature pf1

250
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:15,330
light of course is uh when you go up to

251
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,129
to the far read and if you have a good

252
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,780
balance you should have a good straight

253
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:20,909
qiyamah tree of your photosystems and

254
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:27,839
smooth sailing the electrons right

255
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:29,969
through to carbon metabolism this is the

256
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,670
same diagram but just depict it a little

257
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:35,580
differently and again I've got the time

258
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:39,569
constants of these reactions I listed so

259
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:41,790
we have light harvesting and charge

260
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:44,850
separation which is when the electron in

261
00:12:41,789 --> 00:12:46,259
photosystem 2 goes from water to the QB

262
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,870
binding site we call that charge

263
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:53,600
separation this occurs long sento and

264
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:57,120
pìkô second level electron transport

265
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,190
occurs on milliseconds to second time

266
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,279
scale and you've got carbon metabolism

267
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:04,650
just primarily minutes to occur so you

268
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:07,379
have orders of magnitude difference in

269
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:12,389
the rate constants for photosynthesis

270
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:14,879
and we can certainly drive LEDs at the

271
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:16,740
millisecond and second timescales you

272
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,139
should see erratically be able to drive

273
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:23,399
them at nanosecond time scales but I've

274
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:26,730
never seen that yet in a practical way

275
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,980
so we can utilize LEDs for that so how

276
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:32,250
do we do that with pulse width

277
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:36,300
modulation which is a really popular way

278
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:41,070
to give a LEDs here we've got the duty

279
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:43,319
cycles for LEDs so the duty cycle is the

280
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:46,080
percentage of time the light is on so at

281
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:49,740
100% the light is on there's no off

282
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:53,389
period at 80% you've got the lights on

283
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:56,250
it's 80% of the time during the period

284
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:58,129
50% twenty and then zero percent duty

285
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,909
cycle of course the lights are all off

286
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:03,889
hopefully although this can be a

287
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:07,139
challenge sometimes for lighting fixture

288
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:11,789
developers and here we've just got sort

289
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:15,449
of a pictogram describing this so we can

290
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:18,059
utilize this to help sort of unbalanced

291
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:20,450
the chloroplast to achieve these

292
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:23,309
responses that might be beneficial

293
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,840
warburg or we can do the opposite is

294
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:26,819
drive it so that we've got efficient

295
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:30,420
photosynthesis under other circumstances

296
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:32,460
that might throw the balance off Warburg

297
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:34,559
found that forty milliseconds of dark

298
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:36,480
was adequate to oxidize the whole

299
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:39,899
photosynthetic electron transport chain

300
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,879
so to keep photosynthesis continuing you

301
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:44,069
need give it forty milliseconds to

302
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:46,409
darken in a period and you'll get all

303
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:49,740
those electrons moving along to carbon

304
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:54,329
metabolism and the reaction sensors open

305
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:58,379
and able to accept a photon tennyson

306
00:14:54,330 --> 00:15:01,889
later on using a 680 nanometer LED found

307
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:05,159
that 198 milliseconds is dark in the

308
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:08,220
period was too much it decreased the

309
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:10,110
rates of photosynthesis and and so we

310
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,019
need to find the balance and we need to

311
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:15,960
understand the effects of pulse width

312
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:18,750
modulation on for the chemistry and

313
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,790
photosynthesis when you're looking at

314
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,590
different fixtures and you call the

315
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:24,449
companies and I do this all the time I

316
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:26,850
ask are you doing using pulse width

317
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:29,700
modulation and it's very popular to do

318
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:32,009
that in human centric lighting but we're

319
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,860
easy to trick plants aren't they see a

320
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:36,870
lot more than we do quite often they

321
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:40,460
don't know it's something that they

322
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:42,990
don't think about so our question is

323
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:48,470
photosynthetic controls rapid can we use

324
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:51,149
PWM to to adjust this and play with this

325
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:55,019
one last thing before I move away from

326
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:57,470
LEDs is the phase of pulse width

327
00:15:55,019 --> 00:16:00,840
modulation this is a great study

328
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:04,190
published by schemata at all where they

329
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:09,180
use red and blue LEDs so here we have

330
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:11,820
100 percent duty cycle the R and B LEDs

331
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:15,149
are running full-time here we've got a

332
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:17,850
forty five percent duty cycle where the

333
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:23,159
red and blue LED are going on and off in

334
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:25,830
phase here we have the red and blue LEDs

335
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:28,179
again a forty five percent duty cycle

336
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:30,100
but they're going off and on

337
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:31,989
different phases and let me tell you

338
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:35,379
I've just designed a six wavelength

339
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:38,289
fixture so and got the engineers to make

340
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:41,379
it so all of the LEDs when we pulse with

341
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:43,360
modulated will come on and off in phase

342
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:45,789
so that we don't have to do this because

343
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,970
we look at these around adopts as plants

344
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:50,799
you've got most growth for better growth

345
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:53,470
better performance that looks like in

346
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:55,689
your plants grown under the forty five

347
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:58,240
percent duty cycle when they are in

348
00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:06,939
phase so that throws a bit of a wrench

349
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:08,620
into the works for light designers you

350
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:12,189
have to go to the papers and engineering

351
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:15,958
paper probably not they probably did but

352
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:15,959
but no quantitative data

353
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:26,318
yeah yeah I'd have to actually read

354
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:31,808
through and and see their their methods

355
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:36,519
and statistics again so to hundreds of

356
00:17:31,808 --> 00:17:40,359
experiments of light quality and plants

357
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:43,480
and Porter pointed out in his 2010 paper

358
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:47,289
that none of these experiments have been

359
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:51,190
set up in such a way that we can

360
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:53,349
actually quantify and compare the

361
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,820
analyses they're different wavelengths

362
00:17:53,349 --> 00:17:58,079
different peak Maxima different

363
00:17:54,819 --> 00:18:00,399
temperatures nutrients is no way we can

364
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:03,460
generalize and and sort of make a

365
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,259
unified theory for LEDs and plant growth

366
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,808
so I'm going to show a bit of the data

367
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:09,429
that we've generated in the lab over the

368
00:18:07,808 --> 00:18:12,428
last couple of years and I just want to

369
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:15,280
bring home three main findings that I

370
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:17,170
think are really interesting so looking

371
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,210
at the the different fixtures that we

372
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:22,029
grew under and we do all of our work

373
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:24,640
under sole source lighting at RPI we've

374
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:26,920
got PFD here along the y-axis and of

375
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,710
course wavelengths here we've got the

376
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:32,050
cool white fluorescent pay attention to

377
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:35,279
this you think about it a bit later

378
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:38,339
which is a nice you know standard

379
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:42,149
spectrum that we were all used to

380
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:45,480
Illuma Tex is this red line here so

381
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:47,070
there's a peak at 660 tiny little bit of

382
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,960
white you can't see it here but I can

383
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:52,500
measure it with my with my spectrometer

384
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:56,009
a little bit of green and and then the

385
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:59,789
red or the blue peak here at about 450

386
00:18:56,009 --> 00:19:04,099
nanometers the Phillips is 660

387
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:09,289
nanometers red 470 nanometers in blue

388
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:12,619
the velour is a phosphor converted led a

389
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:16,710
that means that it's a blue LED

390
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:20,069
typically with a phosphor spread on the

391
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:21,990
lens to broaden the spectrum they're

392
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:23,609
using blue but they're using UV now as

393
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,250
well for some of these false or

394
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:29,189
conservative LEDs and so here you've got

395
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:32,430
a peak at about 4:40 and this broad

396
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:34,890
shoulder over the green and red into the

397
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:39,570
far red for those of you that aren't

398
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:43,410
familiar with the with the spectrum this

399
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:47,119
is blue from 400 to 500 green red and

400
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:50,460
far red so the last one is Fiona the

401
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:56,729
Danish lamp and we've got a peak here at

402
00:19:50,460 --> 00:20:00,870
660 and a peak here at 434 nanometers so

403
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:03,390
we grew under all of these spectra are

404
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:06,719
our model organism in the lab is lettuce

405
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:09,330
and this is red lettuce roots I grown

406
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:13,350
under cool light fluorescent Phillips

407
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:15,779
Fiona and Valera and I'd like to just

408
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:19,529
focus on these two either two red and

409
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:23,250
blue LEDs they look identical to the

410
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:25,589
naked eye but there's a thirty-six

411
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:27,960
nanometer difference in the peak maximum

412
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:30,000
of the blue LED and look at the

413
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:34,019
difference in the plant they're

414
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,579
significantly smaller and what we'll see

415
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:41,819
some results in in the net

416
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:44,788
st. ppfd of 200 micromoles same

417
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:49,548
temperatures a nutrient solution same

418
00:20:44,788 --> 00:20:49,548
co2 same relative humidity

419
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:05,849
yeah this is done at RPI actually but in

420
00:21:00,788 --> 00:21:05,849
Sweden you can mimic with anything

421
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:14,380
yeah actually and I have some some data

422
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,150
at the end of this talk which I wasn't

423
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,490
going to present where I did spectral

424
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,798
analyses on an island in the North

425
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:23,470
Atlantic off Gothenburg just north of

426
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:25,690
Gothenburg and yeah it was very blue in

427
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,548
the morning and then it evened out

428
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,620
during the day and in the evening again

429
00:21:27,548 --> 00:21:31,750
there was also a blue light present so

430
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:35,859
yeah probably from the scattering and

431
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:40,720
it's always cloudy there Oh probably a

432
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:44,229
lot of blue light enrichment went off so

433
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:47,589
just to look at the fresh wait for green

434
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:50,798
lettuce red lettuce basil and the height

435
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:52,119
on basil between these two red and blue

436
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,460
fixtures you can see that they're

437
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:56,379
significantly different so what is the

438
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:59,048
grower to do how are they going to

439
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:02,140
choose even the blue and red fixtures

440
00:21:59,048 --> 00:22:08,048
when it can have such a huge effect on

441
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:09,700
your crop I was thinking that the Fiona

442
00:22:08,048 --> 00:22:11,500
would be really good because I had a

443
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,340
lower blue and I thought all that will

444
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:17,558
activate a lot of the biochemistry and

445
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:20,558
you know and sort of thickness of the

446
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:22,538
leaf but it it was actually not a good

447
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,940
the plants were significantly smaller

448
00:22:22,538 --> 00:22:28,450
and we withdrew it from our trials after

449
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:30,880
two or three goes and we replaced it

450
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:32,590
with a new Lumet X fixture which I

451
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,960
showed you it's essentially blue and red

452
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:37,298
has a tiny bit of white which gives a

453
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,620
little bit of green to the spectrum so

454
00:22:37,298 --> 00:22:43,869
here we have red LED of rooks I again

455
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:46,359
the LED treatment there was no

456
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:48,579
significant difference in the fresh

457
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:51,278
weight however the cool white

458
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:55,288
fluorescent did have sufficiently lower

459
00:22:51,278 --> 00:22:58,210
fresh rates at day 16 the anthocyanin

460
00:22:55,288 --> 00:23:00,038
was highest that we always see under the

461
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,558
cool white fluorescent so we're now

462
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:04,509
delineating which one of those Peaks are

463
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,849
actually responsible so we've gone

464
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:07,960
through the green it does get a bit but

465
00:23:06,849 --> 00:23:08,889
I think it's actually going to be a

466
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,900
combination

467
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:13,690
couple Peaks in that spectrum such as

468
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:17,110
responsible scissors so we have high

469
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:20,500
anthocyanins here the red pigment and we

470
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:23,859
have extremely low biochemistry

471
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,210
occurring in the in the Ender's of a

472
00:23:23,859 --> 00:23:27,429
lawyer fixers and we've measured

473
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:32,220
carotenoids chlorophylls and

474
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:36,670
anthocyanins and we see the same in all

475
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:39,490
so looking at the I see as a silent we

476
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:41,740
tried different cultivars so we have

477
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:45,269
groups I here we've got an to finding

478
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:48,549
concentrations there red salad bowl

479
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:51,190
outrageous regice and red tails and we

480
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:53,289
can see in more cases than not under the

481
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:59,230
foster congruent spectrum you have lower

482
00:23:53,289 --> 00:24:02,619
anthocyanin concentration so we threw an

483
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:05,410
even more cultivars and here we have our

484
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:08,139
standard roots I and we have the fella

485
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:10,750
Nova red butter and red oak leaf under

486
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:12,340
I'm calling the Illuma text here regimen

487
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:14,259
white because usually when I speak at

488
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:16,329
conferences in the engineering world I

489
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:18,640
don't like to give the trade the name

490
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:21,730
away of the fixture we've got the velour

491
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,770
foster converted cool white fluorescent

492
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:25,870
and we've got the Philips red and blue

493
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:28,720
look at the difference in the morphology

494
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:31,000
the leaf size when you touch these

495
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:36,250
plants you can feel the difference the

496
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,650
read better under the limit X very hairy

497
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:41,619
and the Culinary Institute would say

498
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:44,980
how's bad mouthfeel it's not very

499
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:47,169
pleasant to eat but that changes

500
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,640
depending on the spectrum look at this

501
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:50,529
under the cool whites where as the

502
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,810
plants can't even stand up and this is

503
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:54,250
repeated this we've repeated this now

504
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:57,940
about six or seven times and we're

505
00:24:54,250 --> 00:25:00,220
seeing the same results every time so

506
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,620
one common thread because we can't

507
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:04,539
there's no commonality here but one

508
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:08,319
common thread is that under these foster

509
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:13,299
converted fixtures there are poor and

510
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:15,250
Santa fine and concentration so this led

511
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:17,889
to the question of is it something

512
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:20,819
specific in the phosphor conversion of

513
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:26,190
LEDs that is responsible for this

514
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:28,409
and I met router Sauer at the several

515
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:30,630
actually engineering conferences and he

516
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:32,610
is an engineer that works for Ludmila's

517
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,620
and I discussed this problem with them

518
00:25:32,609 --> 00:25:37,529
but one of the problems with that I

519
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:39,959
could never really see if it was the

520
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:41,490
foster conversion because the other LEDs

521
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,769
that I'm comparing to you have different

522
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:46,529
special ratios so it might be the

523
00:25:43,769 --> 00:25:49,139
spectral ratio and not the phosphor so

524
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:51,809
we SPECT out some and these are just

525
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,340
photos of different foster's that rotate

526
00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:55,200
I took at a trade booth at this

527
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:59,069
conference they're using up to five

528
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,440
different fosters4 one LED to actually

529
00:25:59,069 --> 00:26:06,029
get a you know different spectral

530
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,890
distribution it's quite fantastic so

531
00:26:06,029 --> 00:26:12,509
while you're in i SPECT out some

532
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:15,960
fixtures that has roughly 20% blue 20%

533
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:18,960
green and 60% red we find that's a

534
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:22,049
really nice spectral ratio to grow under

535
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,579
and so we achieve that so we have line

536
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:27,000
these are my growth cabinets here we've

537
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:29,789
got what we call the lime LED the greens

538
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,920
the purple of course is no green to the

539
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:34,649
Loya and then we have direct emissions

540
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:37,170
LEDs that we built ourselves and at this

541
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:41,190
point we're just running them on an RGB

542
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:43,860
red green blue program so our our

543
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:45,299
numbers are pretty good closest we could

544
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:47,639
get them and here we have the spectral

545
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:50,730
distribution so we've got photon flux

546
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:54,690
density and wavelength here and we've

547
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:59,849
got our RBG so we've got the red at 660

548
00:26:54,690 --> 00:27:05,820
green at 5:30 and blue at 450 we've got

549
00:26:59,849 --> 00:27:09,869
the greens and the lines LEDs which are

550
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:11,970
these lines here so I'll fight be

551
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:15,269
different we've got the Valera which is

552
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,740
this big one and I'm not fitting the

553
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:18,869
purple of course there's no green so

554
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,630
where are we seeing differences so

555
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:23,639
rather than finding commonalities but in

556
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:26,550
the plants I'm looking for commonality

557
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,810
in the spectra so what is it about this

558
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:33,069
spectrum that is

559
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:34,539
and so we see the velour has very little

560
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:38,369
green competin you're going to see why

561
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:41,619
this is important can compare to the

562
00:27:38,369 --> 00:27:44,109
line in the green it's cause this big

563
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:47,469
area here right where the action

564
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:49,089
spectrum for photo damages but then you

565
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:52,000
think it would make amplifying and to

566
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:54,399
protect itself it's not and then it's

567
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,349
got a little bit of a difference here in

568
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,180
far-red I didn't take that into account

569
00:27:56,349 --> 00:28:00,939
and I suspect the light that was my

570
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:04,660
mistake because because there's quite a

571
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:07,799
difference there between far-red between

572
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:10,269
the fixtures so let's look at some data

573
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:12,430
so this is that essentially foster

574
00:28:10,269 --> 00:28:17,559
converted versus direct emission LEDs

575
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:18,430
and the yield is greater for the lime in

576
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:22,089
green and aloha

577
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:24,960
however the anthocyanin is much lower so

578
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:27,549
we so not all Fosters are created equal

579
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,069
so spectrum marriage matters I'm

580
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:32,950
assigning this most spectrally sensitive

581
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:37,029
than yield and not all fosters are

582
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:39,660
created equal which is great so the next

583
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:42,849
work was can we use the spectrum to

584
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:45,970
modulate plant so here is a velour grown

585
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:49,480
plant and a cool light fluorescent plant

586
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:52,690
what happens when we shift a plant from

587
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,880
a non bio chemically active spectrum to

588
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:57,490
biochemistry active one and here's 24

589
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,340
hours we were able to increase the

590
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:04,319
anthocyanin concentration 18 fold and

591
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:04,319
I've got a small movie here

592
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:11,480
24 hours this is a time-lapse of 48

593
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:11,479
hours

594
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:30,170
and again different plants within a

595
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,359
single cultivar no not officially we all

596
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:36,080
have our favorites but I would love to

597
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:42,019
do that absolutely so this is unhook

598
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:43,339
this has grabbed me and yes no

599
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:45,950
unfortunately not

600
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:47,659
I'm in the semiconductor lab so I'm kind

601
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,730
of building it up I've got a

602
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:52,910
spectrophotometer and I've got you know

603
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:59,210
just an that I've got access now to HPLC

604
00:29:52,910 --> 00:30:03,140
but I would love to actually I did the

605
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:05,660
shift experiment back and it's about 24

606
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:08,780
to 48 hours just depends on the life

607
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:10,370
history of the pint of it yeah so we can

608
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:12,470
shift it back and change the more fault

609
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:15,409
and morphology changes as well we can

610
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:17,450
just move it back and forth so it kind

611
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:19,610
of you know why not grow a plant under

612
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:21,170
LEDs that produces large biomass and at

613
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:23,119
the end finish it off so that we can

614
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:25,910
pack it full of nutrients and maybe save

615
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:28,039
energy at the same filling is sort of my

616
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:30,529
series I'm going to have to speed up

617
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:33,139
here to the last bit so one interesting

618
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:34,369
thing I you know I did a lot of worked a

619
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,680
lot in photochemistry I'm really

620
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:39,250
interested in energy in the chloroplast

621
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:42,650
and this is my pulse amplitude modulated

622
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:44,750
parameter that I got out and used during

623
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:46,640
the shift to see what was happening to

624
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:48,559
the plants so we've got effective

625
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,270
quantum yield so the probability that a

626
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:54,440
photon will be used in the photochemical

627
00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:56,960
act and here we have the lower it is the

628
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,750
less efficient to this so here we've got

629
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,400
the plants at time zero there was pretty

630
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:03,529
good at point six four it's reasonable

631
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,750
but when we shifted and this is one

632
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:07,220
minute after the shift we saw an

633
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:10,099
increase in effective quantum yield

634
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:12,230
throughout the 24 hour shift and then we

635
00:31:10,099 --> 00:31:14,089
shifted it back here and it in it

636
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:16,430
decrease and again we were ever able to

637
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:18,139
measure this within one minute and the

638
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:19,970
reason it took me a minute was because I

639
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:22,280
had to jump behind a laser curtain and

640
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:23,960
press start on the computer otherwise I

641
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:27,289
had an assistant at that time we could

642
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,400
have actually done it a bit faster not

643
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:31,649
for the chemical quenching is

644
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,880
the dissipation of absorbs light energy

645
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:34,860
is heat typically through the

646
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,420
xanthophyll cycle indicates up there

647
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:38,879
something wrong with blockage and it has

648
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:41,910
to get rid of that energy during the

649
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,160
before the shift it was relatively it

650
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:46,440
was normal values but high during the

651
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,300
shift it went down shifted it back to

652
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,850
the original spectrum and it goes back

653
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:54,599
up this makes really good sense but it

654
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:58,169
shows how we can detect this and and

655
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:59,789
this is fantastic so I started with a

656
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:02,279
bunch of undergraduates building

657
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:03,899
detectors in the lab so this is my first

658
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:05,639
the first prototype this is the

659
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,559
excitation light this is a photodiode

660
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,870
picking up the chlorophyll fluorescence

661
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:13,200
and you can see how close we're working

662
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:15,928
with to the plant here is my my my very

663
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,110
expensive German pulse amplitude

664
00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:21,630
modulation fluorometer so here we have

665
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:26,219
low temperature for doing abyssion the

666
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:29,309
open circles are measured using the crc

667
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:32,490
student device and the dark circles are

668
00:32:29,308 --> 00:32:35,339
my commercially bought device were right

669
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:39,690
on measuring stress with both detectors

670
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:41,579
excellent but let's move further second

671
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:43,110
round of students came in this is our

672
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:45,869
second prototype we've got the

673
00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:48,389
excitation light here we've got the

674
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:50,279
photo diodes there we're working at 40

675
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:52,350
centimeters from the plant and we're

676
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:54,450
able to detect about a half of a 10 20

677
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:57,029
flat this was pulled from an engineering

678
00:32:54,450 --> 00:33:01,789
students report so you can see that they

679
00:32:57,029 --> 00:33:01,789
had to indicate that this is a plant so

680
00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:08,339
it's a lot of fun it is more than one

681
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:13,679
plant they should have dog bark through

682
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:16,558
that I guess good point so we had a dual

683
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,720
of the Centers here on dark adapting

684
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:20,460
plants just video same measuring the

685
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,339
maximum quantum efficiency of

686
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:25,950
photosystem q we can see during shifting

687
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:28,220
basal from 23 degrees to 5 degrees we

688
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:30,900
get the standard decrease in SE / FM

689
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:34,380
using the Student Center we're seeing

690
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:35,100
again the same thing then I thought okay

691
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,410
this is it

692
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:39,299
I'm sensing all the time because we have

693
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:41,130
these sensors and I've got a group of

694
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:42,369
students coming into the lab to build

695
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:45,520
more the summer hope

696
00:33:42,369 --> 00:33:47,589
we can get some at Cornell as well so

697
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:51,430
here we've got a 16 hour photo period

698
00:33:47,589 --> 00:33:54,250
and this is the signal emanated from the

699
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:56,170
plant at 740 nanometers and this is a

700
00:33:54,250 --> 00:34:00,880
signal that we usually detect with the

701
00:33:56,170 --> 00:34:03,039
Pan 680 nanometers so 640 is a bit more

702
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,650
complicated signal I can talk about it

703
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,779
more to anybody who's interested but for

704
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:11,230
the sake of time I want now one thing we

705
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:13,179
noticed this is oscillation over and

706
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:16,449
over again we've done this about 10 on

707
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:18,970
lettuce and basil about 10 different

708
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:21,579
crops and what we see is this is the

709
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:23,678
chlorophyll fluorescence yield when it's

710
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:25,569
high photosynthesis is down regulated

711
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,610
when it's low photosynthesis is running

712
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:29,800
smoothly so in the morning when the

713
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:31,840
lights come on it's getting all the

714
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:34,360
enzymes ready for carbon assimilation

715
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:37,120
and then it flattens out during the day

716
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:39,490
here about 10 hours into the 16 hour

717
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,378
photo period chlorophyll fluorescence

718
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:43,719
goes well so photosynthesis is being

719
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:45,610
down regulated now what should we do

720
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:47,378
should we turn the lights down and save

721
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:49,960
energy when it's not apparently not

722
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:51,699
using it in photosynthesis or do we use

723
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,878
spectral combinations to try to mitigate

724
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:59,079
this open stomata force it to not have

725
00:34:54,878 --> 00:35:01,389
that afternoon nap so those are two

726
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:04,599
questions that I have but I really like

727
00:35:01,389 --> 00:35:08,710
to work on together and here we have

728
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:10,539
death which is again the students forgot

729
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:12,519
to water plants and actually all of this

730
00:35:10,539 --> 00:35:14,679
data is uploaded to the cloud and I can

731
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:16,360
check it regularly from home and I can

732
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,799
tell exactly when they didn't come in

733
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:21,579
and when they did so they're learning

734
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:23,190
they're learning so with circadian

735
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:25,900
rhythm because we're seeing that here

736
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:27,610
what they do in animal systems as they

737
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,260
say okay put it in the dark continuous

738
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:30,940
dark and see if you see that oscillatory

739
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:33,910
pattern but I can't do that with plants

740
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:35,320
so we put it in continuous light and

741
00:35:33,909 --> 00:35:37,889
here's a 24-hour here we've got another

742
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,240
death by dehydration experiment and

743
00:35:37,889 --> 00:35:44,349
we're seeing the same oscillation this

744
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:46,449
is super exciting and so a one last

745
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:50,319
thing we did this during growth of basil

746
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:52,449
we can see similar oscillatory pattern

747
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,980
happening here and of course an increase

748
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:57,319
in growth slowing fluorescence because

749
00:35:54,980 --> 00:36:00,650
they're filling out the flat and getting

750
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:04,519
a bit taller so whether in a greenhouse

751
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:06,920
or a plant factory light definitely

752
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:09,440
matters and maybe we should be thinking

753
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:12,769
now that we have the ability to turn off

754
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,720
and on a light source at 200 nanoseconds

755
00:36:12,769 --> 00:36:18,170
maybe we should be thinking about how to

756
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:20,779
use that to modulate plants that are

757
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:23,119
used to this so we need more knowledge

758
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:26,390
pets acclimate in a different way we

759
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:30,050
need to understand that and we need to

760
00:36:26,389 --> 00:36:31,819
integrate this into control systems with

761
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:34,580
the potential outcome of saving energy

762
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:39,010
so I couldn't have done this alone my

763
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:41,509
lab is three years old now at RPI and

764
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:43,760
just want to thank all of the support

765
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:45,800
staff Bob Carla check has been really

766
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,140
supportive of this work and of course

767
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,480
all of my undergraduate students that

768
00:36:48,139 --> 00:37:00,039
have contributed to the work devotion

769
00:36:50,480 --> 00:37:00,039
today thank you very much happy faces

770
00:37:10,449 --> 00:37:20,389
ramya I was just I was just a student

771
00:37:16,699 --> 00:37:22,849
enters no presentation the blue line is

772
00:37:20,389 --> 00:37:33,349
we must to photodiodes in it so we've

773
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:36,920
got a 680 filters to 740 top well that's

774
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:46,369
why I'm going to be testing in Asia like

775
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:49,820
it is the Automator as one a little

776
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:54,609
further and bigger for that website so

777
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:54,610
important to speak with in here

778
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:08,449
and of course the appeals of people

779
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:11,260
dependent on the height and the

780
00:38:08,449 --> 00:38:15,139
expectation like reputation identities

781
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:17,420
have to be available and in speaking

782
00:38:15,139 --> 00:38:20,210
average most as barometers were

783
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:23,480
factoring impulses that in the old Texas

784
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:26,150
that they were in default intensity at

785
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:29,599
the bright Sun we could be about 2500

786
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:31,789
like but now we're using actually

787
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,588
imposes a thousand twenty thousand

788
00:38:31,789 --> 00:38:37,789
measurements and you can try to use that

789
00:38:33,588 --> 00:38:40,338
in this kind of tensing he kills one so

790
00:38:37,789 --> 00:38:46,130
we have actually we're not saturating

791
00:38:40,338 --> 00:38:51,699
which is our nation's living have a bus

792
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:51,700
monitor Geneva do you have a question

793
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:59,809
I like I'm here when you did your 24

794
00:38:57,409 --> 00:39:03,248
hour Central Community experiment and

795
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:05,630
video I've kind of been a number of

796
00:39:03,248 --> 00:39:08,629
years and you think of mature plant I

797
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:13,220
would have acted responsibly you know

798
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:16,249
using you can finish plant yes because

799
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:18,498
it yes because of this larger times as

800
00:39:16,248 --> 00:39:21,768
well like any time I have anything going

801
00:39:18,498 --> 00:39:25,248
on like shift things and yeah we can see

802
00:39:21,768 --> 00:39:28,578
it under older plants as well like

803
00:39:25,248 --> 00:39:40,038
everything great 21 to 28 days hon we

804
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:45,318
got you control the other question in

805
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:47,240
government I'm seriously like company BW

806
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:50,449
letting countries we'll talk about like

807
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:52,848
recipes like how we go for our here's a

808
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:53,409
lamp that you can develop a recipe for

809
00:39:52,849 --> 00:40:00,670
you

810
00:39:53,409 --> 00:40:03,129
how to develop the combination there if

811
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:06,190
you have a lens with overheat and like

812
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:08,260
you want 20% of glue or 80 that's kind

813
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:11,320
of the lighter but when you're merging

814
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:13,690
with a pinch eight years developing

815
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:16,720
light dr. paster 7-channel a far better

816
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:22,090
person and it takes a couple here

817
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:25,989
village you be confident that I don't

818
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:29,100
really like calming excess but I'm

819
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:29,099
closer college life

820
00:40:29,909 --> 00:40:34,059
algorithm or algorithm let me see that

821
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,410
that before because we have to be

822
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:38,588
something that just didn't make sense to

823
00:40:35,409 --> 00:40:39,480
be seen at my flowers I very it's harder

824
00:40:38,588 --> 00:40:42,369
than that

825
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:46,659
total press results on approach will

826
00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:50,740
also really only be transferable I

827
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:53,920
posted in broken did he try to use a

828
00:40:50,739 --> 00:41:00,309
green help whether you're in Tucson or

829
00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:02,670
New York or terrible that's right but if

830
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:06,578
there's a lot of artists by complete

831
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:09,550
it's like cold dark light especially not

832
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:12,400
when you've got the lights on but any

833
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:15,130
tweets into your nutrient solution and

834
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,980
your temperature and any considered

835
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:19,750
growing conditions will alter it as well

836
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:22,539
so what I find some it takes it into

837
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:24,849
their souls are pledging area it would

838
00:41:22,539 --> 00:41:31,108
be different if they didn't replicate my

839
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:33,550
groin most emotion versus

840
00:41:31,108 --> 00:41:36,819
you did

841
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:36,820
you can't

842
00:41:37,219 --> 00:41:43,500
sure and when I envision that is like we

843
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:46,199
have measurements we would show that

844
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:49,250
that changes today we do develop some

845
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:54,059
dynamic lighting everybody's numbers

846
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:56,579
kill me so that what we did is that what

847
00:41:54,059 --> 00:41:58,799
I would like to do is actually this

848
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:01,170
absolute vision as we get our technology

849
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,510
of running an automated industry have

850
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:07,530
will be able to record the spectrum and

851
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:09,630
then tap utilize the LED screen second

852
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:12,210
up to the set point that we know is that

853
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:16,250
tables are a problem so that you have

854
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:16,250
stables into the claws of yours

855
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,230
so this is when I have it with no period

856
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:58,980
as you saw in the photos as my life

857
00:42:54,570 --> 00:43:07,110
we're in suppliant their own for the

858
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:17,010
horses go they're brought in my final

859
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:20,700
question this has been a production of

860
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:23,630
Cornell University on the web at cornell

861
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:23,629
