1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,440
the title of my talk today is the malice

4
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:12,320
collection in the US national insurance

5
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:15,798
system here to show you a publication

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:19,100
found a global crop biodiversity trap

7
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:22,039
trust two years ago as you can see that

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,470
in North America very few actually the

9
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:29,169
crop will use and we eat actually came

10
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:29,168
from North America so for longest time

11
00:00:29,498 --> 00:00:35,359
us diploma actually start collecting

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:39,619
germ plasm material from around the

13
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:42,289
globe as early as lay 1700 and then in

14
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:44,269
nineteen eighteen sixty two President

15
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:46,399
Lincoln create a US Bureau of

16
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,469
Agriculture the current day USDA

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,600
and also signed the Morrill land-grant

18
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:52,939
University at which is very important

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:57,079
related to Cornell University and then

20
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:58,399
move forward 30 years in 1898 for major

21
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:00,530
even happened

22
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,989
internal plant exploration activity

23
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,420
first is the office of a seat and the

24
00:01:02,988 --> 00:01:09,049
plant introduction the current plan

25
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:12,769
exchange office was established by by

26
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:15,439
Fairchild and swing go at that time then

27
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:17,929
the year the introduction garden for the

28
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,750
tropical plan was established in Miami

29
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:23,660
Florida that's the first repository in

30
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:26,299
this system and then also at that year

31
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:29,119
new Henson was hire as a first plan

32
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:31,939
Explorer and he also introduced the

33
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,689
first plant material pi0 zero zero zero

34
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:36,409
one

35
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:40,579
Branka Brassica OAC from russia at that

36
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:42,469
year also introduced by Handsome the

37
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:45,170
plain introductions later station later

38
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:48,409
was a established at chico california in

39
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:50,420
1904 and also in savannah georgia and at

here's a picture showing some of the

47
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:14,060

48
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:16,848
activity de pierre cha in the Walters

49
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,150

throughout the US that either a

79
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,870
laboratory or repository dedicated the

80
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:51,180
national plan germplasm system including

81
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:53,550
right here in Geneva New York at Geneva

82
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,590
New York there's actually two Research

83
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:59,189
Unit the first is the plant genetic

84
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:01,620
resources unit the PGR you die in Kuni

85
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:03,719
the sea crab or the wretched world germ

86
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,270
pausing collection my colleagues on the

87
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:09,359
bay talk about the collection last

88
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:11,700
october also here in the horticultural

89
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,190
stamina and then we have the kono crab

90
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:16,709
which is the apple co hardy grape and

91
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:18,750
tart cherry and also we have a program

92
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,569
on the Appaloosa breeding program led by

93
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,430
dr. Gennaro Fazio and then we have

94
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:25,529
another research unit is the grape

95
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:29,870
genetic research unit Gigi are you there

96
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:32,549
working on a genetics and genome of wait

97
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:38,310
here's just showing you some of the

98
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:40,710
photo from 1903 skip one for the kono

99
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:43,560
repository you started actually back in

100
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:45,680
1974 a discussion at the a citrus

101

talking about the need for a fruit and

103
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:57,149
nut crop repository system and then

104
00:04:52,610 --> 00:05:01,080
further discussion in 1908 late 1970 and

105
00:04:57,149 --> 00:05:04,319
then bill Cermak who was a supervisor

106
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:06,930
from operation was higher on board in

107
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:11,009
1983 it was actually still working on

108
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:13,560
Geneva and then in 1984 my predecessor

109
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:17,849
phil force line the first curator for

110
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:22,319
the collection came on bore and planting

111
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:24,990
of the grape and also apple collection

112
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:28,168
actually beginning 1983 and the first

113
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:30,120
planting was in 1986 the tart cherry

114
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:33,120
collection original was housed at the

115
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,000
davis repository in california it was

116
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,629
moved to Geneva in 1995 due to better

117
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,910
growing environment here to show you

118
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:44,699
some of the photo the view of the

119
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:48,630
collection in the mccarthy farms house

120
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:49,408
just a nursery just started in 1985 few

121

of the apple collection we have over

127
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:09,289
there in Geneva New York for the

128
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:10,439
establishment of the mouth collection in

129
00:06:09,288 --> 00:06:13,709
mid-1980

130
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:15,989
actually started by donation of a lot of

131
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:19,139
Apple material from different program

132
00:06:15,988 --> 00:06:20,938
and while the most important Apple

133
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:24,718
breeding program of Cornell University

134
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:27,269
actually led by dr. Roger Roger way at

135
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:29,668
that time here's a photo showing some

136
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:32,459
other older professor at that time in

137
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:35,538
the Horticulture Department over there I

138
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:39,028
believe this is dr. Roger way there and

139
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:41,459
also material from the Purdue rocker

140
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:44,098
Serena no Apple breeding program the PRI

141
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:45,988
Apple breeding program also a lot of

142
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:49,139
material from Washington State

143
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:51,928

a photo of the PRI breeding program

152
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:16,999
that's dr. Julius jenkin Purdue

153
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:21,539
University and he is still very active

154
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:23,909
Society horticultural science here like

155
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:26,699
to show you the distribution of all the

156
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:28,588
water model species or worldwide as you

157
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:30,899
can see majority of the wild mouse

158
00:07:28,588 --> 00:07:36,028
materials actually locally in Asia

159
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:38,939
especially in China it is well belief

160
00:07:36,028 --> 00:07:42,329
that models actually origin from

161
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:44,218
Southwest China then you moved north to

162
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:47,699
central and northern part of the China

163
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:50,509
and then continued moving on to the west

164
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:53,579
follow the Silk Road through history

165
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:55,588
eventually reach Central Asia while

166
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:57,718
species opposite over there at melosa

167
00:07:55,588 --> 00:08:00,149
Vesey and then eventually reach your

168
00:07:57,718 --> 00:08:03,240
Europe for example malice or intolerance

169
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:07,228
foreign tina and also malice of estrus

170
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,810
European crabapple in North America is

171
00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:12,089
actually for Mallos while species

172
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:15,629
material on the East Coast into Canada

173
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:17,939
we have malice corneria most insist in

174
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:20,189
the Midwest and also Mollison just 40 at

175
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:23,569
the southern crabapple and then in the

176
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:26,279
Pacific Northwest we have malice Ruska

177
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:29,939
on the modern-day Apple malice the my

178
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:32,908
cicada is actually a hybrid species he

179
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:35,788
has most of the material deploy with

180
00:08:32,908 --> 00:08:37,918
Sabba komasan 17 shadow coma song and

181
00:08:35,788 --> 00:08:40,830
was their origin actually came from

182
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,629
mallow sebasi in the central asia which

183
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:50,730
we will talk a little bit more and also

184
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:53,429
from the european crabapple those are

185
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,800
the check out sorry those actually the

186
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:59,669
chinese species actually we don't really

187
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:01,229
have them in the collection so that's we

188
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:04,588
hope in the future we can get more

189
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:10,920
material from china also for other area

190
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:14,550
over there here is a study we we publish

191
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:17,759
three years ago looking at the conserved

192
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:21,629
sequence of corpus genome of the 31

193
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:24,899
different mouse species and using 460

194
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:26,639
accession in general a lot of asian

195
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:29,120
species they all group together

196
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:32,338
especially those material from china and

197
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,649
then as you all know also notice the

198
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:37,050
mallas fur scarf on the Pacific

199
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:39,350
Northwest is actually also closely

200
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:42,479
related to the a lot asian species

201
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:44,670
therefore it is well believed that model

202
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,769
fusca actually came from Asia through

203
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:49,588
the land bridge when the land was still

204
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:51,899
frozen and the rich Alaska eventually

205
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:55,560
come to British Columbia Washington

206
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:57,269
Oregon and Northern California and then

207
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:59,729
for the modern-day Apple models the my

208
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:02,370
cicada and also it's for general species

209
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:05,339
they also actually closer related to the

210
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:07,649
Asian species and then there were we

211
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:09,690
have there's a group of Asian material

212
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:12,870
they are actually more tropical for ten

213
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:15,480
example the malos inland ences is

214
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,429
actually the best example the morphology

215
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,950
and everything of all this

216
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:22,859
Tyrael is really different on this most

217
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:25,110
of the Asian while malice material so

218
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,509
phylogenetically they kind of group

219
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,730
together by themselves and then we have

220
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:32,850
a one very unique material Maoist Omari

221
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:37,139
it's actually located in place like a V

222
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:39,570
nan Miramar and also into Taiwan the

223
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:42,240
history of this material are still being

224
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:44,850
debated but it's possible this material

225
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,450
might be actually closer related to

226
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:51,600
Pyrus instead of malice so someone some

227
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:54,480
researcher are working on that and then

228
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,490
we have some models material in the

229
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,399
meditation region for example of foreign

230
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,230
tina in northern Italy but I believe

231
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:03,899
there's some other one-mile species in

232
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:07,110
Europe for example in in a Highland of

233
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:10,830
Lebanon and also there's wall species in

234
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:12,889
in Sicily they are really isolated they

235
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,570
are kind of maybe have a unique

236
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:18,360
evolution also domestication history

237
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:20,399
among those isolated species material

238
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,580
and then of course we have the North

239
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,769
American three wild species in East

240
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:29,700
Coast out of the North American

241
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:32,730
continent here just showing a corner

242
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:35,610
gram timeframe differentiation between

243
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:37,769
the different wild model species in this

244
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:40,019
particular study they actually use two

245
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:43,409
North American wild species the model

246
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:45,629
Sciences and also malas angustifolia you

247
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:48,600
can see this two material actually is

248
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:50,700
most ancient compared with all the while

249
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,980
model species out there but they are

250
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,990
located in North America and they

251
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,778
separated from all the rest of the

252
00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:00,720
maoist material between by about 20 to

253
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:02,939
40 million years so how these three

254
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,329
species came about in the North America

255
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:10,470
still is one of the major puzzle at

256
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:13,939
least in my mind soon after the

257
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:16,470
establishment of the mollusk collection

258
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:18,600
based on the donation from all the

259
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:21,269
programs basically from all over the US

260
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,129
and also from around the globe the

261
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:25,319
researcher actually realized there's

262
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:27,809
really either need trying to collect

263
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,740
more while MAOIs material and therefore

264
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:35,699
in 1987 professor

265
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:37,470
who is also working in Canarsie

266
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:41,040
he started expiration and malformed

267
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:44,100
Alice fusca in Pacific Northwest and

268
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:47,730
followed by dr. Elizabeth Dickinson who

269
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:51,930
was the first PhD student of death toll

270
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:54,120
and for her PhD at Cornell University he

271
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:57,059
collect she collected a lot of material

272
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,220
and gas podía corneria also I wanna

273
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:03,599
insist and study their genetic

274
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:05,639
relationship and then starting 1989 93

275
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,379
95 96

276
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,509
professor herb Alan Koh who was a

277
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:12,269
professor at pathology department at

278
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:15,269
Cornell University in Geneva together

279
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:16,919
with my predecessor Phil first line and

280
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:18,689
also researcher found different

281
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:20,759
institution even from different country

282
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:23,490
they went over to Central Asia

283
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:26,730
especially in Casas tend to collect a

284
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:31,049
model sebacic material for different

285
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:33,690
time and then in 1997 they carry out one

286
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:35,069
of the exploration in China collects

287
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:38,550
seven different Wow model species

288
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:41,310
material and followed by one exploration

289
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:44,039
in in Russia from all Soren tell us and

290
00:13:41,309 --> 00:13:44,909
the more in in Turkey for mouse or

291
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:48,959
Teletoon

292
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:51,360
and then after almost 16 year hiatus in

293
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:54,480
exploration activity I restarted

294
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,730
exploration activity in 2015 by

295
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:02,899
collecting mass and gas folia in the

296
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:02,899
southern US we continue doing so since

297
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:09,090
this is surveyed down by once again by

298
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:12,600
crop diversity trust and also our

299
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:15,840
colleague L VOC the USDA laboratory for

300
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:18,090
Colin Corrado they did a survey for all

301
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,090
the apple collection around the globe

302
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:22,920
here to show you the top 10 Apple

303
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:25,410
collection internal their number and

304
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:28,289
also there were models species

305
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:31,199
representation in the collection as you

306
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:33,209
can see at that time the PGR your

307
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,640
collection is the largest internal the

308
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:37,440
total number and also in terms of the

309
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:42,039
diversity of the WHA model species

310
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:44,410
material here

311
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:47,049
so I a borrow from dr. Peter Brady who

312
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:50,620
is a national program leader Oh planned

313
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:55,269
germplasm also genome within the USDA

314
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:57,549
ARS he gave the priority for all the Jim

315
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:00,578
germplasm resources management all the

316
00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:03,519
repository in general basically for all

317
00:15:00,578 --> 00:15:06,039
the repository our number one priority

318
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,720
is the maintenance also the safeguarding

319
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:10,419
of the material we have in the

320
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,250
collection and for the sea crab and the

321
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:15,669
row crop that involve a lot of

322
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:17,500
regeneration work and also safekeeping

323
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:19,448
out of documentation also data

324
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,240
associated with the accession in the

325
00:15:19,448 --> 00:15:24,909
collection all those three activity

326
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,789
considered number one internal priority

327
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:30,639
and next is actually acquisition

328
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:33,129
this is leaders who exploration exchange

329
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,459
of material for the country all within

330
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:38,350
the US and the third party is the

331
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:40,899
distribution on the material to all the

332
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:43,060
stakeholder by including general public

333
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:45,490
and also researcher which I will talk a

334
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:47,259
little bit more and next party is

335
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:49,600
actually characterization also

336
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:52,750
evaluation of all the accession in the

337
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,389
collection and the next is actually

338
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:58,360
enhancement what that mean is trying to

339
00:15:55,389 --> 00:16:01,028
make crosses events the generation so

340
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:04,269
you can have new trade or disease

341
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:07,149
resistant into events material that can

342
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:09,339
be used by breeder and then finally is

343
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:13,809
trying to carry out research in support

344
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:16,089
all the preceding priorities most

345
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:18,458
specifically for the models collection

346
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:20,170
our number one priority of course the

347
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:22,869
maintenance and the safeguarding of the

348
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:24,969
material we do that by have a field

349
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:27,970
collection of all the trees different

350
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:31,089
material all different variety and also

351
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:34,959
while species material we use also use

352
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:38,139
Co freezer -20 freezer just to store the

353
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:41,049
seeds we collected and also we have

354
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:43,870
using cryopreservation of dormant Bawa

355
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:47,309
of the malleus at the USDA National

356
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:51,460
Center for genetic resources

357
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:53,979
preservation unit a full column Corrado

358
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,450
and next is acquisition we're doing a

359
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,210
lot of those activities through

360
00:16:55,450 --> 00:17:00,399
exchanges also explorations on malice

361
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:03,009
during pause in the US and also from

362
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,529
around the globe and next its

363
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:08,619
distribution for mouse we usually

364
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:11,828
district between 4000 to 6000 sample

365
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:15,578
each year that including winter Dolman

366
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:19,359
Babu some above pollen flower fusilli

367
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:21,399
fanned DNA sample and then next user

368
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,078
care organization we carry a lot of

369
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,839
different morphologies study also

370
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:29,079
genetic study of all our session in the

371
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:31,539
collection and all the information they

372
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:35,349
are store at germplasm resources

373
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:39,399
information network database the current

374
00:17:35,349 --> 00:17:40,750
day green global database and finally we

375
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,900
will carry out a lot of outreach

376
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:46,539
actively trying to increase the public

377
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:51,640
awareness of the value also importance

378
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:53,220
of the malleus collection here to show

379
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,710
you some history for the mouse

380
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:59,200
exploration started by in central asia a

381
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:02,259
lot of Russian scientists actually start

382
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:06,390
in study the wild malice in Central Asia

383
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:10,269
as early as early as we call it back in

384
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:13,090
1796 all the way in early 1900 the

385
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:16,629
famous plan geneticists the claw of

386
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:19,000
Babylon actually he first time explore

387
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:23,590
the wild Apple forest in Central Asia in

388
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,019
Casas tan first guy in 2019 29 together

389
00:18:23,589 --> 00:18:28,990
with waha the planks were west over from

390
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:31,119
usda at that time and then later on

391
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:33,099
professor dental of and other scientists

392
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:36,339
on the cosna stan academy of science

393
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:39,189
they explore explore the wild mouse in

394
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:41,730
the region and also studied them for

395
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,730
several decades

396
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,339
here is a photo showing the first

397
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:50,410
exploration Beauvoir went to central

398
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:54,549
asia the apple forest the first time in

399
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:57,279
1929 here he is and oh here is actually

400
00:18:54,549 --> 00:19:00,220
Westover who is a planned Expo Explorer

401
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:02,490
from usda accompanied him at the same

402
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,490
time

403
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:08,538
some photo showing Bob Lowe actually

404
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:10,819
came to eat chicken ooh you're in 1932

405
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:14,388
to attend the sixth International

406
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:16,099
Congress of genetics this is right here

407
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:19,219
and here is actually a photo of a

408
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:21,648
Barbara McClintock right here and at

409
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:24,589
that time he came to New York he also

410
00:19:21,648 --> 00:19:27,979
brought with him two paintings of a bar

411
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:30,459
apple from Casa Stan and Kristen is to

412
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:33,889
pending actually still housed at a

413
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:36,350
Cornell library and this two pending was

414
00:19:33,888 --> 00:19:38,479
actually presented to Professor

415
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:40,908
Wellington who was a director for the

416
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,329
Experimental Station at Geneva at that

417
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:45,950
time I want to show you I pay attention

418
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:50,808
to this particular painting of this

419
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:53,179
Apple so follow up on that later here's

420
00:19:50,808 --> 00:19:55,509
a map showing all the exploration in

421
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:58,869
Central Asia by my predecessor and

422
00:19:55,509 --> 00:20:01,460
professor herb Allan Coe and other folks

423
00:19:58,868 --> 00:20:03,589
basically most of the exploration

424
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,720
actually is in the country of Casas then

425
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:07,788
a three different time location actually

426
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:11,839
in three other former sofa Soviet

427
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:16,009
republic so altogether they are 40 fun

428
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:18,798
trip in 89 93 95 and 96 they have 12

429
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:22,639
different major sides and also they

430
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:25,700
collect something they call 44 elite

431
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:27,798
melosa Vesely these are the trees 1a in

432
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:31,100
the field they look wonderful maybe they

433
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:33,769
show resistant to diseases or draw or

434
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:36,349
some other unique food quality therefore

435
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:38,388
they also collect a bowl of those 44

436
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:41,058
material bringing it back to the US

437
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:42,979
through the quarantine system but

438
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:44,648
majority of the material they collected

439
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:48,829
actually the open pollinated seeds

440
00:20:44,648 --> 00:20:51,949
altogether they collect 894 see your

441
00:20:48,829 --> 00:20:54,918
session from mouse-over see in that come

442
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:58,308
in four different trip and after all

443
00:20:54,919 --> 00:21:02,090
together they collect over 130,000 seeds

444
00:20:58,308 --> 00:21:04,220
after returned to the US over 40,000 of

445
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:07,038
those seeds actually was sent out to all

446
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,720
the Apple researcher in the u.s. also

447
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:12,558
around the globe at that time

448
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,419
up till now over a third 39,000 all

449
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:17,349
those seeds from the origin exploration

450
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:20,049
still store in the freezer for Colin

451
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:23,829
and over 50,000 of those he actually

452
00:21:20,048 --> 00:21:25,000
store at the freezer in Geneva also in

453
00:21:23,829 --> 00:21:26,710
the last ten year

454
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,648
we're being collect the open pollinated

455
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:32,620
seeds over 200,000 of those Opie seeds

456
00:21:29,648 --> 00:21:34,359
from Alistair versus heating block we

457
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:36,849
call those a mountain you know desire

458
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:38,709
sea because thanks to Michael Pollan's

459
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:40,778
book a lot of people asking for the

460
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:43,690
material so when people send us a

461
00:21:40,778 --> 00:21:46,869
request we'll send a package of 25 open

462
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:50,009
policy of massive se was the instruction

463
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:53,168
how to stratify and germinate the sea so

464
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:56,230
you can have your own while Marcy from

465
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:58,570
Central Asia here just show you quickly

466
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:02,558
some of the photo and as mentioned

467
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:04,950
earlier about a particular painting on

468
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:07,589
their expression in the nineteen

469
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:10,419
nineteen eighty and ninety one

470
00:22:07,589 --> 00:22:13,928
particulars Apple really similar to the

471
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:16,419
drawing by all the way by presented by

472
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:20,950
rebel all to professor wouldn't and at

473
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:27,120
that time some of the photo exploration

474
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:32,798
in China in 1997 exploration in Turkey

475
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:37,719
the rel they take over Turkey at that

476
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:40,450
time and then in 99 in 2015

477
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:43,298
I restarted exploration activity Geneva

478
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:45,700
New York we see funding once again

479
00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:47,259
founded by playing strange office at

480
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:51,490
national germplasm resource the

481
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:55,028
laboratory was a 16 day trip almost

482
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:57,278
5,000 mile driving from New York down to

483
00:22:55,028 --> 00:23:00,369
Arkansas Mississippi Louisiana and

484
00:22:57,278 --> 00:23:03,429
Alabama and came back I was able to

485
00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:06,099
color over 7,000 ORAC found 38 different

486
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:10,210
trees also some of the leaf sample at

487
00:23:06,099 --> 00:23:11,798
that time here's a mark our who's a

488
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,808
professor at University of Southern

489
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:15,819
Mississippi who was actually also a

490
00:23:13,808 --> 00:23:20,349
graduate from Cornell University he was

491
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:20,888
very helpful for this trip and then

492
00:23:20,349 --> 00:23:22,778
follow-up

493
00:23:20,888 --> 00:23:27,250
exploration once again in the Arkansas

494
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:30,038
Mississippi Louisiana in 2016 almost

495
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:31,119
5000 open policy from 18 different trees

496
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:36,879
and also

497
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:39,759
mobile material at that time and last

498
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,650
year together with the Julian group we

499
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:45,160
actually went to Pennsylvania to collect

500
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:49,269
Mouse coronary or material were able to

501
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:53,710
collect over 12,000 open policy found 29

502
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:57,639
different treats also 11 different

503
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:59,829
location actually we found there's a lot

504
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,470
more mouths coronary trees in

505
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:06,149
Pennsylvania so a lot more sample could

506
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:06,150
be collected maybe in the future

507
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,579
a week later I went out to another trip

508
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:16,420
by myself to collect Mouse corneria and

509
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:19,808
also mala Sciences in misses in Michigan

510
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:22,539
Illinois Iowa and also Missouri wow the

511
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:25,058
perks of this treat trip actually was

512
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:29,319
following the footsteps of elizabeth

513
00:24:25,058 --> 00:24:32,609
dickinson 30 year beforehand and i

514
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:36,700
visited 22 location that elizabeth

515
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:40,659
actually collected back in the late 1984

516
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:42,700
CH initely 20 out of 22 side that he

517
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,920
collectors some time he heard

518
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,720
description were saying there's over 100

519
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,500
trees in particular location

520
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:53,860
all those 20 20 side all the way maula

521
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:58,359
street are all gone due to a lot of

522
00:24:53,859 --> 00:25:00,339
development in the midwest so some of

523
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:03,849
the lesson have learned from the mouse

524
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:06,009
expiration so far in the US the first

525
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:07,928
thing is trying to understand the role

526
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:10,660
of the target species play in the

527
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:15,720
ecological setting it's actually very

528
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:18,759
important to understand its location the

529
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,679
age of the environment it's also

530
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:25,900
affecting the growth habit of the tree

531
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:28,570
its morphology and also how reliable is

532
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:31,240
the herbarium sample that we base on for

533
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:35,529
collection a lot of older harboring

534
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:38,620
sample by knowing the possible location

535
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:40,809
environment this species could be then

536
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:43,809
actually you can eliminate some of those

537
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:46,298
location most likely the tree sample

538
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:49,058
will not be there

539
00:25:46,298 --> 00:25:51,720
there's actually a lot of site they will

540
00:25:49,058 --> 00:25:54,308
loss especially during the last 30 years

541
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,380
due to urban development especially

542
00:25:54,308 --> 00:26:00,490
seems like that's the case in the

543
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:02,950
Midwest and also in the South actually

544
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:05,288
don't do to a clear cutting logging

545
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:08,110
practice sometime they were coming chop

546
00:26:05,288 --> 00:26:10,690
off entire block of trees including some

547
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:13,569
other freestanding wild mouse material

548
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:14,288
also seems climate change could be a

549
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:16,779
problem

550
00:26:14,288 --> 00:26:18,788
hurricane in the south sometimes

551
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:21,579
flooding actually also down there some

552
00:26:18,788 --> 00:26:25,769
other tree they've been around for maybe

553
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:29,849
ten year I've seen that in 2015 but on

554
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:33,279
2016 why return to the same side almost

555
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:35,529
trees along a mile track actually on

556
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:39,038
both I or all flooded all the tree just

557
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:40,629
just got killed in that year and also a

558
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:42,819
lot of land management decision

559
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:45,789
especially al owal malice issues

560
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:47,980
material they are very thorny so in a

561
00:26:45,788 --> 00:26:50,079
lot of the park location people actually

562
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:53,558
will cut a tree off because the tree

563
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:56,918
probably are too phony because of that

564
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:59,158
reason but I believe there's still a lot

565
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:02,620
of wild mouse materials still exist

566
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:05,230
especially in poverty force State Park

567
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:07,479
Nature Reserve and even some of the

568
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:10,240
actually on private land so but they're

569
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,950
getting more difficult to find but I

570
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,419
think we should try to spend effort

571
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:18,548
trying to get more before they a

572
00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:20,049
complete disappear then talk about why

573
00:27:18,548 --> 00:27:22,150
we're trying to collect or preserve the

574
00:27:20,048 --> 00:27:24,158
wild germ plasm material especially the

575
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:28,960
wild mouse material on a global scale

576
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:32,490
a lot of material also their natural

577
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:36,850
habitat a loss in the last decade or so

578
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:39,220
and also last half-century due to a lot

579
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:41,259
of agricultural development changes and

580
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:44,558
also the changes also a lot of urban

581
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:46,569
development also a lot of human activity

582
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:48,700
especially in some less developed

583
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:51,189
countries such as a far route getting

584
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,740
it's really a problem the people just

585
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:56,519
chopped off all the wild mouse in that

586
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:58,870
case also a lot of animal grazing

587
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,670
environment degradation

588
00:27:58,869 --> 00:28:04,269
climate change could be an issue also

589
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:07,080
land management decision and also in

590
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:10,629
some location especially like in Europe

591
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:13,480
that's the case for European crabapple

592
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:16,240
mallow semesters the gene flow and also

593
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:19,180
pollen contamination found a co2 based

594
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:22,000
species really become a serious issue in

595
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:24,549
some case the study showed that 60% of

596
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,750
the while the open policy you collect

597
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:28,240
from sixty percent of population

598
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:31,450
actually all contaminated by mouse

599
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,410
domestic you domesticate a pollen so

600
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:37,390
that's a serious issue in Europe

601
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:40,570
sometimes due to new paths and disease

602
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:43,030
and also new invasive species so a lot

603
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:45,099
of problem also climate change has been

604
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:47,589
documented in Central Asia and causes

605
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:50,079
for example in the last almost hundred

606
00:28:47,589 --> 00:28:53,789
years temperature has risen post in the

607
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,789
winter time also during the springtime

608
00:28:54,210 --> 00:29:00,850
here some study from China for example

609
00:28:57,029 --> 00:29:03,099
in the 50-year period 80% of the wild

610
00:29:00,849 --> 00:29:06,000
mouse material in Shenyang China were

611
00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:08,889
all lost due to variety of the reason

612
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,990
well the major reason surprisingly over

613
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:13,900
there is actually over harvests of wire

614
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:16,779
fruit the local resident actually they

615
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:18,400
like to collecting the material so in

616
00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:20,289
the last two year the researcher

617
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,090
actually trying to collect more material

618
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:24,058
but they couldn't because before they

619
00:29:22,089 --> 00:29:28,178
showed up all of whom were gone

620
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:29,920
collected by local resident so that's a

621
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:31,660
serious problem and also there's a study

622
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,420
in 2014

623
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:36,670
showing that firewood getting it's

624
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:39,400
especially serious issue in Central Asia

625
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:42,279
a lot of our malice material also a lot

626
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,080
of food tree material simple issues

627
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:48,389
between laws so they can be complete

628
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:51,009
down in the next 50 to 150 years earlier

629
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:54,070
some target of a future Mouse

630
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:58,150
exploration I'm going to collect more

631
00:29:54,069 --> 00:30:00,549
common area in Ohio this year my

632
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:02,650
colleague gehlbach she's trying to carry

633
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:07,178
our exploration for mouse tamari in

634
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:09,220
North East bean on this this for next

635
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:12,519
year maybe more angustifolia in the

636
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:15,729
southern US and also mouse corner

637
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:17,588
in West Virginia in two years and then

638
00:30:15,729 --> 00:30:20,080
there's a lot of much material in

639
00:30:17,588 --> 00:30:22,239
different places as all wish lists we're

640
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:28,658
trying to collect hopefully in the next

641
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:30,788
five to ten years besides go collected

642
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:34,389
planned germplasm material either in the

643
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:36,759
u.s. also around the globe we also do a

644
00:30:34,388 --> 00:30:38,738
lot of importation of the models German

645
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:42,038
past material from other country into

646
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:44,828
the US all this material we bought in

647
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:48,908
has to go to the USDA APHIS quarantine

648
00:30:44,828 --> 00:30:51,788
system it has to be cling up over there

649
00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:53,889
then were released to us every year we

650
00:30:51,788 --> 00:30:57,729
receive between 10 to 20 years session

651
00:30:53,888 --> 00:31:01,108
from the AFIS sometime war in recent

652
00:30:57,729 --> 00:31:04,088
year for example the model sebasi elite

653
00:31:01,108 --> 00:31:06,999
concentration was imported and also a

654
00:31:04,088 --> 00:31:09,219
lot of cider apple for northern spain

655
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:12,788
was introduced actually by professor

656
00:31:09,219 --> 00:31:16,659
year merwin before he retired two years

657
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:19,298
ago a lot of cider from England Greg

658
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:21,759
over here and a lot of different variety

659
00:31:19,298 --> 00:31:23,700
and rusa material from variety of

660
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:27,219
different country in the last five years

661
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:28,419
and also all this material take a

662
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:31,269
several year to go through the

663
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:34,119
quarantine system all the most extreme

664
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:36,538
example are two of the mouse eally

665
00:31:34,118 --> 00:31:41,288
material was collected in 1996

666
00:31:36,538 --> 00:31:43,358
expiration welcome will just release one

667
00:31:41,288 --> 00:31:46,598
months ago we got noticed on Ava's

668
00:31:43,358 --> 00:31:49,478
saying after 22 year the material is

669
00:31:46,598 --> 00:31:51,128
finally release there's one more

670
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:54,369
actually still in quarantine

671
00:31:51,128 --> 00:31:57,098
maybe next year so we'll wait I see what

672
00:31:54,368 --> 00:32:02,288
happened so altogether in the last five

673
00:31:57,098 --> 00:32:04,808
years we introduced over 100 6:162

674
00:32:02,288 --> 00:32:08,608
clones and also we collect over adding

675
00:32:04,808 --> 00:32:12,158
360 accession to the malleus collection

676
00:32:08,608 --> 00:32:13,989
in the last five years we also have been

677
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,059
selecting a lot in a while seeding

678
00:32:13,989 --> 00:32:19,769
material and after the permanent

679
00:32:16,058 --> 00:32:21,908
collection we had over 300

680
00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:25,899
accession to the permanent collection

681
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:26,290
last year so all together almost 800

682
00:32:25,898 --> 00:32:28,179
different

683
00:32:26,289 --> 00:32:32,920
new accession will add to the collection

684
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:35,500
in the last five years here to show you

685
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:38,110
show you why the aphids quarantine

686
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:40,059
system takes so long while the major

687
00:32:38,109 --> 00:32:42,579
reason is it has to go through

688
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:44,619
biological indexing if there is any

689
00:32:42,579 --> 00:32:46,929
disease being found then they have the

690
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:49,479
dose to a tissue culture process then

691
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:51,610
goes through a thermal therapy and then

692
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,220
it goes who's she tipped grafting micro

693
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:56,589
grafting of the material and then being

694
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:59,319
retest again before they can

695
00:32:56,589 --> 00:33:01,209
provisionally release to us then we'll

696
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:02,799
based on field observation for

697
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:05,980
additional two to three years before

698
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:08,129
they can fully release so normally this

699
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:11,740
process take about at least five years

700
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:14,110
but in the extreme case we have a

701
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:18,609
material being a quarantine for 23 year

702
00:33:14,109 --> 00:33:21,490
now so last year there is the

703
00:33:18,609 --> 00:33:23,889
interesting development the global crop

704
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:26,799
diversity trust together with millennion

705
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:29,950
sea bank at the rope on kenny garden in

706
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:32,440
Kew England they have an ongoing project

707
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:35,980
they are collecting 29 crop wild

708
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:40,420
relatives in 24 different country

709
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:42,849
including the wild malice this project

710
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:45,840
was founded by governme

711
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:48,219
Norway and for the malleus collection

712
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:50,889
lady sigh all the sea they collect

713
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:53,680
actually one-third of all the seeds will

714
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:55,540
stay at the country of origin the other

715
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:59,049
ones there of the C would be stored at a

716
00:33:55,539 --> 00:34:01,539
seed bank in Kew garden and after quite

717
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:04,329
a intense discussion for almost two

718
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:06,399
weeks they made a decision the remaining

719
00:34:04,329 --> 00:34:09,269
one-third of all the while mono sealer

720
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:13,059
collected will come to Geneva for

721
00:34:09,269 --> 00:34:15,009
evaluation also characterization this

722
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:17,918
including Wow miles from seven different

723
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:20,440
countries some of the material from this

724
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,569
country will never have that in our

725
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:25,389
collection so it's very interesting and

726
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:27,340
exciting hopefully to get the hands on

727
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:31,419
this material from seven different

728
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:33,100
country next one to tell you some of the

729
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:36,039
story we're getting involved in the last

730
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:39,099
five year for example in 2016 two years

731
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:39,849
ago we propagate a whole bunch of 28

732
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:42,610
crap

733
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:46,210
from blown two different Walmart species

734
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:48,669
some other hybrid species from the US

735
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:51,849
National Arboretum they have a new

736
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:54,159
director director over there and he made

737
00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:59,019
a decision they going to remove their

738
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:01,000
entire Mouse collection so some of the

739
00:34:59,019 --> 00:35:02,650
material were able to rescue and come to

740
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,559
Geneva before they will completely

741
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:10,760
remove and

742
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:15,920
in back in 2017 last year while the

743
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:20,300
material is a Martha Helene Anna from

744
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:25,159
from China it's actually located at USDA

745
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:28,070
Chico station since 1914 was originally

746
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:31,879
collected by Frank Meyer and once again

747
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:35,750
also in San Shi area he collected

748
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:38,780
material in 1914 January and then sent

749
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:41,389
to Chico station in in March the

750
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:47,060
material actually has been near for the

751
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:50,619
last almost 100 years okay somehow Holly

752
00:35:47,059 --> 00:35:54,949
from the national plunger deposit system

753
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:57,400
Garrigan our Kenard and also Karen Wilin

754
00:35:54,949 --> 00:36:00,169
I was able to go to Chico station

755
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,730
identify the material and then the

756
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:04,900
bubble was sent to us for preservation

757
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:08,590
was very interesting this is actually

758
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:12,019
multi Pato cattle layer pedo of

759
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:13,430
crabapple material Wow Apple material so

760
00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:17,769
it will be interesting to see how he

761
00:36:13,429 --> 00:36:17,769
looks like right here in Geneva New York

762
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:25,099
and also Karen William and also Derek

763
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:27,409
Renard they also went to a former USDA

764
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:30,710
station introduction field station in

765
00:36:27,409 --> 00:36:32,629
Cheyenne Wyoming they found a whole

766
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:36,139
bunch of Mouse material has been around

767
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:39,789
since about 1920 and 1930 so they're

768
00:36:36,139 --> 00:36:42,170
able to rescue about 11 material and

769
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:45,920
collect the Babu and send to us for

770
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:48,440
propagation some of them several

771
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,130
crabapple rack crabapple material from

772
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,889
Canada

773
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:53,930
we caught that Lake series crabapple and

774
00:36:51,889 --> 00:36:55,489
also three different wild mouse material

775
00:36:53,929 --> 00:36:59,989
either originally came from China

776
00:36:55,489 --> 00:37:00,669
collect by Dorset in 1927 or France's

777
00:36:59,989 --> 00:37:04,129
from China

778
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:06,740
and also one material found from Europe

779
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:10,519
so those material rescue or come to

780
00:37:06,739 --> 00:37:12,049
Geneva in New York next I want to talk a

781
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:14,239
little bit about the maintenance of the

782
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:16,400
Mallos collection basically all the

783
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:20,329
variety we have a trees in the field and

784
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:23,690
also we have a core collection from

785
00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:26,599
collection away have we store the seed -

786
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:30,679
20 freezer we also have the doorman Bawa

787
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:32,839
in the cairo preservation here is

788
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:37,190
showing some photo from the center in

789
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:40,280
for Colorado we test the viability by

790
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:41,929
budding and then for our routine

791
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,220
maintenance of a safeguarding of the

792
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:45,529
material we'll do a lot of weeding

793
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:48,889
spraying a nursery operation also

794
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:50,600
pruning doing a wintertime here just

795
00:37:48,889 --> 00:37:53,150
showing the list of all the collection

796
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:54,440
we have we have over basic 7,000 our

797
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:58,280
session right now in the total

798
00:37:54,440 --> 00:38:00,730
collection all the permanent material

799
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:04,820
have a tag showing all the information

800
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:06,829
or photo of the collection here's my

801
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:11,480
predecessor fuel force lawyer and dr.

802
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:13,599
herb Alan Koh in 2013 during a bloom

803
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,670
time

804
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,889
here she's showing some of the data from

805
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:20,289
our distribution record in the last

806
00:38:17,889 --> 00:38:23,529
eight year basically between 2010 in

807
00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:26,050
2017 with this review basically this is

808
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:27,460
a number of requests we got in the last

809
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:29,200
three year you can see in the last three

810
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:33,070
year we really have a high number of

811
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:38,739
requests actually 2016 was a record

812
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:42,430
number of requests but was the total

813
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:47,109
number of sample was not a record but we

814
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:49,539
believe that 2018 Maivia record we're

815
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:51,309
doing a lot of characterization work all

816
00:38:49,539 --> 00:38:53,139
the information about the material

817
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:56,739
actually store in the green Globo

818
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:59,289
database we also do a lot of study about

819
00:38:56,739 --> 00:39:01,419
the chemical composition disease and

820
00:38:59,289 --> 00:39:05,320
information all that is all asked for

821
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:07,960
the Green global database we're also in

822
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:10,210
the last 20 year did a tremendous amount

823
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:12,579
of work in study the wild mouse germ

824
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:15,460
plasm material basically a lot of

825
00:39:12,579 --> 00:39:21,309
disease really the work and also study

826
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:23,559
of the material different trait this is

827
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:26,529
one particular materials actually able

828
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:28,480
to discover a new brand new highly

829
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:32,670
resistant material against blue male

830
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:36,099
Mouse here just showing inoculation

831
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:38,440
seven-day after inoculation in resistant

832
00:39:36,099 --> 00:39:40,989
material versus the susceptor material

833
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:44,559
it's a significant contrast between the

834
00:39:40,989 --> 00:39:48,609
reaction after inoculation with blue

835
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:50,650
mouse and two major kill TL control this

836
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:53,950
tray will map in chromosome number three

837
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:55,930
and commercial number ten and then we do

838
00:39:53,949 --> 00:40:00,549
a lot of other study a different tray

839
00:39:55,929 --> 00:40:00,809
with a lot of different cooperator well

840
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,760
also

841
00:40:00,809 --> 00:40:04,500
provide a lot of material for different

842
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,270
researcher everywhere well the best

843
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:10,110
example is actually there's a

844
00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:12,780
publication by Velasco in 2010 the

845
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:14,460
genome of the domestic apple actually in

846
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,250
that study they used seventies for a

847
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:19,490
session actually 46 of those actions

848
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:23,039
actually all came from Geneva collection

849
00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:25,139
so and the last two year alone there's

850
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:28,079
about 18 publication we are directly

851
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:30,389
involved with seven of those the using

852
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:34,289
are to imply some material to to carry

853
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:39,029
out the research we did the GPS work

854
00:40:34,289 --> 00:40:44,820
since 2012 did the G wasps analysis

855
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:47,820
using the GPS data also we did a

856
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:51,590
extensive resequencing study which after

857
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:54,600
luncheon and at the fail the Thompsons

858
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:59,519
research in here right here in Geneva in

859
00:40:54,599 --> 00:41:03,690
in New York in Ithaca actually study the

860
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:06,750
history domestication of modern day

861
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:08,840
Apple here's a showing diagrams actually

862
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:11,639
two step process for processing

863
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:13,980
full-size increased one happened before

864
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:15,420
domestication process what actually

865
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:20,219
happened during the domestication

866
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:22,409
process in Central Asia a lot of work

867
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:23,689
who was together with Gregg in the last

868
00:41:22,409 --> 00:41:27,329
few years

869
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:30,240
searching for the hard cider for New

870
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:32,789
York which is become while the fastest

871
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:35,359
growing in sector of the industry for

872
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:37,969
alcoholic beverage industry in the US

873
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:41,490
Gregor's studied the malleus collection

874
00:41:37,969 --> 00:41:44,909
we have looking for the best material

875
00:41:41,489 --> 00:41:47,339
also Spanish cider material also right

876
00:41:44,909 --> 00:41:48,869
now in the collection we're trying to

877
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:52,410
look into some of the wild mouse

878
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:55,109
material this is a photo of actually a

879
00:41:52,409 --> 00:42:00,599
cider made from a red flash material

880
00:41:55,110 --> 00:42:02,220
almost looked like a red wine then we

881
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:04,710
are currently actually supporting

882
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:07,859
actually nineteen different research

883
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:10,500
ongoing research a lot of them long time

884
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:13,050
cooperation for example with dr. Susan

885
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,739
brown apple wing program at Cornell

886
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:17,440
University

887
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:21,909
and then also the Apple rooster breeding

888
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,889
program and a lot of different work in

889
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:27,639
the last couple of years people from

890
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:31,118
Michigan State and Purdue University dr.

891
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:32,980
Kenan sue right here in Geneva doing a

892
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:37,180
lot of fruit quality work and also tree

893
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:38,710
architectural trades analysis for doing

894
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:40,838
a lot of sequencing work with different

895
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:42,670
researchers from different institutions

896
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:45,400
from Harvard University from John

897
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:49,269
institution in England some folks for

898
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:53,108
Australia also some disease work and

899
00:42:49,269 --> 00:42:56,530
also insect monitor work and also with

900
00:42:53,108 --> 00:42:57,940
Greg on the cider work and also we start

901
00:42:56,530 --> 00:43:01,150
relying on Chen on the bitter raw

902
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:05,679
evaluation in the last few years we

903
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:08,170
spent over there also right now with dr.

904
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:10,358
Abbas Khan who's a new faculty relative

905
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:12,250
the new faculty Geneva and the plant

906
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:17,829
pathology working on different disease

907
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:20,858
related issue and also a lot of we're

908
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:23,199
supporting a lot of cider variety

909
00:43:20,858 --> 00:43:24,848
testing right now because cider is

910
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:27,250
getting so hot a lot of people

911
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:30,039
interesting so we're studying actually

912
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:33,480
supporting material for study in

913
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:36,369
actually places like Arizona Georgia

914
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:39,219
California Maine Michigan Montana New

915
00:43:36,369 --> 00:43:41,890
Mexico New Year of course Washington's

916
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:46,449
day and also West Virginia but study a

917
00:43:41,889 --> 00:43:48,940
lot of those material so then we have

918
00:43:46,449 --> 00:43:51,608
some uniques requests in the last couple

919
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:55,000
years especially I think this request

920
00:43:51,608 --> 00:43:57,309
from the Smithsonian trying to get the

921
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,070
bark tissue for Native all species from

922
00:43:57,309 --> 00:44:02,170
Japan but study the yellow dye in the

923
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:05,588
use in a traditional Japanese painting

924
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:07,720
that's also very unique are we doing a

925
00:44:05,588 --> 00:44:11,019
lot of outreach a lot of people visit

926
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:13,358
our collection Hobart whaling space

927
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:17,019
college classes several classes every

928
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:19,210
year and also CBS Sunday morning Mo

929
00:44:17,019 --> 00:44:20,619
Rocca our last year October visitor

930
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:23,108
collection

931
00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:24,670
Cornell plant breeding courses 4060

932
00:44:23,108 --> 00:44:27,360
actually come to the collection every

933
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:29,800
year in September

934
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:31,930
and also a lot of researcher from

935
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:35,560
different country from China from Brazil

936
00:44:31,929 --> 00:44:37,690
and from many other country also the

937
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:39,699
grower extension personnel come to the

938
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:41,800
collection all the time in the last five

939
00:44:39,699 --> 00:44:44,589
year basically over 1,500 visitors

940
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:46,810
actually come to the collection 79

941
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:50,260
different group and classes so it's very

942
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:53,170
interesting finally I want to thank a

943
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:58,300
lot of people involved in the project

944
00:44:53,170 --> 00:45:00,039
and it's a very long list here just

945
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:03,840
showing some of the photo of some of the

946
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:03,840
folks we work together on the project

947
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:09,269
any question thank you

948
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:15,320
[Applause]

949
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:27,108
sorry I have to rush you the latter half

950
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:31,309
of the dog so looking into the future

951
00:45:27,108 --> 00:45:34,219
type of question the first wise entry

952
00:45:31,309 --> 00:45:38,529
you should that there is a service out

953
00:45:34,219 --> 00:45:43,069
there how many members are in that

954
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:45,250
exception I don't quite remember I have

955
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:48,500
to go back to look sorry about that

956
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:52,039
Allen was asking copass DNA sequence

957
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:55,250
study of the malleus relationship we

958
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:57,889
have a service our group so he's asking

959
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:59,570
how many sessions in our group I don't

960
00:45:57,889 --> 00:46:03,889
quite remember so I have to go back to

961
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:06,019
look I'm sorry yes look into the future

962
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:10,009
how do you think the future are you

963
00:46:06,019 --> 00:46:14,059
should too the research needs in the

964
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:17,180
post genomics era because currently

965
00:46:14,059 --> 00:46:22,960
kidyou largely keeps a lot to treats

966
00:46:17,179 --> 00:46:26,480
from exception that's absolutely fine

967
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:35,838
but for any other type of let's say you

968
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:40,030
know have low mix or two wraps or just

969
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:43,579
you know don't provide good information

970
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:46,820
do you think this situation and they're

971
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:49,969
gonna get improved in the future in the

972
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:52,220
next few years the question la don't

973
00:46:49,969 --> 00:46:55,009
just ask is how we're going to adopt

974
00:46:52,219 --> 00:46:57,559
maybe in the future regarding currently

975
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:58,910
that most of a collection in the field

976
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:02,029
we only have a single tree

977
00:46:58,909 --> 00:47:05,358
representation so that's probably enough

978
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:07,640
for genomic genetic related study but

979
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:10,179
that is probably not enough for

980
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:13,819
additional kind of Physiology or other

981
00:47:10,179 --> 00:47:15,049
kind of study so we have any idea how

982
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:18,230
we're going to move forward in the

983
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:20,089
future regarding this actually that's

984
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:23,300
actually quite an extensive discussion

985
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:24,048
on the continuing basis for himself and

986
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:26,809
actually also

987
00:47:24,048 --> 00:47:29,989
for the entire college germplasm repoter

988
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:32,449
repository system we're facing a

989
00:47:29,989 --> 00:47:35,568
limitation on the resources and also on

990
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:38,119
the land also on the personnel so it's

991
00:47:35,568 --> 00:47:41,329
very difficult trying to have more than

992
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:43,068
one copy of the trees most of the people

993
00:47:41,329 --> 00:47:45,259
most of the repository actually have

994
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:47,449
more than one copy the reason we go is a

995
00:47:45,259 --> 00:47:50,358
single tree is because we do have a very

996
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:54,259
good bio preservation backup system

997
00:47:50,358 --> 00:47:56,630
right now about 95 percent of all the

998
00:47:54,259 --> 00:47:59,239
permanent collections we have in the

999
00:47:56,630 --> 00:48:01,519
collection actually we they are back up

1000
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:04,068
in the Cairo preservation that we'll

1001
00:48:01,518 --> 00:48:05,899
call in Colorado so that's what the

1002
00:48:04,068 --> 00:48:08,808
reason we go with a single tree

1003
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:11,479
representation I think moving forward

1004
00:48:08,809 --> 00:48:15,579
there's discussion trying to get some

1005
00:48:11,478 --> 00:48:20,268
funding support maybe trying to we have

1006
00:48:15,579 --> 00:48:23,719
Quaid maybe a new course election with a

1007
00:48:20,268 --> 00:48:25,758
better representation of the entire

1008
00:48:23,719 --> 00:48:28,880
diversity and also including some of the

1009
00:48:25,759 --> 00:48:32,059
more important with variety found risa

1010
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:34,429
in the last 20 in the last 30 years the

1011
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:37,359
core right now we have it's almost 30

1012
00:48:34,429 --> 00:48:39,769
years old so a lot of information

1013
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:42,949
different selection could be including

1014
00:48:39,768 --> 00:48:44,958
maybe this new court so if that's the

1015
00:48:42,949 --> 00:48:48,979
direction we're going with then

1016
00:48:44,958 --> 00:48:52,129
hopefully we can maybe have duplicate of

1017
00:48:48,978 --> 00:48:55,608
the new court maybe two or three of

1018
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:58,309
those duplication either planning in

1019
00:48:55,608 --> 00:49:00,938
Geneva additional signs in Eva or maybe

1020
00:48:58,309 --> 00:49:03,709
trying to work with other university

1021
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:06,288
such as the Washington State University

1022
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:08,778
and also maybe it was kearneysville West

1023
00:49:06,289 --> 00:49:10,939
Virginia they also have land over there

1024
00:49:08,778 --> 00:49:14,358
so we have a copy of the new core over

1025
00:49:10,938 --> 00:49:17,438
there so if we can do that then we can

1026
00:49:14,358 --> 00:49:20,058
probably at least minimize some of this

1027
00:49:17,438 --> 00:49:35,838
single representation issue for the

1028
00:49:20,059 --> 00:49:37,539
future and so tap into people's

1029
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:40,619
obsession over apples heaven

1030
00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:44,259
engaging the public and some of these

1031
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:47,079
recall it says I am project where they

1032
00:49:44,259 --> 00:49:49,418
could report to you any what they think

1033
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:53,789
is an ancient tree on their property for

1034
00:49:49,418 --> 00:49:56,438
a long railroad folds like Hill Road

1035
00:49:53,789 --> 00:49:57,459
connecting east to west or east asylum

1036
00:49:56,438 --> 00:49:58,868
because I've heard about this in

1037
00:49:57,458 --> 00:50:01,388
Washington that there was a nursery

1038
00:49:58,869 --> 00:50:03,338
where there was it's all a bunch of

1039
00:50:01,389 --> 00:50:05,108
ancient tree varieties and they

1040
00:50:03,338 --> 00:50:08,139
primarily collected it from abandoned

1041
00:50:05,108 --> 00:50:11,259
arms and railroad sites and so I

1042
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:13,028
wondered if you could engage them you

1043
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:16,179
know people around the United States to

1044
00:50:13,028 --> 00:50:18,518
give you the seeds or reports you were

1045
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:21,939
at either Lily Union right actually

1046
00:50:18,518 --> 00:50:24,958
there's a you're correct there's a lot

1047
00:50:21,938 --> 00:50:27,098
of public interests in the apple

1048
00:50:24,958 --> 00:50:29,138
specifically I'm something we call the

1049
00:50:27,099 --> 00:50:32,289
heirloom apple variety in the in North

1050
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:34,209
America actually I went to well the

1051
00:50:32,289 --> 00:50:37,959
first heirloom Apple meeting last year

1052
00:50:34,208 --> 00:50:40,688
in Maine so there's actually a different

1053
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:43,719
group especially very active group in in

1054
00:50:40,688 --> 00:50:45,338
Maine in Colorado in Washington there's

1055
00:50:43,719 --> 00:50:48,130
actually story just came up from

1056
00:50:45,338 --> 00:50:51,099
Washington stay about discovery of find

1057
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:54,189
new I heirloom Apple variety and also

1058
00:50:51,099 --> 00:50:56,979
we're working was a history professor

1059
00:50:54,188 --> 00:50:59,678
actually in Georgia he is working on

1060
00:50:56,978 --> 00:51:02,858
fifteen heirloom apple variety he kind

1061
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:05,439
of rediscover over there so yes we got

1062
00:51:02,858 --> 00:51:09,338
constant requests actually by the

1063
00:51:05,438 --> 00:51:12,428
heirloom folks but it's very hard

1064
00:51:09,338 --> 00:51:14,078
because we're limited space so the lot

1065
00:51:12,429 --> 00:51:16,509
of private actually institutions

1066
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:20,318
stepping in in this regard for example

1067
00:51:16,509 --> 00:51:22,329
the sea saver exchange in Iowa the

1068
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:24,608
currently their collection for heirloom

1069
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:27,278
Apple is only about four hundred four

1070
00:51:24,608 --> 00:51:30,219
hundred variety they actually plan to

1071
00:51:27,278 --> 00:51:32,829
increase their collection of a variety

1072
00:51:30,219 --> 00:51:36,398
up to fifteen hundred then there's a

1073
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:38,349
Southern heritage apple orchard in Oscar

1074
00:51:36,398 --> 00:51:41,918
aina your collection currently have

1075
00:51:38,349 --> 00:51:46,798
about 2,000 heirloom Apple variety and

1076
00:51:41,918 --> 00:51:46,798
the grouping Maine Maine Heritage

1077
00:51:46,829 --> 00:51:51,340
Foundation maybe they currently have a

1078
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:54,039
collection of a three

1079
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:56,559
400 heirloom apple variety and then

1080
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:59,469
there's more this going on in Colorado

1081
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:02,170
and Washington State and also actually

1082
00:51:59,469 --> 00:52:04,449
there's some interests I got phone call

1083
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:07,090
and contact from some of the folks from

1084
00:52:04,449 --> 00:52:10,210
New York actually just two weeks ago on

1085
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:12,250
West first Empire of New York and also

1086
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:14,440
founder pardon your people asking allow

1087
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:18,099
this question we're trying to help we're

1088
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:20,769
trying to engage we also live in what we

1089
00:52:18,099 --> 00:52:23,769
could do so that's a very challenge but

1090
00:52:20,769 --> 00:52:26,440
will help them for example if they want

1091
00:52:23,769 --> 00:52:28,300
to engage in genetic study so they need

1092
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:30,730
to stand the variety usually they will

1093
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:33,280
come to us will provide a sample for

1094
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:39,250
them to do comparison genetic study from

1095
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:42,400
sample we actually do also the hair

1096
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:44,739
heritage Apple group actually they are

1097
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:48,660
considering trying to come to Geneva for

1098
00:52:44,739 --> 00:52:52,149
their any meeting actually this year

1099
00:52:48,659 --> 00:52:55,920
they want me to chair the organization

1100
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:55,920
committee so we'll see how that goes

1101
00:52:56,579 --> 00:53:05,319
