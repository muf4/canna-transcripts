and Cornell Cooperative Extension my

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,800
name is Kathy Henrich and I'll be your

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,800
moderator for this

11
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,800
webinar just wanted to let you know that

12
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,159
today's speaker is Dr Mark pritz who's

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,759
professor and chair of the Department of

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,599
horticulture at Corno University and the

15
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:39,079
topic is nutrient management and

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,079
established

17
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,558
plantings

18
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:02,320
Marvin guess there's a delay in program

19
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,599
loading hang on and it should be up in

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,599
just a

21
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,478
second okay good afternoon everyone and

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,200
Welcome to our sixth webinar uh this

23
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:15,959
webinar is on interpreting foler

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,240
analysis and this gets a little bit

25
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,078
complicated and it's not something that

26
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,359
computers can you know we can develop

27
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:24,758
recommendations for very easily so what

28
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:26,599
we want to do today is uh walk you

29
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:28,719
through various ways of interpreting

30
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:30,438
soil analysis and give you a sense of

31
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,078
what you might want to look for when you

32
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:34,839
get these

33
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:38,199
results Just A Brief Review from last

34
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,079
time uh the time of lease sampling

35
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,399
varies slightly between the berry crops

36
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:45,359
but mostly it's uh Late July and early

37
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:47,359
August when you take the leaf samples

38
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,319
and send them in for

39
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:53,438
analysis uh in the last couple of weeks

40
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:55,599
I was able to find some data to show you

41
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,559
what happens to values of nutrient

42
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,359
concentrations of certain elements over

43
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,000
the growing season and this is old data

44
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,718
and an old slide but early on in the

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,078
season this is with Boron uh we found

46
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:09,359
that the levels start off pretty high

47
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:12,560
and then they drop during the season and

48
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,560
they stabilize somewhere after August uh

49
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,519
to a a level that's uh lower and more

50
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,239
stable for the rest of the

51
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:25,400
season and the same thing uh was true

52
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:28,000
for leaf zinc uh values start high they

53
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,239
go down and they stabilize later in the

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,680
later part of the season when we don't

55
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,640
have a lot of fruit being produced this

56
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,599
is up with strawberry so again that's

57
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,119
why we recommend at certain times of the

58
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:39,000
year we take the samples when we don't

59
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,439
have uh large changes in values from

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,439
week to

61
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,479
week there are standard Fuller nutrient

62
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:52,719
ranges for all the ber crops and these

63
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:54,359
are generally accepted uh no matter

64
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,039
where you're at they're pretty standard

65
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:00,480
across the board uh different climates

66
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:03,199
different soils uh that's makes it ni

67
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,199
for interpreting these things one thing

68
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,238
you'll notice when you compare

69
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,560
strawberries to raspberries is that

70
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:12,719
there's very little difference between

71
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,759
the two uh both are rosaceous plants the

72
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,919
accepted values are pretty much the same

73
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:19,439
for both of them so again it sort of

74
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:22,158
indicates that the plants are growing in

75
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,919
similar ways accumulating nutrients to a

76
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:26,199
similar amount and uh these are

77
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,759
indicative of healthy levels of plants

78
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:31,280
that are growing

79
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:32,719
normally blueberries are a little bit

80
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,120
different though if we compare those

81
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,400
with raspberries or strawberries the

82
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,840
critical values for blueberries are

83
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,000
usually quite a bit lower than they are

84
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,360
for strawberries and raspberries and one

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,080
of the things to keep in mind when

86
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,760
you're using a soil and leaf Testing Lab

87
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,640
that doesn't know much about blueberries

88
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:54,919
is they'll often use a standard that

89
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,518
would be appropriate for strawberries or

90
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:58,598
raspberries and and Truth me many other

91
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,200
crops have those similar ranges of

92
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:02,959
strawberries and raspberries for example

93
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:05,158
Alfalfa and they'll use those to base

94
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,000
the recommendations on but really they

95
00:04:05,158 --> 00:04:09,479
need to be adjusted downward quite a bit

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,280
for blueberries uh blueberries just have

97
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:14,438
a much lower nutrient requirement than

98
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,279
many other crops they grow more slowly

99
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:18,279
they don't require as much nutrient

100
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:21,358
critical levels in leaves are are much

101
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:25,758
lower in most cases so just keep that in

102
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:28,399
mind if you uh see you know giving

103
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,720
nutrient recommendations that don't seem

104
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,279
right uh it maybe that they're using the

105
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,759
wrong standard that hasn't been adjusted

106
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,959
for

107
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:40,120
blueberries there is one exception in

108
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:43,159
the the blueberry side of things and

109
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,399
that's with manganese and uh it's not

110
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,199
going to have much of an impact on your

111
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:49,239
interpretation except you might see high

112
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,840
manganes values in blueberries

113
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,680
occasionally and for other crops that

114
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,879
might signal a problem like oh maybe

115
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,000
manganese is becoming toxic but in

116
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:59,879
blueberries it's not a problem

117
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,918
blueberries have evolved uh tolerance to

118
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,759
high levels of Manganese they take that

119
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,079
manganese and they stick it into vacul

120
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,038
and isolate it from the rest of the

121
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:08,918
plant so when you grind that leaf and

122
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,120
analyze it you see lots of Manganese

123
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:13,879
there but really it's not hurting the

124
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,478
plant and blueberries evolved tolerance

125
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:19,159
for that uh for a couple of reasons one

126
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,199
is if you recall a few webinars ago we

127
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,000
looked at the

128
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:27,639
availability of Manganese when the pH

129
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,478
changes and at low pH levels manganese

130
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,519
levels tend to be higher so blueberries

131
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,879
grow in acid soils so we would expect

132
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:37,000
more maganese to be available but the

133
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,839
other thing that happens is uh

134
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,120
blueberries evolved in soils that tend

135
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:44,560
to flood frequently and in flooded soils

136
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:48,160
you don't have very much oxygen oxygen

137
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,759
diffuses very slowly in water log soils

138
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,400
and when oxygen isn't available you have

139
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:56,680
this these electrons moving around and

140
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,478
if the oxygen is not available to be an

141
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:02,240
acceptor for that electron that electron

142
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:05,680
has has to go somewhere so like the next

143
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:09,199
thing that it goes to is manganese and

144
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,519
there's a in the soil a lot of magnes is

145
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:15,000
available in the form of four pluses one

146
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:17,519
of the veence states but when you throw

147
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,319
electrons at it it converts to the

148
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:23,038
manganese 2 form that manganese 2 form

149
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,598
is the biologically active form so all

150
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:28,199
of a sudden uh in flooded soils you get

151
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:30,079
a lot of this maganese to form and it's

152
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:34,439
rapidly taken up by the plant and it's

153
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:36,198
biologically active and blueberries take

154
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:37,759
that and they put it in a vacu and

155
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,360
isolate it from the rest of the plant so

156
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,800
it doesn't become

157
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,479
toxic so just so you know if you see

158
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,800
that looks odd it's probably not going

159
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:48,639
to be a problem unless it gets really

160
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,439
really high inside the

161
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,560
plant

162
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:55,879
now the foler analysis will give you

163
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,240
values of leaf nutrients that just don't

164
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,960
show up in the soil test remember we

165
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,680
sort of discounted levels of Manganese

166
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:07,638
iron and zinc and copper and soil is not

167
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,840
being very meaningful uh but the

168
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:13,000
probability of being

169
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:15,159
deficient uh is varies it's not the same

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,319
for all the nutrients some nutrients

171
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,199
you're more likely to see uh deficient

172
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:23,960
than

173
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:27,720
others so uh nitrogen uh we rarely see

174
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:30,799
it low uh most Growers fertilize fairly

175
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,000
well with nitrogen and in fact we often

176
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,598
see it above the critical value that we

177
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,560
need so Growers put on nitrogen often

178
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:39,279
times more than they really need and

179
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,639
leaf analysis comes back showing us a

180
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:46,198
little bit of High We R rarely see it

181
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,598
low same way with phosphorus and our

182
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,639
soils particularly in the Northeast

183
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:51,598
where there have been lots of dairy

184
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,199
farms in the past and people have used

185
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,279
manure to fertilize Fields phosphorous

186
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:58,520
levels are generally pretty high and we

187
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:00,439
rarely see it uh below the critical

188
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,158
value

189
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,478
potassium we sometimes see low on

190
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:07,120
lighter

191
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:10,199
soils excuse me calcium sometimes see it

192
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,840
low uh but not a real probability of it

193
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,919
happening a lot particularly if the pH

194
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:18,279
is within the appropriate range

195
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:21,240
magnesium that'll sometimes uh show up

196
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:24,399
as deficient particularly in blueberry

197
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,360
Fields manganese will show up as

198
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,560
deficient uh somewhat frequently

199
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,199
particularly in fields that were once

200
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,000
wet and then we're Dr drain for some

201
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,839
reason there's just not a lot of

202
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,879
manganese in those

203
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:41,959
soils iron um it's low um Iron is a very

204
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:44,080
very common element in the soil it's

205
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:46,000
rarely that there's insufficient iron in

206
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,399
the soil usually if you see iron

207
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,639
deficiency it's generally a problem with

208
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:55,639
ph Boron though is an element that is

209
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:58,159
frequently low in the Northeast in fact

210
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:00,159
the Atlantic Coastal Plain soils tend to

211
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,919
be very low in boron it's one of the

212
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,919
areas of the world where Boron tends to

213
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,559
be deficient um parts of Ontario and

214
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,719
Canada also

215
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,759
deficient it's probably the one we see

216
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,600
most commonly deficient in leaf analysis

217
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:15,159
is

218
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,959
boron excuse me uh zinc uh and when

219
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:22,519
phosis is high sometimes zinc is

220
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:24,000
low and in Copper you see it um low

221
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:26,480
sometimes deficient is particularly in

222
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,600
soils that are high or organic

223
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,519
matter there's a question about aluminum

224
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,040
aluminum is really sporadic um around

225
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:39,440
and so

226
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:42,679
it's toxicity U can be high in low PH

227
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,560
soils uh generally if the pH is within a

228
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:45,799
normal range we don't see aluminum

229
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,719
toxicity even if there's a lot of

230
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:50,000
aluminum in the soil where we tend to

231
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,800
see aluminum be a problem is when we

232
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,879
lower the pH for blueberries and we

233
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:57,879
release less of aluminum sometimes then

234
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:57,879
we'll see that becoming toxic

235
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,039
foler tests are really useful for

236
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:07,519
adjusting the fertility program uh but

237
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:11,159
only when plants are healthy and the

238
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,480
soil pH is adequate the foler test

239
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:15,360
doesn't really do much good if there's a

240
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,200
disease in the soil or the plants aren't

241
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,360
growing well it's a really good way to

242
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,879
fine-tune the fertility program but not

243
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,320
really make use that as a sole guide for

244
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:25,519
wholesale

245
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,079
adjustments we use a Fuller analysis we

246
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,919
want to make sure that the soil is

247
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,799
generally adequate in nutrients

248
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:34,199
the plants are growing well then it's

249
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:36,240
really good for making adjustments but

250
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,639
if you just have a soil analysis alone

251
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,360
it often doesn't give you enough

252
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:42,360
information to develop a recommendation

253
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:49,320
from what I do whenever I look at the uh

254
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,800
Fuller test results I go through a

255
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:55,600
series of about five or six

256
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:57,679
steps that um one after the other to

257
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,120
help with that and the first thing I do

258
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:03,000
is I want to ensure that the soil pH is

259
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,078
within the correct range if it's not

260
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,440
that'll throw off the Fuller testing

261
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:09,199
value so if you just looked at the soil

262
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,519
test you might say well I have to add

263
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,320
four or five nutrients to the soil

264
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,839
because my leaves show me deficient but

265
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,079
really a simple adjustment in PH might

266
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,920
correct those problems so you you want

267
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:23,120
to make sure the soil pH is right before

268
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:25,199
you jump to conclusions about what is

269
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,679
lacking in the

270
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,120
soil the other thing is make sure that

271
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:33,239
uh there's nothing else that could be

272
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,600
limiting the plant growth if you have

273
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,560
diseases in the soil or or something

274
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,600
eating the roots or something's just not

275
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:42,078
right uh the full a test isn't really

276
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,759
going to be that useful in helping to

277
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,120
diagnose the problem or making

278
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,278
Corrections plants have to be growing

279
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,078
relatively healthily uh for the Fuller

280
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:52,320
test to be

281
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:55,159
meaningful the third thing I do

282
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,839
particularly since uh we live along the

283
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:58,958
Atlantic coast and the soils tend to be

284
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:01,800
low on Boron is to check the status of

285
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,799
boron Boron we talked a couple webinars

286
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:06,000
ago about how Boron is essential for

287
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:08,120
root growth and root elongation so if

288
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,839
you have low Boron and your roots aren't

289
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,240
growing that means you can't take the

290
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,639
plant can't take up other nutrients so

291
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,600
the boron has to be adequate for the

292
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:21,320
other nutrients to be um taken up so

293
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,839
that's the third thing I

294
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,399
check then if all those things check out

295
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,360
then I'll look at the specific nutrients

296
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:31,759
in the leaf analysis and see if they

297
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,120
might be

298
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:36,240
deficient sort of the last thing I'll do

299
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,159
is there's a few interactions that you

300
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,959
might want to might check out to make

301
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,120
sure that things are in are in balance

302
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,799
and we'll talk about what some of those

303
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,480
are in a second but they can exacerbate

304
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,240
low nutrient levels and again this gets

305
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,560
a little bit complex at this point this

306
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,759
is why sometimes just looking over it

307
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:55,159
yourself is better than having some

308
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:56,919
computer plow through it and try to

309
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:58,360
tease these apart I'll give you some

310
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:01,120
examples in a minute where we can look

311
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,120
at that

312
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,360
we're going to cover three scenarios one

313
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,879
is when the leaf test and the soil tests

314
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,879
sort of tell you the same story and

315
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,559
that's good we'll look at a situation or

316
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:16,000
two where soil tests are low for

317
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:17,799
nutrient yet the leaf analysis is normal

318
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,198
how can that be what's going on there

319
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:22,278
well we'll talk about that and

320
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:25,000
conversely when the soil test is high

321
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:26,919
for a nutrient yet the leaf test is low

322
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,679
what's going on how can that be we'll

323
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:32,000
talk about some of the situations

324
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,439
so I've got 12 scenarios I want to go

325
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,919
through and most of these are based on

326
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:40,440
real soil and leaf analysis

327
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:43,519
tests so this is the first example

328
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,600
strawberries uh good growth and yield

329
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,440
and we want to look down here and uh we

330
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,920
have a soil test uh things look pretty

331
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,120
good in the soil Boron is adequate pH is

332
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,919
good organic matter is good Leaf

333
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,440
analysis is

334
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,278
normal it kind of tells you that hey

335
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,959
what you've been doing is working

336
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:03,919
everything looks appropriate and good

337
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:06,119
the plants are growing well so you're

338
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:08,719
fine just keep up what you've been doing

339
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,039
everything should be fine so this is

340
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,199
what we like to

341
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:18,278
see no problems everything looks

342
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:20,078
good uh go to a second example these are

343
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:21,799
blueberries and again we'll just look at

344
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:26,039
the leaf analysis here and see what's

345
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:26,838
going on here and we see normal npn K

346
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:29,559
high

347
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:32,079
calcium normal magnesium

348
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:34,000
but then we we see low maganese iron

349
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:37,359
copper and

350
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,120
zinc and when you see these four in

351
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,519
particular low that's a pretty good

352
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,198
indication that it's not that they're

353
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:46,799
low in the soil it's that they're in the

354
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:50,599
soil they just can't be taken up by the

355
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:53,000
plant because the pH isn't

356
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,600
right and if you look at the pH here

357
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,278
it's a little bit too high in

358
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:00,240
blueberries we need to lower that pH and

359
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:02,078
by lowering that pH it it'll basically

360
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,519
automatically increase the values of

361
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:06,519
zinc copper iron and manganese just

362
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:08,879
automatically because the availability

363
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:11,600
will suddenly go up and these levels of

364
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,480
leaf uh nutrients should go up as well

365
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,000
so don't be tricked don't think well

366
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,519
I've got to go out and find some source

367
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,879
of Manganese and iron and copper and

368
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:21,159
zinc to add to the blueberry planting

369
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,559
check pH almost guaranteed it's going to

370
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:23,559
be too

371
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,399
high strawberries

372
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:34,078
tyoga soil River Bottom soil this is an

373
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:38,360
actual Leaf analysis and when we look at

374
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:40,239
that normal values VP K uh everything

375
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,800
else is normal but we see low calcium

376
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,680
and magnesium H well what might be going

377
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:49,479
on here do we need to add calcium and

378
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:51,799
magnesium well sort of U but this is a

379
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,399
pretty good indication that the pH is

380
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:57,318
too

381
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:59,078
low so in this case we want to add

382
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:01,559
probably lime and probably high

383
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:03,758
magnesium lime that'll increase the ph

384
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:06,119
and also increase the plant's ability to

385
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,919
take up calcium magnesium but a pretty

386
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,959
good clue if you just saw the leaf

387
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:11,639
analysis alone that when calcium and

388
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:15,399
magnesium are low that's probably an

389
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,399
indication that the pH is too low as

390
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,480
well uh question came up is sulfur part

391
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:26,838
of a normal Leaf analysis no it is not

392
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:29,120
there's a separate test is required for

393
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:31,120
nitrogen and then a separate test test

394
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,919
that does all the other nutrients except

395
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,240
for sulfur uh the nitrogen test is

396
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,078
fairly expensive uh you got to have it

397
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,198
those since it's so critical the other

398
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:41,439
nutrient test is fairly expensive you

399
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:44,559
put them together it's going to cost you

400
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,199
about 30 bucks if you want to do sulfur

401
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,719
it's going to cost about another 15

402
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:50,639
bucks it's probably not worth it uh

403
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,560
because sulfur and nitrogen track very

404
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,600
closely together so most of the time we

405
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,679
don't do sulfur analysis particularly

406
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,040
because it's rarely ever defici

407
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,758
there's lots of sulfur around there's

408
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,599
lots of sulfates around sulfur is coming

409
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,400
down in the rain it's in most of the

410
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:08,719
soils it's in fertilizers that we apply

411
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,600
so it's just something it's just not

412
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,600
worth testing for for the most

413
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,439
part okay take another look here we got

414
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:24,400
blueberries we've got low

415
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:27,000
nitrogen in the leaves um soils look

416
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,280
pretty good nothing really low here

417
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,119
borons medium pH is

418
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:35,240
kind of on the high side for blueberries

419
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:39,678
not too high uh everything's normal but

420
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,679
we have some low iron and copper and

421
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:48,359
zinc the primary cause for the low

422
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,400
nitrogen might not again be we have to

423
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:54,839
go out and add nitrogen but in this case

424
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,720
here this a very weedy field and we have

425
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:59,240
lots of weeds that can suck nitrogen out

426
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,519
of the soil and give us a low Leaf value

427
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,319
now the grower probably doesn't have to

428
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:05,200
do anything different in terms of the

429
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:06,798
nitrogen management just manage the

430
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,319
weeds better and that nitrogen level

431
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:11,319
should go up the pH probably should go

432
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:13,879
down just a little bit and when the pH

433
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:16,759
goes down that'll increase the zinc and

434
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,880
the copper and the iron so looking at

435
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:22,279
this whole picture two things lower the

436
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,720
ph and manage the weeds a little bit

437
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:27,519
better and that's really pretty uh

438
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,679
simple thing to do and that'll mostly

439
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:31,679
most likely bring everything back into

440
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:41,119
balance okay example five raspberries

441
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,960
kinesia soil poor

442
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,959
growth go back to soil

443
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:50,639
test a few things are low here um

444
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,159
calcium magnesium

445
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,759
medium pH is okay organic matter is good

446
00:18:54,159 --> 00:19:00,960
Leaf analysis everything looks

447
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:03,640
fine um but the plants aren't growing

448
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,319
well what do we conclude from

449
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,919
this well we conclude that whatever is

450
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:12,240
wrong with that planting causing a poor

451
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:14,400
growth probably isn't

452
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,480
nutritional so we look for something

453
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,600
else so again this is a case where the

454
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,159
leaf and soil analyses don't really tell

455
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:23,079
us much about what's going on with that

456
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:24,640
plant we've got to correct the other

457
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:27,240
factor that might be limiting growth

458
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,720
before the soil and leaf analysis tell

459
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,720
us any valuable information

460
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:38,799
okay let's look at some

461
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,159
strawberries uh a soil here and um we

462
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,319
look at the

463
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:45,640
soil everything's looking good

464
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:47,399
everything's fairly High am out um

465
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,159
boron's that's sort of like the

466
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,919
threshold for Boron pH is good organic

467
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:55,080
matter is pretty

468
00:19:51,919 --> 00:20:00,038
good see what might be going on

469
00:19:55,079 --> 00:20:00,038
here this let me turn this off

470
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:08,200
the here uh the leaf analysis is fine

471
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,720
but the plants still aren't healthy but

472
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:14,960
when we look at the field we can see

473
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,880
that the plants have black root Rod or

474
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,960
some Weevil or something like that

475
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,240
eating the the roots of the plant so

476
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,279
again this is a situation where the soil

477
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,279
test looks fine the leaf analysis looks

478
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:28,798
fine but it doesn't tell us what's going

479
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:31,879
on what happens most of the time when

480
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:35,480
plants are compromised with disease they

481
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:38,120
don't grow very much so the leaf values

482
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,798
generally are Norm more high in plants

483
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:43,399
that are diseased because they just

484
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:45,400
aren't growing so it's not difficult for

485
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,679
the plant to accumulate the nutrients it

486
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,080
needs but that doesn't tell you what's

487
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,480
wrong with the

488
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:54,519
plant that's why you have to look at

489
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,759
both the foler analysis soil test and

490
00:20:54,519 --> 00:21:00,519
the health of the planning because

491
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:03,240
unhealthy plants almost all always have

492
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:07,679
good folar nutrient levels when there's

493
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,679
something else that's causing the poor

494
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,320
growth okay let's take a another example

495
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:22,720
here we've got medium levels of

496
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,720
phosphorus and potassium in the

497
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,640
soil PH a little bit low organic matter

498
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:31,720
is good what might be going on

499
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,320
here well let's look at the leaf

500
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:38,240
analysis and see if it gives us a

501
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:42,319
hint this is an actual test uh that we

502
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,200
got from soil and leaf and here Boron is

503
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,839
a little bit below the threshold before

504
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,640
we like to see it and the leaf Boron is

505
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:51,720
low and you can see that reflected over

506
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,880
here in the foler test results it's sort

507
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,200
of at the low end and because we don't

508
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,799
have Boron we don't have good root

509
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,679
growth often times that leads to low

510
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,200
levels of some of these other nutrients

511
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:04,360
that require good root growth to be

512
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,840
taken up at high

513
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:10,519
levels so in this case here the

514
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:13,839
recommendation should probably say uh

515
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:16,720
raise the ph a little bit and certainly

516
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:20,639
apply some Boron because that's what we

517
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,640
need to do in order to make this

518
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,120
correction okay example 8

519
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:34,278
here we have high levels of phosphorus

520
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:36,678
potassium calcium

521
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:39,319
magnesium and again based on that last

522
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:42,360
example you'll say oh boron's low and

523
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:43,918
yeah it is low here the pH is fine

524
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:46,359
organic matter is fine let's look and

525
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,440
see how that affected the leaf

526
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:51,639
analysis remember look up it's a well-

527
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,640
drained soil in a dry

528
00:22:54,558 --> 00:23:00,240
year what the leaf analysis shows in

529
00:22:57,558 --> 00:23:02,879
this case is that even though we have

530
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,278
high potassium and high

531
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,240
calcium the levels in the leaf are low

532
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:09,558
so high levels in the soil but low

533
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,798
levels in the

534
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:16,480
leaf why is that well uh probably a

535
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:18,240
couple of reasons one is boron is low

536
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,000
and we have low Boron we have poor root

537
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,519
growth we don't often have the uptake

538
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,079
that we would expect and secondly it was

539
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:26,720
a very dry year and a lot of these

540
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:29,119
nutrients particularly

541
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,600
calcium and potassium some extent get

542
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,558
taken up by mass flow so they get

543
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,599
dissolved in the water when the plant

544
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:37,440
transpires the water moves into the

545
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:40,240
plant and brings along the dissolve

546
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,759
nutrient in that water stream when we

547
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,839
don't have water when it's dry that just

548
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:46,400
doesn't happen so we end up with low

549
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:49,439
levels

550
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,480
so it's possible in many cases to have

551
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,400
high soil test values but low Leaf

552
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,159
values and usually it's because of low

553
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Boron or inadequate water or sometimes

554
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,360
both

555
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,120
nitrogen is low in this case uh again we

556
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:08,479
don't test for that in the soil but here

557
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:12,079
they might be uh a need for an increased

558
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,079
level of nitrogen fertilizer in this

559
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,559
situation what impact would pore

560
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:26,200
drainage have on foler values uh what

561
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:28,918
that often does is uh poor drainage

562
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,759
sometimes increases the level

563
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:33,679
of the the copper and the zinc and the

564
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,599
manganese we talked earlier with the

565
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,200
example of blueberries how you have

566
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:40,439
water loged soils manganese levels go

567
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,640
way up almost to toxic levels and that's

568
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,480
one of the first things you see happen

569
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,240
in a planning where you have water log

570
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,679
soils or po dranes manganes levels get

571
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:53,120
really high that's one of the first

572
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:55,720
signs but otherwise uh sometimes you

573
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:57,678
know it stops the plant from growing uh

574
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,200
because the soils are water logged and

575
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:03,679
the leaf nutrients levels can come to

576
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,319
normal within normal range uh and you

577
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,559
look at it you say well I don't really

578
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:11,439
see anything wrong here the leaf levels

579
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:14,119
look normal but the plant's not growing

580
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,200
because the soil's water log that's why

581
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:17,879
I'm uh saying you have to look at the

582
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,919
big picture and not just look at the

583
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,039
foler analysis because that can be

584
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,240
normal when you have these other impacts

585
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:24,240
going

586
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:32,519
on okay let's look at uh another example

587
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:35,558
here raspberries kinesia soil very heavy

588
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:36,798
crop load exceptionally heavy crop load

589
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:39,678
of the summer

590
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:43,319
raspberries soil looks

591
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:45,600
fine everything's High Boron is

592
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:49,480
adequate critical value is around one

593
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:51,119
pound per acre uh pH is perfect organic

594
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,278
matter is

595
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:57,479
high we do a leaf

596
00:25:54,278 --> 00:26:00,640
analysis everything's good except a

597
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:03,919
potassium is showing up as low so why is

598
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,278
pottassium low when the soil values are

599
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:10,640
high and this is reflected over here in

600
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:11,720
the leaf analysis again actual test but

601
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,840
if you

602
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,000
recall fruiting takes a lot of potassium

603
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:18,359
from the plant in years where you have

604
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,720
heavy heavy fruit

605
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:24,759
load and you test for folar nutrients

606
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:27,159
shortly after Fring you'll often see low

607
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:29,879
levels of potassium it doesn't mean you

608
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:31,960
have to add potassium fertilizer it just

609
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,679
means that you got to give the plant

610
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:37,000
time to recover and build back those

611
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,120
potassium levels so in this case here

612
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
probably the best thing to grower could

613
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:41,839
do is just ensure that there's adequate

614
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,480
moisture in the soil so that the

615
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:45,038
potassium levels can recover because it

616
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,120
looks like there's plenty in the soil to

617
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:49,038
be taken up the plant just needs time to

618
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:51,519
do that because it just went through a

619
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:54,440
really heavy uh cropping

620
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:57,200
load again a reason to understand the

621
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,240
big picture the cropping history uh

622
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,159
what's going on physically to the plant

623
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,720
as well as just look at the soil and

624
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:03,720
foler

625
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:14,319
test okay uh 10th example here's

626
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:16,678
strawberries they're exhibiting poor

627
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:18,599
growth but you look around you just

628
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:21,919
can't find any disease you can't find

629
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:23,199
any insect problems but the plants are

630
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:27,120
growing

631
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,240
poorly you look at a soil test you know

632
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:32,519
these are values are high high magnesium

633
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:35,640
is medium plenty of boron in the soil pH

634
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:39,119
is Right On Target organic matter is

635
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:41,320
reasonable um what's going on here why

636
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:44,398
do we have poor

637
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:47,519
growth uh we look at a fuller test and

638
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:49,359
we see you know some things are low

639
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,399
magnesium is low even though the soil

640
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:52,839
levels look adequate we have low iron

641
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:56,398
low

642
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:59,199
copper low zinc why do we have these low

643
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:01,558
values when the soil t show that most

644
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,558
things are

645
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:08,559
adequate well this is an example where

646
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:12,359
sometimes the soil nutrients can be too

647
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:14,440
high in this case um phosphorus is high

648
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:16,599
maybe from you know using too much manur

649
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,440
or too much phosphorous fertilizer in a

650
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:21,798
previous crop or in a previous year when

651
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,038
we have high levels of phosphorus in

652
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:26,079
particular phosphorus interacts with a

653
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:28,558
lot of these micronutrients and ties

654
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:30,000
them up it forms precipitates before

655
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,359
they even get in the plant there's even

656
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,880
evidence that inside the plant that

657
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:36,319
phosphorus can interact with nutrients

658
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,240
these micronutrients even after they get

659
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:41,319
into the plant uh phospher zinc is one

660
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,919
that's commonly written about in the

661
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:46,038
literature phosphorus is known to

662
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,640
interfere with iron uptake and copper

663
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:50,519
uptake

664
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,159
so more than likely in this situation

665
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:54,519
here this the high phosphorus is

666
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,039
actually causing problems and causing

667
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:59,319
low levels of these other nutrients

668
00:28:56,038 --> 00:29:00,440
because of the interaction

669
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:02,119
these are some of the things you have

670
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,440
just kind of have to learn to watch out

671
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:06,839
for because the foler uh testing

672
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,640
recommendations that come back from a

673
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:11,278
lab aren't going to be able to give you

674
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,278
this level of

675
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:20,759
detail another negative interaction that

676
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,960
you often see is U real high calcium can

677
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,599
interfere with iron and this is

678
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,240
especially true in blueberries now this

679
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:28,319
example is strawberries but we talked

680
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,558
about this before that particular

681
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:33,038
blueberries high calcium is uh really

682
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:36,240
bad for blueberries it really does

683
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:40,359
interfere with iron not so much iron

684
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:42,359
uptake but the iron um when there's high

685
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:44,519
calcium on the iron is in the feric form

686
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:47,000
which is in the inactive form of iron in

687
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:50,319
plants as opposed to the feric plus two

688
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,200
form that's the active form so that's a

689
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:55,439
interaction that happens with the

690
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:58,159
veilance of the iron and it affects the

691
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,919
activity of the iron in the plant

692
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,519
but the phosphorus and the calcium are

693
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,200
the two you have to watch out for when

694
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,159
they come out at high levels uh that

695
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,240
could spell trouble for the

696
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:09,640
micronutrients so again soil tests are

697
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,359
important to make sure we don't exceed

698
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,919
the level of phosphorus and exceed the

699
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:17,038
level of calcium uh so we don't induce

700
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,038
these deficiencies later

701
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:24,719
on okay we're getting close to end here

702
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:26,959
uh blueberries poor growth okay here we

703
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,519
have both the soil test and the leaf

704
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,120
analysis results

705
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:35,399
looking through

706
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:35,398
here seeing what's going on

707
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:45,558
uh again uh this is one of those uh

708
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:49,558
interaction kind of things that we see

709
00:30:45,558 --> 00:30:53,639
that in this case blueberries had poor

710
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:55,839
growth magnesium is low the leaves are

711
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,360
showing typical magnesium deficiency

712
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:01,079
symptoms but we really want to expect to

713
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:04,199
see that from the soil test because the

714
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:07,119
levels in the soil are

715
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,759
medium but we're seeing magnesium

716
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:12,798
deficiency and the reason for that is

717
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:16,000
that there are other nutrients that

718
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:19,480
basically compete with magnesium in the

719
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,798
plant and some of those are potassium

720
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,319
calcium and zinc to some extent

721
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:28,038
manganese will do it too because they

722
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:31,278
all have this you know calcium uh

723
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:33,720
manganese and zinc are plus two so they

724
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:36,200
will compete for bonding sites with the

725
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:40,679
Magnesium so this is a little bit more

726
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:44,038
subtle but again High values of certain

727
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:47,440
Leaf nutrients can suppress others and

728
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:49,038
in this case here it's what's going on

729
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,320
explains why we're seeing magnesium

730
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:53,960
deficiency in a leaf when there is

731
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:55,439
adequate magnesium in the soil too much

732
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,200
of other

733
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,320
things again it's subtle and it's not

734
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,639
really picked up with a recommendation

735
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,839
so you kind of have to watch out for

736
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:03,839
that

737
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:11,558
yourself and this is the last example I

738
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:13,879
wanted to review with you blueberries

739
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:16,440
very poor growth but again you look out

740
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:20,799
there there's just no disease what is

741
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:22,360
going on here uh soil test everything

742
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:26,440
looks pretty good everything is medium

743
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:28,918
or high Boron is adequate pH is adequate

744
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,840
organic matter is good

745
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:34,919
folar levels are normal or high for

746
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:38,319
everything you just no disease what's

747
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:40,720
going on how can you explain that well

748
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:42,119
when I see something like this that just

749
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,000
you know I can't figure out what's going

750
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:47,918
on with the nutrients I see I'll

751
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,558
sometimes go back and ask to look at

752
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,080
this complete soil test and the complete

753
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:55,798
foler analysis to look at all the

754
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:57,960
elements that are being reported uh so

755
00:32:55,798 --> 00:32:59,398
I'm sorry the report you get shows you

756
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,480
essential nutrients but it doesn't show

757
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:03,278
you all of them and a question came up

758
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,240
earlier about aluminum like it doesn't

759
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:09,398
show a standard aluminum levels in

760
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,359
leaves or even soil in many tests but if

761
00:33:09,398 --> 00:33:14,278
you ask for it often times the original

762
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:16,759
analysis has that number it's just not

763
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:19,159
reported on the report and you can go

764
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:20,919
back and look and see oh maybe aluminum

765
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:23,679
is present at really high levels and

766
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:26,240
it's actually causing a

767
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:29,440
toxicity so that's one thing you want to

768
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,319
look for sodium not so much in the

769
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,080
northeast or the Midwest but as you go

770
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:35,119
out further west you might want to look

771
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:38,480
at sodium levels again it's not standard

772
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:41,239
on a report but too much sodium can

773
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,399
raise Havoc with folar nutrient levels

774
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,519
and compete with sodium and cause all

775
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:47,879
sorts of problems and the same way with

776
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:52,000
soluble salts too much fertilizer too

777
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,679
much salt um can cause toxic problems in

778
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,278
the plant even though it doesn't reflect

779
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,278
it in the leaf nutrient values

780
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,319
so those are some of the examples you

781
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:07,000
might see and hopefully that is a a way

782
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:09,039
to help you interpret these foler

783
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,838
analysis that you get uh you can't

784
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:12,398
always rely on what the computer says it

785
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:14,838
doesn't go into the level of detail of

786
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:17,559
looking at interactions most foler

787
00:34:14,838 --> 00:34:19,719
analyses don't tie back in with soil

788
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:22,078
tests so I can look at them both

789
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:25,439
simultaneously one of our goals at Coral

790
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:28,079
over the long run is to uh integrate the

791
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,039
soil tests with the leaf analysis and

792
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:33,200
include recommendations look at them you

793
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,519
get one recommendation based on both the

794
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,838
soil and leaf analysis and then can

795
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:38,759
account for some of these interactions

796
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:40,440
we talked about right now we don't have

797
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,359
that I don't know if anybody who does

798
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,039
that uh you kind of have to do that with

799
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:47,319
your own human brain and perform those

800
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,159
analyses and adjust the recommendations

801
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,320
that

802
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:54,358
way a question uh so soil compaction

803
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:58,320
have the same impact on foler values as

804
00:34:54,358 --> 00:35:02,159
poor drainage uh not exactly compaction

805
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,920
doesn't alter the um amount of oxygen in

806
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:06,279
the soil as much as you might think I

807
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,400
mean it reduces it some but when you wet

808
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,720
it it really pushes the oxygen out of

809
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,160
the soil so you don't have that same

810
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:14,399
response with accumulating high levels

811
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:17,358
of magnes and stuff with compaction just

812
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,480
get poor root growth with in compacted

813
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:22,799
soils you know it's hard to predict what

814
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:26,358
you're going to get uh one outcome is

815
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,280
it's just poor growth but the plants

816
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:31,159
have adequate nutrients given their

817
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:34,240
small size uh and other as you'll see

818
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:36,078
deficiencies in certain nutrients um and

819
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:37,639
not others it's really hard to predict

820
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,920
specifically what the impact of

821
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:42,559
compaction would be I haven't seen any

822
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,880
consistent effect on folar nutrients

823
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:45,880
Alone by looking at

824
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,440
compaction the last uh PR principle that

825
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,800
I want to share with you is something

826
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:57,358
called the steam Burge

827
00:35:53,800 --> 00:36:00,440
effect and this happens at low levels of

828
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:02,639
new nutrient and think about a situation

829
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,920
where you have a plant that has adequate

830
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,838
nutrients of everything except for one

831
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,800
nutrient let's just pick one at random

832
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:11,599
say say magnesium so very low levels of

833
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,480
magnesium and that's limiting growth

834
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:17,519
plants aren't growing well magnesium is

835
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:19,760
low so we start to add magnesium to the

836
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:23,358
plant or to the soil and the plant

837
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,079
starts to grow and we can see growth

838
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:28,598
increases as we add more and more

839
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:30,920
nutrient when the plant starts to grow

840
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:33,640
we often get what's called a dilution

841
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:36,240
effect and a plant grows so fast because

842
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:39,559
now all of a sudden it has magnesium

843
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:42,159
that foler levels actually drop even

844
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:45,199
though we're adding more nutrient to the

845
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:47,598
soil or to the plant the fer

846
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:49,559
concentrations drop that's because we're

847
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,240
stimulating growth so much and the

848
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:54,039
plants are growing faster than the rate

849
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:56,118
of uptake because that nutrient was

850
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:58,039
limiting before now it's not so limiting

851
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:00,240
the plants are really growing fast

852
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:03,159
so it sort of reverses and the levels

853
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,719
actually drop then uh you'll get to the

854
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:06,559
point where they start to behave

855
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:09,039
normally you go through the critical

856
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:10,639
concentration you reach a point where

857
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:12,599
not much happens as you add more and

858
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:15,480
more and more and as you get out a real

859
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:17,079
high end you get to be at the toxic

860
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,039
range where growth actually starts to

861
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:22,839
drop off again too much but this place

862
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:25,440
right in here is an interesting place to

863
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:27,559
be and we sometimes see this when values

864
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,800
are really really low we make a

865
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:32,639
recommendation a grower will add uh what

866
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,960
we tell them to do they come back to

867
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:37,039
next year and say and test again say hey

868
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,400
my foler values actually fell after I

869
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:40,880
did what you told me to do I don't know

870
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,480
trust you you know what you're talking

871
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,760
about well what's going on is you say

872
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,719
well how happened to growth well the

873
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,560
plants grew really well well that's what

874
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:50,480
happened the plants grew well diluted

875
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:52,920
out the levels of nutrient and again

876
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,719
until we're uh at a point where the

877
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,519
plants are looking good and growing well

878
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:59,639
and the yields are good that's why these

879
00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:01,000
foler uh tests are better for these

880
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:03,480
fine-tuned adjustments than these

881
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,480
wholesale

882
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,119
changes so that's summarize what we've

883
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:12,078
talked about so test results don't

884
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:13,680
always correlate with foler test results

885
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,880
and we talked about a variety of reasons

886
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:17,679
why that might

887
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,680
be fer tests aren't really meaningful

888
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:21,519
for fertility guidelines unless the soil

889
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:22,960
pH is within the correct range and I

890
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:26,159
think by now you should understand why

891
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,920
that is fer tests are useful for

892
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:30,639
diagnosis but for detailed guidance

893
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,280
unless growth and yield are

894
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:34,719
good so when growth and yield are good

895
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,720
the Fuller test are really good for

896
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:38,159
detailed

897
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:40,480
guidance um and they're sometimes good

898
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:43,399
for diagnosis but there's major things

899
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,599
wrong besides nutrition the Fuller tests

900
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,838
aren't going to be that

901
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:49,200
helpful and as we just mentioned with

902
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:50,960
this steenberg effect applying nutrients

903
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,239
may result in a decrease in foler

904
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,599
concentrations under certain

905
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:57,838
circumstances so don't be thrown off if

906
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,160
applying a nutrient gives you a a lower

907
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:01,559
foler value the following year that's

908
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:04,039
probably a good thing because the plants

909
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:04,039
are growing

910
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:12,239
more and correcting deficiencies or

911
00:39:10,358 --> 00:39:14,960
imbalances in these established

912
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:17,399
plantings based on the foler test is

913
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,838
going to be more difficult than amending

914
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,680
soils prior to

915
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:23,440
planning and that's going to be the

916
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:25,078
subject of the next webinar that we have

917
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,240
cuz it's going to be a lot trickier when

918
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:27,760
the plants are in the ground and they

919
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:29,479
have roots and you can't mix things in

920
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,280
with the soil after the plants are

921
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,838
already established and we have to start

922
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:37,160
reverting to uh foler sprays and uh

923
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:40,279
certain nutrients that are more

924
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:42,838
soluble so that's all I have for today's

925
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,440
subject I know was a lot and it's

926
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:47,279
somewhat detailed you can always go back

927
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:49,800
and uh review the webinar and go through

928
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,839
those examples but uh we want to stop

929
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,480
and not overwhelm you with a lot of uh

930
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:55,000
ways to correct that today we'll save

931
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,519
that for the next

932
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,079
webinar so at this point uh we'll see if

933
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:02,559
anybody has any questions they' like to

934
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:04,519
type into the box and uh uh it was Bob

935
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:06,039
trit mentioned that Eric Hansen received

936
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:08,079
a distinguished service award by the

937
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:10,159
Michigan State Hort Society at last

938
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,680
week's Expo that's really great Eric

939
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:15,480
congratulations on that and Eric will be

940
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:18,078
next uh webinar speaker so we're glad to

941
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,800
have him involved in this

942
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,960
series so questions go ahead and type

943
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,960
those in

944
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:47,239
I don't think it's coming it's not

945
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,240
coming through

946
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,159
while we're waiting for any questions I

947
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:14,480
just wanted to say some of you have not

948
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:16,759
yet sent me the demographics

949
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,519
questionnaire and the educator preest

950
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:23,640
please download those and send them in

951
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:23,639
and we'd really appreciate that thanks

952
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:55,719
yeah so um Mark made a comment that it's

953
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:58,239
frustrating sometimes when people send

954
00:41:55,719 --> 00:42:00,399
you the tissue test and then you know

955
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:02,078
something's not right but you got don't

956
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,440
know what the soil pH is you don't know

957
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,119
what the condition of plants are so you

958
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,079
have to call them up and ask a bunch of

959
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:10,400
questions um hope that they remember and

960
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:13,240
give you the right answer and try to

961
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,680
figure that out so yeah that's a

962
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:18,679
frustration and uh I hope in the future

963
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:20,399
that's why we want to set up a system

964
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:22,679
where Growers submit soil samples

965
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,318
simultaneously with Leaf analysis and

966
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:26,480
fill out the form so we can get all

967
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:28,719
those uh all that information in one

968
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:32,639
place so we don't have to try to piece

969
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:35,558
it together later on yep it's a good

970
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:39,679
point uh do we ever see uh tin up of

971
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:41,839
nitrogen from straw mulch in lower foler

972
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:45,399
analysis

973
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:48,759
you not so much I mean um if you have

974
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,358
the straw mulch down first and or even

975
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,880
uh bark mulch like on blueberries and

976
00:42:50,358 --> 00:42:55,039
you throw fertilizer on top of it

977
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,680
sometimes you have to increase the

978
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:59,119
amount of nitrogen you apply because

979
00:42:56,679 --> 00:43:00,879
that'll get tied up on its way down is

980
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,000
it the bacteria that are breaking down

981
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,599
the straw mulch will grab some of that

982
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,239
nitrogen and hold on to it for a while

983
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,400
uh eventually it will get down into the

984
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:11,318
roots but it's a little bit more slow

985
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:14,000
because it's now is in an organic form

986
00:43:11,318 --> 00:43:17,920
as opposed to the nitrate or ammonium

987
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:21,159
form uh it'll eventually get there but

988
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,358
if it's if it's underneath the straw uh

989
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:24,879
generally it won't tie it up it'll work

990
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:26,598
its way down it's mostly on its way

991
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,559
through when it's in close combination

992
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:29,760
with that uh organic matters being

993
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:32,680
broken

994
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:35,079
down the question is does there tend to

995
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:37,440
be more nutrient issues in blueberries

996
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:40,200
versus other small fruit crops I think

997
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,639
the answer is yes to that but it's

998
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:45,759
mostly because people are trying to grow

999
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:48,078
blueberries on soils that they really

1000
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,160
shouldn't be growing blueberries on and

1001
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,839
so they dump a lot of sulfur on there to

1002
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:55,598
try to lower the ph and that's what they

1003
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:58,880
need to do but that releases all sorts

1004
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:01,720
of other nutrients that normally uh

1005
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,318
aren't present at high levels and it

1006
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:06,399
causes these interactions to happen that

1007
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:08,279
you don't see with strawberries and

1008
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,559
raspberries under a PH range that's a

1009
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:13,400
little bit more normal for crops so yeah

1010
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:15,720
we do see it we we don't see so many

1011
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,800
nutrient problems on some of the lighter

1012
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:20,078
soils uh where blueberries might not

1013
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:22,920
grow naturally like in western Michigan

1014
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,920
or New Jersey along the shore but in

1015
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,400
Upland soils yeah we see a lot more

1016
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,800
problems with nutrients and we wood with

1017
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,519
strawberries or

1018
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,440
raspberries yeah Mark says with

1019
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:35,838
blueberries it's pH pH pH yep that's

1020
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,800
exactly I would agree

1021
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:41,239
100% and most of the time with

1022
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:43,760
blueberries when you correct the pH um

1023
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:47,039
that'll often times solve a lot of those

1024
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:49,480
nutrient problems that you see but again

1025
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:51,239
on these some of these soils that people

1026
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,079
are trying to grow blueberries on they

1027
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:55,399
just should not be growing blueberries

1028
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:57,800
but they want to do it so they throw the

1029
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,960
sulfur on there to get that PH down that

1030
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:02,240
just starts a Cascade of other problems

1031
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,240
that are

1032
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,519
unintended don't think there are any

1033
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,519
other questions and so we want to wish

1034
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:14,880
you happy holidays and we'll see you on

1035
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:19,838
the first week of January for the next

1036
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,838
webinar in the series thanks everyone
