1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:12,300
pleasure to be here thanks for the

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,429
invitation nice to see some familiar

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,170
faces

6
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:18,480
happy to talk about my work I usually

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,689
spend most of my time doing it and not

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,160
much time talking about summarizing it

9
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,019
so this was a really good exercise for

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,250
me and sort of tying some things

11
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,689
together to give people who have

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,629
absolutely no idea what I've been doing

13
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:34,109
for the last 20 years a snapshot of one

14
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:36,149
particular area of my work as Tony said

15
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:37,769
and I'm very proud to say I almost feel

16
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,689
I've been around long enough to say I'm

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,670
one of those old-fashioned extension

18
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:43,948
scientists I really believe very

19
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,448
strongly in my commitment as an

20
00:00:43,948 --> 00:00:47,369
extension specialist and you're going to

21
00:00:45,448 --> 00:00:49,710
see that in my work I've had the

22
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:51,780
pleasure of course you can't avoid being

23
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,128
involved in basic research at some level

24
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,620
at this place and I've always had the

25
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:56,820
pleasure of being involved in that but

26
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:00,358
what I'm going to talk to you today

27
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,579
about is this intersection of systems

28
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,820
based research done at the landscape

29
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:09,239
level and changing people's behaviors

30
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:12,000
and using data to drive your education

31
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:14,310
programs and then further continue to

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,170
hone the research and education ideas

33
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,850
that you implement this is the

34
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,700
environment that I work in what we now

35
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:23,299
know as the urban ecosystem we've got

36
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,340
really nice terms for that type of

37
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:28,379
landscape now this is the particular

38
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,060
landscape that I will be talking about

39
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:34,259
today one of the many that we work on as

40
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,150
Tony said I've had the pleasure of

41
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,609
working with the practitioners at

42
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,350
Central Park and a lot of the interest

43
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:43,109
that I initially get is we have a

44
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:45,239
problem how can you help us and then

45
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:48,000
laws get passed that says well you can't

46
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:50,729
use those things anymore you can't have

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,950
those pesticides anymore and so then not

48
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,480
only do you become as I am an extension

49
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,510
scientists where you sort of help them

50
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,280
solve short-term issues they begin to

51
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,109
see the long-term challenges they're

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,060
going to face as the people who think

53
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:05,519
much of this is their front yard and

54
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,420
most of these people have a fair amount

55
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:12,150
of affluence to draw upon affluence and

56
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:14,369
influence to draw upon to impact the way

57
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,580
this particular landscape gets managed

58
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:21,090
so I spend a lot of time on the

59
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:23,670
intersection of managing plants in urban

60
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,560
environments and as Jenny a gown if and

61
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:27,238
said in her presentation in our

62
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,250
department meeting this morning the sort

63
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,489
of socio-economic intersection and

64
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,439
understanding how much people are

65
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:35,759
involved in the decisions and the way

66
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,769
things get managed out in these

67
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,750
landscapes and one of the driving forces

68
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:42,659
believe it or not in the urban landscape

69
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,370
is mimicry there's a fair amount of

70
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:45,989
research that's been conducted now to

71
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,759
say well if they see that's the way the

72
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:50,099
landscape is going to be that's what

73
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,899
everybody wants we know it in for neck

74
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:54,060
you know sort of common vernacular as

75
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,799
keeping up with the joneses right I

76
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,830
think we've observed this for a long

77
00:02:55,799 --> 00:03:02,239
time and one of the problems is once one

78
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:05,150
person does it badly

79
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,739
then you've got it multiplied

80
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:10,170
on and also so I'll show you a pretty

81
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:12,060
large scale the other thing that's

82
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:13,469
important to understand about the urban

83
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,739
environment particularly from a

84
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:18,409
stormwater perspective where I really

85
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:21,000
spend a lot of my time thinking about

86
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:23,699
reducing inputs because of these reasons

87
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,129
is eighty percent of the u.s. population

88
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:29,988
lives on about ten percent of the land

89
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:33,449
and the urban environments have a

90
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:36,269
put except put exceptional pressure on

91
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:38,759
the ecosystems that service them that

92
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:41,359
most of the time are not in cities

93
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:44,818
bringing the urban green infrastructure

94
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:47,700
into the city now begins to connect this

95
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:49,530
population with an ecosystem that can

96
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,358
service them for their needs but

97
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,789
oftentimes they put a disproportionate

98
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:56,370
pressure on those ecosystems that are

99
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:58,560
very much dispersed from where they are

100
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,049
so lots of interest in the urban

101
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,239
landscape

102
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:06,299
rebuilding it building more and of

103
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,209
course all the roles that the stormwater

104
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:12,889
management system

105
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:15,659
impacts this grass is involved in it

106
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:18,810
we cover a fair amount of the landscape

107
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:21,959
this is from a 2005 NASA publication

108
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:24,149
bimal SE and others where they did some

109
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,329
spectral scans of the United States to

110
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:30,538
look at where grass was and by no

111
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:32,810
surprise grass is where the people are

112
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:35,788
you don't see a lot of grass out here

113
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:37,439
that people our managing as turf there's

114
00:04:35,788 --> 00:04:40,199
a lot of grass out here I assure you

115
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,300
I've seen it but most of what we call

116
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,489
managed turf is managed in these urban

117
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,949
environments and that happens to be in

118
00:04:44,488 --> 00:04:50,998
close proximity where we pave a lot of

119
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:54,119
places right you use all the sudden now

120
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:55,860
eliminate a big component of stormwater

121
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:58,319
management in fact make a lot of

122
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,059
problems worse because where people are

123
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,300
there's also going to be significant

124
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:04,860
amounts of impervious surface so the

125
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,709
anything that potentially goes on to

126
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,169
that landscape if it is allowed to

127
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:12,598
escape into those impervious surfaces

128
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:14,668
then gets channeled and funneled and

129
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:17,278
concentrated into some of the other

130
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:18,928
issues that this wonderful picture I saw

131
00:05:17,278 --> 00:05:21,959
on Twitter the other day I couldn't help

132
00:05:18,928 --> 00:05:24,588
myself but steal it the connectedness of

133
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:27,899
the watersheds and the rivers that

134
00:05:24,588 --> 00:05:29,788
connect our American continental United

135
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:32,098
States society and you know when you

136
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:34,110
start looking up in here I actually

137
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:36,269
wouldn't be surprised if at some point

138
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,158
we start to see laws drawn along the

139
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:41,129
lines of these watersheds as they do

140
00:05:38,158 --> 00:05:44,218
throughout Europe so these kinds of

141
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:46,789
connected this connective tissue in the

142
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:49,978
in the water system is

143
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:50,838
what I connect myself to in the urban

144
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:53,550
environment

145
00:05:50,838 --> 00:05:56,189
so now that's ultimately going to impact

146
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,079
it be impacted by the inputs that we

147
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,419
bring into this urban environment and

148
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:03,209
what do people use in urban environments

149
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:05,668
well to the tune of about five and a

150
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:07,348
half billion dollars they spend on lawn

151
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:11,878
and garden products this is an

152
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:14,069
enormously large economic driver in the

153
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,110
green industry and if you look just that

154
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:18,899
pesticides and fertilizers that could

155
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:21,419
potentially have nutrient and other

156
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:23,999
health effects you know you're looking

157
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:27,568
at in excess of fifty percent of all the

158
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:31,289
money is spent on stuff that gets put on

159
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:33,050
that landscape that even if we did sort

160
00:06:31,288 --> 00:06:36,568
of crude

161
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:39,088
percentage losses in the point 0 0 0 1

162
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:40,919
percentage points you're still looking

163
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:42,718
at enormous amounts of materials that

164
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:45,538
can concentrate and get into the water

165
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:48,120
and of course when you look at pesticide

166
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:49,529
use specifically New York State's been

167
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,689
keeping records for a number of years

168
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:53,909
and when you look at the pounds of

169
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:56,009
pesticides by County which is the way

170
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,560
the Dec has been collecting them for

171
00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:01,978
many years you see that some of the

172
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,220
largest pesticide use gets associated in

173
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:08,519
the urban areas right Buffalo Rochester

174
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:11,610
Syracuse up the Hudson Valley into

175
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:14,180
Albany so lots of pesticide use in urban

176
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,949
areas and you know lots of rural areas

177
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,418
not as much right even though we know

178
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:21,120
there's a lot of agricultural production

179
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:23,279
going on there so if you wonder why

180
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,639
someone would be talking about pesticide

181
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:28,379
use on a golf course or in urban areas

182
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:30,900
there's enormous there's an enormous

183
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:33,538
amount of pesticide used in those areas

184
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:35,519
now is all of it on lawns probably not i

185
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:37,409
would say a lot of this could be and is

186
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,329
probably related in urban areas to

187
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,039
structural pest control i don't want to

188
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:43,430
say all of this is getting blanketed on

189
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:45,839
terrific golf courses but for sure

190
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,668
pesticides are a part of our lives which

191
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,399
is very disconnected from the way I

192
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:51,899
think many of our citizens view

193
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,279
pesticides well they don't use

194
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:55,829
pesticides but they don't look under the

195
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:58,138
counter and see the raid and the tick on

196
00:07:55,829 --> 00:08:00,209
the detik material on their dogs which

197
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:03,139
is the same grub control we use for

198
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:06,418
lawns there's a enormous disconnect

199
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:09,478
where the stuff ends up tends to be a

200
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:11,788
big problem and so my approach to this

201
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:14,579
has always been pollution prevention

202
00:08:11,788 --> 00:08:17,339
right if we're not using it if we're not

203
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:19,259
relying on it the chance that the usgs

204
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:21,478
is going to find it in a stream and

205
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:24,269
oddly enough when you see some of their

206
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:26,699
highest insecticide concentrations they

207
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:28,409
tend to be located at least in the

208
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:31,110
Northeast in some of these heavily

209
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,180
urbanized areas now we're not immune to

210
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,129
this from the nutrient perspective this

211
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,408
is the North and South Fork of Long

212
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:40,908
Island where if they've done some recent

213
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:40,908
nutrient use and

214
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,879
testing well survey surface and

215
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:50,399
groundwater well surveys and have found

216
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:52,409
that you know fertilizers on lawns and

217
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,899
golf courses because of the high

218
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:57,149
percentage of golf courses and lawns in

219
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,338
these affluent areas there's a fair

220
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:01,639
amount of materials used and there have

221
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:04,760
been legislative initiative in these

222
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:07,399
areas to further restrict the use of

223
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:09,110
these nutrients so we've been challenged

224
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:11,659
as scientists to be able to say well how

225
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,310
can you justify this use so my colleague

226
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:15,649
and retired colleague Marty Petrovic

227
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:18,619
spent a lot of his career working on

228
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:21,799
this particular issue but the pesticide

229
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:23,600
issue is continues to the restriction of

230
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:26,539
pesticide use continues to gather

231
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,159
momentum in Tony's native land of Canada

232
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:30,620
one of your native lands of Canada

233
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,389
they've really led the charge in banning

234
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,210
pesticide use in urban environments

235
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:37,629
primarily on lawns but in Montgomery

236
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:41,000
County where this recent legislation was

237
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:42,889
promulgated and about to be passed it

238
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,620
was going to impact off courses as well

239
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:47,449
as especially municipal golf courses one

240
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,620
of the things that that the people don't

241
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:51,410
realize is a lot of municipalities

242
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:54,080
including the state of New York manage

243
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:56,480
golf as a recreational landscape and so

244
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,250
they provide opportunities for laws to

245
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,170
be passed that don't have to be voted on

246
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,299
by the citizens if the governor signs an

247
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:03,620
executive order that's the way the parks

248
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:05,899
get managed that's the way the

249
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,429
municipalities get managed so what's

250
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:08,870
happening is they're trying to get some

251
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:11,299
of these executive orders at least on

252
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,830
public land now Montgomery County went a

253
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:15,169
little bit further and said we want to

254
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:17,450
ban it on private land as well now you

255
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:20,019
start running into the private public

256
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:22,400
land issues that we face in our country

257
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:24,559
Canada has gone one step further has

258
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,149
been the pmra it's been a very activist

259
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,500
organization since the new prime

260
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:28,970
minister came into power that

261
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:33,019
handsome-looking guy you got up there

262
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:35,629
and so chlorothalonil very commonly used

263
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:37,909
contact fungicide is going under

264
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:41,570
significant restrictions at bird I own

265
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:43,789
thio fan a methyl chlorpyrifos all of

266
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,440
these commonly used turf pesticides are

267
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:47,719
probably going to be completely removed

268
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,150
from the market in the next five to

269
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,490
seven years in Canada which I think

270
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,870
doesn't bode well for people who want to

271
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,419
sell chemicals in the United States

272
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,919
because I think that that is exactly the

273
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:59,719
way we are going to be going I've been

274
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,509
saying it for the better part of 25

275
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,420
years of my academic career so maybe by

276
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:08,419
the time I retire much of what I've been

277
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:11,599
barking about wine actually come true so

278
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:13,219
how do you deal with the public that you

279
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,389
when you ask them about environmental

280
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,519
issues how do they respond so this is a

281
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:19,439
couple of Gallup surveys I wanted to

282
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,909
make you aware of percentage of

283
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,490
Americans wearing a great deal about

284
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:25,079
certain environmental problems and two

285
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,990
of the ones that I work very closely

286
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,860
with drinking water and

287
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,019
contamination of soil water not

288
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,899
necessarily by toxic waste but pollution

289
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:36,240
of rivers as well you can see a mount

290
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:37,829
for the people who worry about

291
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,769
environmental issues which is about half

292
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:43,200
about half of the American population a

293
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:45,329
full half of them are very much worried

294
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,090
about the things that our work focuses

295
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:50,700
on you know how do we keep these inputs

296
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:52,769
out of those water bodies now the

297
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,990
fascinating thing about the way people

298
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:56,789
view the environment is when the economy

299
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:59,990
is not doing well over the last two

300
00:11:56,789 --> 00:12:02,730
decades since we've started to see more

301
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:06,330
significant financial crises and you can

302
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:08,250
track the financial crises on this graph

303
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:11,460
this is a simple question that says if

304
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:13,289
push comes to shove should we favorite

305
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,990
economic issues over environmental

306
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:18,629
issues or should we face environmental

307
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:20,430
issues over economic issues and for many

308
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:22,470
many years up until the turn of the

309
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:24,149
century they said wait a minute

310
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,129
protection of the environment should be

311
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:27,809
given priority over everything right now

312
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:29,519
you think while we're experiencing this

313
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:31,979
big environmental movement but I think

314
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,750
what you see is a steady decline in

315
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,330
people interested in environmental

316
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,769
quality certainly at the level that

317
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,350
they're interested in the quality of

318
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:41,730
their economic life so this creates a

319
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,350
number of challenges when you're

320
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,420
constantly talking to people about

321
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,860
environmental issues whether they're

322
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:48,870
going to be interested in what you're

323
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,659
selling what's saying whether it whether

324
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,909
there is a driver to motivate them to

325
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:56,069
change their behavior by using less

326
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:58,309
products and I think a lot of that goes

327
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:00,300
back to the sort of

328
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:02,399
socio-economic stuff that jenny was

329
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:04,229
talking about in our faculty meeting

330
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,720
this morning and and this SCAF really

331
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,850
depicts that so I'm as an extension

332
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,879
scientist it's sort of nice to learn new

333
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,590
things but as I learn new things I want

334
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:16,320
to see how I can help change people's

335
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:18,750
behavior by taking that science and and

336
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,250
putting it to work and that's really the

337
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,590
stage I'm trying to set move them

338
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,809
forward so here's this here's the issue

339
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:28,290
this is the issue i was on faculty

340
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:30,579
couple years when this happen Spitzer

341
00:13:28,289 --> 00:13:33,039
signs an executive order banning

342
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:36,190
pesticide use on state park land so in

343
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:39,279
1998 he comes in for the five minutes he

344
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,870
was governor and really sort of went

345
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,610
through and in his normal way sort of

346
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:45,840
slashed and burned everything and took a

347
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:48,460
real activist agenda and banned

348
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,290
pesticide use on state park land and at

349
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:53,170
the same time so did Suffolk County

350
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:56,139
Parks now what I thought was interesting

351
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:58,870
was what about the 27 New York State

352
00:13:56,139 --> 00:14:00,699
Office of park recreation and historical

353
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,789
preservation courses that's what that

354
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:05,890
long acronym stands for what about those

355
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:09,279
courses and what about the three courses

356
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:10,539
on Long Island and I think they just

357
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,679
wrote he's a state parks we don't need

358
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:13,299
pesticides out of state park so the

359
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:16,419
state parks don't use roundup anymore

360
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:18,579
they don't use any synthetic chemical

361
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:21,579
pesticides that when there's not a golf

362
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:23,470
course associated with it so Jennifer

363
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,850
grant who many of you know dr. Jennifer

364
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,500
grant is the director of the New York

365
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,629
State IPM program we've been colleagues

366
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,549
since really already knew or even when I

367
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:32,740
was a graduate student here in the late

368
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:35,409
1980s when she was worked beginning her

369
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:37,029
work with rod farentino and I p.m. and

370
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:37,980
Jennifer came and said look what's

371
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:40,089
happening

372
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,070
can we have golf courses without

373
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:43,690
pesticides I said no you can't have a

374
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,629
golf course without pesticides and she

375
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:49,180
said how do you know

376
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:51,730
and that's how dead silent the

377
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:53,529
conversation went after that no one's

378
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,810
ever tested trying to manage a golf

379
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:57,639
course without pesticides people say

380
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:59,229
organic otherwise I can promise you

381
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:01,289
they're using regular chemical

382
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,580
pesticides and these

383
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:06,189
executive orders said anything with an

384
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,990
EPA number can't be used that was the

385
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,940
executive order that was signed when we

386
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,700
first started this work so she said how

387
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:14,650
do you know and so then it was writing

388
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,240
proposals and the normal process we go

389
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:17,610
through and you know the question was

390
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,350
simply

391
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:22,029
at first we pitched the idea to do it on

392
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:24,100
our research plots because as a

393
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:26,620
practical golfcourse guy I said who's

394
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,450
going to let us kill grass on their golf

395
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,519
course because I'm was fairly sure that

396
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,810
was what was going to happen

397
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,759
ecologically if you are maintaining a

398
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:35,019
golf course for 70 years with pesticides

399
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,120
and all of a sudden you stop spraying

400
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:38,889
those pesticides what kind of chance you

401
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,049
think ecologically those plants have

402
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:43,360
that have been held up all these years

403
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:45,758
by preventing diseases and preventing

404
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,829
insect problems the problem chances of

405
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,959
them working are very less so I blame

406
00:15:47,828 --> 00:15:51,519
Jennifer for me being here today and of

407
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:54,969
course my relationship with her has been

408
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,679
one of the great joys of my career I had

409
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,740
been fortunate to start working with the

410
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:02,888
bethpage Park guys on the center of Long

411
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:05,500
Island training them because they had it

412
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:08,318
was announced back in 1997 that they

413
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,778
were going to have the 2002 US Open

414
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:13,688
which was the biggest golf tournament in

415
00:16:10,778 --> 00:16:16,389
the world and they didn't have a staff

416
00:16:13,688 --> 00:16:18,370
that even knew the first thing about how

417
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:20,198
they might prepare a golf course for

418
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:21,938
that they were state park workers and

419
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:25,628
this golf course which is one of the

420
00:16:21,938 --> 00:16:28,599
great ones in the world was left to into

421
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:30,699
decline its demise and decline was well

422
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,699
known there just wasn't money to keep it

423
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:35,378
up the they wanted to the leaders of

424
00:16:33,698 --> 00:16:37,659
golf want it to sort of rien still

425
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:40,180
public off so this was the first time

426
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:41,588
the US Open was held on a truly public

427
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:43,778
off course the kind of golf course you

428
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:46,269
sleep in your car to be able to play

429
00:16:43,778 --> 00:16:48,578
first thing in the morning and so I had

430
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:50,799
this long relationship with them and I

431
00:16:48,578 --> 00:16:52,989
literally will tell you i leveraged it I

432
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:55,479
said to the park superintendent Dave

433
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:57,370
Catalano at the time I said hey man we

434
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,110
need you have five golf courses here we

435
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:01,839
need one of them to test this out and he

436
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,870
said absolutely that's what we should be

437
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,870
doing

438
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:08,619
it almost gets me choked up every time I

439
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,270
say it because if he said no I'm not

440
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:11,708
sure what I would have done so he gave

441
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:14,220
us the golf course they basically said

442
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:17,259
yeah do what you got to do so

443
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,730
2002 bethpage was a great place to do it

444
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:20,709
because the world was looking at

445
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,720
bethpage right the world had their eyes

446
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:25,419
on this golf course that hadn't been on

447
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,279
television ever had never hosted a major

448
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,500
tournament and it had to be sort of

449
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,558
pulled off in a five-year period and as

450
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,150
you see it was enormously successful

451
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:36,038
even got to work with my nephew was on

452
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:38,019
the ground screw so one of the things to

453
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:39,519
do as an extension scientist in my world

454
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:41,589
is when there's work to be done and

455
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,779
there's a chance to get up and do it

456
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:46,599
it's a way you build relationships with

457
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:48,460
your peers as say hey least not just a

458
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:50,529
guy who locks himself up in those rooms

459
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:53,048
he's out there actually boy knows how to

460
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:54,519
run a greens mower he knows how to do

461
00:17:53,048 --> 00:17:56,170
this he knows how to do that I do

462
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:57,700
because before I came back to graduate

463
00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:00,070
school I was a golf course

464
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:03,130
superintendent but I want to say how

465
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:05,200
much of a benefit this is in changing

466
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:06,700
people's behavior I think one of the

467
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,110
great challenges environmental groups

468
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,819
have in general is they're trying to

469
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:13,029
change systems many times from the

470
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:15,189
complete outside and I am I don't know

471
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:16,869
how else to say it I'm a mole I'm this

472
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,549
guy who's been in the turf business for

473
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:20,889
thirty something years and have

474
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:22,930
consistently tried to make changes in

475
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:25,480
this environmental way and I finally

476
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:27,730
after 25 years I feel like some of that

477
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,589
work is coming to fruition so this is

478
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,380
what work is like during a US open when

479
00:18:29,589 --> 00:18:33,519
it rains a lot that's me

480
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,590
you wouldn't believe they actually try

481
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,230
to play golf in this thing they even

482
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:39,490
wrote a book about the tournament I'm

483
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:42,190
mentioned a couple of times in this book

484
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,660
was the first time again the big

485
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:47,519
tournament was played on a public stage

486
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:50,860
all right bethpage is a busy place

487
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:54,940
people love playing golf they'll play

488
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:58,209
between 50 and 60 thousand 18-hole

489
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:00,279
rounds a year on the green course that

490
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:03,160
we work that we play on it's not

491
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:05,230
uncommon that when you play God at the

492
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,120
golf course here this is one of the

493
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:10,058
putting greens so here's a group putting

494
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:12,669
their ball in this group here finished

495
00:19:10,058 --> 00:19:15,399
putting and is waiting for these guys to

496
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:17,289
tee off who are teeing off while there's

497
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,970
people on the green it's a par three so

498
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:20,529
they're hitting to the green while

499
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,990
people on the par-3 are standing back

500
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:25,389
waiting for them to head up that's what

501
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:27,190
this is like it is a constant play

502
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:30,130
traffic and all that foot traffic

503
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:33,220
creates a lot of challenges for living

504
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:35,170
things of which grass plants are mode at

505
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,390
about a tenth of an inch when they're

506
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:39,039
experiencing that traffic so what is the

507
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:41,370
bethpage state park it's five golf

508
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:44,200
courses 1,500 acres

509
00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:47,139
260 thousand rounds across the five golf

510
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:50,529
courses only 35,000 on the championship

511
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:53,110
course it's second only to the parking

512
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:55,720
lot at Niagara Falls and income for the

513
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:57,428
state park system nothing makes more

514
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,679
money than the parking lot at Niagara

515
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:02,679
Falls and Beth blades is typically a

516
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,440
close second to it our work is being

517
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:06,930
done on the green course we didn't

518
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,580
necessarily think about that at the time

519
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,560
but the green course that was the

520
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:14,699
original golf course that was on the

521
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:17,549
land when Robert Moses bought and bought

522
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,140
is loose term for Robert Moses he sort

523
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:21,480
of said I want it and next thing you

524
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,610
know he had it and so then they built

525
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,500
out the golf course to include five

526
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:27,449
other properties as well so our work was

527
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,250
on the green course now i want to just

528
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,170
set the stage for the first part of the

529
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,940
study because the meat of it is actually

530
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:35,190
the second part of the work that we've

531
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,680
been doing in the last seven years so

532
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:40,740
for the first

533
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:43,140
ten years 13 years we were conducting an

534
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,660
experiment that was a systems-based

535
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:48,300
trial and i guess the easiest way to

536
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:51,480
explain it is when you go on a diet as a

537
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:53,730
person sometimes nowadays there actually

538
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,470
are prescribed foods but generally you

539
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:57,569
can eat lots of different things Weight

540
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,610
Watchers has a point system you get

541
00:20:57,569 --> 00:21:01,529
these many points for this food and so

542
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:05,039
they'll tell you exactly what to eat all

543
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:08,129
time but they say here's what that stuff

544
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,319
has to be like that's how I would

545
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:13,020
describe the way we approach the work we

546
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:15,779
have 18 putting surfaces which is where

547
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:17,730
we wanted to do this work we put nine of

548
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:19,889
them under you know what you're normally

549
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:22,009
doing on the golf course and nine of

550
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:25,800
them under what we thought would be

551
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:27,799
practices that reduce overall stress on

552
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:29,849
the plants and

553
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:32,579
maximize their ability to withstand

554
00:21:29,849 --> 00:21:36,149
pests pressure if they're under less

555
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:38,759
stress theoretically they'll be less

556
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:42,240
exposed less vulnerable to particularly

557
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:45,119
fungal diseases fungal pathogens insect

558
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,549
predation are the two big pest problems

559
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,709
on these playing surfaces so we had nine

560
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:51,480
the way they were doing it and nine the

561
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:55,400
way we thought they should do it in the

562
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:58,640
future and then within those nine

563
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:01,740
surfaces we replicated

564
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,410
three pest management approaches one

565
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,960
that they normally used one that we

566
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:09,570
would call a sort of progressive IPM

567
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,440
approach and one that initially

568
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:14,809
initially was following the executive

569
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,870
order no

570
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:20,099
chemicals with an EPA number then I'll

571
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:22,079
show you in a minute why we have to

572
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:24,119
adapt that particular treatment to

573
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,899
ultimately become what we published as

574
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:29,759
bio-based pest management

575
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:33,660
biologicals reduced risk products that

576
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:35,009
the EPA indicates as such and so we did

577
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,050
we published a paper in our

578
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:40,410
international turfgrass research journal

579
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:42,869
back in 2009 that summarized our first

580
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:44,400
seven years of work and I don't expect

581
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:46,919
you to pay attention to the suite of

582
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,920
practices I just want you to see that

583
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,900
these were what the cultural management

584
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,910
systems look like when i say cultural

585
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,130
management it's how you mow how you

586
00:22:53,910 --> 00:23:00,259
fertilize how you water these are

587
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:02,910
enormously intensive management systems

588
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:06,059
enormous amounts of intervention on a

589
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:08,310
daily basis this is gonna put the apple

590
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:11,220
tree and see you in 30 years kind of

591
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:13,049
thing this is every day they're at it

592
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,690
doing something to these playing

593
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:17,700
surfaces on a variety of different ways

594
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,950
to condition them to perform the way

595
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,360
they're supposed to

596
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:22,559
so what we often call the most

597
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,369
dysfunctional building in the entire

598
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:28,589
state of New York that's the state house

599
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:31,969
so the goals of our original project as

600
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:36,269
we set it out was the first

601
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:38,519
how do we if you ban pesticides what are

602
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:40,410
these growers going to do they don't

603
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,000
have there was no one's ever sort of

604
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:44,400
said how do you do this with one hand

605
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,410
tied behind your back those questions

606
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,120
had never really been asked before so we

607
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:51,650
said wait a minute we need to figure out

608
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:55,500
what sorts of things work and

609
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:57,090
give policymakers an opportunity to see

610
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,460
the work we would invite them out on a

611
00:23:57,089 --> 00:24:02,659
regular basis during the study to say

612
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:05,850
hey here's the treatment that

613
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:07,980
you the law you would just are about to

614
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:09,839
impose this is going to be what happens

615
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,809
when everybody starts managing like this

616
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:15,629
and so this is the funeral service for

617
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:17,789
the second putting surface on the green

618
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:19,890
course it didn't take long for this to

619
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:23,220
happen the first two years we made it

620
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:25,710
into two July one year in early August

621
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:28,309
another year and then basically within a

622
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:32,549
week that's what happens and they died

623
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:35,519
from the most commonly found fungal

624
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:37,288
pathogen that no one ever were about the

625
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,870
disease that actually began came in and

626
00:24:37,288 --> 00:24:41,759
killed these surfaces is one that Nolan

627
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:43,979
even if you ask people are the top ten

628
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:47,579
problems they barely make that top ten

629
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,839
list it's so common that they just spray

630
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:50,849
all the time for it and never think

631
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:52,558
about and all of a sudden when you don't

632
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:54,928
have the tools that solve common

633
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,388
problems and you don't have alternatives

634
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:58,919
to those problem

635
00:24:56,388 --> 00:25:00,719
alternatives to solve those issues it

636
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,730
becomes very difficult to not have

637
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,139
surfaces like this these were putting

638
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:06,599
surfaces that been managed with

639
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:09,719
chemicals in various ways shapes or form

640
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:12,240
all the way back to chlordane in the 30s

641
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,700
these greens had never seen these putty

642
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,819
surfaces had never seen a growing season

643
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,620
without regular pesticide use so when we

644
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:22,230
stopped doing it two years in a row this

645
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:25,609
is what happened that's why the final

646
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:28,288
treatment that that bio-based sorry

647
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:32,099
the bio-based pest management here at

648
00:25:28,288 --> 00:25:34,798
the bottom had to be implemented because

649
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:36,480
Dave can Alanna looked at us and said do

650
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:38,220
you have to keep killing these greens

651
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,139
are you learning something if you're

652
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,329
learning something by continuing to kill

653
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:43,949
them by all means continue to kill them

654
00:25:42,329 --> 00:25:46,439
but if you're not learning anything

655
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:48,210
maybe you can stop and we did one more

656
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,980
thing before we softened that's we

657
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:51,600
invited the policy makers out there the

658
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:55,110
Suffolk County legislators we probably

659
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:57,408
had four there and we had two state

660
00:25:55,109 --> 00:26:00,898
senators and their aides there

661
00:25:57,409 --> 00:26:03,210
for the Twilight field day with about

662
00:26:00,898 --> 00:26:06,449
15-20 people and we said this is what

663
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:09,558
happens when your law gets enacted and

664
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:12,690
their comment was oh I

665
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:14,668
I think that there is this and maybe you

666
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:16,409
see this in agriculture as well there's

667
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:18,929
this pervasive attitude what do you need

668
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:20,429
pesticides for how hard is how r could

669
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:21,659
it be what do you need pesticides for it

670
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:24,269
and oh it's a golf course why are you

671
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:25,740
using them on a golf course so the idea

672
00:26:24,269 --> 00:26:27,240
that we would take away a tool and it

673
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,589
would result in something like this I

674
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,929
think speaks to the level of ignorance

675
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:33,000
that we have in much of our legislators

676
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:36,240
when it comes to these kinds of

677
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,980
complicated issues so our operating

678
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,620
principles with the project was number

679
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:42,808
one established cultural practices that

680
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:45,298
reduce stress create an environment that

681
00:26:42,808 --> 00:26:48,119
has less problems and then when you're

682
00:26:45,298 --> 00:26:50,579
going to intervene with a product right

683
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:52,619
I can tell you every snake oil salesman

684
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:54,240
in the country found out we were doing

685
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:57,869
this and said hey we got the magic

686
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:01,500
potion for you Frank and we had to

687
00:26:57,869 --> 00:27:04,319
immediately say wait a minute who says

688
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,180
that and they said well you know we

689
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:09,089
tried it in a greenhouse one weekend on

690
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:10,740
cucumber and it worked really good so so

691
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:12,359
that's the kind of stuff that we were

692
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:16,410
confronted with when we started this

693
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:18,419
work you know 15 years ago so challenges

694
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:20,610
of new technology i will say you know

695
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:22,140
god bless those people at bethpage for

696
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:24,599
putting up with you know if I had 10

697
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,580
ideas one of them might have been a good

698
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:29,969
one but they let me try all 10 of them

699
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:32,399
and we tried brewery waste compost for

700
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:34,079
snow mold we had to push the snow off

701
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,580
and put the brewery ways down because

702
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:37,559
there was data that said that would work

703
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:39,779
and lo and behold we didn't have snow

704
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:42,450
mold but we had the worst case a fairy

705
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:44,490
ring you've ever seen this whole idea i

706
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:46,620
read a recent paper recently that a

707
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:49,319
paper recently that increasing

708
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:52,709
pseudomonads has led to more take all

709
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:55,589
patch problems in week a gal minomycin

710
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:57,509
species problem goes up when you

711
00:27:55,589 --> 00:27:59,549
increase microbial activity of a

712
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:01,049
particular microbe so I think we have a

713
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:03,450
lot to learn about these sorts of things

714
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:07,970
in this drove many of the golf course

715
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:09,860
guys crazy this one year we have gone to

716
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:13,279
pharmaceutical grade

717
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:16,139
microbial fermenters

718
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:18,960
put these bugs in the put the microbes

719
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:21,960
in there blew a slurry put it in a spray

720
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,529
tank and spray it every day for a

721
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:28,559
hundred and fifty days

722
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:30,149
so we did that and it was okay I mean it

723
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,359
certainly reduced some of the pest

724
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:34,830
problems it was a microorganism and that

725
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:37,799
for a while they were injecting this

726
00:28:34,829 --> 00:28:39,720
stuff into the irrigation system but it

727
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:41,220
just wasn't practical we did the carbon

728
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,950
footprint that would have been better to

729
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:46,470
bring a hundred more pounds of pesticide

730
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:48,930
into the r into the operation then use

731
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:50,759
this thing we've tried direct injection

732
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:52,410
sprayers Andrew Landers when he first

733
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:54,539
came to campus have worked with us on

734
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:56,640
this it's a pure tank of water with

735
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:59,879
jockey tanks that it will allow you in

736
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:04,410
real time to adjust rates and locations

737
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:07,010
and 2 a 2 full boom set up this was a

738
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:09,870
state-of-the-art prototype

739
00:29:07,009 --> 00:29:12,119
once we had an intern that used it once

740
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:14,000
that kid left everybody looked at it

741
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:15,839
said I'm not sitting on that thing and

742
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,299
agriculture has been doing this for a

743
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:20,459
really long time and now it's finally

744
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:23,119
starting to come back to the golf

745
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:26,370
industry GPS controlled sprayers

746
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:28,229
variable rate technology I was 15 years

747
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:30,329
ahead of my time we had this on the golf

748
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:32,910
course 15 years ago and we couldn't even

749
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:34,500
get him to take a look at it one student

750
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,570
did it one year and we could never get

751
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,339
it going again

752
00:29:35,569 --> 00:29:40,799
compost teas this was a big deal with

753
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:43,109
the organic movement on Long Island we

754
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:45,809
have a lot of very people with a lot of

755
00:29:43,109 --> 00:29:47,909
time on their hands that really believe

756
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:50,519
organic is the solution to every problem

757
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:53,400
known to man and if we just use more

758
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:56,009
compost the world would be better so we

759
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,570
did the research in Ithaca and found and

760
00:29:56,009 --> 00:29:59,849
then we actually did it on Long Island

761
00:29:57,569 --> 00:30:01,439
as well to appease some of these real

762
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:03,269
critical people say they didn't think we

763
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,390
were doing anything useful because it

764
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:07,920
wasn't organic

765
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:09,480
direct injectors on the side of the

766
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,800
irrigation system we did this actually

767
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,990
at the cornell golf course as well

768
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,789
products that you find there's billions

769
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:18,299
of dollars spent on products that have

770
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:20,399
no practical value for use in turf no

771
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:22,589
matter what we say we can't stop them

772
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,920
from using them but they continue to do

773
00:30:22,589 --> 00:30:27,209
it so

774
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,860
just to give you a sense of the golf

775
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:31,170
course that we're talking about fairly

776
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:33,659
small putting surfaces about 4,500

777
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:36,060
square feet and they get a fair amount

778
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:38,310
of traffic I show you this graph this

779
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:41,099
was a seven-year track of the rounds of

780
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:44,549
golf this is what happened after the

781
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:46,289
first two years of kill and greens so

782
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:47,700
this is when we started and then the

783
00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:49,200
greens died and they didn't come back

784
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,940
and then the greens died and didn't come

785
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,850
back and so once the state revenue

786
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:55,980
people said whoa make it less money on

787
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:57,480
this maybe there is something to this

788
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,460
golf course thing that we should pay

789
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,680
attention to and so we made some

790
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:04,230
adjustments to our systems that allowed

791
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,539
us that bio-based pest management and we

792
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:08,370
saw a return rounds of golf and one when

793
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:10,349
I show this to people who manage golf

794
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:13,829
courses has small businesses many small

795
00:31:10,349 --> 00:31:15,509
farmers like oh yeah when our greens are

796
00:31:13,829 --> 00:31:17,279
in good shape people don't like playing

797
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:19,769
here or they want a discount and let me

798
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:22,289
tell you how rude Long Island Public

799
00:31:19,769 --> 00:31:23,759
offers can be sometimes when they find

800
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:26,759
they can't play a putting green because

801
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:28,220
it's dead they want a discount on the

802
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:32,390
round so

803
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:34,710
anyway speaking of the golfers we did

804
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:36,660
interview them regularly this was

805
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:38,819
Jennifer's part of the project dealing

806
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:42,170
with the golfers and so we would service

807
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:44,399
them survey them and ask them if

808
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:47,400
percentage of golfers had said they

809
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:50,820
wanted you to keep quality high use

810
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:52,580
pesticides whenever they might help keep

811
00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:55,558
reasonably good use pesticides

812
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:57,779
judiciously minimize pesticide use

813
00:31:55,558 --> 00:32:00,359
regardless of quality and don't use

814
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:02,399
pesticides now what you see in this

815
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:04,289
graph that's fascinating is particularly

816
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,940
in the early parts of the study we

817
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:07,769
didn't show we didn't survey them when

818
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,179
the greens were dead necessarily but a

819
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:10,009
lot of these golfers went through this

820
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:13,170
experience

821
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:15,089
you can see a starting an occasional

822
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:18,600
increase and when we started looking at

823
00:32:15,089 --> 00:32:21,269
this data further there did track

824
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:23,219
economy the better the economy was and

825
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:24,869
the more they liked playing golf the

826
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,759
less they cared about pesticide use and

827
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:29,609
golfers in general don't care much about

828
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:31,890
pesticide use in general they have sort

829
00:32:29,609 --> 00:32:33,959
of grown accustomed to it like people

830
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:35,850
who live in agrarian societies and see

831
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,799
farmers apply pesticides all the time

832
00:32:35,849 --> 00:32:41,579
they don't see it as something abnormal

833
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:43,349
that people do but on golf course is you

834
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:45,419
know where people don't normally see

835
00:32:43,349 --> 00:32:47,699
people other people applying pesticides

836
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:49,529
people who are not golfers get all

837
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,299
worked up about it we find that the

838
00:32:49,529 --> 00:32:52,428
golfers tend not to get that worked up

839
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:54,450
about it

840
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:57,330
okay so how would you rate the overall

841
00:32:54,450 --> 00:33:00,269
condition of the green course in 2008

842
00:32:57,329 --> 00:33:02,699
and so we had about a sixty percent very

843
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:05,308
good and twenty-eight percent adequate

844
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:07,980
so we're going to say tough New York

845
00:33:05,308 --> 00:33:09,990
public golf crowd we've satisfied about

846
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:12,240
eighty-five percent ninety percent of

847
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:14,220
the public and we're driving down

848
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,670
pesticide use in this project so we

849
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:19,589
surveyed the golfers and

850
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:23,460
we asked them about how they thought it

851
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:25,470
looked and how they thought it played

852
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,288
so green quality rating by golfers

853
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:30,480
looking at our I p.m. with alternative

854
00:33:28,288 --> 00:33:33,690
cultural practices all of them thought

855
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,278
those greens were good the can equal to

856
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:37,200
0

857
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:39,390
statistically the same as the way

858
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,028
they've been doing business so we've

859
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:45,179
developed this alternative collection of

860
00:33:42,028 --> 00:33:46,609
practices that the golfers say is doing

861
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:49,140
pretty good and

862
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:51,329
consistent with the way they've been

863
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:54,028
doing business in the past so if we can

864
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:57,269
make our adjustments to their management

865
00:33:54,028 --> 00:33:59,909
good for the environment and transparent

866
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:01,528
to the golfer that's the sweet spot that

867
00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:03,020
I think we were suited for when we

868
00:34:01,528 --> 00:34:05,339
started this work and

869
00:34:03,019 --> 00:34:07,259
playing surfaces as well it can skip

870
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:10,789
over some of that we monitored labor

871
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:13,530
hours because one of the knocks on

872
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:15,960
alternative or organic is it takes more

873
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:18,839
time it's more labor intensive and we

874
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:22,280
did not necessarily find that now the AC

875
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:25,529
is alternative culture I p.m. and the

876
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:28,050
green bar is the standard practice the

877
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:30,179
blue bar is the progressive practices

878
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:32,399
that we've implemented and you could see

879
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:34,108
early on when we first started

880
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:36,088
implementing them it took more time

881
00:34:34,108 --> 00:34:38,250
right changing the way they manage you'd

882
00:34:36,088 --> 00:34:41,460
expect things that take more time but as

883
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:43,530
we've gone along we saw that oh they got

884
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,898
used to this different way of management

885
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:47,990
and then it no longer took more time

886
00:34:45,898 --> 00:34:50,309
than the conventional approach

887
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:52,678
now fundamentally the title of my talk

888
00:34:50,309 --> 00:34:54,539
is pesticide use reduction so let me

889
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:56,429
talk to you about the way we look about

890
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:58,588
pesticide use obviously practitioners

891
00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:01,440
pick them based on multiple factors

892
00:34:58,588 --> 00:35:02,909
Jennifer likes efficacy economics and

893
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,099
the environment I think it's an easy way

894
00:35:02,909 --> 00:35:07,049
to summarize the way people select

895
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:09,510
pesticides we have Cornell guidelines

896
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:12,269
that guides them but I'll approach with

897
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:15,470
at bethpage and then with our larger

898
00:35:12,269 --> 00:35:18,269
state park group has been first of all

899
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:20,009
New York State labeled chemicals it's

900
00:35:18,269 --> 00:35:21,619
got to be labeled for use in New York

901
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:24,089
that's the use of the guidelines

902
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:26,579
we want it to be effective and I'll show

903
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:29,338
you how we went about that and we wanted

904
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:31,679
to introduce some sort of environmental

905
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:33,049
screening that said okay here's 10

906
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:35,460
pesticides

907
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:37,460
they're different chemically they're

908
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,588
different based their potential

909
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:42,588
environmental impact we want you to

910
00:35:39,588 --> 00:35:44,599
screen the products you use based on

911
00:35:42,588 --> 00:35:47,949
this screening model known to many as

912
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:50,720
the environmental impact quotient

913
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:52,939
so before I get to a discussion at the

914
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:55,250
eiq I want to give you a sense there's

915
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:57,470
an enormous amount of data available

916
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:59,420
looking at efficacy of products land

917
00:35:57,469 --> 00:36:01,639
grant institutions have no problem

918
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:03,650
spraying plots have no problem telling

919
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:05,539
you what works and doesn't work and they

920
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:07,550
do such a good job of it I don't have to

921
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:09,380
do it we don't have to do it and I can

922
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:12,230
use that information and translate it

923
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:15,160
here and paul Vance elia proud Cornell

924
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:19,269
grad at Kentucky publishes a particular

925
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:22,639
bulletin every year that ranks efficacy

926
00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:25,068
looks at fungicide to mattify tests and

927
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:27,289
says these do pretty well in a lot of

928
00:36:25,068 --> 00:36:28,909
different studies these do poorly in a

929
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:31,159
lot of different studies these do good

930
00:36:28,909 --> 00:36:33,649
and some not good in others and so he

931
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:35,598
ranks the efficacy of the various

932
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:38,720
products so we've put this into a tool

933
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,579
to help the managers make decisions now

934
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:42,679
the IQ is one you may be aware of

935
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:44,539
djokovic a former fruit I p.m.

936
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:47,058
specialist developed this model many

937
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:50,808
years ago to see if he could compare

938
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:53,210
organic apple production to I p.m. apple

939
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:55,069
production to conventional apple

940
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:57,588
production that was the original intent

941
00:36:55,068 --> 00:37:00,409
of this model that he began to run

942
00:36:57,588 --> 00:37:02,420
chemicals through to demonstrate one

943
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:05,568
pest management system versus another

944
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:07,608
this model is heavily scrutinized by the

945
00:37:05,568 --> 00:37:09,440
scientific communities one person Paul

946
00:37:07,608 --> 00:37:12,769
was the paper said it's no better than

947
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:15,048
random numbers now i will say there are

948
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:16,849
some caveats to this when the model was

949
00:37:15,048 --> 00:37:18,889
originally developed there was a lot of

950
00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:20,539
products that were really bad we were

951
00:37:18,889 --> 00:37:23,239
using and i think one of the things

952
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:25,369
that's affected its efficacy as a model

953
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:28,308
of screening is a lot of those products

954
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:30,108
are gone so the wide disparity and

955
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:32,420
potential environmental impact of a lot

956
00:37:30,108 --> 00:37:35,239
of products is more related to their

957
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:38,210
overall amounts then necessarily their

958
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:40,189
their inherent toxicity so this fancy

959
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:41,568
this model that Joe developed jennifer

960
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:43,970
and I sat down said hey we should give

961
00:37:41,568 --> 00:37:45,769
these guys a tool at bethpage to screen

962
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:48,379
these things we adapted this a little

963
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:51,230
bit for our use and then began to have

964
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:53,840
them use it so this was table that a

965
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:55,789
turf manager would get at bethpage for a

966
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:58,220
dollar spot control a score of tinea

967
00:37:55,789 --> 00:38:00,079
minor that common disease that killed

968
00:37:58,219 --> 00:38:02,239
those greens here's a variety of

969
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,179
products that we know have decent

970
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:07,129
efficacy the frack code for those of you

971
00:38:05,179 --> 00:38:09,829
that aren't familiar with these action

972
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:11,780
codes is at a track code and iraq code

973
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:13,940
this is the frack code fungicide

974
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:15,769
resistance action committee that

975
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:18,950
basically codes them based on their mode

976
00:38:15,769 --> 00:38:21,050
of action we want it to stop using a

977
00:38:18,949 --> 00:38:23,359
particular compact fungicide called

978
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:25,940
chlorothalonil and a lot of the concern

979
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:27,620
was all we're going to get resistance to

980
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:29,119
these other chemicals as well you're

981
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:31,279
going to get resistance of all you do is

982
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,679
spray one particular type of chemical

983
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,240
but if you use a variety of modes of

984
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:36,799
action you're more likely to hold off

985
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:39,409
resistance resistance management

986
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,480
continues to be and is emerging issue in

987
00:38:39,409 --> 00:38:44,449
our field as well so this is what they

988
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,460
have and the subsequent eiq numbers that

989
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:49,250
go along with it we encourage them to

990
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:52,340
use reduce risk products we encourage

991
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:54,699
them when ft wizzy was there to use Omri

992
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:58,910
listed products and we've used a few and

993
00:38:54,699 --> 00:39:01,369
then we looked at the eiq of the various

994
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:02,839
management systems so a set i don't know

995
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:04,789
i don't know how i don't expect you to

996
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:07,870
grab all this but essentially what i

997
00:39:04,789 --> 00:39:09,759
want you to do is compare this one to

998
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:12,739
this one

999
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:15,440
coat this is conventional culture

1000
00:39:12,739 --> 00:39:18,769
conventional pest management and what

1001
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,619
you see here is what we were learning in

1002
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:23,739
these other pest management programs

1003
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:26,480
these bio-based ones

1004
00:39:23,739 --> 00:39:28,309
treatment integrity was compromised a

1005
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,380
little bit and they started using them

1006
00:39:28,309 --> 00:39:32,989
in their conventional treatment so we

1007
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:34,880
were not the best research result but a

1008
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:36,589
really good behavior will change like

1009
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,300
wow this product works as good as that

1010
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:40,460
product this one's better for the

1011
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:42,350
environment I'll use that product my

1012
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:45,280
sense is if you give growers options

1013
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:47,900
that they can afford and that work

1014
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,850
most likely they're going to use those

1015
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:52,630
approaches if it's not a big shift in

1016
00:39:49,849 --> 00:39:55,569
their system so we

1017
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:58,160
see real

1018
00:39:55,570 --> 00:40:01,010
this is the one I want you to compare to

1019
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:04,039
not this one alternative culture and I

1020
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:05,900
p.m. versus conventional culture and can

1021
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:09,409
national pest management and so you see

1022
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:10,550
the real low E IQ which is indicating

1023
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:14,210
the environmental impact is

1024
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:15,530
significantly reduced so another way of

1025
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:18,170
looking at the same data which

1026
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:20,150
culminated in a publication that Bob

1027
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:22,940
Portman so we lost unexpectedly this

1028
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:24,170
past March we're sorry to lose Bob we

1029
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:26,030
didn't just lose him from here Bob

1030
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:28,159
passed away suddenly so it was a big

1031
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:31,160
shock to our program but this was his

1032
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:34,849
master's work and a longtime colleague

1033
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:36,949
with mine so once we got that data we

1034
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:38,809
hired Bob and we said hey we learn this

1035
00:40:36,949 --> 00:40:40,939
stuff out at the on the green course how

1036
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:42,159
about we take it to the whole state park

1037
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:45,679
system

1038
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:48,619
apply the same thinking and started to

1039
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:52,250
look at our eiq for our pest management

1040
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:54,199
programs and compare them to different

1041
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:56,119
golf courses we were collecting pest

1042
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:58,149
management programs pesticide use

1043
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:00,440
records from around the country

1044
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:03,590
comparing what some golf courses are

1045
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:05,059
doing compared to what our flagship golf

1046
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:07,850
course the tournament golf course was

1047
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:10,250
doing and the average state golf courses

1048
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:11,960
were doing so first of all we were

1049
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,610
starting to establish a baseline now the

1050
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,990
University of Wisconsin has taken this

1051
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:17,120
and they're creating a statewide

1052
00:41:14,989 --> 00:41:21,049
initiative of all their golf courses to

1053
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,909
be at or below an average eiq value but

1054
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:25,850
one of the things you notice these are

1055
00:41:22,909 --> 00:41:29,029
various parts of the golf course small

1056
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:29,949
area so this is about this represents

1057
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:34,360
about

1058
00:41:29,949 --> 00:41:37,969
three acres this is about four acres

1059
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:41,420
fairways generally can be 20 to 30 acres

1060
00:41:37,969 --> 00:41:44,199
of turf rough areas 40 to 60 acres so

1061
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:48,710
the more you apply pesticides

1062
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:50,539
to larger areas the larger your eiq goes

1063
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:53,409
up and I've been still comfortable using

1064
00:41:50,539 --> 00:41:56,599
the eiq because while it's a measure of

1065
00:41:53,409 --> 00:41:59,359
toxicity of the material risk is a

1066
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:01,130
function of toxicity and exposure so

1067
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:04,340
we're looking at the toxicity of the

1068
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:06,260
product and the exposure that a golfer

1069
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:09,440
or the citizens might have by deploying

1070
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:11,720
these compounds on a large area so when

1071
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,269
we look so now you're looking at seven

1072
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:18,709
years one two three four five six years

1073
00:42:14,269 --> 00:42:20,420
of data we've collected from 15 state

1074
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:22,550
park golf courses that have been

1075
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:26,650
participating in the expanded program

1076
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:28,760
since 2009 2010 and this is the total

1077
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:32,059
environmental impact of their pesticide

1078
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:34,130
use over that period of time so you can

1079
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:35,299
see when we started the program this was

1080
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:37,910
the year before we started we started

1081
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:41,420
the program he said hey use this list

1082
00:42:37,909 --> 00:42:44,059
spray less compound uz IQ and boom right

1083
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:47,930
away we saw big reductions now I break

1084
00:42:44,059 --> 00:42:51,920
this out into all the golf courses or 15

1085
00:42:47,929 --> 00:42:54,349
courses only the five or six on Long

1086
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,950
Island no seven on Long Island and then

1087
00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:59,569
eight upstate so seven and eight golf

1088
00:42:57,949 --> 00:43:01,369
course is so roughly the same number of

1089
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:03,950
golf courses but you see the majority of

1090
00:43:01,369 --> 00:43:06,349
pesticide use is occurring on long

1091
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:08,389
island golf courses right on long island

1092
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:11,719
golf courses so they immediately began

1093
00:43:08,389 --> 00:43:14,629
to drop their eiq and they got pest

1094
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:16,399
problems like crazy once we started to

1095
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:17,840
take this out to a broader audience they

1096
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,240
were going through the same thing we

1097
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:23,390
went through when we started 15 years

1098
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:26,509
ago now what I think we've seen is sort

1099
00:43:23,389 --> 00:43:28,309
of a return we watched a big increase

1100
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:29,870
for a couple of years in Jennifer grant

1101
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:31,849
and I worked very closely on training

1102
00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:33,739
and trying to figure this out and so in

1103
00:43:31,849 --> 00:43:35,239
the last few years we've implemented a

1104
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:38,000
strategy that I want to leave you with

1105
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:40,279
as I wrap up what we've learned in these

1106
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,329
last few years about really changing

1107
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:46,040
pest management behavior using this data

1108
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:47,840
so what this data allows us to do and

1109
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:50,239
what Bob really left us this great gift

1110
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:52,250
is this enormous database that allows us

1111
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:53,899
to look at their behavior based on

1112
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:57,110
environmental impact of the products

1113
00:43:53,900 --> 00:44:00,170
that they used so we took the field use

1114
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:02,840
eiq which is the toxicity the material

1115
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:05,809
calibrated for the rate multiplied by

1116
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:07,510
the area treated so you see that a

1117
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:11,150
majority of

1118
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:15,350
increases across this is all 15 golf

1119
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:18,500
courses came from large increases to

1120
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:20,779
rough areas weed control it was the

1121
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:23,179
primary product that's driving a lot of

1122
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:24,730
this as well as additional fungicide

1123
00:44:23,179 --> 00:44:27,019
treatments that are getting made because

1124
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:28,699
once people see a really good golf

1125
00:44:27,019 --> 00:44:30,079
course they want to keep playing on a

1126
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:32,179
really good golf course once you give

1127
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,759
them a perfect Apple they want a perfect

1128
00:44:32,179 --> 00:44:36,649
Apple all the time so we've sort of were

1129
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,510
a victim of our own success that we got

1130
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,530
good at it and we watch their behavior

1131
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:42,050
so he said wait a minute we're going to

1132
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:45,140
start to stop this so we started to make

1133
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:48,820
some changes there you also see fairway

1134
00:44:45,139 --> 00:44:50,500
use which was high as has gotten bigger

1135
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:54,440
and

1136
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:57,110
yeah and pine green use is stayed fairly

1137
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,429
flat this is where it got very

1138
00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:00,650
interesting and where we've really

1139
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:03,079
implemented the education first of all

1140
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:04,579
we want you to stop you we told the guys

1141
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:07,779
we wanted to stop using products that

1142
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:11,569
are very high toxicity and

1143
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:13,130
it represented in 2015 about fifty

1144
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:17,150
percent of the products they were still

1145
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:20,300
using we would call bad actors or e I

1146
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:22,309
Q's above a value that we liked you're

1147
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,470
starting to see a decline in their use

1148
00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:27,190
but boy that use went up quite a bit

1149
00:45:24,469 --> 00:45:29,569
even above where we started

1150
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:31,970
this is where the education has been

1151
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:36,789
focused most recently and that is to

1152
00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:39,429
pest problems on these golf courses that

1153
00:45:36,789 --> 00:45:42,380
50 that about

1154
00:45:39,429 --> 00:45:45,049
50% forty-eight percent of all the

1155
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:48,980
pesticide used on these 15 golf courses

1156
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:51,530
went at these two pests and that's what

1157
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:53,869
this aiq data allowed us to see so again

1158
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:56,600
we tried to eat knowing this we tried to

1159
00:45:53,869 --> 00:45:59,719
implement some training which included

1160
00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:02,539
the use of predictive models skipped be

1161
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:04,669
over this the use of predictive models

1162
00:46:02,539 --> 00:46:06,739
that was saying that we've been working

1163
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:08,630
with rt gaetano at the Northeast climate

1164
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:11,419
Center we had these predictive models

1165
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:13,250
available for the last decade so we

1166
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:16,880
started using these models a long time

1167
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:19,039
ago and develop risks that could predict

1168
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:22,250
when this disease would be a particular

1169
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:24,320
problem and we asked the practitioners

1170
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:27,710
to monitor that data so here you have

1171
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:32,269
these dots and low medium and high risk

1172
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:35,869
put out in indices so here is below this

1173
00:46:32,269 --> 00:46:38,780
is low-risk medium risk for disease high

1174
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:41,839
risk for disease and this is the trace

1175
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:44,380
of the risk that was experienced at

1176
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:47,318
bethpage in 2014

1177
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:49,838
you can see there was about a 12 to 14

1178
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:52,358
day period when risks were very high

1179
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:55,509
that's when we want to reserve those

1180
00:46:52,358 --> 00:46:58,989
high-risk control products for only

1181
00:46:55,509 --> 00:47:01,389
those times and use softer products or

1182
00:46:58,989 --> 00:47:03,818
products with lower IQ values during

1183
00:47:01,389 --> 00:47:07,000
periods of lower risk if they're needed

1184
00:47:03,818 --> 00:47:09,880
at all so we began this in 2014 gave

1185
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,920
them some suggestions for looking at a

1186
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:13,750
model what would happen and then

1187
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,150
actually looked at their chemical

1188
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:19,028
applications during that period of time

1189
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:20,798
and found when you look at their eiq

1190
00:47:19,028 --> 00:47:22,869
values that one I don't know what

1191
00:47:20,798 --> 00:47:25,900
happened there but when you look at some

1192
00:47:22,869 --> 00:47:28,358
of their yo highest ew q values they're

1193
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:30,220
following when some of the pressures

1194
00:47:28,358 --> 00:47:32,739
were the highest so we're starting to

1195
00:47:30,219 --> 00:47:34,538
see that by bringing a lot of different

1196
00:47:32,739 --> 00:47:37,149
ways of thinking about pest management

1197
00:47:34,539 --> 00:47:39,220
to bear for these people they're

1198
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:41,048
starting to adjust their management to

1199
00:47:39,219 --> 00:47:43,989
be more in line with when the risk

1200
00:47:41,048 --> 00:47:46,119
occurs how to use these lower eiq

1201
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:48,038
products and how the result in the end

1202
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:50,640
is going to be less environmental risk

1203
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:53,200
associated with pesticide use

1204
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:54,940
Andy Wilson is our project manager and

1205
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:56,528
deserves all the credit in the world for

1206
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:59,798
putting up with me all these years of

1207
00:47:56,528 --> 00:48:01,389
visiting I would spend every other I was

1208
00:47:59,798 --> 00:48:03,068
down on Long Island from april to

1209
00:48:01,389 --> 00:48:05,230
november every other week for the better

1210
00:48:03,068 --> 00:48:07,480
part of seven years and he put up with

1211
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:09,429
me this was at the most recent Barclays

1212
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:11,679
tournament we've shifted some of our

1213
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:14,288
work to enhance pollinator habitat the

1214
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:15,848
project continues to expand we get a

1215
00:48:14,289 --> 00:48:18,009
hundred thousand dollars every year from

1216
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:20,500
state parks and we've started to plant

1217
00:48:18,009 --> 00:48:22,690
some of these out of way areas now into

1218
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,818
places where pollinators have some more

1219
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:27,278
help and of course our most recent

1220
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:29,048
extension accomplishment was publishing

1221
00:48:27,278 --> 00:48:30,849
this new york state best management

1222
00:48:29,048 --> 00:48:32,528
practices for golf courses this is

1223
00:48:30,849 --> 00:48:35,559
primarily for water quality protection

1224
00:48:32,528 --> 00:48:37,420
and the eiq and the things that we've

1225
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:40,480
learned from our project are embedded in

1226
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:42,309
this so with that I'm right at my time

1227
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,670
sorry for that wish I had time for

1228
00:48:42,309 --> 00:48:44,670
questions

1229
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:52,039
one or two quick questions yes

1230
00:48:55,670 --> 00:49:01,920
city or two and one was try to turn and

1231
00:48:59,789 --> 00:49:04,050
the other is our they're known as

1232
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,820
impressive loyalty to the fungal

1233
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:08,130
diseases you're interested in Ian could

1234
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:11,010
you use of like a microbiome transplant

1235
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:13,320
type of book been approached to try to

1236
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:15,420
enhance so the answer to the first

1237
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:18,390
question did you strike a derma the

1238
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:21,630
answer is yes and we continued to use to

1239
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:23,460
try to turn long our product down there

1240
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:25,860
it's worked very well on a number of

1241
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:28,800
root pathogen problems that we've had as

1242
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:31,349
far as suppressing soils no such luck

1243
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,390
there Janice we I think everything else

1244
00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:35,670
in early on in his career was working on

1245
00:49:33,389 --> 00:49:37,469
that particular area I think we found

1246
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:39,630
some things with the pity of that might

1247
00:49:37,469 --> 00:49:42,000
be useful but I don't think anybody's

1248
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:44,309
taking that work any further I know

1249
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,820
that's something that the microbiome is

1250
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:49,559
James working on and then ad future for

1251
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,850
that sort of stuff we haven't found any

1252
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:53,570
suppressant soils that we can

1253
00:49:50,849 --> 00:49:56,190
characterize that exists car

1254
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:57,380
one more question anybody had last

1255
00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:01,550
question

1256
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:01,550
all right if not let's fight

1257
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:12,280
this has been a production of Cornell

1258
00:50:07,429 --> 00:50:12,279
University on the web at cornell edu
