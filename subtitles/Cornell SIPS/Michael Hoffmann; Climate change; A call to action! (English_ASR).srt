1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,800
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,519
University so thanks for the opportunity

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,638
this is not going to be your typical

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,000
scientific seminar

5
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:20,320
um I'm going to cover the basics of

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,920
climate change bear with me I'm an

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,560
entomologist I'm not a climate scientist

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,640
but I've also dedicated an aw out of

9
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:30,598
time of learning the science of climate

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,000
change I'm going to cover the basics

11
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,238
then we're all going out to dinner get

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,119
your credit card out because we're going

13
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:40,159
to have an expensive meal but the point

14
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:42,839
is what's changing on the menu and then

15
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,878
I'm going to talk about uh what Cornell

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,600
is doing both a little bit from the

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,839
academic side which you're all part of

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,679
but also facilities and operations there

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,760
really is a lot going on it was just

20
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:56,159
launched a report from the senior

21
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,839
leadership sustainability group on a set

22
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,358
of recommendations to get us to carbon

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,680
neutrality by 2035 so I'm going to

24
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,400
summarize

25
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:07,239
that and Tony failed to mention that

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,520
this our latest publication we actually

27
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:10,599
published Together made the front cover

28
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,920
of weed

29
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:17,879
science it's my picture on front no was

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:23,000
that it no no oh okay well

31
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:24,158
whatever okay so Tony and provide a

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,400
little bio but I'm going to add a few

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,240
more things uh here I am milking a cow

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,439
in Costa Rica a few years ago it's one

35
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,719
thing you never forget and that's like

36
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,239
riding a bike you never forget how to

37
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,798
milk a cow and the tour guide was just

38
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,519
blown away that I could milk a cow and I

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,920
did it rather effectively I also got

40
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:39,640
really excited about this anerobic

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,719
digestor back there and he said we've

42
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,560
never had a tourist who could milk a cow

43
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:45,798
and got it excited about the

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,600
manure uh I grew up on a little farm in

45
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:49,439
Wisconsin had a pet Crow named Carl

46
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,679
although recently I realized it may have

47
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,319
been Carla but you know when you're 9

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,840
years old you don't have that kind of

49
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:58,078
conversation with your pets spend time

50
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,240
in a Marine Corps Vietnam veteran I tell

51
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,639
this story because it helps with a lot

52
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,920
of different

53
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,039
audiences I'm not just a professor going

54
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,280
to talk to this group I'm part of

55
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,159
it um I've also held leadership roles at

56
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,239
Cornell and when you're in one of those

57
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,439
roles you're supposed to see the big

58
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,439
picture you can't just be an enologist

59
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:22,560
anymore I'm also a parent climate change

60
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:25,079
is

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,159
personal going affect my

62
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,959
daughters and lastly the homeland

63
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,519
security motto is if you see something

64
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,000
say something I'm here to say something

65
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:37,879
okay how many

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,400
trekkies probably how' they get their

67
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:44,359
food replicat replicators right so what

68
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,239
happens with they blew both their

69
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,280
engines throughout the what was the guy

70
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,280
the Klingons you know they're

71
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,719
incapacitated they're lost out in space

72
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,360
in trouble they had to be

73
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,439
self-sufficient kind of looks like the

74
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,400
same place our situation we don't have a

75
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:01,719
whole lot of places to go got to take

76
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,760
care of what we

77
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:06,799
have and I think it's better to tell the

78
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,798
truth make you a little

79
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,199
uncomfortable so here we go all right

80
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,039
this is the Endeavor first time I saw

81
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:20,280
this what a remarkable selfie

82
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:22,120
but that orange band is the

83
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,560
troposphere right here about this part

84
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,719
of the world's maybe five six miles high

85
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,519
that's where the action occurs that's

86
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:30,759
where 80% of the climate change activity

87
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,400
occurs

88
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:36,000
it's like a very very thin

89
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,519
blanket solar radiation comes down hits

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,400
the surface of the Earth if it's white

91
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,280
snow most of that energy is reflected

92
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,879
back if it comes down and hits a dark

93
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,360
surface it's absorbed that some of that

94
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:49,120
energy is then irradiated in as I and I

95
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,080
just learned this the other day

96
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,879
listening to Toby alt if you had a

97
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,640
candle in your hand and you feel the

98
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:57,679
warmth is it the actual air that's

99
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,039
warming

100
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,640
up it's not it's the radiant energy so

101
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,359
it's that same kind of energy reflecting

102
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,679
off the surface of the planet hits

103
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,319
carbon uh greenhouse gases which are

104
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,360
essential to life on the planet and some

105
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:13,679
of those are reflected back so we're

106
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,280
simply adding more and more greenhouse

107
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,600
gases to that thin little layer that

108
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,599
blanket is getting thicker it is getting

109
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,319
warmer one of the carbon do one of the

110
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,478
greenhouse gases carbon dioxide on the

111
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,038
bottom is year 1,000 to year 2000 you

112
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,519
can see the Industrial Revolution tion

113
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:34,839
how quickly things have changed when we

114
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,839
started burning fossil fuels fossil fuel

115
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:40,439
uh we should be at about 270 parts per

116
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:43,799
million we're now at 404 more or less

117
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:45,680
40% above normal if we keep going

118
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,520
business as usual will it hit 900 parts

119
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,240
per million that means we'll have 60

120
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,758
days here in this part of the world

121
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,120
above 90 degrees in the summertime very

122
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,680
different nothing new Tindle hand others

123
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,120
had this worked out in the 1800s what a

124
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,319
greenhouse gas is all about one of the

125
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,959
things that's I've had farmers say to me

126
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,719
is when I mentioned this carbon 12 is

127
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:08,959
actually increasing the atmosphere and

128
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,639
it comes from the burning of ancient

129
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:14,758
plants or fossil fuels it's another

130
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:17,240
direct indicator that the burning of

131
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,479
fossil fuels is changing the atmosphere

132
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,038
and I think this is 97 out of 100

133
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:23,918
scientists agree we are the cause

134
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:26,959
climate change is happening I think it's

135
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:30,478
now 99 out of

136
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:33,439
100 pretty solid evidence another way to

137
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:35,519
look at this is the atmosphere is a

138
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,680
bathtub we're filling it up with

139
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,359
greenhouse

140
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:44,478
gases the natural systems which would be

141
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:47,600
the drain the oceans the plants Etc to

142
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:50,719
absorb the greenhouse gases in the

143
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,280
atmosphere uh can no longer keep up

144
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,039
we're putting more water in more

145
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:58,119
greenhouse gases the drain has not

146
00:05:54,038 --> 00:06:00,800
changed the bathtub is filling

147
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,399
up the relationship ship between carbon

148
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,400
dioxide and

149
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,360
temperature going back 400,000 years we

150
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,199
all know where these data come

151
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,000
from Ice cores the ice the bubbles in

152
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,598
ice and if you look at the top you can

153
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,918
see how CO2 fluctuates over the years

154
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:23,199
from 400,000 years of current time and

155
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:26,038
so does the temperature very much

156
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:29,240
aligned CO2 decreases temperature

157
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:31,918
decreases CO2 increases temperature

158
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,598
increas es and of course here we are in

159
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,598
current times going off the

160
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:43,079
chart where does it come from

161
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,360
Transportation about a third electricity

162
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:49,359
production any idea how many cars are

163
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,360
produced per day on the

164
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:54,240
planet I just

165
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:01,520
forgot okay I'll make something up I

166
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,519
think it's like 180,000

167
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,680
day here we go how many flights

168
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,720
commercial flights a

169
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,519
day

170
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,360
93,000 these are things we take you know

171
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:18,399
we enjoy there's my 93 Volvo up there I

172
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,639
still drive that I drive so electricity

173
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,439
industry but agriculture in the US

174
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,360
contributes about 10% of greenhouse

175
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:27,839
gases worldwide it's more like 18 to 20%

176
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,120
so it's not always fair to Pro Point

177
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,638
one's finger at agriculture as a major

178
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,879
yes it's a contributor but there's a lot

179
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,160
of other sources of these greenhouse

180
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:38,080
gases so let's just summarize we've

181
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,599
gained about 1 and A2 degrees

182
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,878
globally it's warming twice as fast at

183
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:45,759
the

184
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:47,319
poles the idod the dog sled race every

185
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,598
year now they're concerned they'll even

186
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:53,158
have it and they keep moving further

187
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:55,038
north 2001 2010 the hottest decade 15

188
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:58,038
the hottest year this year will surpass

189
00:07:55,038 --> 00:08:01,158
all previous years hotter Summers warmer

190
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:03,759
Winters nights are warming faster than

191
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:05,120
days the rate of warming is very fast

192
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,319
we're going to gain as much heat in the

193
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,800
next 100 years as we have since the last

194
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:13,319
ice age and again you can't turn this

195
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,720
off even if we sto and really behave

196
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,080
today it'll take hundreds if not

197
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,159
thousands of years to sort of

198
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:20,598
equilibrate and the distinction between

199
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:22,918
climate and weather weather is what's

200
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:26,598
happening outside today over shortterm

201
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:30,279
climate is decades in length so we Face

202
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:31,439
a challenge a Grand Challenge

203
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:34,240
the

204
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,158
evidence with a few exceptions when I

205
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,879
did my Ted X talk we looked for great

206
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:41,479
pictures of glaciers and we had this

207
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:43,278
beautiful one I thought let me check and

208
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,480
was actually highlighted because it was

209
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:48,600
one of the few glaciers that's actually

210
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:52,240
growing we didn't use that picture

211
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:55,040
Glaciers are melting um worldwide this

212
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,320
is an important source of irrigation

213
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:00,679
water and chili in a lot of other

214
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,320
countries uh if you haven't been to

215
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:05,838
Glacier National Park I suggest you get

216
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:09,120
there soon because the glaciers will be

217
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,160
gone in about 20 years and talking to my

218
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,159
daughters about where they want to go

219
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:16,480
next year and they want to go to Glacier

220
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:20,759
Park while the Glaciers are still

221
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,278
there this is summer sea ice the Arctic

222
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:27,759
this is a actually I looked just today

223
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:30,399
at where we are with uh retreating sea

224
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:33,759
ice in the summertime it rapidly freezes

225
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:37,240
over and is rapidly freezing right now

226
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:39,519
but this is an image of in September and

227
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,759
you can see it's about 700,000 square

228
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,600
miles less than it should be when you

229
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,759
compare to historical records so here's

230
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,920
an example of where solar radiation

231
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:53,360
comes in it's absorbed by that deep blue

232
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:55,479
ocean warms the water melts more ice you

233
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,480
get

234
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:04,399
it there's actually uh and a concern as

235
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:06,078
the passage is open here because it will

236
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,120
well one there's a military concern

237
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:11,879
because of more Russian and Chinese

238
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,240
transport but also invasive species that

239
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:16,078
exist in buges and ships because the

240
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,560
ships are going to get from point A to

241
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:20,120
point B much faster there's a likelihood

242
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,799
of more of those kind of invasives being

243
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,799
moved around the

244
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,480
planet oceans are changing 30% more

245
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,920
acidic than they should be the rising

246
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,959
thermal expansion accounts for about a

247
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,679
third of that much more comes from

248
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,838
melting GLA

249
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,519
glaciers obviously I think most

250
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,600
everyone's aware the acidification is

251
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,600
affecting shell forming

252
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:47,559
organisms how many have hugged a

253
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:50,799
redwood kind of hard not to

254
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:55,000
right uh these are these the largest

255
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:56,359
creatures on Earth living no okay well

256
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,519
they're big they're massive and they're

257
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,919
hard not to

258
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,720
hug so in the Sierra

259
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,919
invasive species and other plants are

260
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,639
moving up the sieras because of warming

261
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,958
conditions so someone asked a question

262
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,039
what about the Redwoods well it turns

263
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,078
out they're just this narrow band of

264
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:13,039
perfect soil conditions for the Redwoods

265
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:15,359
so in time they're already under stress

266
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:19,240
but in time they will be compromised by

267
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,360
warming temperatures even these Grand

268
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,360
creatures so let's talk about

269
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,240
agriculture and food security with all

270
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,278
these changes it's no longer business as

271
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,240
usual there's more variability more risk

272
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,240
the impacts are local local to Global

273
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,200
food production is moving North we've

274
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:38,399
essentially shifted close to one

275
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,639
planting zone North this obviously has

276
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,839
impact for farmers in Manitoba where

277
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,839
they've expanded grain

278
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,720
production growing seasons are longer

279
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:52,278
we've gained about 10 days here out west

280
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,800
it's more 19 the Northwest 16

281
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:57,559
days but that doesn't necessarily mean

282
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,838
additional growing days for Farmers

283
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:02,078
because of more extreme weather

284
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,680
we're having wet spells in the

285
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:06,638
spring or in the fall that interferes

286
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:10,199
with Harvest or

287
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,600
planting some of our farmers are

288
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,360
uh I heard Dave wolf mentioned this a

289
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,040
while back where they're splitting their

290
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,600
planting they get in early while they

291
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:19,599
have a dry period early spring with a

292
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,360
long season corn and then they'll wait

293
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,440
for the sort of the the wet spell and

294
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,320
then they'll come in with a short

295
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,839
seasoned corn later on so they still get

296
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,399
a

297
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,040
crop and we're having more heavy

298
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,039
precipitation of events especially in

299
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:33,039
the Northeast were up

300
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:40,518
71% there was um Libby pumpkin which

301
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,159
grows 90% of their excuse me grows

302
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:44,919
almost all their pumpkins within 90

303
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:48,240
miles of their processing facility in

304
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:50,120
Illinois in 2012 they had a very wet

305
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,360
spring in

306
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,959
2014 a very wet fall uh which meant

307
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,000
planting or harvesting of pumpkins was

308
00:12:55,958 --> 00:13:00,599
compromised I think in 2012 they had

309
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,600
about half the crop the nor wood and

310
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,360
they produce almost all the pumpkin f

311
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:08,600
pie filling in the US this is

312
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,039
serious we're talking about pumpkin pie

313
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,079
filling but it's an example of

314
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,639
diversification spread out your risk

315
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:17,519
don't plant all your pumpkins close to

316
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:20,759
the

317
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:24,480
plant and this is a quote from a farmer

318
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:26,159
uh we've done some videos of farmers

319
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,959
interviewing them their perceptions of

320
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,958
climate change and just happen to go to

321
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:32,159
this this Farm right after a heavy

322
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:34,319
downpour and he had lost $80,000 worth

323
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,799
of Al Alpa seed he had just planted it

324
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,959
but with the Heavy Rain everything was

325
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:39,039
washed away as a farmer you can weather

326
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,078
the storm but you can't weather

327
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:44,480
continuous

328
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:46,679
storms panan in 2014 they had 5 Ines of

329
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,920
rain and 4 hours ice slip Down The Long

330
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:53,879
Island had 18 in in 24 hours there more

331
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:57,319
of these U events are

332
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:59,078
occurring and this is where I really get

333
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,920
into the climate change for job security

334
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:05,319
dir sake they're more insects excuse me

335
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:07,879
the likelihood of with longer Seasons

336
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,000
more Generations uh new inv bases coming

337
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:12,759
in the bottom the corn near worm down

338
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,839
here what is a pest primarily of sweet

339
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:16,839
corn historically when I started that

340
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:20,519
Cornell it was a late season

341
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:24,040
corn late season pest now it's here year

342
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,039
round presumably because now it can

343
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,079
overwinter last week there was a forum

344
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:35,039
in Washington DC on uh climate and Pest

345
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:37,239
and I heard Lou zisa a weed scientist

346
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,120
talk about some of his work and it was

347
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,159
just

348
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,240
amazing he found a he had a call from

349
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,399
someone in the ARs lab and say we got

350
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,240
this old seed that's like 60 years old

351
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,919
should we throw it away and he said ah

352
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,879
yeah sure then he went wait a

353
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:56,198
minute that seed those plants grew under

354
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:58,519
much lower CO2 levels than what we have

355
00:14:56,198 --> 00:15:01,159
today and he did some comparisons there

356
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:03,799
clearly the the weeds have evolved but

357
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:05,559
he summarized his talk like this

358
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:07,399
preliminary suggests that weeds May

359
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:09,439
impose greater limitations on Crop

360
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,559
Production than earlier assumed the

361
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,240
worst weeds often wild relatives of crop

362
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:15,239
may be able to better adapt to increase

363
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,759
CO2 and temperature associate with

364
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,159
future

365
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:21,079
changes at the same time adaptation

366
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:22,559
among wild weedy lines may serve as a

367
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:24,638
means to enhance adaptation of

368
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:27,000
cultivated lines Especial Especially

369
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,440
serial lines to increase production as

370
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,879
CO2 increases so we're going to both be

371
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,759
fighting weeds but also learning from

372
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:37,078
them and there were several other

373
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:39,399
stories at this form on crop

374
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:41,838
diseases and even insects were there

375
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:46,600
just some of these subtle but kind

376
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,600
of uh scary changes that are

377
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,680
occurring this is an interesting

378
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,800
prediction looking forward the gray band

379
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:56,439
is

380
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:59,359
historical high and low average

381
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:02,639
temperature by Year from roughly 1850 50

382
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,879
to current times and here's projections

383
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,959
the red line would be business as usual

384
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:10,198
worst case scenario and what it shows is

385
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,198
by

386
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:17,318
2050 the

387
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:20,000
coldest Year we will experience will be

388
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:24,198
above any high temperature we've ever

389
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,600
pre previous 150 years we're moving

390
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:31,000
the temperature

391
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,319
band and here here we go watch carefully

392
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,399
this is average temperatures from the

393
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:38,479
1800s to 2100 this is going to show uh

394
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,679
increasing temperatures over the next

395
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,159
150

396
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:47,679
years now we're not supposed to go by 2°

397
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:47,679
C that will happen at roughly

398
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:54,120
2028 and by the end of the century we're

399
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,720
past 5 degre

400
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,720
steep want to see that again

401
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,279
I have to one

402
00:17:03,678 --> 00:17:08,679
2:00

403
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:11,160
no one

404
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:13,400
11 all right we'll go through this one

405
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,400
more

406
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:24,640
time

407
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:25,919
okay that's looking forward in

408
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,720
temperature let's look forward in

409
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,799
precipitation patterns just find New

410
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,400
York on the map and you'll see it's

411
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:35,160
darker blue and thatched that means

412
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,160
we'll have generally increase in overall

413
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,279
precipitation annual precipitation in

414
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,919
the winter and the

415
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:44,519
spring fall so so summer is a little

416
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,960
drier but then look at the

417
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:48,038
Southwest it's going to get drier and

418
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,519
drier and

419
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:52,798
drier does that mean that we here in the

420
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:54,240
Northeast have an opportunity to

421
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:56,079
actually diversify and expand

422
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,359
agriculture because we will have water

423
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,678
in the coming

424
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:02,079
years now if anybody body follows Toby

425
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,440
Alor there's two papers one in 2015 and

426
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,119
one in

427
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,400
2016 this is the risk of a mega drought

428
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:11,759
a mega drought is 35 years in length or

429
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,640
greater the two the arrows point to

430
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:18,759
megga droughts were U civilizations

431
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:21,480
collap in in the southwest back in 1150

432
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:26,640
and about 1300 because of long-term

433
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:29,120
droughts but the odds of us having a

434
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:33,360
mega drought went from the first page to

435
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:35,558
80% to 99% in the

436
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,839
southwest that has an extraordinary

437
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:41,200
impact on agriculture in California

438
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:44,480
agriculture in Mexico and U just

439
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,480
communities there and cities as

440
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:50,439
well and you know if you can make a

441
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,000
dollar on something why not there's a

442
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,000
beer called Global warmer it's actually

443
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,640
a very good beer it's seasonal I have no

444
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,200
idea why it's seasonal CU I can't always

445
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,159
get it but the little on the back it

446
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,000
said extended Refrigeration at retail

447
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:06,919
magnifies beers carbon footprint please

448
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,919
enjoy as soon as

449
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:12,480
possible comes in a four pack okay let's

450
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:15,200
go out to dinner so growing food is

451
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,079
changing Supply chains are changing

452
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,000
price volatility is increasing and I had

453
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:20,240
the opportunity three four years ago to

454
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,960
actually meet with the president of

455
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,640
craft food at that time she's a Cornel

456
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,679
Alum and I brought up climate change and

457
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,360
she paused and

458
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:32,720
said price volatility is is costing us

459
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:34,918
about $3 billion a year we're a big

460
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,360
company but that's a lot of money so

461
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:38,360
this is a business issue as

462
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:44,158
well we got to start with the right

463
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:48,200
ingredients for a good

464
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:50,679
meal agava grown in Northern Mexico and

465
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,120
it's been subject to the drought it's a

466
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:55,080
10-year crop it's under severe pressure

467
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,639
we're messing with

468
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:59,639
tequila cor trees around the

469
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,640
Mediterranean with higher temperatures

470
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,520
the bark is changing and they make like

471
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,919
a billion corks a year it's a big deal

472
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:08,679
but if you drink really good stuff that

473
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:10,799
where the cork is important because

474
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:14,240
there's a breathability issue uh that's

475
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:16,158
changing so your product will be

476
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,880
different and they're

477
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,400
considering synthetic corks Etc but the

478
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,000
cork trees are changing which is having

479
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:28,159
an impact on this these kind of

480
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
beverages um olives some are grown in

481
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,240
California

482
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,440
but the point there is California is

483
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,319
starting to lose its Winter Chill which

484
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,519
is essential for fruit in many nut crops

485
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,399
and in the longer term UCF did a report

486
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:43,759
and I think they're going they said

487
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,080
they're going to lose about 40% of their

488
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:46,640
Winter Chill by the middle of the

489
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:48,879
century that's going to affect plums

490
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,159
peaches pears apricots grapes you name

491
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,880
it in the longer term that's a kind of a

492
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,120
ominous change or subtle change in the

493
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,440
background that a lot of people don't

494
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,439
fully appreciate

495
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,440
if you're producing uh whiskey in

496
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,839
Kentucky the angel is getting a bigger

497
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,558
share there's evaporation through the

498
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:13,158
oak barrels the oak oak barrels are

499
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:13,158
stored essentially out of doors

500
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,600
in there the term they're buildings but

501
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,360
they're open to the outside so as

502
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:21,959
temperatures increase there's more

503
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:23,678
evaporation and more loss of alcohol

504
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,919
through the Oak and it's actually enough

505
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,440
that they're getting a little worried

506
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:30,520
and they call let the Angels share well

507
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,519
at least the angels are happy

508
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:35,839
okay salad uh avocado production in

509
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,400
California will be off about 40% in 30

510
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,599
years because of increasing temperatures

511
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,880
it's hard to grow organic tomatoes in

512
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,558
this part of the world now because of

513
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,360
these early heavy downpours and the risk

514
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:46,440
of Lake light so they have to be grown

515
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,879
under

516
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,798
plastic if you're going to grow lettuce

517
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,278
in Selena Valley in the future you'll

518
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:56,440
probably need to switch to more uh heat

519
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:58,679
tolerant varieties uh wine is affected

520
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,640
because grapes are very sensitive to

521
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:02,960
temperatures changes so that's going to

522
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,320
affect California grapes and maybe be an

523
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,319
advantage for us grain production

524
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:11,359
worldwide is off a little because of

525
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:15,119
more extreme in

526
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:17,599
weather lobsters off the coast of Maine

527
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,558
they've moved North 50 mies the oceans

528
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,119
off the coast of main are warming eight

529
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:23,480
times faster than most any other place

530
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:25,678
on the planet it's also affected the

531
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,960
shrimp industry which is pretty much

532
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:31,000
crashed if there were saffron in this

533
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,519
rice most saffron has grown in Iran but

534
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,119
about 10 to 15% is from Kashmir and

535
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,599
India because of changes in

536
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,239
precipitation patterns and temperatures

537
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:42,079
they're going out of business and it's

538
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,480
affecting thousands of farmers in that

539
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:47,599
part of the

540
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:51,038
world and I I don't even want to talk

541
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:54,119
about this one but yes

542
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:56,640
coffee it happened to be in Costa Rica

543
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:58,719
as I mentioned a few years ago and walk

544
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,480
through some coffee plantations and you

545
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,720
know it's getting warmer and warmer so

546
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,079
they simply move up the side of the

547
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:07,000
mountains a little further but obviously

548
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:10,399
they're going to run out of space

549
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,440
uh cof there's a coffee bore spreading

550
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,960
worldwide in part related to climate

551
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,880
change that's also impacting industry uh

552
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,759
vanilla grown on the coast of Madagascar

553
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,360
is moving Inland because of more storms

554
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:23,278
increased Transportation cost of cocoa

555
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:26,278
probably move from Western Africa to

556
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:28,480
Central and South America so the point

557
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:31,119
is if you go to next time you go to

558
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,079
restaurant just look at the all that's

559
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,479
available to us and changes occurring

560
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:39,439
but what

561
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:41,000
if you're in a country poor where

562
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,480
agriculture is rainfed and you really

563
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,839
have limited resources so this we Face a

564
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,839
food security challenge globally it's a

565
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:49,639
national security challenge it's a moral

566
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:51,278
challenge there are arguments that the

567
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,000
war in Syria started because of a

568
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,960
long-term drought started driven by

569
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,519
climate

570
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:01,319
change and actually a few years ago

571
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:03,960
there was a conference on

572
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:05,519
campus Chris Barrett L it this was not

573
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,960
the one that really big one last year

574
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:08,839
but about four or five years ago was

575
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,319
actually funded by the

576
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:14,000
CIA they do that um and they publish

577
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,678
they're in the background but I was part

578
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,480
of that sort of background dialogue

579
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:22,480
which was kind of

580
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,480
interesting so I was had the honor

581
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,519
privilege of being in Vietnam in March

582
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,440
and here's a country the makon 17

583
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:32,000
million people living 5 ft above sea

584
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,519
level they're already affected by

585
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,240
saltwater intrusion and some other

586
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:38,398
complications but it's a land and a

587
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,480
people on water which is just remarkable

588
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:42,678
to watch but you can also Envision what

589
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,519
would happen what will happen with sea

590
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:46,919
level rise and they have also 2,000

591
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:46,918
miles of

592
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,798
Coastline it's a beautiful country if

593
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,359
anybody gets a chance to go there just

594
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:57,079
remarkable and wonderful people and just

595
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:58,759
for the record we're actually planning

596
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:00,879
to take students here in January and one

597
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:03,558
of the internationalizing Cornell

598
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,039
curriculum programs to spend two weeks

599
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:08,200
in the

600
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:11,038
makon food secur is in the News Press

601
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:14,120
picks this up sharp swings in ingredient

602
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:17,119
prices we're aware of so on so there's

603
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:21,398
this concern in the food

604
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:24,079
industry and another example of uh a

605
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:26,239
potential conflict with Rising Waters in

606
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:29,678
Bangladesh and changing temperatures in

607
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:33,278
India movement of people

608
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,679
in multiple countries with nuclear

609
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:38,038
weapons and it's a moral issue I'm sure

610
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,480
you've heard the pope came out in

611
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,599
support of getting her act together

612
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:47,159
there have been religious summus the Dal

613
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:47,158
Lama har Desman 22

614
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:54,199
Etc all right we take a breath we get

615
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:57,038
pretty depressed overwhelmed by all of

616
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,640
this so I guess we could move we could

617
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:02,480
ignore deny we're too busy it's actually

618
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,799
in part not in our DNA we're not

619
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,759
responsive to threats that are far in

620
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:09,679
the future or somewhere else we're more

621
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:11,158
of the immediate we respond to immediate

622
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,880
threats and generally life is good and

623
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:14,880
we're busy leave me

624
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:22,079
alone so a call to

625
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:24,398
action and if it's a short book written

626
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,678
by Mary Piper it's called The Green Boat

627
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:28,759
and She lays out and it's her personal

628
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:31,000
story on how she as one person person

629
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:33,119
made a change related to climate change

630
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,759
it was actually related to

631
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,038
energy become aware listen to the

632
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:41,759
science accept

633
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:43,720
it this was the O shoot moment or

634
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:46,240
otherwise and

635
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,519
enact and I love this quote from Zorba

636
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,079
the Greek To Live is to roll up your

637
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:50,398
sleeves and embrace trouble and I think

638
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:53,240
we've got something to put our arms

639
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:55,918
around right here at

640
00:26:53,240 --> 00:27:00,000
Cornell so I'm going to talk about some

641
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:02,120
of the things going on here at Cornell

642
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,839
both on the sort of the academic side

643
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:07,558
but also the operations facility

644
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:10,119
side I think you're all aware this is a

645
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:11,639
land grant but in particular we have

646
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:13,639
Incredible strength in climate change

647
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:17,120
and agriculture we have

648
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:19,200
much uh capacity beyond that but we have

649
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,359
particular strength at the Nexus of

650
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,000
climate change and

651
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,719
Agriculture and I made a list of some of

652
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,720
the things going on and there's many

653
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:31,319
more um strength and PL breeding soil

654
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:35,079
Health nutrient

655
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:37,240
Management Hot cows give less milk I

656
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:39,558
sometimes show a picture of some

657
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,000
research out of UC Davis and it shows a

658
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:43,720
picture of a dairy cow on a platform and

659
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,319
there's a shower the cow is getting a

660
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,319
shower and the the idea was a cow comes

661
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:50,678
in gets the shower cools off and leaves

662
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:51,960
trouble is the cows didn't leave they

663
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:54,200
just stayed there so they had to put a

664
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,679
little kicking device to get cows to

665
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,558
move on we have exceptional talent in

666
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,200
communication and climate change water

667
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:04,079
management IPM Etc we have the Northeast

668
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,880
climate center it's a collaborative

669
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:07,678
environment it's the right place to take

670
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:11,240
on this

671
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:14,240
challenge we have the Atkinson

672
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,798
Center Innovative research they have a

673
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,558
climate Forum making connections through

674
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,038
topical

675
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:24,200
lunches some new initiatives the US

676
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:28,879
climate change hubs created in

677
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:32,000
2014 there's actually a sub subhub on

678
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,480
campus at the ar ar facility um but

679
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,759
their their agenda is to bring all

680
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:41,200
parties together land grants extension

681
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:43,480
stakeholders non or NGS Etc and

682
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,558
coordinate their efforts there's also

683
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,480
the relatively new Cornel Institute for

684
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:49,720
climate smart Solutions which focuses

685
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,798
primarily on agriculture right now the

686
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,798
climate smart farming

687
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:56,960
program this is an example of what

688
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,519
happening the climate smart Farm

689
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,440
extension team this is the first in the

690
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:02,519
country where six of our Educators

691
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,000
actually have part of the responsibility

692
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:06,679
is to work on climate change they're

693
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,398
distributed around the state they have

694
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:12,360
different responsibilities most are with

695
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:12,359
regional

696
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:16,599
teams and the other thing being

697
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,320
developed by The Institute are tools

698
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:20,079
there's a growing degree day tool we

699
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:22,759
don't do it these are the faculty and

700
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:26,158
programmers Etc we help facilitate this

701
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:27,839
there's a freeze risk tool and somewhat

702
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,919
relevant to this drought for this last

703
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,759
year there's also an irrigation

704
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:37,000
scheduler that looks out 30 days and

705
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:39,398
gives probability about uh plant stress

706
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,558
given different scenarios and you can

707
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:43,759
put in soil type you can put in crop

708
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:46,720
type you can put in location and it'll

709
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:52,119
give it for your particular this kind of

710
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,120
prediction for your particular Farm or

711
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,278
location so Cornell walking the walk I'm

712
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,640
not sure sure how many follow this but

713
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:02,440
we are now committed to carbon

714
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,080
neutrality by

715
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,240
2035 that's a really big deal it's a

716
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:09,038
really big

717
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,440
challenge we have a climate action plan

718
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:11,798
that's been around for several years

719
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,840
that has something like 60

720
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:16,759
recommendations to help us get to a

721
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:19,000
lower carbon

722
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:20,558
footprint uh two years ago there was an

723
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,880
acceleration working groups and how do

724
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:24,158
we speed that all up I Cod shared that

725
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,720
more recently there's a senior

726
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,159
leadership campus committee that just

727
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,839
released their report a couple weeks ago

728
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,559
on how to get us to carbon neutrality as

729
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:34,558
mentioned early on there's also the

730
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:36,480
president sustainable campus committee

731
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:39,000
they have responsibility

732
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,720
for implementation of a lot of these

733
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,278
recommendations and as an institution

734
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,960
we're a living laboratory faculty and

735
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:51,440
staff can work on these issues together

736
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:55,159
and it's a big

737
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:59,240
place 21,000 students 1,600 faculty

738
00:30:55,159 --> 00:31:02,360
8,000 staff 600 buildings 2,000 acres of

739
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:05,359
land 25,000 light

740
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:05,359
switches

741
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:14,599
annual here's this summarizes the

742
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:18,440
greenhouse gas emissions this is

743
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:21,398
basically 2008 to 2014 in 2010 we went

744
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:24,960
from coal L heat and power plant runal

745
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:27,239
gas so this shows the combustion

746
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,919
emissions obviously dropped in 2010 when

747
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,919
we got off coal

748
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,679
we have to buy electricity but we're

749
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,278
buying less after 2010 because now we

750
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:40,639
produce a lot of

751
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:43,480
it commuting is a big deal lot a travel

752
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:45,558
Believe It or Not sports teams do a lot

753
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,558
of

754
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:51,480
travel air travel and then some of this

755
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,038
is offset a little bit by Forest

756
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,798
sequestration and the fact that

757
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:59,798
uh we're also selling on occasion

758
00:31:56,798 --> 00:31:59,798
electricity

759
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:05,558
and um this shows the net emissions

760
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,519
essentially a 30% decrease over that

761
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:10,798
time span and at the same time an energy

762
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:12,519
conservation initiative helped the

763
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:15,759
campus actually grew by about

764
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:18,638
20% Mike why does it appear that it has

765
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:18,638
gone back

766
00:32:19,558 --> 00:32:27,638
up unusually cold winter in

767
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:30,398
2014 thank you okay I'm going to bear

768
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:30,398
with me what

769
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,120
time 10 minutes okay all right I'll just

770
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:37,359
summarize rather quickly what has been

771
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:39,678
done I think you're familiar with Lake

772
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:42,959
Source cooling this has reduced energy

773
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,960
use to cool the campus by

774
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:48,359
86% combined heat and power plant if

775
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,558
anybody ever had a chance to tour that

776
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:52,558
it's essentially two

777
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:55,038
747 jet

778
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:58,000
engines running on natural

779
00:32:55,038 --> 00:33:00,200
gas they're producing electricity and

780
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,519
the heat the exhaust creates steam it's

781
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,240
all captured instead of

782
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:07,038
wasted solar power if you fly in and out

783
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:11,038
of Etha airport I'm sure you've seen the

784
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:14,359
solar array out there there's now one at

785
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:16,480
Geneva I think the blackout project the

786
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:18,879
wind project is has the green light I'm

787
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,720
not absolutely sure but Cornell is one

788
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,120
of the few if not the only universities

789
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,079
in the world or the US that has a

790
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:25,000
hydroelectric plant produces all of 1%

791
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:28,558
of our

792
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,759
electricity it used to produce all of it

793
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:31,918
lead

794
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:35,359
buildings anybody know what's wrong with

795
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:37,240
the the gates building right there you

796
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:39,798
see those

797
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:42,278
spins they're directly

798
00:33:39,798 --> 00:33:45,638
connected by metal to the inside so

799
00:33:42,278 --> 00:33:47,798
there's a transfer of heat out or called

800
00:33:45,638 --> 00:33:49,839
in and out and you know this is one of

801
00:33:47,798 --> 00:33:52,398
the things that changing with the new

802
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:54,839
codes don't bear with me don't let Deans

803
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:57,959
and architect put up buildings you need

804
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:59,079
an energy person there as well

805
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,639
because they got to look pretty and you

806
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:03,000
know Etc uh energy conservation if you

807
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:04,959
play tennis they put new lights out

808
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,159
there saving a lot of money about

809
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,199
$20,000 per year in energy cost and

810
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,200
there's a about 50 buildings on campus

811
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:14,279
have the stash board so I went this

812
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:15,719
morning and I checked on Bradfield

813
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,440
probably not the best building to do

814
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:20,559
this and how much energy was used but so

815
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:24,440
far this week starting Monday at 12:00

816
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:26,679
a.m. to roughly a few minutes ago uh

817
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:32,800
40,000 kwatt hours of electricity for

818
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:35,838
Bradfield um $3,600 in cost and 36,600

819
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:39,079
lb of CO2 to operate that building for

820
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:41,440
the entire year it cost about $300,000 a

821
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:42,639
year you can this is pretty easy pretty

822
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,079
handy you can go in and type in any

823
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,878
building it gives kind of immediate

824
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:49,039
feedback on energy use in a building not

825
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:50,838
only electricity but also chilled water

826
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:54,079
and uh

827
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:55,679
heat um this is a we reflec the energy

828
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,240
conservation these are new buildings

829
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,720
that were built over the year the dark

830
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:02,799
line is Square footed Square uh gross

831
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:06,000
square feet you can see the quite an

832
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,760
increase from the year 2000 to

833
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,920
2016 this is steam sails

834
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:16,119
flat electrical sails

835
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:18,358
flat chilled water flat despite a very

836
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:19,760
large increase in our number of

837
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:22,598
buildings and square footage just

838
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,040
reflects the effort that the facilities

839
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:29,400
and sustainability office put into this

840
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:29,400
so the carbon neutrality by 2035

841
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:36,520
typically these are driven by financial

842
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:38,480
reasons this is a quadruple bottom line

843
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:39,960
does a solution help Cornell fulfill its

844
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,800
academic Mission and purpose does it

845
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,800
meet the needs of the people on campus

846
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,519
and the communities will it enhance

847
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,240
overall prosperity for the campus in our

848
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:50,519
region does it support a sustainable

849
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:53,959
Planet it also

850
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:56,280
includes natural gas and the leakage

851
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,880
issue solutions for tomorrow the big one

852
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:03,480
is Earth sort Heat digging down about 2

853
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:05,318
mies to tap the warmth and uh Deep Rock

854
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,039
and using that to in part heat the

855
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:10,639
campus there's heat pumps nuclear was

856
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:12,800
actually considered or we can just buy

857
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:15,440
our way out of this through

858
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,160
offsets that's looking in the longer

859
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:21,000
term this is a depiction

860
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:24,799
of also called Deep Rock geothermal

861
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,358
going down 10 to 30,000 ft this is not a

862
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,440
trivial investment very expensive and it

863
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:31,598
be initially

864
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,639
experimental more short term what do we

865
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,559
do build more high performance buildings

866
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:38,159
concern energy uh switch over as much as

867
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:39,559
possible to electrical vehicle increase

868
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:43,358
our capacity there's this thing called

869
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:46,440
think big live green which is

870
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:48,039
um really all of us participating in

871
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,159
doing what we can in our offices and

872
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:54,719
labor Laboratories there's also a campus

873
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:59,318
climate huh not campus campus literacy

874
00:36:54,719 --> 00:37:00,679
it's climate campus literacy

875
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:02,440
I personally don't think anybody should

876
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:03,919
graduate from this institution without

877
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,358
being fully aware of climate change

878
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,639
means to their

879
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:12,719
life it's a living laboratory and

880
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:13,879
uh this climate literacy is the why

881
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:16,199
we're doing

882
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:18,440
it and there's two working groups that

883
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:20,118
are going to be formed one focused on

884
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,039
climate literacy how do we incorporate

885
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:25,358
more of that into experiences for

886
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:26,679
students and our staff and faculty and

887
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:27,920
also a group coming together and how do

888
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:30,118
we really change Behavior behavior and

889
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,559
when I say group these are the faculty

890
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:34,760
working with staff The Faculty have the

891
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:36,239
expertise and I have a personal issue

892
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:40,760
with

893
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:44,279
windows open when it's 100°

894
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:47,200
outside this one's pretty close to

895
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,920
home this is Kennedy one day I walked up

896
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:52,399
to Kennedy and Robert's Hall and there

897
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:56,280
were 13 windows open and the AC's

898
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:58,000
running hello Newman I'm in the gym my

899
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,960
hair is getting messed up because the

900
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,000
air conditioner is blowing so

901
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,599
hard the door's wide

902
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,239
open some of the stuff the simple

903
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:11,440
Behavior changes could really make a

904
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:13,078
difference I would just love to have a

905
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,760
group of students having the opportunity

906
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:17,318
to wander on campus and just start sort

907
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,359
of grading occupants these are really

908
00:38:17,318 --> 00:38:22,838
simple things but in fact they're

909
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:24,639
they're game changers um is it possible

910
00:38:22,838 --> 00:38:26,279
for the faculty to work with staff to

911
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:27,960
make these kind of changes this is Cal's

912
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,319
green that happened in

913
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,159
2011 energy conservation in several

914
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:34,318
buildings the winner was Barton lab in

915
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:37,239
Geneva but in one year we saved about2

916
00:38:34,318 --> 00:38:38,559
200,000 $23,000 in energy cost 2 million

917
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:40,838
pounds of

918
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:42,480
CO2 those are the simple things as the

919
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:45,239
experiment station which I was director

920
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:48,039
of we adopted a culture

921
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:50,078
sustainability where people were

922
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:51,719
empowered to find better ways of doing

923
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,200
things there was actually a sustainable

924
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:54,759
action team one of the things they did

925
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:57,639
on their own was to reduce the

926
00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:00,560
greenhouse footprint by 25,000 ft saving

927
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:02,078
a college $300 to $400,000 a year they

928
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:06,279
also designed a better growth chamber

929
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,280
that uses 85% less

930
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:11,440
energy

931
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:13,960
so it's a Grand

932
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,639
Challenge we can tackle this if we have

933
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,000
the will and look what we've

934
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:21,440
accomplished as a species

935
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,800
art disease gone to the Moon we have

936
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:27,720
these things called iPhones technology

937
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,480
agriculture engineering

938
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:31,480
we can do remarkable things but we have

939
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:35,079
to decide we really want to do

940
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:38,240
it so I challenge all of us get informed

941
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:39,280
stay inform accept the truth making it

942
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:42,199
personal

943
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,920
helps leading is also a good thing and

944
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:49,078
raise your

945
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:54,119
voices and it's personal two alums from

946
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:56,440
Cornell 06 and Tim when they look back

947
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:59,318
what are they going to say why didn't

948
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,318
they take action

949
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:01,879
thank

950
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:10,199
you um could you go back to the slide

951
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,358
that was on the solutions for the future

952
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:14,358
I just didn't it all

953
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:31,679
I did um what what are the current

954
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:34,119
thoughts about which one of these

955
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:38,440
solutions would be best the big one is

956
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:43,920
for S heat if

957
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:45,639
um yes very expensive to install Etc but

958
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,800
it's essentially the energy the heat

959
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:50,039
from the earth is free and it's just

960
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:53,680
just circulating and G know capturing

961
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:55,318
that heat clusion bringing it up and

962
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:58,078
it's hot water wouldn't be steamed but

963
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:59,400
that hot water then is of the turbans

964
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,640
have starting with cold water and

965
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,119
heating that up they already got hot

966
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:05,318
water to go in um they would also

967
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,200
potentially change the entire meeting

968
00:41:05,318 --> 00:41:09,679
system on campus from Steam to H water

969
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:13,399
which would be another investment but

970
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:16,759
that if it works it can be replicated is

971
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:20,358
a real game changer and that's longer

972
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:22,319
term Mike great talk um thanks for great

973
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:25,000
bringing up Brad all I think most people

974
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:28,079
don't realize how terrible that building

975
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:32,079
is the worst building with the highest

976
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:35,119
um energy cost on campus because of the

977
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:38,519
any he or air conditioning that comes in

978
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,440
goes directly out and so finally they

979
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:42,920
it's going to be handled but the comment

980
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,599
I wanted to make is is related to the

981
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:48,159
buildings in General on campus Because

982
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,400
the problem is that when buildings get

983
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:53,159
upgraded or new buildings get

984
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,280
constructed there is this apparent need

985
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:59,000
to have Platinum lead and to have these

986
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,800
beautiful buildings but at the cost of

987
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,679
the older buildings that that never get

988
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,359
a turn to to be upgraded so you get this

989
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:09,879
it's nice to have all the these

990
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:11,759
buildings um but if you spend $120

991
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,200
million on one building that means that

992
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,240
other buildings like Brash and

993
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:19,199
Emerson you know stay the same and and

994
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:22,639
is a pretty awful working environment as

995
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:22,639
well and that's a

996
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:29,039
problem St nucular in countries like

997
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,440
Germany

998
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:34,279
me what's your stance on nuclear energy

999
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,720
and countries like Germany moving away

1000
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:40,480
from given the threat of climate change

1001
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:42,279
I am an advocate for nuclear energy

1002
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,639
however there's also these new Breer

1003
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,280
reactors which are smaller and produce

1004
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:48,759
distributed energy production which we

1005
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:51,559
be much better Direction and I'm

1006
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:53,640
thinking that's where James Hanson wrote

1007
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:55,800
his book scoring my grandchildren and

1008
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:57,799
that's essentially his the his story is

1009
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,760
we need reinvest

1010
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:03,280
in newer technology and the breedo

1011
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:08,440
reactors use existing nuclear waste as a

1012
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,440
s of fuel breeder is that what you

1013
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:17,119
said so the Deep Rock Energy mention has

1014
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:19,358
that been you said it was a little

1015
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,039
experimental have other larger

1016
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:23,679
institions done it work great an Iceland

1017
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:26,480
an Iceland you don't have to go very

1018
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:30,279
cute yeah and I think there are some

1019
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,800
experimental and so part of the

1020
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,359
experiment here is they're not sure how

1021
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,359
deep they have to

1022
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,079
go if I understood one of the graphics

1023
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:43,400
that you showed for uh climate

1024
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:47,039
predictions it shows that this part of

1025
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:49,639
the country is predicted to have more

1026
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:52,400
precipitation uh on the other hand the

1027
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:57,598
temperature is also increasing so that

1028
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,599
will drive more rapid evaporation

1029
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:04,519
what's the net effect are we going to

1030
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:04,519
have more likelihood of drout events or

1031
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:11,720
less um

1032
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:15,838
globally we going to be a 30 fold

1033
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:18,838
increase in Ry events I understand it

1034
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:23,000
not that much here but it's just more

1035
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:25,239
extremes um but yes more precipitation

1036
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,960
higher temperatures and increasing

1037
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:30,279
frequency of drops but then there's also

1038
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:35,079
these increasing incidents of heavy

1039
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:35,079
downard yeah more Extreme More

1040
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:42,240
VAR my background is atomic spectroscopy

1041
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,440
and some p and um I think talk was

1042
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:47,439
really good I think we need really need

1043
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:50,318
to focus on adaptation and I think

1044
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,200
sometimes people can get distracted by

1045
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:53,519
the

1046
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:55,838
CO2 effect because the new calculation

1047
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:57,519
show doesn't take much CO2 to raise the

1048
00:44:55,838 --> 00:44:59,639
temperature

1049
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,400
and those say that the new calculations

1050
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:05,000
coming out doing at you doing

1051
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:08,039
spectroscopy analysis so I think in even

1052
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,760
keeping the um carbon neutrality is very

1053
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:12,480
important but it could be as low as this

1054
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:15,359
effect could be seen is as low as 50

1055
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,639
parts per million carbon dioxide so that

1056
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:19,679
means it's that makes it really scary

1057
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:21,679
because it's not going to take much just

1058
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:23,799
any more increase in solar radiation and

1059
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:26,199
our temperatures are going to keep going

1060
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:29,000
up so I just might don't get too

1061
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:32,318
distracted by this CO2 okay and don't so

1062
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,519
we can focus on adaptation

1063
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:38,800
y i I gave a talk yesterday I give one

1064
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:40,119
tonight give one tomorrow too and

1065
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,519
there's another side of this because you

1066
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:43,680
also see we're also seeing more and more

1067
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:47,239
solar and contributing more to Electric

1068
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:50,118
production I I want to There's Hope here

1069
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:53,558
yeah ter that comes up and actually

1070
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:58,920
mention presal called Clean Coal can you

1071
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:58,920
highlight that what that is it

1072
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,480
I'm sorry I'm

1073
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:07,879
being right that's the idea is it's

1074
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,599
lower

1075
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:12,800
sulfur yeah some of the other

1076
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,920
contaminants but not NE

1077
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,640
CO2 um I think if I understood you

1078
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:19,280
correctly you said that the contribution

1079
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:23,400
of Agriculture to greenhouse gas

1080
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:25,839
emissions in the US is lower than the

1081
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,599
world yeah we're about 10% globally it's

1082
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:28,880
18 to 20

1083
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,519
is that because the differences in

1084
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,318
agriculture or is that because in other

1085
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:35,000
places they

1086
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:37,719
like Transportation

1087
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,920
lower I think in far is agriculture

1088
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:41,959
because of rice production is anybody

1089
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,358
help me out on that well agriculture is

1090
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:46,358
a large part of the GDP for a lot of

1091
00:46:44,358 --> 00:46:49,199
those countries we have also a lot of

1092
00:46:46,358 --> 00:46:52,400
energy use in Industries that's probably

1093
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:54,439
a prim for Reas it's just relative right

1094
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:58,358
it is so much actual change in the

1095
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:58,358
agriculture it's more that

1096
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,519
right yeah another problem with those

1097
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:06,000
statistics is there's a lot of embodied

1098
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:08,759
energy and embodied greenhouse gas

1099
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,760
emissions in what we import so actually

1100
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:14,160
our footprint is much larger than it

1101
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,800
appears if you just analiz the emissions

1102
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:18,480
country by

1103
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:20,240
country it is disproportionate though

1104
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,119
10% of our

1105
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:28,279
GDP agriculture is not 10% of our GDP is

1106
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:31,680
much less it's like 3% or 4% dis still a

1107
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:31,680
disproportionate impact on

1108
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:38,039
agriculture so thank you for the

1109
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:41,118
presentation I thought it felt really

1110
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:45,440
nice to know like we can all do these

1111
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:47,079
small parts to decrease our own energy

1112
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:50,880
usage

1113
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:54,160
but if it is if we do our small part

1114
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:57,599
that it is such an insignificant part of

1115
00:47:54,159 --> 00:48:01,078
still and that we're all operating in

1116
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:03,680
this very high energy environment we

1117
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:06,880
justify it because we are working in

1118
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:09,239
things like better climate change

1119
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,519
farming and and we're all working

1120
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:14,799
towards some greater goal but what is

1121
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,838
quel University doing as an institution

1122
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,800
to

1123
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:21,679
systematically change this high

1124
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,359
energy

1125
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:27,558
output well I tried to share as much as

1126
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:31,558
I could what Cornell is doing referring

1127
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:34,000
on the operation side

1128
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:38,839
um do a lot more

1129
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:41,880
but ad of like the university as

1130
00:48:38,838 --> 00:48:45,599
a you know you're talking to the person

1131
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:47,079
at C but who else is Cornell talking to

1132
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:50,280
there is some major

1133
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:51,079
players I'm going to slee around this

1134
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,480
wait I'm

1135
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:56,519
sorry I just happened to look at some

1136
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,920
upper Administration positions across

1137
00:48:56,519 --> 00:49:01,960
the country proos

1138
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,720
being climate change is not included in

1139
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:08,720
those

1140
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:10,798
job I me find that Prett sad um I

1141
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:13,118
think we have trustees that don't

1142
00:49:10,798 --> 00:49:13,119
believe in

1143
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:25,118
clim I I wonder like when you think

1144
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,640
about okay that the Southwest is going

1145
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:29,920
to you know get Dr an AG culture is

1146
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:32,199
going to be moved um to another

1147
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:36,480
centralized somewhere else I guess I

1148
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:38,679
fear that we will just repeat the same

1149
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,639
issues with centralized agriculture I

1150
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:42,558
mean maybe we'll have new energy sources

1151
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:46,118
and things like that but we'll still

1152
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:49,319
have this great demand to move stuff

1153
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:51,720
around uh for fertilizer for you know

1154
00:49:49,318 --> 00:49:55,719
all that stuff like so it feels like to

1155
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:58,358
me is or I guess I question are there um

1156
00:49:55,719 --> 00:49:59,879
as many efforts going towards some kind

1157
00:49:58,358 --> 00:50:02,838
of I know that it's happening at a

1158
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:05,119
Grassroots level um to see decentralize

1159
00:50:02,838 --> 00:50:07,400
some of Agriculture but I do have this

1160
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:09,519
spere that will just move it somewhere

1161
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,000
else and still have the distribution

1162
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:15,199
question Transportation cost and all

1163
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:17,760
that sort yeah yeah and you know energy

1164
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:21,639
need

1165
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:26,280
yeah Harold knows the answer

1166
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:27,838
that um let's hope not uh I mean I just

1167
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,040
we're the process of trying to put

1168
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:31,880
together a USDA proposal right now that

1169
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:34,480
looks at the Northeast

1170
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:36,119
and preparing for climate change and it

1171
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,679
has transportation components that has

1172
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:39,480
the whole food chain involved we trying

1173
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:40,838
to get them all in the room kind of

1174
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,039
layout scenarios of what it's going to

1175
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:43,119
look like in the future and how do we

1176
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:45,639
work

1177
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:48,079
together that's my answer it's very

1178
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:49,920
complicated enormous amounts of money a

1179
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:52,720
lot of food growing maybe in the wrong

1180
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,280
places and then you think of global

1181
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:57,838
shocks

1182
00:50:54,280 --> 00:51:01,359
um you know what what if California

1183
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:02,440
agriculture does collapse there in 2060

1184
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:04,239
what does that mean globally where's the

1185
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,920
say newk going to get it food there

1186
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:08,318
actually I would contract contacted a

1187
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:10,159
while back by someone in y York City

1188
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:11,558
trying to find a group of a Consulting

1189
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:12,798
Group that would come in and help them

1190
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:14,119
understand where the food come from

1191
00:51:12,798 --> 00:51:17,039
because of

1192
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:19,160
PL the that's kind of the driver if you

1193
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:21,358
get Metropolitan are asking those

1194
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:22,759
questions then we can make some change

1195
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:26,000
one thing I

1196
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:28,680
say seems to me like some some work well

1197
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,440
work to would just be in the on the

1198
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:33,118
consumer level about this idea of eating

1199
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,039
locally and not eating everything every

1200
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:39,000
season you know

1201
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:40,719
that's one more like we have a

1202
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,920
greenhouse and hoop house operation so

1203
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:45,118
we're trying to do it centrally we have

1204
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:47,559
a corn burn stove and a p stove so we

1205
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,480
cance and we're selling out of all of

1206
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:52,160
our Tomatoes you know so local

1207
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:53,798
production because you can make it fresh

1208
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:55,399
you can have it taste good so it still

1209
00:51:53,798 --> 00:51:58,159
tastes all of its flavor and of all its

1210
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:00,280
nutrients and if it's done Lo it is a

1211
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:02,558
way to adapt to the climate change and

1212
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:05,640
it does work well and Market it as lower

1213
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:09,480
carbon footprint and selling all

1214
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:09,480
out all right let's thank

1215
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:17,480
M again this has been a production of
