1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,878
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,880
University so well uh welcome and um

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,039
let's see what we can say here this is

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:20,359
the title this talk is based on a paper

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,679
that's been published in geoderma U last

6
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:24,640
year and I want to First give credit to

7
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,759
my co-authors I should say before so you

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,359
won't be disappointed U I don't actually

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,640
have any citizen science data that I've

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,280
worked on myself self so the idea of

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,480
this paper was the second author is Miss

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,359
uh misso who's a PhD student at

13
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:42,119
Wisconsin under Professor aul who's an

14
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:44,799
old colleague of mine who I work with a

15
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:48,159
lot in China he's at Wisconsin and China

16
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:50,718
and her whole thesis her old PhD thesis

17
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:53,119
is on using volunteer Geographic data

18
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,120
which is a big issue and she came to

19
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,558
visit me here a couple of years ago a

20
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,439
year year and a half ago and we got

21
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:01,280
talking about could this be used for the

22
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:04,118
area that most interested in which is

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,840
digital soil mapping and uh we decided

24
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:07,599
Well let's sit down and and write a

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,040
concept paper about this which is what

26
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,319
we've done and the third author many of

27
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,960
you know Steve carile is a retired soil

28
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:17,478
surveyor lives up in Aurora and a very

29
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:20,239
keen Observer not only of the soil

30
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:21,679
landscape but a quite a thinker about

31
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,559
interacting with the different

32
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,479
stakeholders so he gave us a lot of

33
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,600
really good ideas and so we have him

34
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:29,920
together so it's based on this paper and

35
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:33,599
if you like to read the paper then

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,560
you'll learn more um to my great

37
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,798
amazement after a little bit of uh few

38
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,040
weeks it was then actually cited in an

39
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,880
nature editorial as an example of even

40
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,439
soil scientists are thinking about

41
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:48,158
citizen science so it was like citizen

42
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:50,679
science is a big deal which I'll explain

43
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,399
in a minute but wow even soil science is

44
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,439
getting involved and they kind of took

45
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,718
my abstract and put it here so that was

46
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,319
pretty cool but uh the paper has not

47
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:01,280
been cited too many times so I don't

48
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:03,438
know if anyone has done much with it but

49
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,960
anyway a mention in nature makes my

50
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,079
mother proud very

51
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,679
good anyway some of you may well know

52
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,120
about citizen science I want to give the

53
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,878
background in citizen science then talk

54
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,800
about how it's been used in soil science

55
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:20,280
more in general but then focus in on

56
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,680
could it be used in the more technical

57
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,560
aspect of soil mapping and that's my my

58
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,480
main interest but let's talk about

59
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,159
citizen science in a more General sense

60
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,238
uh this quote I can't remember where

61
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:34,079
that's from actually uh the idea here is

62
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,280
the citizen and we could maybe call The

63
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,159
non-sp Specialist might be the word they

64
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,919
act as either the Observer the

65
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,479
experimentalists but this is within a

66
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:44,119
structure that's set up by the

67
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,039
professional science that's why we don't

68
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,400
call it a hobby and you'll see in a

69
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:49,679
minute the difference between bird

70
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,640
watching as a hobby and bird watching as

71
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,040
citizen science for example there's a

72
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:55,039
structure that's been set up by the

73
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:58,000
scientists within which the citizen

74
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:00,639
works there really two main features for

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,598
this one of course is we we're greedy as

76
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:06,238
scientists if we can get people to make

77
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:07,959
observations or do things for us then

78
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,959
that amplifies our effort we don't have

79
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,959
to hire another uh graduate student

80
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,239
right you know that's good but a really

81
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,039
important e effort I think almost equal

82
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,840
is to build build a citizen support for

83
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:23,239
Science and scientific understanding

84
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,598
making a a literate uh scientifically

85
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,360
literate public is another main

86
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:29,839
objective and these are sometimes a

87
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,120
little bit in Conflict on the one hand

88
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,400
we want this rigorous scientific data

89
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,640
but on the other hand we don't want to

90
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,438
make it too difficult for the citizen to

91
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:41,919
get involved to get some feeling for

92
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:45,280
science uh there's a lot going

93
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,919
on your Scientific American has a whole

94
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,560
page with lots and lots of Citizen

95
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,878
science projects you can read about

96
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,840
that's an example U these are just some

97
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:57,719
of the citizen science projects that are

98
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,799
involved so the Connecticut Turtle Atlas

99
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:00,560
people are interested where are the

100
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,120
turtles and they try to get people

101
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,560
involved in this her and herpetology and

102
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,759
so forth but there lots and lots of

103
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,280
projects in Europe we have a uh whole

104
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:15,679
citizen science Association Network and

105
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,439
these are logos of various both

106
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,959
universities such as here we have

107
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,120
burnmouth University but also and

108
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:26,360
Aristotle University but also all kinds

109
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:29,000
of NOS so there's a whole movement uh in

110
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,319
China there's a whole page on this and

111
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,839
there's a lot of

112
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,959
projects that are listed so this is

113
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,399
getting more and more popular let's talk

114
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,120
about probably maybe the most successful

115
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,120
project and one that's very dear to our

116
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,519
hearts here at Cornell because it's a of

117
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,000
course a Cornell

118
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:48,159
example U eird is run by the Cornell lab

119
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,079
of orthology and their aim is to look at

120
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,600
the spaciotemporal distribution of bird

121
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,038
species and what's the advantage from

122
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,240
the point of view of the lab of

123
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:58,478
ornithology obviously a much denser

124
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,639
network of

125
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:01,439
observations then could be possible with

126
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,759
the

127
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,199
professionals their aim their scientific

128
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,759
aim in general of course is

129
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,360
understanding bird ecology you know this

130
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:10,759
is in in the broad sense that's what

131
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,520
they'd like to do and the idea is in

132
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,840
this case they're having the citizens

133
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:17,639
amplify their

134
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:19,959
efforts um this is their web page and I

135
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,160
didn't update this unfortunately for now

136
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:23,959
but as even a year ago there were

137
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,400
already almost 10 million observations

138
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:28,399
that were made and you can view and

139
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,599
explore their data you can contribute

140
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:33,279
data and so forth

141
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,680
um there are all kinds of incentives you

142
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:39,159
see you can make your totals and the

143
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,959
reason for this is so successful well

144
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,199
let's just look at this here are the

145
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,279
areas where they've received

146
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:47,520
observations so they would really like

147
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:49,879
someone to go up to Siberia which is VE

148
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:52,959
a very important area for Birds

149
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:54,839
obviously uh but I was really surprised

150
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,879
by the density in in Mongolia for

151
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,159
example so there must be some active

152
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,800
bird watchers there that's good but you

153
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:05,000
can see a bit of the problem here

154
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,879
spatially in that the distribution of

155
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,959
the observations is is not done by any

156
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:12,918
kind of sampling plan it's all

157
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,439
volunteered so it's not as if we an

158
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:16,198
example of Siberia is may be a good one

159
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:18,598
you'd say well look this is really

160
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,840
important for migratory bird ecology so

161
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:22,120
we're going to do a scientific

162
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,239
Expedition we're going to go to Siberia

163
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,240
we're going to set up a sampling plan

164
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,360
according to our protocols Etc you would

165
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,840
have a very different sampling uh you

166
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,759
can't really tell this in the United

167
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:37,279
States but I had a student a couple of

168
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:40,919
years ago in my uh my graduate course

169
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:43,000
here working on eird data from Chicago

170
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:46,198
and when you looked at the city of

171
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,199
Chicago uh the idea was what is a good

172
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,240
Urban bird habitat she was trying to

173
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:53,080
look at habitat that would be suitable

174
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,120
from these observations well you found a

175
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:59,598
huge observation uh along Lake Michigan

176
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,038
there were huge numbers of observations

177
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,079
everyone sits there with their Scopes

178
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,159
looking at the Ducks and the birds when

179
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:06,959
you got to the south side of Chicago

180
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,039
with a little bit more rougher

181
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:12,000
neighborhood there were no Birds now

182
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:14,399
this either means there are no birds

183
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,199
there because it's bad habitat or

184
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,079
because no bird watchers like to go

185
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,800
there or because the citizens who live

186
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,038
there aren't so interested in bird

187
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,960
watching but it's obviously I mean this

188
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:27,519
is a nice example of uh the danger and I

189
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:29,878
won't call it a danger but a limitation

190
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,560
of Citizen science is it's very

191
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,199
difficult for the scientist has to deal

192
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,759
with data that is not collected

193
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:39,879
According to some sampling plan you

194
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,360
might otherwise use U now why is this so

195
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:43,000
so important you know why is this

196
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,240
getting more important and one thing of

197
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,240
course is the technology um the GPS

198
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,158
mobile phone has has absolutely

199
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,000
revolutionized so many things um you

200
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:55,959
know the social interactions of

201
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,120
teenagers and things like that but also

202
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:00,239
for us the fact you can go take a

203
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,439
picture it's GE reference

204
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,560
um you data capture apps and you can

205
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:08,120
upload it very easily has has really

206
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,720
made it possible for uh for anybody

207
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,240
really with a very very modest

208
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,680
investment to get involved in this and

209
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,840
almost everywhere you have a these these

210
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,079
smartphones all over the world the other

211
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:23,560
part is this mentality

212
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:26,359
and the idea here is that we're getting

213
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:29,120
more the idea of the

214
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,319
specialist being different from from us

215
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,959
as an ordinary citizen is going away

216
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:36,839
quite a bit and examples for example of

217
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:39,239
of reviews I you remember you used to

218
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,320
have to buy you know the New York Review

219
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,799
of Books if you wanted to read a a book

220
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,320
review and a new book came out and what

221
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,879
do people think about it you read that

222
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,800
or you read the New York Times book book

223
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:52,039
review now you go on Amazon and everyone

224
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:53,719
can review the book and that's an

225
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:55,639
empowering thing and so many people are

226
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,639
used to now doing that and giving their

227
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:01,799
opinions Wikipedia is a very also a very

228
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:04,360
good example um let alone let alone

229
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:07,958
blogs everyone can give their opinion so

230
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:12,200
people are mentally more ready to do

231
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:14,199
this um so the professional scientists

232
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,879
how do they use this data one is the

233
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,320
massive databases the idea you can make

234
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,240
a much better model you have more

235
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,278
observations you have more points you

236
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,680
can make a better model and the example

237
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:26,159
for the eBird would be habitat

238
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:28,199
suitability something like that the

239
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,799
other thing that can be done is now

240
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,160
monitoring because people are out there

241
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:35,479
constantly and for example they can

242
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:38,799
report an event like the first skunk

243
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:41,879
cabbage they see or the or a certain

244
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:43,838
first bird or they can report a toxic a

245
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:44,958
toxic dump a dump site for example they

246
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,279
found someone that dumped a

247
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,278
refrigerators along the side of the road

248
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,799
they can just go report that and if

249
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:52,799
you're building an environmental

250
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,838
database or a hazards database you can

251
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,519
you can just do that so you have this

252
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:00,480
early warning and time series and these

253
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:05,278
are both very useful to the professional

254
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:08,360
scientist uh now that was a little bit

255
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:10,360
about in general and there are lots and

256
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,759
lots of examples of Citizen science some

257
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,519
more or less successful but I'd like to

258
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:18,278
now get to soil science um what is

259
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,720
different about soil science well the

260
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:23,320
first thing of course it's a resource

261
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,560
that's very underappreciated or

262
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,920
unappreciated in the in the common in

263
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:30,639
the popular uh culture I was interested

264
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:32,278
we had one one of the candidates for our

265
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:33,958
geospatial position come in and have

266
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:36,120
these very nice diagrams of the inter

267
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:38,399
sectioning spheres and the hydrosphere

268
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,159
and the and the and the atmosphere and

269
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,399
you know and the soils were absolutely

270
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:45,719
nowhere there that was okay soils were

271
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,399
implicitly there how's that and that was

272
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,680
interesting to me uh because the

273
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,399
position was of course in the soil

274
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:54,599
science

275
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:56,078
department anyway that was okay but but

276
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,360
uh that just illustrates and in the

277
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:01,000
popular knowledge then uh people don't

278
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,879
have much concept of of soils actually

279
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,320
maybe we have enough time I'll tell you

280
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,919
a nice little story about my my phda

281
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,959
exam and that was many years ago but I

282
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,799
had a minor in computer science so uh

283
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:15,000
they start to examine me and Tom Scott

284
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,519
who many of you know said okay well I'm

285
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,360
going to ask you some questions about

286
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:20,480
soils and see what you know so please

287
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,519
write down the orders of soil taxonomy

288
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,399
and then we'll talk about them so I'm

289
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,000
about to write on the board and the

290
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,000
computer science Professor interrupts he

291
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,240
says wait wait wait you just use the

292
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,559
word taxonomy is that like a

293
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,560
classification I said yes he said you

294
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:39,399
mean you can classify soils yes you mean

295
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:41,879
soils are are different I mean are there

296
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:44,000
differences luckily I knew where the

297
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:45,360
professor lived in KY Glenn and I could

298
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
specifically tell him about the differ

299
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,800
lustrin soils where his house was and

300
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,039
the Terrace soils right across the road

301
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,399
in the kyen Quarry so I could illustrate

302
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:56,159
to him there were some differences and

303
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,399
we had a nice a exam but but I always

304
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,600
thought was a nice example of a very

305
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,879
intelligent very very well informed

306
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,759
person about many things not

307
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:06,639
appreciating soils okay second point is

308
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:08,679
even people that know about soils I I

309
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,639
don't think we have any soil hobbyists

310
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:12,239
I've never heard of anyone who goes out

311
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,879
and looks at soils for a

312
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,919
hobby uh you could you could go around

313
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,799
you say I want to have seen every order

314
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:21,240
in soil taxonomy I mean that could be a

315
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,399
hobby but I've never heard of it so I

316
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,079
was on a pedology tour and there were

317
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:30,360
two students from the University of

318
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:33,679
Maryland who were like finally I saw

319
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,000
okay a tattoo of the texture triangle on

320
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,000
his

321
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:42,159
leg okay that's a good point that's a

322
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:45,439
good point you like

323
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,958
that but let's even if that is true how

324
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,519
many birders do you have and you

325
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,359
probably maybe some of you were birders

326
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:51,600
yourself they're they're fanatic they

327
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,159
they love their hobby they get out in

328
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,199
all weather in fact right now they're

329
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:56,879
these two burgers that have set up by

330
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:58,799
this the Stuart Avenue Bridge I've seen

331
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,078
them the last several days walking down

332
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:01,759
there're set up I think they're looking

333
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,759
for eagle or something I'm not sure what

334
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,360
they're looking for a falcon maybe a red

335
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:07,919
tail hawk I don't know but they're set

336
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,320
up there with their Scopes and they have

337
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:12,159
all their gear so they spend all day

338
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,440
there anyway so we don't have I guess

339
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:16,639
the point is in soils we don't have a

340
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,000
readymade group of people that already

341
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,000
go out in the field and like to look at

342
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,198
at soils uh a large group but I will

343
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,120
talk to Le about that another thing of

344
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:28,799
course Very is the surface soil is the

345
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,720
only one that's visible to the non-sp

346
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,198
specialist

347
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,079
and even if you would dig anyone who

348
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:35,879
hasn't been trained to look to

349
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,319
understand soil horizon soil structure

350
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:39,958
and so forth would not really know what

351
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,800
they're looking at or they they'd have a

352
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:44,799
very crude idea of what they would be

353
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:46,719
looking at um therefore and I also

354
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,919
mentioned this if you want to make a a

355
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,600
consistent observation even even of of

356
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:54,519
texturing you need some kind of training

357
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,120
uh maybe a few things like I can

358
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:58,399
estimate how many stones are on the

359
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,839
surface but even then you know if you've

360
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,759
ever done that

361
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,480
you get very fooled if you don't use

362
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,360
these grids to try to say really what is

363
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,278
the percentage of stones so it takes

364
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,000
some training um so it's also difficult

365
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:12,759
to have sort of repeat of similar

366
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,360
observations it's not like the birders

367
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:16,519
where you you go back to the same

368
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,839
location so there a lot of difficulties

369
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:21,679
there are some citizen soil projects and

370
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:24,600
these are the ones that um I I know

371
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,479
about um the first one and I'll I think

372
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,120
I have slides on each one yeah so the

373
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,639
first one is from the British Geological

374
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:33,320
Survey and this is the only attempt that

375
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,680
I know of to try to collect uh Point

376
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,120
soil data that might possibly be useful

377
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:40,359
for mapping it's a mobile phone

378
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,679
application uh displays on the

379
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,278
background the general soil type and it

380
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:46,078
allows people to upload their

381
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:48,639
observations but I'll explain the

382
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:53,359
problems with it in a minute opal is a

383
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:55,360
very impressive uh effort this is funded

384
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,159
by the UK lottery they have a lottery in

385
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,519
the UK and they take that money and they

386
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:03,439
can give it to different organizations

387
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:05,120
uh based with uh that make proposals and

388
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,480
so they have this Imperial College of

389
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,799
London has set this up and collaboration

390
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,759
with museums and they have all these

391
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:14,879
these these surveys and soil is one of

392
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:16,759
them they have six surveys and you'll

393
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,120
see they decided to make an earthworm

394
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:21,959
survey and you'll see how they did that

395
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,919
in collaboration with a lot of schools

396
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:26,078
then in the United States we have Globe

397
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:30,278
which several people in our section have

398
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:32,039
worked on before this was set up by NASA

399
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:34,198
but the main the interesting thing here

400
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:36,639
the main purpose was to educate school

401
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:38,439
children it it wasn't really set up by a

402
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,318
scientist to say I want to collect a lot

403
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,199
of data that I can now use in my

404
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:44,719
scientific project so it's very

405
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:47,919
important to educate school children in

406
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,199
in in methods of OBS observation of

407
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:53,759
atmosphere and soil but the main aim was

408
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:57,318
not to collect the data so here's my

409
00:15:53,759 --> 00:16:00,720
soil and U it's uh it kind of promises a

410
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:03,679
lot more than it delivers um the

411
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,000
background in of of Europe is the

412
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,479
general soil map of Europe from the jrc

413
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,360
but the uh joint recharge Center in

414
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,680
Italy but the one in England is only a a

415
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,800
very very very general parent material

416
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:18,879
map now why is this the British

417
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,879
Geological Survey which controls the

418
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:23,439
soil survey data was the old soil survey

419
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:26,679
of England and Wales was privatized

420
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,199
under Margaret Thatcher and sold we give

421
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:29,958
you zero budget you have to make all

422
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:31,359
your money so they immediately even

423
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:33,479
though the data was completely collected

424
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,600
with rate payer money they completely

425
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,440
kept it to themselves they only sell it

426
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,560
you can't even buy it they only license

427
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,000
it and they don't want to give anything

428
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:44,679
away for free that's now been taken over

429
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,679
by the British Geological Survey but now

430
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:50,000
you see this extremely general map

431
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:52,159
saying we're on Chalk or on Triassic

432
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,440
rocks and that's all you can get as a

433
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,000
homeor you can't see the soil map even

434
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,839
though there is a soil map so you can't

435
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,679
go there and say Here's Where I Am this

436
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,759
is what the soil map say

437
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:04,480
when you upload your information all you

438
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:07,199
can say is well is it coarse medium or

439
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,919
fine and does it you know was it black

440
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:13,079
or white it's so it's not very useful

441
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,959
they are getting some U people uploading

442
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:17,838
things from their Garden but it's I I

443
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,759
find a really a lost uh lost opportunity

444
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:22,918
but you can maybe decide for

445
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:24,599
yourself this is opal and uh they have

446
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,480
of all these surveys I mentioned and

447
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,198
they they have a soil survey what

448
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,200
they've done here they've got a very

449
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,200
nicely worked out protocol for all their

450
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,679
surveys and the reason it's becoming

451
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,840
successful is because they're working

452
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,240
through the schools and have this they

453
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,079
work with the teachers and the schools

454
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,160
and they it's mainly school children as

455
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:43,199
you can see from the kind of publicity

456
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,080
picture but look what they're holding

457
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,200
see they have a nice worm here are they

458
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:48,879
very happy that they found a worm and

459
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,919
they learn how to describe tell the

460
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,120
different types of worms count worm

461
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:56,679
density and so forth so that's the main

462
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:58,279
thing about their their soil survey and

463
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:00,600
you can see all the things they've done

464
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:02,319
here enter your results results map

465
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:04,759
earthworm guide and so forth they've

466
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:06,960
decided to concentrate on the earthworms

467
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:08,798
and they've made really really a lot of

468
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,798
data and it very much more

469
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:13,879
consistent and Globe here is the globe

470
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:15,679
uh they collected data on soil

471
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,960
temperature moisture and so forth at

472
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,320
these various stations and then mainly

473
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,079
through schools and so you see this

474
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:24,759
teachers guide and so forth so these are

475
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:27,199
things they they tried to get the

476
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:28,960
students to to understand but it was

477
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,880
more a teaching effort and I don't think

478
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,360
they've really collected much data uh

479
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,640
that uh can be can be

480
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:39,599
used U okay now let's get to narrow down

481
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,559
even further into digital soil mapping

482
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,038
which is which is my interest and some

483
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:44,720
I'm sure you know about this others

484
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,640
maybe

485
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,919
not well soil mapping of course is we

486
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,320
would like to show spatially the

487
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,640
distribution of the different types of

488
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:54,720
soils either the properties directly so

489
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,000
we'd like to map the pH everywhere or

490
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,120
the soil texture or soil types According

491
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,599
to some class classification system for

492
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:05,158
example soil series or soil

493
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:07,119
orders uh the digital soil mapping just

494
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:09,280
means we use computer algorithms to

495
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,558
speed up or help this process and we

496
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:14,319
have this mapping Paradigm that goes

497
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:16,879
back that was that MC bratney uh and his

498
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:20,200
colleagues back in uh now it's already

499
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,679
13 years ago so systematized and

500
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,319
everyone uses this concept and how we

501
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,559
work it out as quite different but he

502
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:29,639
didn't like the clorpt he thought cped

503
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:32,319
didn't sound good if you know your Jenny

504
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,600
equation so he decided scorpan he wanted

505
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:37,359
to make scorpion but he couldn't think

506
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:39,759
of any ey to put in there so we have

507
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,839
scorpan and so he put the a in there

508
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:44,038
instead of time he used anom instead of

509
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,439
time so we get of a but there is

510
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:47,960
something new in here if you know your

511
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,960
Genny equation the point here is the

512
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,200
soil that we see is meant to be not

513
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,000
randomly distributed it's there for a

514
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,519
reason so it's based on the climate it's

515
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,400
found in the organisms that were work

516
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:02,798
both in and above of the soil the relief

517
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,240
so where it is in the topography the

518
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:07,720
parent material it developed from the

519
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,200
time it had to develop those are all in

520
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,400
the Jenny equation but here we have two

521
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,038
other factors we have S as a function of

522
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,679
s what is that supposed to mean that's

523
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:18,440
supposed to mean it's based on the

524
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:20,400
actual observations we've made that's

525
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,679
why he put it in there so you can't do

526
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,240
this abstractly you calibrate it based

527
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,559
on actual observations and then the N

528
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,759
here is there for geostatistics it's

529
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:33,279
meant to say neighborhood it means that

530
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:36,119
if you know if you know the soils you've

531
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:39,038
observed close by it tells you gives you

532
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:40,519
some idea of what soils you might find

533
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:43,158
after you've taken these others in

534
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:45,798
account so it's just a conceptual way

535
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:48,280
but what do we do when we now go to

536
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:50,319
actually use it we like to find a

537
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:53,558
covariant that covers the whole area we

538
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:55,599
want to map that each covariant

539
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:58,038
represents part of that equation and of

540
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:59,798
course it can be a very complicated I

541
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:02,000
have a colleague down in Flor University

542
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:05,440
of Florida Savina grunvald and she

543
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,240
throws 350 different covariants in a

544
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,480
great big data mining model to try to

545
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,400
figure things out I I'm not really an

546
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,038
advocate of that approach but that's

547
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,120
that's an idea but each of those

548
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:17,558
covariants are meant to represent

549
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:20,199
something that would affect soil

550
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:22,038
development so for example if you have

551
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,960
vegetation indices and you look at the

552
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:26,640
intensity of the vegetation or the

553
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:29,400
seasonality of the vegetation that might

554
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:33,520
tell you something about the the the

555
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:36,798
organic matter that kind of thing um so

556
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:38,519
anyway we we have we need the point

557
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:41,079
obser I said the S was then the point

558
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:42,599
observations for the soil and we need

559
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:45,000
Point observations I guess that's the

560
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:47,199
point we have lots of covariants we have

561
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,720
digital elevation models and derivatives

562
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,038
we have a huge number of remote sensing

563
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,839
products stream networks all kinds of

564
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:58,079
things like this geology Maps but what

565
00:21:54,839 --> 00:22:01,079
we don't have or what are very expensive

566
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:03,759
are Mak Point observations of the soils

567
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:06,319
so the concept of how we might be liking

568
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:09,119
to use citizen soil science here would

569
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:11,599
be to try to find some observations we

570
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,558
could use either in our model building

571
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:16,519
or even if we built models with more

572
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:18,599
reliable information maybe for the model

573
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:20,798
evaluation which probably shouldn't be

574
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:22,519
called validation I I've been convinced

575
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,240
never to use this word that's why I put

576
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:25,519
it in quotes because I was convinced by

577
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,519
a colleague who I worked with in the

578
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:30,480
Netherlands that a model is never valid

579
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:32,319
you never say it's valid you can

580
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,880
evaluate it and

581
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:37,720
see how well it's performing and so

582
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,200
forth but to say it's valid is sort of

583
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,640
like you know you have a validated

584
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,519
driver's license or something so she

585
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,640
convinced me not to do that so I've ever

586
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:48,359
since been tried to be uh strict about

587
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,200
that so we can maybe get a philosophical

588
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:54,199
discussion about is a model ever valid I

589
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,120
don't think so anyway so this is the

590
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,759
question this is what we got our

591
00:22:56,119 --> 00:23:00,959
motivation was to thinking about this I

592
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:02,960
just show an example digital soil map to

593
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,038
just if you have never seen one before

594
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:09,038
this is aroua in Tanzania and one is it

595
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:11,919
a one kilm resolution and one is it a

596
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:15,240
250 M resolution of the same area this

597
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:17,360
is the prediction of in this case the so

598
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,000
organic car carbon concentration in the

599
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:21,439
top uh 5

600
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,079
cm uh and I'm sorry I didn't show the

601
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,840
scale bar I should have shown that and

602
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:27,639
you can see so how are you doing this

603
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,480
you haven't been everywhere well youve

604
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,559
built some model and you can see what's

605
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,278
happening here is as we go up the

606
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:36,319
volcano first off we get more volcanic

607
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:38,359
parent material second we get higher

608
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:40,200
elevation where it's cooler organic

609
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:42,240
matter won't decompose as much and so

610
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,080
forth and there are other factors that

611
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,359
might might come in here but that's how

612
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:49,678
these maps are made but to certainly to

613
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,479
mild the model and possibly to evaluate

614
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,159
it we we need some observations we'd

615
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,759
like someone to go in a lot of these

616
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:59,840
places and and take a soil sample so why

617
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:03,158
involve citizens well for us

618
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:05,119
uh we'd like to increase the density uh

619
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:07,000
we think of course just like the bird

620
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:09,079
just like the bird watchers or the bird

621
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,319
ecologists we'd get better predictive

622
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:13,319
models if we had more

623
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:15,558
observations I'm going to get to this in

624
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:17,879
just a minute and Show an example we

625
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:19,399
would like maybe to correct mistakes on

626
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,200
published Maps because if you've seen a

627
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:25,519
soil map what you realize is they're

628
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,798
typically made now as polygons and the

629
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,158
surveyor has really not been everywhere

630
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:30,960
they've been every they've taken some

631
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:32,799
samples they have a mental model but

632
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,679
they could have made a mistake and if

633
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,158
you have an observation where it's

634
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,360
predicted to be one thing and you see

635
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,640
something else it allows a professional

636
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:43,119
mapper to say hm I didn't go there I

637
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,720
didn't take that observation but if

638
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:47,639
that's a true observation I better

639
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,798
rethink I better rethink my mental model

640
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,240
and would allow them to then improve the

641
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:54,319
map uh another way would be to take a

642
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,079
published map and and downscale it or

643
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:58,798
disaggregate it so you might have

644
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:00,519
especially a more General soil map where

645
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:03,038
it's been done maybe at a scale of

646
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:04,879
100,000 or 200,000 you know there are

647
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:06,440
several soil types in there but you

648
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,960
don't know where but if other people

649
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,759
have gone there that helps you to make a

650
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,600
more detailed map so that's what we'd

651
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:16,679
like to see now

652
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:18,599
Society well number one we'd like to

653
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:21,038
we'd like the citizens to have a good

654
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:22,038
idea appreciation for the soil geography

655
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:24,038
we'd like them to know there are

656
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:25,599
different soils that they have different

657
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:27,480
capabilities that they occur at

658
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:29,000
different places on the landscape and

659
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,240
the more people we could get out there

660
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,919
looking at soils and realizing this then

661
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,120
we would just be building support for

662
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:39,759
soil survey in a more General

663
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:41,398
sense uh so you know we'd like we'd like

664
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:44,000
people to do this and there's this

665
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:45,759
concept of the connectivity the soil the

666
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,398
people appreciating soils and thinking

667
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,960
as a citizen about the quality of their

668
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:52,558
soils the health of their soils in the

669
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,679
same way probably most citizens now were

670
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:56,639
quite aware of water quality for example

671
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:58,440
they they're clear if their lake is

672
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,559
getting polluted or if they're if they

673
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,240
have foul smelling water and so forth so

674
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:05,038
people have feel connected to their

675
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,519
Water Resource but often not to soil

676
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:10,119
resource okay now I what we did after

677
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:12,759
that my my co-authors and I we we were

678
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:15,000
really thinking who could be the citizen

679
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:17,558
scientist how could we categorize these

680
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,759
people of course some person might be in

681
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:21,960
different roles so I'll go through all

682
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:25,119
these different uh different types of

683
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,640
people that we might attract to be our

684
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,558
our citizen

685
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,120
scientists uh all of these groups the

686
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:32,918
interesting thing about this is these

687
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:34,918
all have a specific culture so if we

688
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:37,799
want to approach one of these groups

689
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:40,038
like if I go back here if we want to

690
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:42,079
I'll I'll talk to the greens or the

691
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:43,879
gardeners if they all have a culture

692
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:46,558
right so if you'd like to attract them

693
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,720
you'd have to meet them with the culture

694
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,359
the way they're thinking and making a a

695
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,880
project that's attractive to them and

696
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:54,639
what they do so these are probably very

697
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,278
different types of people and they would

698
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,520
call for a different type of

699
00:26:56,278 --> 00:27:00,640
organization

700
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:02,519
I mentioned the national culture here

701
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,159
because we are interested of course in

702
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:06,679
doing this around the world and there's

703
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:09,399
a lot of difference between National

704
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:12,200
cultures uh both in terms of the

705
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:15,558
citizens mentality but also the way that

706
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:18,159
people would take to sharing data in

707
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:20,960
other words letting you on their land to

708
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,320
look at data or even if it's my own land

709
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,159
am I willing to share data what are my

710
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:27,798
cultural norms and so forth and we have

711
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,480
these these other things that are quite

712
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:30,798
different scientists and the public have

713
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,120
a different relation in different

714
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:35,440
countries so if you were thinking of

715
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:38,639
that okay so let's talk about the groups

716
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,320
one at a time the first one is yeah do I

717
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,559
call them citizens now I'm talking about

718
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:46,038
this is the closest to us and many

719
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:47,918
people in the room here would fit

720
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:49,919
certainly in this you're a research soil

721
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,480
scientist but you're not a soil mapper

722
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,480
you're an agronomist you're not a soil

723
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,120
mapper you're a professional in your

724
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,919
educ in your field of course um so we

725
00:27:56,119 --> 00:28:01,558
call you an educated citizen uh

726
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:03,278
so you're to some degree familiar with

727
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:05,119
existing soil survey protocols and

728
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:07,359
products youve you're aware there's a

729
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,000
soil survey you of a if you don't know

730
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:10,519
exactly you have a general idea that

731
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,679
these exist and what can be done with

732
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:15,399
them uh you have an interest in these

733
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:17,360
Maps so you have an idea that if you're

734
00:28:15,398 --> 00:28:18,839
interested in Agronomy or soil science

735
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,119
you you really have an interested in a

736
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:22,759
reliable soil map you have a

737
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:24,558
professional attitude towards soil

738
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:27,158
information so the concept that you

739
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:29,000
might get involved in in during your

740
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:31,799
routine your other work that you're

741
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,798
doing in making certain observations

742
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:37,599
that would help the soil mappers is not

743
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:40,079
doesn't seem like such a big stretch so

744
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:43,798
that would be uh one type of group this

745
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:46,720
would involve uh not so much uh more

746
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:48,599
just of figuring out a protocol that

747
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,440
would not be too hard for people to do

748
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:52,119
in the course of their other work so you

749
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,320
know plant breeder goes out they have

750
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:56,639
plant breeding plots they're out there

751
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,439
anyway what can you what could you ask

752
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,038
them to do as as they're out out there

753
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:04,720
that that might help you with your soil

754
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:07,200
mapping that kind of thing okay now the

755
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,919
next of course are farmers uh or we

756
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,600
might say land managers it might not be

757
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:12,720
the farmer themselves it might be the

758
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:15,879
Forester managing a forestry block or

759
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,240
DEC Forester for example these people

760
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,559
are familiar with their portion of the

761
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,798
landscape and mostly they're definitely

762
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:23,879
aware of the value of soil

763
00:29:21,798 --> 00:29:26,079
information the motivation and we're

764
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,640
trying to think of the motivation here U

765
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:29,639
and the motivation for the first group

766
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,320
might have been in well you know science

767
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,559
is important and you know your colleague

768
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:35,359
is working to make a better soil map and

769
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:36,519
if you can contribute to that you feel

770
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:38,839
well you're

771
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:42,720
increasing the scientific project in

772
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:46,000
some sense here I think the they're more

773
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:49,759
interested in in a more detailed soil

774
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,319
map of their area it's maybe maybe the

775
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:54,038
other areas to compare Land Management

776
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:55,480
methods so maybe they'd like to have a

777
00:29:54,038 --> 00:29:57,759
more detailed map of let's say the

778
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,960
county or a surrounding area but I think

779
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:02,240
the main interest is saying well if we

780
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,399
can convince them to supply data they

781
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,679
would get back a more reliable map

782
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:08,678
somehow I think that would be the

783
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:11,759
motivation to get uh Farmers

784
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:13,798
involved uh a big I should say a bit of

785
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:16,200
a problem with this of course is is the

786
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:18,000
Privacy issue in that in the United

787
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,558
States of course anyone can look at the

788
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,398
soil map and see in general how your

789
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:25,240
farm is mapped if I'm thinking of buying

790
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:28,239
your farm or I'm comparing but uh if

791
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,880
it's a more detailed map uh maybe maybe

792
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,880
I don't really want that information to

793
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,399
get out that's a bit of a

794
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,600
problem now civil engineers and others

795
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:38,079
involving construction are an

796
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:41,319
interesting group because they're the

797
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:42,960
ones who go and see the subsoil uh they

798
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:44,798
have Road Cuts service Mining

799
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,759
excavations and so forth so they're the

800
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:49,319
ones that are already making their own

801
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:53,480
geotechnical measurements so they're

802
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:56,240
they're used to this so we usually only

803
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,919
go to 2 m and you know the reason that

804
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,359
soil survey only goes to 2 m

805
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:02,320
this is a I don't know if it's a true

806
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:05,479
story but I heard back in

807
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:08,000
1899 when the Bureau of um agricultural

808
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,599
industry was set up Milton Whitney was

809
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,200
arguing with the head of the Geological

810
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:12,918
Survey and the Geological Survey said

811
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,880
you don't we don't need a soil survey we

812
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:18,000
already we already survey and he said no

813
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,240
no soils are different soils are the

814
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,440
it's this you know everything is

815
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,440
happening in the upper part of the soil

816
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,278
and you're only looking at the geology

817
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,038
and you just call it quaternary geology

818
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:28,720
and and we're looking at the we're

819
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:30,319
looking at the soil and they had a kind

820
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,319
of an argument and they decided that

821
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:33,519
since bodies were buried to six feet

822
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:36,038
that would be the

823
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,759
limit so okay you can call that the soil

824
00:31:36,038 --> 00:31:40,200
down to 6 feet which we now call 2

825
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:42,720
meters so I don't know if that's a true

826
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,000
story but uh in fact there's been a

827
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,120
movement in recent years headed by the

828
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,720
Australians for obvious reasons because

829
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:51,918
they're in a very old weathered

830
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,880
landscape what they call whole regolith

831
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,440
pedology and there just been a special

832
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,080
issue in I think geoderma about this but

833
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:02,000
a lot of papers on this where they

834
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:04,638
saying oh look pedology is the entire

835
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,278
regali down to Hard Rock this is all a

836
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:09,759
continuous process and there's much more

837
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:11,880
conductivity much deeper in the soil

838
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:15,638
than soil scientists have have thought

839
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:18,000
in the past so uh we would actually and

840
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:20,839
USDA is behind this nrcs they'd like to

841
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,240
look deeper of course that's very

842
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:25,759
expensive uh you can't do it routinely

843
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,480
but these people uh look at quite some

844
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:30,440
depth so they could be a good source

845
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,159
and here's a picture of uh actually this

846
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,480
is a soil survey but I like this picture

847
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:38,159
because um it shows an excavation that

848
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,079
was done and we jumped in we we saw well

849
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,399
before they before they build the

850
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:44,638
buildings here uh we'll jump in there

851
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:47,319
and we'll take this opportunity uh to

852
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:49,959
see the the soil um and the nice thing

853
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:52,519
is here not only can we see the the soil

854
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,919
where we're taking the uh the the

855
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:55,960
observation here but you can see in the

856
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,919
back we get a very good idea of the very

857
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,399
of the variability which is very hard to

858
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,159
do if you don't have a trench or a pit

859
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:05,439
like this now I can ask you in this

860
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:07,639
picture which one is the professor head

861
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,639
of the

862
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:11,759
group the one in the chair

863
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,278
absolutely well he's taking no no he's

864
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:19,319
very active but he's taking the notes so

865
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:21,079
that's okay this is my my work group at

866
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:23,119
the Chinese academ the the soil Science

867
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:25,759
Institute the Chinese Academy of scien

868
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:27,479
Sciences take a lot of but this so it's

869
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,759
not a civil engineers but you see the

870
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,120
point that these these people doing the

871
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,720
excavation they have an opportunity

872
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:36,638
possibly for example just to take photos

873
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,000
for us that would be maybe just enough

874
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:41,199
if if if we already have a good idea

875
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,558
what the soil type is here and but we

876
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,038
don't have a real good idea of the

877
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:47,359
variability let's say of the horizons if

878
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:49,798
someone just takes a photo back here and

879
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,558
sends it to us that's that's really nice

880
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:53,079
so this is the kind of thing we we might

881
00:33:51,558 --> 00:33:55,720
ask them to

882
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:56,918
do now gardeners a lot of people think

883
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,038
well the gardeners would be a good

884
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:00,799
choice but I don't I don't think so for

885
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:03,278
a couple of reasons first off the

886
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:05,398
gardeners are just managing one very

887
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:07,159
site very intensively and second they're

888
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:08,838
modifying the soil quite a bit so

889
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:10,440
Gardener an interesting group to work

890
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:13,078
with for many things but they don't

891
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:17,079
really help us with digital soil mapping

892
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:18,760
over over larger areas uh so I I think

893
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:20,119
they're enthusiastic people and they're

894
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,480
a ready-made group but I don't think

895
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:25,599
they're so useful for digital soil

896
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,358
mapping now people who go Outdoors

897
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,039
anyway hikers geocachers these people

898
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:33,078
who go out and they like to go out

899
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:34,480
anyway um I'm thinking they may be

900
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:36,480
interested in learning more about their

901
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,800
environment and you might be able to

902
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,320
convince them to do something as they're

903
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,839
going along in in their regular outdoor

904
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,480
activity we'll talk about what we might

905
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:47,639
ask them to do well we have the greens

906
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,240
and the organizers the greens these are

907
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,440
people that love the environment even if

908
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:53,678
they don't always get out in the

909
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:56,159
environment they they love it somehow uh

910
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,880
and the mo and the motivation well I'm

911
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,599
you know I'm today St Patrick's Day I

912
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,920
see we have one person wearing green so

913
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,800
this is

914
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,720
good the time I went down into Boston on

915
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,800
St Patrick's Day wearing my orange coat

916
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:13,799
was a bad idea that was a long time ago

917
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:17,760
anyway well Northern Irish are Irish too

918
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:19,320
right I I don't know anyway but um the

919
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,119
the idea with the greens in would be if

920
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,119
people are already involved I didn't we

921
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,039
didn't get to think too clearly about

922
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,640
what they might do the organizers are

923
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,679
are an interesting group a really

924
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:31,199
interesting group and some of you may be

925
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:32,239
in this group if you think about it

926
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:34,358
these are people that have a

927
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:35,519
psychological need to live in an

928
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:37,279
organized

929
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:39,679
world no

930
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,680
seriously let me ask you if you go look

931
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,399
at a Wikipedia entry about something you

932
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:46,078
know about and there's an incorrect

933
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,519
statement there what do you do do you

934
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,480
edit it or you just go on and say

935
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,599
someone else will edit it a lot of

936
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,039
people and I may include myself partly

937
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,640
in this description say I can't stand

938
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:59,480
that there's a wrong statement there now

939
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:01,279
why am I taking my my time no one's

940
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,039
paying me to do it to correct and it's

941
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,519
not a it's not a statement about me or

942
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:08,239
or someone I know it's just a wrong

943
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:10,159
statement I take my time to organize it

944
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:11,838
open street map is another really good

945
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:13,639
example of this why don't we just let

946
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:16,078
the professional mappers why are people

947
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:18,759
updating open street map well and I'm

948
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:21,240
thinking in terms of the soil map if

949
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,960
these same people can be motivated to go

950
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:25,199
look at the soil map and compare the

951
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,000
soil map that exists with what's really

952
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:29,719
there they might have a compulsive

953
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,079
interest in in sending information in

954
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:34,719
and I I don't I would not downplay this

955
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:37,079
because we see we see really good

956
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:38,759
examples of this the number of people

957
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:42,079
that every in the Netherlands you know

958
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:44,400
it's just unbelievable every bike path

959
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,640
with its width and and its surface is in

960
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,200
the open street map and someone is doing

961
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:50,960
all this too much time on their hands

962
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:52,519
too much you know they only work 36

963
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,480
hours a week so you got some time it's

964
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:57,239
not like

965
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:59,318
us but they work hard in the 36 hours

966
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:01,959
okay now let's turn the over to the

967
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:04,159
other side and say what information

968
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,679
could be provided to us and how hard

969
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:08,679
would this to be to get and I'll talk

970
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:10,598
about all of these one at a time that

971
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:13,838
and you can see the list here and let's

972
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:16,039
talk about them now the tacit knowledge

973
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:17,960
is what I might call the local knowledge

974
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:20,318
of the soil landscape it's not expressed

975
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,039
in really scientific language you don't

976
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:24,800
really make this is this is without

977
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:28,000
making a new observation but you make a

978
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:30,079
comment on a published map or a comment

979
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,599
uh maybe an even an unpublished map

980
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,760
where you say well I know over in this

981
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:37,200
area it's really really bouldery really

982
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,200
Rocky you could never use Machinery over

983
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:41,399
here and the bul this you know or here

984
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:43,039
it's been extremely high I I look at my

985
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,599
photo I say over there oh it's really

986
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:47,679
really eroded over there uh the gullies

987
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,039
are everywhere you the subsoil is coming

988
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:51,679
through and this kind of knowledge where

989
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:55,000
without making a new observation the

990
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:57,039
person who knows their land very well um

991
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,318
can either comment on a published map or

992
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:02,199
they could make a sketch um this is

993
00:38:00,318 --> 00:38:04,358
difficult to translate into Point

994
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:06,799
observations but I can imagine it's it's

995
00:38:04,358 --> 00:38:09,400
useful information because we haven't

996
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,079
looked at points we we've kind of made

997
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,838
observations then there's opportunistic

998
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,119
uh newly acquired information and you

999
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:18,639
know to see something say something

1000
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:22,079
motto where is that used in New York

1001
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:24,000
Subway maybe I don't know maybe here all

1002
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,119
we need here is to say look if you're

1003
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,358
out there and you see something that you

1004
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:31,200
think is interesting and important to us

1005
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:34,199
just send us a just tell us where you

1006
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:36,719
were and send us a Geo a geotag

1007
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:39,399
photo we can see a lots of things from

1008
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:40,799
just a surface photo now we have an idea

1009
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,800
already of what's there it's not a

1010
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,079
detailed observation but this can help

1011
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,079
us a lot um there's no protocol the

1012
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,640
advantage here is we're not asking you

1013
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,359
to fill in any form did you ever get

1014
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:54,279
these things on the web where they say

1015
00:38:52,358 --> 00:38:56,358
please take a survey to improve our

1016
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,079
website I just got one from the New York

1017
00:38:56,358 --> 00:39:00,759
Times this morning I I I subscribe to

1018
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,200
New York Times I like it and I said okay

1019
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,839
let me see and they came up and said

1020
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:06,279
this will take 10 minutes to complete I

1021
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:07,880
said forget it I don't want to answer

1022
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,920
questions for 10 minutes I mean if

1023
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,680
you're just asking me a couple questions

1024
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,119
I might do it but in this case there's

1025
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:17,118
no protocol and no

1026
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:21,160
complication and here's an example

1027
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:23,240
actually from me uh which I did uh out

1028
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:25,519
one day for a bike ride and I see

1029
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:29,199
they've done deep plowing on this field

1030
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:31,199
and you can see these iron h Iron Stone

1031
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:32,919
there's Iron Stone gravels here and then

1032
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:35,399
big big chunks of Iron Stone there's a

1033
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,920
TENS I there was one this big what is

1034
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,079
this this is what we call bog iron

1035
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:41,480
orstein in in Europe it's it's a it's a

1036
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,720
concentration of iron that's been

1037
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,079
concentrated by

1038
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:47,000
groundwater and uh the farmer had

1039
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:50,240
decided had this drainage problem in the

1040
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,559
field and had decided to deep rip it for

1041
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:55,239
some reason and brought all these stuff

1042
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,759
up from maybe a meter deep and you see

1043
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:59,279
all this stuff you wouldn't normally see

1044
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:02,359
and I went back and look at the soil map

1045
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,319
and U the you have sort of two units

1046
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:08,078
coming in here this is in the 1 to

1047
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:10,679
50,000 soil map but neither of them say

1048
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:13,359
anything about bog iron now this unit

1049
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:17,838
here the the uh this one with the

1050
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:20,440
stipples does talk about bands of iron

1051
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:22,440
of thin bands of non-continuous iron

1052
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:25,000
that might be precipitating through the

1053
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,559
spodic Horizon so you'd have a nice very

1054
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,960
fine sand spodic Horizon with little

1055
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:31,679
lines of iron but nothing about this

1056
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,039
groundwater iron so this is definitely

1057
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:36,199
wrong uh I don't know if the original

1058
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:37,960
surveyor didn't dig that deep or what

1059
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:39,799
but you see the soil type is quite a bit

1060
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,720
here and so this is something that I

1061
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,280
would if they were the if the mapping

1062
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:46,078
project were active I would say here was

1063
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,839
my point here's the photo figure out

1064
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,880
what's going on and then they would be

1065
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:52,559
presumably be reinterpreting the

1066
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,000
landscape you also see here that the

1067
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,559
Dutch don't think there are any soils in

1068
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,039
urban areas so they're way behind other

1069
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:01,799
European colleages the French and

1070
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:03,358
Germans especially even the US so okay

1071
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,800
here's an idea that came from Steve

1072
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:09,400
carile and we worked it out a bit uh and

1073
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,800
the idea is you'd have a map a project

1074
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,880
called improve your soil survey and the

1075
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,920
idea is you would the citizens access

1076
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:18,440
the online map which you can always do

1077
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,000
now anyway I'll show you that and

1078
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,039
displaying it on their smartphone or

1079
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,559
tablet and then they can check the soil

1080
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:26,000
description that they see there with

1081
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:28,000
what they're seeing on the ground and

1082
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,079
they can then report things that don't

1083
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
seem to match um certainly things on the

1084
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:35,519
surface course fragments or Texture

1085
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,358
things like that you can easily see uh

1086
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:38,800
and if there's any discrepancies they

1087
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:41,279
could either confirm or they could send

1088
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,000
in they say went here and the idea here

1089
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,560
is the professional surveyors in the

1090
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,239
nrcs in the case of the US would review

1091
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:50,318
this and here's actually an example from

1092
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,519
Newfield uh this is a published soil

1093
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:55,119
survey map which is online I I printed

1094
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:57,559
it out very nicely uh this is all from

1095
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:00,519
the our nrcs and I can print out the map

1096
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:02,159
and show it on the on the on the the

1097
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:05,719
background this is up on Irish Hill Road

1098
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:07,559
in Newfield um you can also use I really

1099
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:09,838
recommend this location at the

1100
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:12,159
California soil resource lab they've

1101
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:13,679
taken the whole Sergo database and

1102
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:15,799
they've made it into something we'll

1103
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:18,118
just show on Google Earth it's super

1104
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,039
cool so you can show the soil map on

1105
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:22,200
Google Earth you can see the perspective

1106
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:24,239
and it's a really nice job and you'll

1107
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:26,558
see they did a good job also in soil

1108
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:28,879
survey so here's this area and if you

1109
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:32,880
click on it you will see it's a Valia

1110
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:35,559
Channer silt loone you will see a modal

1111
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,519
profile and if you click on this you'll

1112
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:41,599
get all the uh all the descriptions of

1113
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:44,079
this but you'll see that this shows the

1114
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:47,480
modal profile going down to almost 2

1115
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:49,240
meters in the valua but when you get

1116
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,679
there some of you may know this spot

1117
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:52,639
this is a na the natural the Green

1118
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:54,960
Springs natural Cemetery up on Irish

1119
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:57,639
Hill Road uh just before the arnet

1120
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,280
forest and when you get up there

1121
00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:00,719
you will see that there's no way the

1122
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,480
soil is this deep and it's very

1123
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:05,838
consistent in fact if you look at their

1124
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,880
website and they ask one of the faq's is

1125
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:09,318
can I dig my own grave or my own

1126
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,280
relative grave because that would be a

1127
00:43:09,318 --> 00:43:14,039
really nice thing to do I could you know

1128
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,800
it's very natural they say no because

1129
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:18,838
after you get to about a meter you are

1130
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,160
going to be stuck by this we need a back

1131
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:24,199
ho because you are not going to be

1132
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:26,399
digging this stuff out down to 2 m um so

1133
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:27,679
they're clear on that and if you go and

1134
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,599
look at any of these Graves that are

1135
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:33,679
open you see here's the pile and huge

1136
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:36,599
numbers of rocks have been excavated so

1137
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:40,159
clearly uh the depth to the Bedrock here

1138
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:42,838
is much shallower than mapped and I

1139
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:44,679
think the solution here if if you would

1140
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:47,119
uh if this nrcs would look at this would

1141
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:48,519
be to re remap that I think the whole

1142
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,760
everything they're calling the valua

1143
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:53,239
there is is is probably not it's it's

1144
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,240
because it's much much shallower and

1145
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:57,159
there's another soil series I think well

1146
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:59,118
it's not

1147
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:01,480
what is it

1148
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,200
Jonathan it's not it's not the Arn it's

1149
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,719
the wetter it's the one it's the it's in

1150
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,639
the arnet sequence but it's it's a

1151
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:08,399
shallow is aret but it's it's the next

1152
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:12,639
wetter

1153
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,318
one yeah yeah so they could yeah no this

1154
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:16,118
would be it's like arnet it's like arnet

1155
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:18,880
but it's a little bit it's the little

1156
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:20,480
one range class wetter but anyway the

1157
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,720
Lords toown there would be remapped as

1158
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,880
arnet and and I think the reason they

1159
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:26,679
did this is when in the in the old days

1160
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,200
when they when they mapped the counties

1161
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:30,118
they didn't want to have too many soil

1162
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:32,078
Series so if they had only a small area

1163
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:34,000
of one series they'd correlate it to

1164
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:36,519
another so these mappers May well have

1165
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,079
known it was shallower because arnut is

1166
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:41,719
mapped uh arnut series is mapped a lot

1167
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:43,519
in the arnut forest and in in uh and in

1168
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:45,838
in Shamong County for example but not

1169
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:49,639
here because it's still Tomkins County

1170
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:51,078
anyway okay almost finished here uh now

1171
00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:53,279
let's get to the more difficult part

1172
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:55,519
which is the protocol guided

1173
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,640
information this is much more difficult

1174
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:59,880
than the opportunistic observation

1175
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:02,480
uh you have to have a protocol you have

1176
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:05,119
to get the uh observers you have to

1177
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,880
train them and the quality control

1178
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,760
though makes this a much more consistent

1179
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,280
observation that you could really use

1180
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,680
directly

1181
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,839
um you need a protocol that's first off

1182
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:18,519
safe that's a very important thing you

1183
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:20,358
can't ask someone to do something unsafe

1184
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:22,759
digging a deep pit maybe it'll fall in

1185
00:45:20,358 --> 00:45:24,920
on them or something like that or they

1186
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:27,079
can make pull their back out digging you

1187
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,519
know I various things you really have to

1188
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:31,039
think about this we're professionals

1189
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:33,239
we're all covered by well some of us are

1190
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:36,239
covered by Cornell health insurance

1191
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:38,439
others not I still have Dutch okay

1192
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,199
anyway but um you have all this this is

1193
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,079
all very fine but then I guess my

1194
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:43,159
question here when you have this

1195
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:45,760
protocol division you're asking them to

1196
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:47,239
to get training and and to follow a

1197
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,319
protocol and and really what's the

1198
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:50,959
motivation for them there it's a little

1199
00:45:49,318 --> 00:45:54,000
bit unclear for me to see what that

1200
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,760
would be um to be like being in the

1201
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,358
volunteer fire department there's a lot

1202
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,839
of training involved but the motivation

1203
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:00,480
is clear you're you know you're helping

1204
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:02,358
your community you're working in a nice

1205
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,159
team and so there's a reason you go

1206
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:06,558
through all this

1207
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:09,039
training here's what they did in opal

1208
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:11,119
and they have a 16-page field book just

1209
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:13,199
for the earthworms they teach the kids

1210
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,760
how to do this it's very nice but this

1211
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:17,239
is the kind of material you would need

1212
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:19,280
to develop this level of material if you

1213
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:21,399
want a really consistent they have this

1214
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:25,000
they have this survey step they you have

1215
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:26,519
to measure a 20x 20 M square cenm square

1216
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,920
and you have to do things just right so

1217
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:31,119
the Sur surve is really consistent so

1218
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,480
that's why they have high quality

1219
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,760
data uh physical samples could be

1220
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,559
submitted for analysis but I'm a little

1221
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,520
reluctant about that because all of

1222
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:41,400
these issues here finding a

1223
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:43,679
representative site preparing the site

1224
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:46,000
you know the surface soil sampling it

1225
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:50,199
putting in the bag all that I just find

1226
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,599
is uh probably uh maybe a bit

1227
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:54,679
difficult the last thing I think is the

1228
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:57,079
Precision Agriculture and this is

1229
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:59,679
something that I thought about I don't

1230
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:01,160
this is really citizen science as such

1231
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:03,318
because the farmer the farmer is a

1232
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:07,039
citizen of course but I think the

1233
00:47:03,318 --> 00:47:09,639
problem here is U there's a lot I mean a

1234
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:11,159
lot has been done on this but I think

1235
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:13,159
most of this data ends up being

1236
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:16,639
proprietary that farmers do not want to

1237
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:18,799
release this there might be a way to say

1238
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:20,920
we will use your data to help us improve

1239
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,640
our map but we won't show your data

1240
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,720
directly there might be a ways to do

1241
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:27,920
that but again this would take some time

1242
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:30,239
to convince people okay okay so these

1243
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,240
are my

1244
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:35,240
conclusions we think that we could

1245
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:38,919
increase our spatio temporal density

1246
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:40,719
somehow with this so less glamorous but

1247
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:44,358
there is a community of people us we

1248
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:46,039
hope who like it um and maybe we were

1249
00:47:44,358 --> 00:47:47,920
we're imp you know we're very attractive

1250
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:49,079
now our environmental science major more

1251
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,760
and more people are interested in

1252
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:53,280
environment and agriculture which is

1253
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:56,000
good and maybe our numbers are

1254
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,480
increasing so then the last thing is

1255
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,559
that the citizen science relation we

1256
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,960
have to think very closely about the

1257
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:04,119
culture thank you this is me and one of

1258
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,119
