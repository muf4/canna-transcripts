1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,399
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,879
University for filling break because I

3
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:13,400
know he's un sabatical now so it's nice

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,200
to have a wonderful inection and thank

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,679
you for having me here today talk to you

6
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,358
about my work where I'm going to

7
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:20,480
describe to you how we identified a

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,880
tomato receptor that we call felin

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,039
sensitive 3 Sensi 3 and it perceives the

10
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:27,640
pepti like 228 and activates immune

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,679
signaling and

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,679
tomato and so I just want to huge glad

13
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:34,878
with project and I want to especially

14
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:37,759
emphasize there were two post talks in

15
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:40,079
Greg's lab U Pat Bo and julan B who are

16
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,159
really helpful for this project uh we

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,000
couldn't have done any of the work

18
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,078
without CES strickler who's here today

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,039
thank you um who was a vir informaticist

20
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:50,640
who did a lot of uh data mining for us

21
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:54,120
and also we have two chemistry students

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,719
uh Josh pil and inish adori who were

23
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,159
really instrumental in some of our um

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,800
development of chemical PRS that I'll

25
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,000
talk to you about um so without that

26
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,840
I'll start by reminding you of the

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,040
overview of plant immunity and so we

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,759
have on the surface of a plant cell

29
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,840
these pattern recognition receptors or

30
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:15,079
PRS that are responsible for

31
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,359
perceiving pathogens and I'm going to

32
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:20,280
use the example of camonis which is a

33
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,840
bacterial pathogen and it has a felin

34
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,079
and a part of that felin is this

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,520
conserved region called micro Associated

36
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:28,319
molecular patterns or Ms that are

37
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,239
perceived by these cell surface

38
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,478
receptors and initiate inter cellular

39
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:36,679
signaling that include mise Cascades and

40
00:01:33,478 --> 00:01:38,438
that lead to translational reprogramming

41
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,840
that leads to pattern triggered immunity

42
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:42,519
and this pattern triggered immunity is

43
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,880
important for inhibiting the growth of

44
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:48,280
pathogen of course pathogens have been

45
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:50,478
able to usurp the system through the use

46
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,399
of effectors specifically type three

47
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,840
effectors that are injected into the

48
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,879
plant cell by the type two secretion

49
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,280
system and these affectors once they're

50
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,879
inside the South can then interfere with

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,280
this pattern trigger immunity and in the

52
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:07,718
case of AVP and AV PTO two effectors in

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,239
ponus that we study in tomato these

54
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:12,400
specifically inhibit this pattern

55
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,039
recognition receptor complex activity

56
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,360
and so thereby it inhibits pattern

57
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:19,239
triggered immunity and now of course the

58
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,840
plan has to fight back and so in tomato

59
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,519
these two effectors are recognized by

60
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,920
the resistance protein complex PTO P

61
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,959
that then leads to affector triggered

62
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:31,518
immunity and um program cell death that

63
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,598
then stops the spread of

64
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,400
pathogen so today I'm going to

65
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,359
specifically focus on this very initial

66
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,239
events of recognition that's happening

67
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,840
on the plant cell

68
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,400
surface so in pattern trigger immunity

69
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,158
we have these cell surface receptors and

70
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,439
these are transmembrane receptors and

71
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:50,280
the majority of them these the ones I'm

72
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:53,719
showing today all have intercellular

73
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,840
protein Kinesis and these extracellular

74
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:59,039
domains so before in the last slide I

75
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,319
had FS2 which is probably the best

76
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:05,519
characterized ctor in plants for

77
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:07,798
immunity and so FS2 works with the

78
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,599
co-receptor back one and recognizes flag

79
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:14,239
22 which is a region of

80
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:16,639
FL now this is a fairly well conserved

81
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,640
uh receptor throughout plants but there

82
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,518
are several examples of receptors that

83
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,119
are found in very specific plant groups

84
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,680
or families so in the case of the efr

85
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:31,000
receptor that recognizes L 18 which is

86
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:35,360
from the elongation Factor Tu of MiG

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,360
this is only found in bre casate so

88
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,639
parabox another example of so these are

89
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,560
all examples of these locing rich pees

90
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,839
after light pesis which are indicated in

91
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,400
these little green uh domains we also

92
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,200
have other ones including the um lysm

93
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,360
domain containing proteins such as the

94
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:55,238
Cs which recognize kiten and I'll bring

95
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,239
up that this was a new receptor that was

96
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,680
just published yesterday um in plant

97
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,360
Immunology so this actually recognizes

98
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,680
LPS Li polysaccharides and it's receptor

99
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,840
is called Lore and it's a lectin estain

100
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,640
FR

101
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,000
receptes and so what's key and what's

102
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:15,199
sort of concerned in all of these is

103
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,918
that Downstream since these are all

104
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,759
protein chases they activate mes

105
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,120
Cascades they um include transcriptional

106
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,639
reprogramming and this all leads to your

107
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,759
basal

108
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,079
defense and so I want to talk a little

109
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:32,000
bit more about these two uh pepti is

110
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,519
called FL 22 that I already mentioned

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and this other new peptide that was only

112
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:40,000
identified about a year and a half ago

113
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,399
from uh tomato cly 228 and this is also

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,079
from

115
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,679
felin and so for I'm step back for a

116
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,399
second and talk a little bit about

117
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,000
humanin receptors so it's been known

118
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,959
that there's actually two felin

119
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,240
receptors in Maman systems you have an

120
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,599
extracellular receptor called tlr5 that

121
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,720
recognizes one portion of felin and you

122
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,360
have an intercellular protein complex

123
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,639
that recognizes second portion of

124
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,639
theel what's kind of cool is actually if

125
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,639
you look at the structure and what the

126
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,079
Tomato receptors seem to recognize we

127
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:12,199
actually again have two portions the

128
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:14,560
flag 22 region that's recognized by LS 2

129
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:16,600
and we have a second region flag 228

130
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,280
that's recognized by a previously

131
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,919
unknown receptor

132
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:25,918
fs3 and so one early hypothesis when we

133
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:27,279
first identified this new man was well

134
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,318
this could actually both of these

135
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:32,198
peptides could be recognized by the same

136
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:34,560
protein so in other words the Tomato FS

137
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,038
to could just be modified in such a way

138
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,800
as to recognize both so we tested the

139
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:42,159
hypothesis pretty early on and what we

140
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,478
could find was in fact when you silence

141
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,479
Eis 2 and tomato and you treat with 522

142
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:49,199
you see a reduced response to this

143
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:51,800
peptide but there's no difference when

144
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,680
you treat with the flag 228 peptide so

145
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,759
this seemed to provide evidence that in

146
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,959
fact we have two different receptors in

147
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,639
tomato that are recognizing the same

148
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:01,638
protein but just different portions of

149
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,120
so just to give you some evidence that

150
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:08,799
flag 228 actually is functioning as a m

151
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,240
so that it's actually inducing a

152
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,038
transcriptional change in the plants so

153
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,160
um Anan rosley in our lab who actually

154
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,639
gave a talk I think back in the fall he

155
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,680
was uh did a lot of experiments working

156
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:23,519
with uh man juers tomato and looking at

157
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,439
the

158
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,079
transcript and so I just want to

159
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,680
acknowledge J Worley actually did a

160
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:30,279
reanalysis of some of this data and

161
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,360
that's what I'm showing you today

162
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:33,839
what he did is that what we see is that

163
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,680
looking at the number of genes induced

164
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,198
in tomato upon treatment with flag 228

165
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,079
we have more than

166
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,840
2200 but if we look and divide further

167
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:45,240
treatments such as when we treat with

168
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:48,439
sudam monus florescence which is a PTI

169
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,519
inducer 86 of the% of the genes that are

170
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:51,839
transcriptionally upregulated are

171
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:53,359
overlapping with the genes that are

172
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,799
upregulated with flag

173
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,439
228 so this sort of suggests that one of

174
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,598
the major pants in Flores is probably

175
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:03,680
felin again flag 228 treatment is giving

176
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:06,839
us that same

177
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,478
response when we treat with a a disarm

178
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:12,918
strain of Cy path ofart tomato DC 3000

179
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:15,360
we see that 90% of the genes that are

180
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:19,159
upregulated are overlapping again with

181
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:22,759
the like in je and this percentage goes

182
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,439
down in the fully bual 3000 because that

183
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,319
as I showed you previously is sort of

184
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:28,439
suppressing the PTI

185
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,199
induction and then if we don't if we

186
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,478
have a strain that doesn't deliver

187
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,800
affectors and doesn't have a fuelin it's

188
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,359
pretty much escaping recognition we're

189
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,120
not really getting an induction of PTI

190
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,879
in gen so when we looked at this

191
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:46,439
evidence this gave us um some confidence

192
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:49,000
that 228 treatment was inducing uh a

193
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:49,000
response in

194
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:55,158
tomato and so we were interested in

195
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,079
maybe figuring out what was going on and

196
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:59,560
I happened to be involved in a project

197
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:01,800
where we were screening um tomato

198
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,639
heirloom cultivars to see if they had

199
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,280
variation in their response to different

200
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:08,918
Ms so we had included flag 22 and

201
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:11,359
another peptide cs22 but I'm showing you

202
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:13,439
here the data for flag 228 treatment and

203
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,080
what I want to emphasize here is we saw

204
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:18,079
that there was one line yellow pair that

205
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,959
was tested that seemed to have really

206
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:23,918
really reduced responses to fight

207
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:26,000
228 and so I wondered was this an

208
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,478
anomaly what was going on and could we

209
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,759
actually find other cultivars that were

210
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,598
in fact having a IAL

211
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:35,158
response and so I went through and

212
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,399
screened about 200 different tomato

213
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:39,958
cultivars and also wild species of

214
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:42,719
tomato and what I could find was

215
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:45,919
actually several uh cultivars and a few

216
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,920
wild species EXs that had this reduced

217
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,039
response to flag 228

218
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:53,120
treatment and so again we have this

219
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:55,278
yellow pair tomato we have two pimpell

220
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,159
folium accession so this is the one of

221
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,720
the closest relatives to Tomato but it's

222
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:01,838
a wild species and then we had all of

223
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,160
these different tomato cultur bars that

224
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,160
all showed this extremely reduced

225
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,600
response and in fact when you look at

226
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,519
the response it really isn't anything

227
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,159
there that's just background and so we

228
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,720
were very excited and decided this

229
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,838
really set us up for a really nice

230
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,920
genetics

231
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:19,800
approach where I used uh yellow pair

232
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:23,919
fvar the non-responder as one of my

233
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:25,240
parents and the sanum Pilla fum La 1589

234
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:27,319
as my other

235
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,480
parent what was really nice is we

236
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,278
actually have genomes of both parents so

237
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,360
actually made the genetics really really

238
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:37,919
nice later on um so we have is we

239
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,399
actually did a a cross and looked at the

240
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,599
phenotype of the

241
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:45,799
f1s and so what we see if we treat the

242
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:49,639
flag 22 for either yellow pair the other

243
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:53,359
parent La 1589 or the F1 hybrid they all

244
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:54,879
respond equally well to FL 22 but now

245
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,039
when we treat the flight

246
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,958
228 yellow peir is completely

247
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:03,278
insensitive to the

248
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:07,159
but the LA 1589 and the F1

249
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:08,439
respond so now this set us up to do a

250
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:10,799
bul segregate

251
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,120
analysis so I showed you the phenotype

252
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,479
of the F1 when we went to the F2 we had

253
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,120
a nice segregation of the phenotype

254
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,159
where we had responsive plants and

255
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,759
non-responsive plants and so we pulled

256
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:25,159
the DNA from the responsive plants and

257
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:28,039
the idea was is that if we could go and

258
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:29,958
sequence the genomes we wanted to look

259
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:32,360
specifically for regions of the genomes

260
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:35,559
where we had Snips that corresponded to

261
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,200
only the yellow pair parent but not to

262
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:39,879
the other La 1589 parent and again

263
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,680
because we had the genome sequences for

264
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:43,439
both of these this actually ended up

265
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,278
being fairly

266
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,000
straightforward and so this is where

267
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,600
Susie comes in so we developed this uh

268
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,639
analysis pipeline I just want to walk

269
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,839
you through it so we again grouped the

270
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:57,360
susceptible plants and then we sent the

271
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,959
DNA off for um Next Generation aluminous

272
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,600
sequencing and then did sequence

273
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,838
processing of that data where she

274
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,680
trimmed the reads and filtered and then

275
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,760
she mapped those reads onto her yellow

276
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:11,159
pareno so that she could call those

277
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:14,000
Snips and then what she ended up doing

278
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:16,919
is looking for Regions where the senum

279
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,078
from Pell volum specific Snips were

280
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:20,479
located and then that allowed us find

281
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:23,599
some candidates so I'm going to show you

282
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,320
an example of what this output data

283
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,800
looks like and so for 11 of the 12

284
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,160
chromosomes this is generally what the

285
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:33,919
data look like we're looking at the

286
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:36,039
percentage of La 1589 nips and so if we

287
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,039
see no linkage to our trade of Interest

288
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:39,319
we should see

289
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,879
50% and that's generally what you see

290
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,200
obviously you have a little bit of

291
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:45,679
wiggling in the data but what we see is

292
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:50,600
generally a 50%

293
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:52,838
um snip ratio and so again about 11 of

294
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,399
the 12 chromosomes look like this one

295
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:58,200
chromosome instead had a suppressed

296
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:01,958
region where we had very very few La

297
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,519
1589 SS it's right in here and this uh

298
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:07,759
corresponded to about a 2.5 megabase

299
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:09,919
region and when we looked at the genes

300
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,000
there we actually found nine receptor

301
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,039
like kyes genes which was a our sort of

302
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,720
candidate protein that we were

303
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:20,159
expecting and so looking at these nine

304
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,800
genes I then designed primers looking um

305
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:24,000
at these different portions of the

306
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:25,919
genome and did a little bit of fine

307
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,639
mapping and when we looked at the re

308
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:29,319
combination we saw a suppressed re

309
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:32,079
combination around the region of this

310
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,760
one gene but not around these other

311
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:38,039
genes and so we very tentatively called

312
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:40,399
this one reate chise gene are putative

313
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:43,919
fs3

314
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,278
Gene um so tomato has been really nice

315
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,958
in the last few years in that we have a

316
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:49,078
lot of genetic resources that have been

317
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,719
developed so one of those resources

318
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:54,958
that's been developed out of Michigan

319
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,360
state is soul cap um Soul cap sequencing

320
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,518
and they took a whole bunch of different

321
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,919
tomato cultivars and ponella folium

322
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:02,519
accessions and they did uh snip calling

323
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:04,479
throughout the genomes and so we could

324
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,560
actually mine this data and what we

325
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,278
looked for was

326
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:11,119
um Susie first did a whole genome

327
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,600
analysis so she took all the Snips from

328
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,879
the whole genome and developed this tree

329
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,199
and what we could do is we had three

330
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:20,559
cultivars in that list that were

331
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:22,479
non-responsive so those three cultivars

332
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,518
are not related if you look at the

333
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,560
entire genome so again these are three

334
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:29,720
cultivars that don't respond if we just

335
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:32,518
take that region of Interest 10 meab

336
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,000
bases around that region we now see that

337
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:37,240
all of these uh cultivars now cluster

338
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,159
together so this again gave us some you

339
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,600
know potential evidence that perhaps

340
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:42,559
this region of the genome was of

341
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,680
interest for us and it could have like a

342
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:49,799
common um breeding history or a common

343
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:52,599
lineage we next then went to uh

344
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:55,078
different Salan of species so I pointed

345
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,519
out tomato of course responds to fly 228

346
00:13:55,078 --> 00:14:01,399
treatment we also know potato and pepper

347
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,799
also respond but Funia do not and so now

348
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,399
we have genome sequences of all of these

349
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:07,639
so we can actually go into the genomes

350
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,480
and ask well do they have this one

351
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:13,039
candidate LS3 Gene and really

352
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,240
interestingly we have the Tomato fs3

353
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:17,919
candidate we have pepper and we have

354
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,799
potato but if you look petunia and

355
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:23,159
actually bamana do not have a clear

356
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,758
orthol for this Gene so this again was

357
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:26,240
some evidence suggesting that maybe that

358
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,519
this was the Gene and it was a newly

359
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,839
Arisen Gene that was not present in it

360
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,198
came about after um the Divergence of

361
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:38,160
petunia and Nana from the the

362
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,719
salanos okay so this is a whole lot of

363
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,120
evidence let's get back to the gene what

364
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,560
it is so it has two

365
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:48,039
exons and what we did is we sequenced

366
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:50,078
all of those uh um different cultiv bars

367
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:52,599
to see what was going on in this Gene

368
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:55,239
and what we found is that in yellow pair

369
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,800
the six other tomato cultivars and in

370
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,879
one of the pimpel folium ex sessions we

371
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:02,519
have four B PA deletion in the Gene and

372
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,159
so actually the one base pair deletion

373
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,240
is sufficient because that causes an

374
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,799
aberin

375
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,240
stopon and so we would predict actually

376
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:12,399
that in all of these cultivars and

377
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,919
obessions this is actually a

378
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,399
null and then we had one other that was

379
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:21,078
very interesting so in the pimpell

380
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:22,839
folium LA 373 we actually had what

381
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:25,719
appeared to be a full length encoding

382
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:28,040
Gene but there were four non synonymous

383
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,639
Snips and so you can actually see if you

384
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:32,679
go back to the

385
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:34,799
we see that this La 373 wasn't really a

386
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:37,120
null it seemed to have some response but

387
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,758
it was greatly reduced so this was kind

388
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,399
of another really interesting Al for us

389
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:42,919
to study but first before all of this we

390
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,278
have to actually show what is the what

391
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:48,360
is the gene doing what is it encoding

392
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:51,759
not surprisingly it's a lucing RIT Pete

393
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:54,399
receptiv so it has 27 extracellular

394
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,519
Lucen ritual PS a transmembrane domain

395
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,600
and a kind domain and now when we go and

396
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:04,720
actually look at what looks like on the

397
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:07,639
Ecto domain uh if you take the FS2 back

398
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,639
one flly 22 Co crystal structure and you

399
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:11,919
put the fs3 gene on it and thread it it

400
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:15,198
looks very similar but if you look at

401
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:17,479
the actual amino acid um um identity

402
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,599
it's only about 35% so while

403
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,680
structurally it looks similar because

404
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,480
again the Lucen Rich repeat domains are

405
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:26,120
pretty conserved as far as their

406
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:30,440
structure the actual amino acid

407
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,440
conservation is fairly low

408
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:35,880
and now finally putting it into planta

409
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,759
so what's nice is I can use those uh

410
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:40,159
yellow pear tomatoes to do some work in

411
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,278
tomato and what I first did was

412
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:45,240
expressed this fs3 gene into yellow peir

413
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:49,559
protoplasts to see if they're able to

414
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:52,480
now signal and so if I just Express fs3

415
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:54,439
we don't get any activation of M PES but

416
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,319
if we treat with flly 22 as our control

417
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,680
we do get activation um if we just treat

418
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:02,879
with the peptide we don't get activ

419
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:05,438
either it's only when we have the fls 3

420
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:08,838
plus the flag 228 that we actually now

421
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:12,279
get activation of M sign and just as a

422
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:13,918
control if you remember this efr and l18

423
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:16,240
pair that we can put this in tomato and

424
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,199
we also get signaling so this was

425
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,640
suggesting to us that the gene that we

426
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:23,480
had was probably the right Gene but we

427
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,640
wanted to do some further testing so now

428
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,078
we expressed LS3 in the Ciana benana

429
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,640
which you remember from the tree I just

430
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:33,839
show did not have a clear fls 3

431
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,759
orthologue and so if we put in fls 3 in

432
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,959
the flag 228 we get a nice response and

433
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:41,960
if we put in the efr and it's cognet

434
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,440
Lian L 18 we also get a response but if

435
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,600
you have the wrong receptor Lan pairs we

436
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:50,400
don't see any response so it's not that

437
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:50,399
just expression of fs3 causes

438
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,439
ad so we had some nice data that was

439
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:57,959
suggesting that um fsy could be the

440
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,759
receptor but we wanted to do some

441
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,558
further studies so going back to this

442
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:06,038
model what we had is um as I mentioned

443
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:07,918
we had this abert stop Cod on in in one

444
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:08,798
of our Le that really didn't do us very

445
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,720
much

446
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:14,839
good but we had this other nice o that

447
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:17,159
had four amino acid changes three in

448
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:19,839
Lucen R repe domains and when we looked

449
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:21,640
at that they weren't really um conserved

450
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,558
residues it didn't seem to be really big

451
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,320
changes but when we looked at this

452
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:27,240
fourth one that's actually in the highly

453
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:30,119
conserved p+ oneop we're doing a three

454
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,038
need to pring change and so I

455
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:33,639
hypothesize it was probably this amino

456
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:35,720
acid change that was causing this

457
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,240
reduction in response phenotype that we

458
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,279
were

459
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,640
observing um and then one other one I

460
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:43,599
want to mention is that um in kineses

461
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,360
they have a highly conserved ATP binding

462
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:48,119
site that's important for the actual

463
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:50,879
catalytic activity of the kise and so in

464
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:53,759
this case it said this Lys 877 so we

465
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,960
also use this amino acid to probe uh the

466
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:58,200
function of

467
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,400
fs3 and so now we started making

468
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,240
mutations

469
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,880
so we're looking here at total Ross

470
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:08,038
production if I put in fs3 into benana

471
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,520
and treat fly 228 we get response if I

472
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:13,919
make this ATP binding site mutant we

473
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:15,960
lose the response and also if I make the

474
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,159
three to Proline substitution that I

475
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,279
mentioned again we have a A reduced

476
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:22,600
response um that's sort of similar to

477
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:24,480
what we were seeing in the plant and

478
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:28,279
just to confirm that what I actually did

479
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:31,880
was um cloned out the other Al from the

480
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:33,678
LA 373 which we call fless 3-2 and

481
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,280
similar to what we were seeing from the

482
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,679
actual plant the the pimpel folium we

483
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:41,440
see a reduction in response but it's not

484
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:43,280
no response and in fact if we take that

485
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,240
alil and we mutate the proline back to

486
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:48,678
three we can restore wild type function

487
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,558
so this told us a couple of things but

488
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:53,000
it also really implied that the Kines

489
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:56,839
domain or kinese activity is probably

490
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,839
important for the function of F3

491
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:02,678
sign so so uh next we wanted to actually

492
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:04,480
show that we're getting an induction of

493
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:07,159
PTI and so what we did for these

494
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,279
experiments was we took benthamiana

495
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:13,120
plants we infiltrated the leaves with

496
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:14,759
agrobacterium that expresses F L3 and

497
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,678
then came back later and treated with

498
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:19,240
our peptide so this should induce uh our

499
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,440
immune

500
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,839
response we then came in eight hours

501
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,120
later and we

502
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:28,319
challenged uh the plant with our dc3000

503
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:31,639
in an overlapping Circle and what this

504
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:34,119
allows to do is that we look for whether

505
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,840
we have cell death in the overlap region

506
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:37,519
if we don't it means that we didn't

507
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:42,158
induce an immune response and so the

508
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:44,079
bacteria won if we were able to induce

509
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,240
immunity then we don't see cell death in

510
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,439
that spot and that means sort of a

511
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,400
plantform so this allows us to really

512
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,759
Pro whether we are getting an immune

513
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,640
response from this receptor and um

514
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:57,879
treatment or

515
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,919
not and so that's a horrible picture I

516
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,720
apologize what you can sort of see here

517
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,679
is that if we infiltrate with only yfp

518
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,960
and do the treatment you see that we

519
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:07,960
actually have the cell death in the

520
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,440
overlapping area the majority of the

521
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,038
time and this suggests again that we're

522
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,240
not inducing a clear immune response in

523
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:16,440
that

524
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,558
region if we take the inactive fs3 the

525
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,440
one that has ATP binding s mutation we

526
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:24,158
again also see that we have cell death

527
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:26,600
in that overlapping area thank you but

528
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,600
when we have the wild type fls 3 we

529
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:31,599
don't see that we have cell de occurring

530
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:32,959
in that region so that was suggesting

531
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:34,959
again that we were getting an immune

532
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,640
response that was being initiated when

533
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,919
we had LS3 plus the

534
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,200
cogn these experiments were done with by

535
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,960
Diane d in our

536
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,919
lab okay and last part of course is the

537
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,240
affector story because that's really

538
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:53,400
what our lab focuses on and so it's been

539
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,319
known that the affectors AVP and2

540
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,200
suppress fls2 mediated signaling and not

541
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:03,519
too surprisingly they also Suess fls 3

542
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,558
mediated expl um for both abp2 and for

543
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:07,759
avp2 and so this is something of course

544
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:10,200
we're really interested in exploring in

545
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:13,200
Greg's lab whether this is going to be

546
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,440
um the same as what occurs for fls2 or

547
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,840
if it's actually different and this is

548
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,640
something I think tiny and Simon are

549
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:21,599
going to be working on

550
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,759
shortly um and then we wanted to ask is

551
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:27,278
it iss3 signaling dependent on back one

552
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:28,960
and again fls2 signaling is so we would

553
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:31,440
expect that it would be but we needed to

554
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,558
do the experiments anyway so if we use

555
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,038
Bena and we either have a control

556
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:37,879
silencing or a back one silencing in

557
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:40,240
plants that are silenced for back one

558
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,400
and express fs3 we have a reduced

559
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,079
signaling and it's comparable to what we

560
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,960
see for efr so this was some preliminary

561
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:51,199
evidence back one was involved um but I

562
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,640
was able to recently do uh invivo

563
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,640
studies looking at um the existence of

564
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,880
fs3 back one in a complex using Co

565
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,440
precipitation and so if I have fs3 and

566
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,960
back one expressed in the same leak if I

567
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,720
immuno uh precipitate pulling on the

568
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,519
back one I'm able to detect

569
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:13,798
fs3 but if I have yfp instead and pull

570
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:16,519
on yfp I don't pull down the fs3 and so

571
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:19,639
this was again suggesting that we were

572
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:21,839
getting um fering back one to exist in a

573
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,240
complex together and I will say this is

574
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:27,278
actually after treatment with the

575
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,720
peptide and so again this is more um

576
00:23:27,278 --> 00:23:32,960
something else we very interest in

577
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:35,360
studying as well but uh needs more work

578
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,079
and so last thing that we needed to do

579
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:39,240
in order to actually show that this is

580
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:41,960
in fact the receptor we had to

581
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,919
demonstrate specific binding between the

582
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,038
Lian and the receptor and so we did this

583
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:49,320
using some chemistry probes that were

584
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,798
developed through uh collaboration with

585
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:53,879
Frank schroers lab and specifically a

586
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:56,879
current post talk Jos belli and a former

587
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:00,799
postu in odor and they came up with

588
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:03,320
these very uh clever systems to put on

589
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:05,798
two important chemical moities the first

590
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:07,319
one is this diazine photocross Linker

591
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:09,918
and the second one is this alkine

592
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:13,158
chemistry gr and so we made two probes

593
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,600
our flag 228 and our flag 22 that had

594
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:17,480
what we call this our handle and what

595
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:20,439
this allows us to do is that with a

596
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:23,400
photo diering cross Linker we can use UV

597
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:26,798
light and this will coal attack and bond

598
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,679
to whatever's close by the alkine handle

599
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,480
allows us to do clip chemistry and what

600
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,278
this allows us to do is specifically put

601
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,038
on a tag but it lets us put on a tag

602
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:37,038
after we've done the experiment so that

603
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,919
the tag doesn't interfere with The

604
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:43,200
Binding of the probe to it of the LI to

605
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:45,399
its receptor and so we could show that

606
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,038
putting on this little uh chemical Group

607
00:24:45,398 --> 00:24:48,798
which is actually about the one and a

608
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:52,119
half amino acids in size it's not very

609
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:55,200
big it didn't affect the activity of the

610
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:56,798
probes and so now we wanted to show the

611
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,880
bining so I'll walk you through these

612
00:24:56,798 --> 00:24:58,918
experiments because they're a little

613
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,080
tricky

614
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:05,919
uh we first Express fs3 gfp in our

615
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:08,240
benthamiana leaves we then Harvest uh

616
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,919
microsomes and plasma membranes to have

617
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,159
an enrichment of our protein and to get

618
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,919
rid of a lot of the contaminating

619
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:18,000
cytosolic proteins as well as our um

620
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,840
chlorophyll because that would soak up

621
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,519
the UV radiation and prevent the

622
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:26,599
downstream analysis so we have our

623
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:30,278
microsomes that have our fs3

624
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:32,839
gfp we add our probe and any competitors

625
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:34,839
and so if our peptide binds to the

626
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:37,480
receptor again this photocross Linker is

627
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:39,480
now in close proximity so that we can

628
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,880
hit it with UV radiation and it now

629
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,679
photocross links so we now have a coent

630
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:47,399
linkage between our receptor and our

631
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:49,360
Legend since we have a gfp tag we can do

632
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:52,158
amuno precipitation to pull down this

633
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:54,000
complex between the receptor's leg ends

634
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,880
and now with this click chemistry handle

635
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,759
we can add on any tag we want but we

636
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,720
instead we're adding on biotin so we can

637
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:02,319
use a click chemistry reaction to add on

638
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,960
biotin

639
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:07,000
aide and then allows us to do

640
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,480
immunoblotting looking for either the

641
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,480
gfp or for the

642
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:17,038
bio so we first could show that the prob

643
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:19,119
chemistry was working so when we treat

644
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:22,798
uh with flag 228 in the presence of

645
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:25,759
eilis 3 we get a biotin label as you can

646
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:29,000
see through the stav and HP signal and

647
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:31,278
we have protein in both so the FL 22 is

648
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,240
not just aberly binding so it shows that

649
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:35,839
our Pro chemistry is specific and it's

650
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,079
not just cross linking

651
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:40,918
everything and we could also compete off

652
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:43,319
the signal so when we have uh our Pro

653
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:45,960
flag 228 in the presence of excess

654
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:48,319
unlabeled flag 228 we lose our signal

655
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,798
and we don't with the flag 22 so that

656
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:52,918
would suggest again that we had a very

657
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:56,599
specific receptor Lian interaction

658
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:59,600
between our flag 228 and our fs3 and

659
00:26:56,599 --> 00:27:01,918
that we couldn't uh get rid of this B by

660
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,398
just adding any old peptide to the to

661
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,440
the

662
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:07,599
experiment and so just sort of in

663
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,278
summary what we have now is we have

664
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:12,158
identified LS3 which is the receptor for

665
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:15,278
flag

666
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:18,320
228 we've shown that it um the signaling

667
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:20,519
involves back one a co- receptor and

668
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:23,398
that activation of the signaling pathway

669
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:25,240
leads to the activation of mise Cades as

670
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:26,918
well as transcriptional reprogramming of

671
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,200
the

672
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:31,720
plant we showed that uh the signaling

673
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,200
involves the Ros

674
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:37,278
production and that the pseudomonas

675
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,159
affectors AVP and avp2 B can come in and

676
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:41,720
actually suppress the

677
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:42,960
signal and with that which was very fast

678
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,558
I'm going to go ahead and just again

679
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,840
acknowledge everyone in the group so um

680
00:27:45,558 --> 00:27:50,079
again Pat did a lot of the Cross linking

681
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:51,759
experiments uh xong was really

682
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:53,079
instrumental in some of the genetics and

683
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,720
also the cloning of

684
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:58,000
theal Susie did all the bioinformatics

685
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,200
work which was totally essential for

686
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,200
this project as you saw uh Josh and

687
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,200
inish did the chemistry um we also

688
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,278
worked with Joyce and one of her TCH

689
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,000
Kate with um working with some cell

690
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:11,720
cultures and we also collaborated with

691
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,558
uh Boris benzer and his student Chris

692
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,278
Clark who were the ones who originally

693
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:17,678
were finding the flag

694
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,069
228 and with that I'd be very glad to

695
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,220
take your

696
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:22,220
[Applause]

697
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:28,599
questions this has been a production of

698
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:31,600
Cornell University on the web at
