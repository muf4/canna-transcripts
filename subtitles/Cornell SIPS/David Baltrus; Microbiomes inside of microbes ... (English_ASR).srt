1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:12,080
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:13,250
University so I first want to and I did

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,199
this yesterday but I'll do this today

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,079
again thank you so much the students

5
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:20,000
like I've been on both sides of now I've

6
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,528
been on both sides of both inviting

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,778
people as grad students as a committee

8
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:25,009
and then it's awesome to be invited by

9
00:00:23,778 --> 00:00:27,410
people you know it's uh

10
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,539
we do this job and we toil away

11
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,490
sometimes and then it's nice to know

12
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:33,730
that at some level like people people

13
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:36,679
recognize you so that's awesome

14
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:38,239
yeah so the talk I'll give today is

15
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:39,740
completely different than the talk I

16
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,750
gave yesterday what I like to do in my

17
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,340
lab is focus on a broader variety of

18
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,460
topics I'm just a naturally curious

19
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,960
person and I like bacteria and so

20
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,969
luckily bacteria do pretty much

21
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,009
everything in the world and so there's a

22
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:53,600
ton of topics to dive into the topic

23
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:56,299
I'll talk about today was something that

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,490
I really started probably my third or

25
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:59,929
second or third year having a lab and it

26
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,370
really just blossomed from there we've

27
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:03,289
got some really good people at Arizona

28
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:05,090
that contribute greatly and kind of

29
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:06,769
drive this project in a lot of ways to

30
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:09,409
you that I'll acknowledge now so Betsy

31
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:10,789
Arnold is awesome collaborator Rachel

32
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:12,739
gallery is an awesome collaborator and

33
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:16,190
they're fully involved in this as well

34
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:17,689
so I I can't take any personal credit

35
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:19,730
it's it's we work really well together

36
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:21,469
as a team so I just want to say that up

37
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:24,650
front and I'll acknowledge Rachel and

38
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:26,329
Betsy at the end as well all right so my

39
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,920
talk today is going to be on a symbiosis

40
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:30,349
though or maybe assembly else's

41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,200
interaction at least that I had no clue

42
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:35,329
existed until I really started my lab so

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,829
I was very focused on Pseudomonas

44
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:40,189
syringae and then started reading papers

45
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:41,569
and once you start reading more broadly

46
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:41,959
and you have some time to read more

47
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:44,089
broadly

48
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:45,259
it opens your eyes into a variety of

49
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:49,670
different ways that interactions can

50
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:51,650
happen to begin though and as a just to

51
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,239
one the room here to a little bit I'm

52
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,978
gonna talk about a horrible human

53
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:58,819
pathogen outbreak that happened in about

54
00:01:54,978 --> 00:02:02,120
1976 so in 1976 there was a convention

55
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:03,798
of American Legion folk in Philadelphia

56
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,079
and so this convention that takes place

57
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,610
and I was during the summer I think of

58
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,129
the Spanish flu or one of the flus that

59
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:12,050
came through and so people went to the

60
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:13,219
convention a lot of people got sick and

61
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,730
some people died from this convention

62
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:15,590
there is

63
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:17,509
mystery as to what the actual cause of

64
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:20,269
this pathogenicity was where this where

65
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:21,889
this infection came from turns out that

66
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:23,959
after a bunch of Epidemiology and some

67
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:27,768
microbiology and some really cool

68
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:29,750
genetics work the convention errs that

69
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:31,700
the American Legion folk we're actually

70
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,019
infected by a strain of Legionella which

71
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:34,039
is now called legion now it was called

72
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,810
something different back then it's

73
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:37,818
Legionella cause American Legion

74
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:40,128
convention Legionella has a pretty

75
00:02:37,818 --> 00:02:42,560
interesting life cycle where it'll just

76
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:43,729
kind of grow in human environments

77
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,049
because there's amoeba in human

78
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:46,669
environments and so that uni but really

79
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:48,469
like the water the Legionella can get

80
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:51,798
into amoeba kind of survives

81
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:52,489
intracellularly an amoeba and always

82
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:54,290
well and good

83
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:56,390
nothing is involving human pathogenicity

84
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:58,759
there and everything is kind of hunky

85
00:02:56,389 --> 00:03:01,699
dory the problem is that amoeba look a

86
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:04,090
lot like someone human immune cells and

87
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:06,589
so because Legionella has evolved to

88
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,030
infect amoeba it's also really good and

89
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,620
in fact the human immune cells certain

90
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,979
types of human immune cells like matric

91
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:15,379
macrophage and so what we think happened

92
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:17,719
is that a lot of different bacteria can

93
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:20,120
evolve to live inside of a variety of

94
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:22,900
different eukaryotic microorganisms like

95
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,829
amoeba sometimes we get the secondary

96
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,569
spillover into things like human

97
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:28,819
pathogen acity potentially things like

98
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:30,500
plant pathogen nesting so just setting

99
00:03:28,818 --> 00:03:33,078
the stage here there's a lot of

100
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,729
precedent for some work in some systems

101
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,650
showing that bacteria can really

102
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:38,649
proliferate and survive well in a

103
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,819
variety of different eukaryotic microbes

104
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,859
the Legionella system in the amoeba

105
00:03:40,818 --> 00:03:45,619
system is actually amoeba or basically

106
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:47,299
used as an analogue of macrophage now a

107
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,039
lot of different labs in the genetics

108
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:51,260
actually works out pretty well so

109
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,078
there's paper showing you know amoeba

110
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:56,179
survival Dictyostelium ends up being a

111
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:59,180
good model system for this as well and

112
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,250
as some labs here have shown as well and

113
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,049
contributing greatly to this is not

114
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,180
limited just to just protists or other

115
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:06,349
single side eukaryotes it seems like

116
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,000
this is a more widespread phenomenon

117
00:04:06,348 --> 00:04:10,909
where there's a lot of microscopic

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,590
eukaryotes that can be infected by or at

119
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:16,848
least hosts different types of bacteria

120
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:20,180
I really started this project because so

121
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:21,738
I started in about 2012 2013 when the

122
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,209
microbiome wave was happening and

123
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:26,569
everybody's microbiome was getting

124
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:28,219
sequenced and the joke used to be that

125
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:29,480
when I made the slide there was the

126
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,130
only thing that didn't have a microbiome

127
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,650
was hotter now there's an otter

128
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:35,870
microbiome even so there's microbiomes

129
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:37,909
for everything and there's a variety of

130
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,889
system where it's been shown that i'm at

131
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,510
least at the level of plus or minus

132
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:43,339
bacteria and this seems to affect

133
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:45,769
development physiology across a variety

134
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:47,149
of different eukaryotes what I want to

135
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:49,819
focus on though is that there's been a

136
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:52,279
good legacy of at some level at some

137
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:55,040
very specific level investigating

138
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:57,469
interactions between bacteria and fungi

139
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,580
so you know I when I started my lab and

140
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,930
when I was starting reading papers I

141
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:02,209
didn't have a good appreciation that

142
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:04,250
fungi actually hosted a microbiome um

143
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:05,930
but once I started digging in it kind of

144
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,240
makes sense like lichens are well known

145
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,069
I'm likings are effectively a fungal

146
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,389
microbiome um there's a pirkled area

147
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:16,040
rise like Seneca system and then kind of

148
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:18,349
datas lemare back herb

149
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,150
I'm not the greatest fan of bacterial

150
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:22,370
nomenclature but basically there's a

151
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:24,259
another candidate that can be in a

152
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,810
variety of micro mycorrhizal fungi

153
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:29,209
there's other systems where these other

154
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,129
very specialized it seems bacteria have

155
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:32,839
evolved to intimately interact with

156
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:34,639
their fungal hosts they seem to be

157
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:36,679
vertically inherited they seem to be

158
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,000
there's some certain genomic properties

159
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,340
there that actually contribute to the

160
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,410
symbiosis and so there's this legacy of

161
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:44,989
at least at very specialized levels

162
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,850
understanding that bacteria can interact

163
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:49,269
with fungi can be intra Highfill inside

164
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:52,040
a fungi and can manipulate fungal

165
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:55,279
behavior and physiology but again when I

166
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,020
started I didn't have this appreciation

167
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,869
and I think hopefully I've contributed

168
00:05:57,019 --> 00:06:02,478
to expanding this this theme throughout

169
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,829
a variety of different systems so this

170
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,529
work really started the work I'll talk

171
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:09,319
about today really started about 2013 I

172
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:11,029
emailed Betsy Arnold I read a paper it

173
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:12,589
might have been Teresa's paper it might

174
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:15,439
have been a different paper or using the

175
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:17,329
same system where I read a paper showing

176
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,350
that type 3 secretion was involved in

177
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:23,539
this pirkled area I was like Seneca

178
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:25,250
system and so I was coming from Jeff

179
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,319
Daniels lab working on type 3 secretion

180
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,629
of Pseudomonas syringae I saw hay type 3

181
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,040
secretion in bacteria maybe I can jump

182
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:32,360
into the system maybe I can figure out

183
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,240
some stuff with the factors and then

184
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,979
type risa creation in fungal hosts i'm

185
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,120
email email betsy Arlen said hey is

186
00:06:36,978 --> 00:06:39,680
there any way we can team up and

187
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,509
actually work on this and she said ah I

188
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,180
got a system for you like let's not

189
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:43,079
working

190
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,970
a lot of people who working on the

191
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:46,949
pirkled area let's work on this other

192
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,389
completely different system that that we

193
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,500
have no clue what they make of it but I

194
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:51,660
think there's something there I'm like

195
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,360
all right like fair game let's go for it

196
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,949
and so all of this work just and started

197
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,100
with an email and I kind of went from

198
00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:01,319
there so we'll talk about today builds

199
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,759
off of Betsy Arnold's work and Betsy

200
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:06,449
Arnold's a variety people that's this

201
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,770
lab where they identified in a variety

202
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:10,319
of different bacteria they can actually

203
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:12,240
interact pretty intimately um and in an

204
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:16,168
end a Highfill way with a variety of

205
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,848
fungal endophyte so I'll talk about

206
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:19,319
today I'll just give you an overview of

207
00:07:17,848 --> 00:07:20,310
this system kind of tell you a little

208
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,750
bit about the background on the

209
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,259
diversity of this then I'll talk about

210
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:27,089
my role in and how my questions interact

211
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:45,930
with this system and so here's the

212
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:47,279
overview a native New Yorker so I'm not

213
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:51,629
used to microphones I just kind of

214
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:53,839
scream at people but I so with the

215
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:55,680
overview I'll talk a little bit about

216
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,448
bacterial assembly on some fungi and

217
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,189
kind of Betsy's story working into this

218
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:01,259
and then I'll start to get to the

219
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:03,750
nitty-gritty of it so if we know that

220
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:05,939
there's bacteria inside of high P we can

221
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,500
ask questions like you know do they

222
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:09,629
alter fungal phenotypes is there any way

223
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,519
that we can control this symbiosis and

224
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:12,449
maybe engineer it in different ways what

225
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,908
are the bacteria get out of this

226
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:17,069
partnership can we do genetics is there

227
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:18,569
a type 3 secretion see all these

228
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:20,339
questions about interactions that really

229
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:22,319
I've come to you from the plant

230
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:23,519
pathology side but I'm really just

231
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,889
curious about how these interactions

232
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,069
evolve what kinds of genetic structures

233
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:30,389
these interactions and how going forward

234
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:32,218
and how we can predict and manipulate

235
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:35,370
these interactions maybe for the benefit

236
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:36,930
of agriculture or you know we're never

237
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,370
gonna feed 9 billion people but we can

238
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:41,728
we can feed at least a couple more I

239
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:44,578
think so an overview bacterial semi

240
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:47,278
ounce of fungi I'm not gonna show many

241
00:08:44,578 --> 00:08:49,109
pictures of plants I have a hard time

242
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,519
growing plants and I'm not I don't have

243
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,139
a green thumb I'm in a plant sciences

244
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:54,088
department but I can't grow plants very

245
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:55,590
well so what I can do is I can isolate

246
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:57,600
bacteria from

247
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,800
a variety of different plants so a lot

248
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,350
of what I'll talk about today takes

249
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,729
place in the Compu have to imagine caps

250
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,310
on imagine it's all taking place in the

251
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,830
context of plants like this so the

252
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:11,279
splatted cladius orientalis basically a

253
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:13,320
juniper juniper berry kind of plant the

254
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,839
needles on it are like pine needles

255
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,190
they're kind of coniferous and tough all

256
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,440
of the fungi that I'll talk about

257
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,870
for the most part of today where I

258
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,950
saluted from this type of plant and all

259
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,590
the bacterial talked about from this

260
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:27,990
fungi are theoretically living either on

261
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,759
the needles or inside of the fungi

262
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:33,120
inside of the Russian doll that is this

263
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:35,549
whole system if you look across

264
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,990
different plant species I don't know if

265
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:39,359
there's an exception to this I'm pretty

266
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,279
sure there's not but if you sample all

267
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,379
plant species will contain endophytes at

268
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,629
some level I'm a lot of them have fungal

269
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:46,830
into fights and these fungal endophyte

270
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:48,389
contributes to different plant behaviors

271
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,520
some of them have been shown to

272
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:52,139
influence pan plant physiology and

273
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:54,539
immune systems they make them a little

274
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:57,840
bit more resistant to pathogens some of

275
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:59,939
them are potentially pathogens you know

276
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,639
that every plant species seems to have

277
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,070
its own fungal endophyte s-- at some

278
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,600
level these Juniper species and Betsy

279
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,580
has shown this throughout a variety of

280
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,529
plants throughout the world these tend

281
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:13,050
to be covered in fungal endophyte so if

282
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:15,000
you just sample a little bit of a pine

283
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:16,319
needle you'll find a ton diversity in

284
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,029
terms of the fungi that actually live

285
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,800
there or live in the roots or live in

286
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:24,120
the stems or live in the soil around the

287
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:25,979
fungi or around the plant the fungi I'll

288
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,690
focus on for about three-quarters of the

289
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,460
talk today are gonna be N 2 fights of

290
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,780
leaves and so they're found within

291
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:34,070
leaves and that's kind of what Betsy

292
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:36,360
specialized on going around the world

293
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,530
fungal endophyte some leaves have a kind

294
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,820
of an interesting life cycle when you

295
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:40,529
think about it so a lot of these are

296
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,110
found so when the leaf emergence it

297
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:46,230
tends to be sterile or in a lot of

298
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,669
plants the fungi we think through scores

299
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,830
and other ways get up and in fact the

300
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:51,509
leaves as they emerge and you get a

301
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,610
really high level of diversity within a

302
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:55,259
leaf over a short amount of time so you

303
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,730
know within a couple weeks you get a lot

304
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:59,480
of different diverse types of fungi

305
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:01,620
they're actually within these leaves

306
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,629
eventually though you know spoiler alert

307
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,950
everything dies so eventually the leaf

308
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,570
is going to die it's gonna fall to the

309
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,040
ground and a lot of these fungi end up

310
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:09,420
being able to switch their lifecycle to

311
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:11,099
become saprotrophic so

312
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,110
they go from endophytes to stop or truce

313
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,450
and we don't really understand that

314
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,950
transition it's a kind of a cool

315
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:19,410
transition if the same fungi are doing

316
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,930
both roles so eventually the saboteurs

317
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:23,850
break down things in the soil they spoil

318
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:25,169
later or you know some other mysterious

319
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,860
ways they might get up into the air

320
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:27,899
again

321
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,909
but those spores get up in the air which

322
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:31,259
we think then in fact those newly

323
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:34,469
emerging lead so really is kind of a

324
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:35,970
Lion King circle of life thing I have a

325
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,680
four year old so I speak in Disney

326
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:42,259
movies a lot of time so I apologize for

327
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:44,519
that very well

328
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:49,708
frozen yea I've taken all the frozen

329
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:51,149
references out but all right so what

330
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,649
Betsy shown in this is where this is

331
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:53,990
where I come into the story so I came in

332
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:56,429
right after this paper was published

333
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:59,129
Betsy and her former grad student /

334
00:11:56,429 --> 00:12:00,479
postdoc Michelle Othman had showed in a

335
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:03,149
variety of these fungal and of fights

336
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,589
that they seemed to contain bacterial

337
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:07,169
symbionts and though it's a cool story

338
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:08,100
to understand I this is the story I tell

339
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:09,328
I think Betsy tells it slightly

340
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:14,180
different but I like my version better

341
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:18,239
so Betsy is very very detailed and very

342
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:20,219
specific and how she curates things and

343
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,570
cleans things and her and Michelle were

344
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,730
isolating a bunch of these fungi from

345
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,110
around the world we're preparing sterile

346
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:28,139
isolates of it and putting them in water

347
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,970
auger or water or water pushers and so

348
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:31,620
over time they just had this massive

349
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:34,190
collection of water vouchers of fungi

350
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,970
which is basically just fungi in water

351
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:37,410
every once in a while they would see

352
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:39,209
bacterial contaminants pop up in the

353
00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:40,528
water auger and they're like oh there's

354
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,879
you know we got a autoclave things

355
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:44,909
better than we got to clean things

356
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:46,379
better and be really really vehement and

357
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:48,120
getting these bacteria out because they

358
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:49,708
thought they were contaminants when they

359
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,360
start to look back at the data the same

360
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:53,399
contaminants are popping up in the same

361
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,959
fungal cultures and no matter how well

362
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:56,190
they cleaned they would get these same

363
00:12:54,958 --> 00:13:00,419
contaminants coming up again and again

364
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:01,769
and again then Betsy Michelle maybe

365
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:03,120
they're actually in the fungi and

366
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:05,759
they're just popping out at certain

367
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,679
levels um and then you know they did

368
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,679
some fish these are fish papers from a

369
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:14,599
16s fish from a couple of different

370
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:16,469
fungi but basically these dots are

371
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,170
bacteria that seem to be within the

372
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,819
hyphy of a variety of different fungi so

373
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:22,588
again this is where I come in

374
00:13:20,818 --> 00:13:23,309
what Betsy Michelle were able to do was

375
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:26,130
just you know

376
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:27,839
Tina's PCR and amplify using amplicon

377
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:29,909
sequencing a variety of these spectral

378
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,889
sequences from the fungi they built a

379
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:34,559
tree the tree is gonna happen in a

380
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:37,470
second in a couple of slides but I will

381
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,209
get to that so we think and this is kind

382
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,860
of how Betsy's whole isolation scheme so

383
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,570
we think what happens is that there's

384
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,399
just fungi and bacteria inside of those

385
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:47,100
fungi inside of leaves and things like

386
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:50,309
platic lattice we can plate out the

387
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,870
fungi and then they look like normal

388
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:54,599
fungi we just plate them out on just

389
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:56,490
normal augur bacteria don't emerge out

390
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,230
at this point so this is this plus

391
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,730
represents there's a bacteria inside of

392
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,629
there but when you actually grow them on

393
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:03,570
plates you don't see the bacteria

394
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:04,980
popping out it took a while to figure

395
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,350
this out but it's not just that you can

396
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,480
put the fungi and have the bacteria pop

397
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,009
out what you have to do is stress out

398
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,050
the fungi and bacteria a little bit and

399
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:14,939
so what we would do and again this is

400
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:16,620
sometimes you do indirect experiments

401
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,510
that end up showing you how to the way

402
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,519
so it turns out you need to heat shock

403
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:22,470
you sponge out a little bit and then you

404
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,480
get the bacteria and a dotting out and

405
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:27,120
growing out from the fungi so we can

406
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,680
take these clean fungal isolates heat

407
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,960
shock them a little bit and then we get

408
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:33,719
what we now call ehb I'm just kind of

409
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,910
emerging out now I think there's a tree

410
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,460
right so Betsy and Michelle sequence

411
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:40,319
both without culturing and them with

412
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,519
culturing some of them variety of these

413
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,720
different bacterial types that they

414
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,360
found inside of these fungal endophyte

415
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,370
s' this is a tree representing a lot of

416
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,750
the diversity I found I like this tree

417
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:50,669
because it represents a couple of things

418
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,740
that I like to frame this question went

419
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:54,959
first off this is the tree that shows a

420
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,850
huge diversity of bacteria so we have

421
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,830
gram positives a proteobacteria there's

422
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,269
a lot of protein bacteria there and then

423
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:03,150
even within the proteobacteria some

424
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:04,439
other more specialized ones point I want

425
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:05,639
to make is there's gram positives and

426
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,620
gram negatives in this tree it's not

427
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,708
like there's a truly specialized you

428
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,269
know pattern that we're seeing yet

429
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:14,429
second thing I want to point out in this

430
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:16,319
yellow box that represents the pirkled

431
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:18,479
area if you look at a variety of

432
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,910
different bacteria interacting with

433
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,649
fungal systems more often than not it's

434
00:15:20,909 --> 00:15:24,929
going to be a pirkled area that you see

435
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:26,730
and so this yellow box represents the

436
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:29,549
pirkled area in a variety of different

437
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:32,940
forms even that candidate s lemare

438
00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:34,919
bacter again I'm I get in I get an

439
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,780
arguments with nomenclatural people go

440
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:37,049
mirror back there kind of is the pirkled

441
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,338
area

442
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:41,219
clayed like it's just a little bit more

443
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:42,420
specialized in Alaska Larry backers up

444
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,820
there Buerkle Derry is there there's

445
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:46,669
another pirkled area and a forum on the

446
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,500
different played I'm so that yellow box

447
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:51,629
effectively represents the 80% of what

448
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,578
was known before Betsy published this

449
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:56,250
paper showing and a bacterial diversity

450
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:58,109
inside of fungi what Betsy was able to

451
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,970
show him what Betsy Michelle showed or

452
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:03,778
in this blue box these are all isolates

453
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:05,160
from different fungal sequencing

454
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:07,289
isolates from different fungi that they

455
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:08,909
had you'll notice and we have some

456
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:10,708
Buerkle Darius I didn't I didn't put

457
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:12,360
overlay on that but a lot of these other

458
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,979
types of bacteria or not they were never

459
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,360
really shown to be associated with fungi

460
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,490
before and there's a huge diversity we

461
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,339
have gram positives a bunch of alpha

462
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:22,709
Proteobacteria a bunch of gamma beta all

463
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:24,209
over the place the nice part about these

464
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:26,159
is that a lot of these bacteria end up

465
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:29,189
being highly culturable very easily

466
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:31,319
culturable and so it as a bacteriologist

467
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,820
i kind of screamed out to me like i can

468
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,920
actually do genetics and grow these

469
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,269
things and manipulate them it seemed

470
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:39,689
like an awesome system to actually jump

471
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:41,220
into so that's step one a lot of

472
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,860
different diversity within bacteria

473
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,940
within fungi when we actually started

474
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,980
looking at the phylogenetic diversity

475
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,890
and matching up you know which bacteria

476
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:52,470
was found in which fungal hosts what you

477
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:54,360
would see was that within and these

478
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,220
boxes just represent clades of bacteria

479
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,350
within the blue box and within the red

480
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:01,500
box these are different isolates of

481
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:04,558
bacteria from fungi these are the fungal

482
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,269
names what I want you to take away from

483
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,279
this is that we find very similar

484
00:17:06,269 --> 00:17:10,318
bacteria in very different fungal hosts

485
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:13,109
all within kind of the the ascomycete

486
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:15,629
but very different fungal hosts and so

487
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:17,129
we've even now got nearly identical

488
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,870
strains there's basically there's no

489
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:20,520
snips between strain no no single

490
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:22,558
nucleotide polymorphisms between the

491
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:26,490
bacterial strains found within different

492
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:28,379
classes of ascomycete so we think that

493
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,609
speaks that there's maybe these are

494
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,110
being horizontally transferred across

495
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:32,939
strains pretty frequently and pretty

496
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:34,019
readily versus the vertical inherence

497
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,940
that you may see with things like the

498
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:39,418
burgled area or the the gloomier back

499
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,740
here are the molecules isolates so we

500
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:43,050
see this in a variety different way so

501
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,279
here's these are the ones the blue box

502
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:46,500
is the ones like kind of focused on

503
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:48,599
going forward these are ludia bacter

504
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,910
they're kind of Xanthomonas die yellow

505
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:53,189
blue tobacker things yeah

506
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:56,580
proteobacteria these ones are more

507
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:59,400
enteric so you get it or wynia panto

508
00:17:56,579 --> 00:18:01,139
eeeh other things like that i'm but

509
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,670
again we we find her winnie a very

510
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,020
similar winnie strains across very

511
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:06,200
different fungal host so we think

512
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:09,000
they're being horizontally transferred

513
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,529
and then even within the same fungal

514
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,210
host we can find multiple isolates that

515
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:15,960
are divergent so in this case we have a

516
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:19,289
fungal host as the lodi abscess that

517
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,789
actually has we think in this case we

518
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:22,440
have one that's the pestle OD abscess

519
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:24,720
that has Lutie bacteria and a Rhizobium

520
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,580
this one's I'm showing a pestle OD

521
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,250
abscess with in erwinia I'm Anna Louie

522
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:31,460
Becker there can be multiple bacterial

523
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,509
types within the same fungal host

524
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,519
spatially we don't have it quite worked

525
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:39,269
out yet but it seems like we've found

526
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:42,000
about I think 12 different 16s sequences

527
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:44,309
within a - Mac a bacteria so it seems

528
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,930
like there's potential there for quite a

529
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:47,730
high amount of diversity relative to

530
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,799
what we would have imagined originally

531
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,910
think again we don't quite know how

532
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,259
they're spatially structure it seems

533
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,000
like there is some spatial structure to

534
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:55,680
where they're found but we can find

535
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,480
multiple bacterial isolates within the

536
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,670
same fungus and I think that's

537
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,779
interesting going forward kind of

538
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,910
thinking about what that does in terms

539
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:04,289
of combinations far majority of them

540
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:07,170
though just have kind of one isolate

541
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:10,409
that we can see up to 12 in some cases

542
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:11,820
though so we can isolate a lot of these

543
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,170
are culturable and if they're culturable

544
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:14,879
that means we can do a lot of

545
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:17,370
interesting bacterial genetics and other

546
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,480
associations between them so we can also

547
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:22,679
clear the fungi of the bacteria and so

548
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,180
it was pretty easy to kind of figure

549
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,890
this out and then other labs have shown

550
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:28,590
this before so if we grow these fungi on

551
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:29,880
a cocktail of antibiotics and in some

552
00:19:28,589 --> 00:19:31,159
cases this doesn't even work but if we

553
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,300
grow them on a cocktail of antibiotics

554
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,910
eventually we can get clean fungi

555
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:37,379
without bacterial symbiosis we verify

556
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:40,259
this through fish we verify it through

557
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,180
PCR and just through microscopy they

558
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:43,980
seem to be pretty clean we can get AZ

559
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:47,100
Nakai Slits AZ nick just meaning no

560
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:48,569
bacteria colonizing them a fungi

561
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:50,429
if we can culture the bacteria and we

562
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:51,419
can culture the fungal host seems like

563
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,549
we should be able to try to figure out

564
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,560
how to put them back together as well

565
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:56,639
took us a while probably two years to

566
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:59,879
figure out the tricks with this because

567
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,410
they wouldn't take for a lot of the

568
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,050
times but we finally figured out that if

569
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,800
we grow the fungus and bacteria

570
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:06,210
separately

571
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,579
mix them together in minimal media in

572
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,870
some cases the trick was actually

573
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:10,769
growing them in middle media and giving

574
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:12,689
them a little bit of a starvation

575
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:14,129
environment seems like the bacteria tend

576
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,220
to go back into the fungi a lot more

577
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,630
under those conditions and so it ends up

578
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,579
being pretty easy to reassociate these

579
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,960
if you have the right conditions we just

580
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:24,990
mix them together and liquid and they

581
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:27,779
can you just go back together it's kind

582
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:29,220
of nice so we can reassociate bacteria

583
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:30,569
with fungi and how do we prove this well

584
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,360
we prove it through again through PCR

585
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:34,769
through just culturing if you grow if

586
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,299
you take this mixed culture and just put

587
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:39,750
it on a plate you don't see any bacteria

588
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:40,769
growing on the outside so we think

589
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,119
they're inside but then you can do

590
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:44,309
things like microscopy so what I'm going

591
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:46,079
to show you in this case is a we've been

592
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:47,460
able to label with TD tomato a

593
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,199
fluorophore we've labeled with Louie

594
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,809
backer with that fluorophore

595
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,539
in this case we just did some microscopy

596
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:57,389
showing fluorescence of that so here is

597
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:59,099
going to be look here for the rien occu

598
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,170
lated bacterial isolate this is just

599
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:03,689
going to be a sterile I showing there's

600
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:05,970
no background fluorescence so here's TD

601
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:08,850
tomato showing up kind of along the

602
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:10,680
lines of the hyphy the reviewers

603
00:21:08,849 --> 00:21:12,480
tolerated this but they weren't quite

604
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,430
happy with this because I mean you can

605
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,900
kind of they look like they're inside

606
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:17,370
the hyphy but they might just all be

607
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,810
attached to the hyphy and kind of

608
00:21:17,369 --> 00:21:21,239
fluoresce even a few different planes

609
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:24,450
like we got it published but we weren't

610
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,799
quite happy with this so and it took us

611
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,600
a while but since we had that

612
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:29,940
fluorescent isolated bacteria I mean

613
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,589
then we could do confocal microscopy I

614
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,630
was using my own computer I have a fancy

615
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:36,179
illustration of showing this it's just

616
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:37,860
not going to be as dramatic as I wanted

617
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,789
to be but here's the confocal picture I

618
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:41,969
could do Z Sachs

619
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:44,039
if you labeled a TD tomato there's a

620
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:45,870
bacteria in the little red spots the

621
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,430
blue on the outside is Kalka floor so

622
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:49,679
that basically stains chitin and it's

623
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:50,910
things the fungal walls blue so if we do

624
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,470
a Z stack through this you can basically

625
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:54,420
definitely tell that there's fluorescent

626
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:56,339
bacteria inside of the - that's not just

627
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:58,560
the bound to the outside I'm again I

628
00:21:56,339 --> 00:21:59,939
just imagine a little bit you know this

629
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,259
part turns blue and then the red goes

630
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:06,870
away and then the blue comes back up my

631
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:08,309
other side video um anyway kind of sad

632
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:10,859
when you spend a lot of time trying to

633
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:13,440
get this one done anyway

634
00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:14,699
anyway whether those are if y'all were

635
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,160
reviewing that paper like we finally

636
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:19,170
have the confocal pictures and I truly

637
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,060
at least in this case truly believe

638
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:23,250
that we can we can read inoculate and

639
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:24,480
they get back inside the hyphy as you'll

640
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,750
see we don't think that they're super

641
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,799
dense inside the hyphy and even in a lot

642
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,960
of cases we think they might go into

643
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,359
some like stasis kind of a not really

644
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,130
growing actively state but they're at

645
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:38,069
least growing actively enough to make

646
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:40,830
that TD tomato for for that's that's

647
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:42,659
good alright last thing I want to show

648
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:44,279
you and this is another trick again this

649
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,390
a lot of this talking's at being a lot

650
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,589
of the tricks I learned along the way to

651
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:49,170
try to figure out how to actually do

652
00:22:46,589 --> 00:22:51,149
this but the other thing I wanted to do

653
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:53,670
was try to measure can we figure out a

654
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:54,870
way to reassociate these bacteria where

655
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,110
I can almost you know not in a

656
00:22:54,869 --> 00:23:00,149
high-throughput way but in a much more

657
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:02,549
systematic way go through and understand

658
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:03,930
host ratings so my background is in

659
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:05,759
evolutionary biology I want to

660
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:07,110
understand the genetics and and how host

661
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,819
range of Olives across a variety of

662
00:23:07,109 --> 00:23:10,619
hosts that's kind of why I want to see

663
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:12,750
the monitoring and what I'd like to go

664
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:14,369
to now I'm with this fungal system I

665
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,990
want to understand you know how does

666
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:17,189
host Ranger Bob is their host range I

667
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,630
mean that's that's still a question is

668
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,160
there a host range and then what is the

669
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,750
genetics in your line so to get to that

670
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,920
point I need to set up a pretty

671
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,440
straightforward host train jury

672
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:27,240
Association system my background was in

673
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,920
Gila kaback you're in grad school and we

674
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,809
had a trick to actually select for

675
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,360
intracellular you know just using tissue

676
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:34,319
culture and human tissue culture cells

677
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:36,000
what you could do with he'll go back

678
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:38,549
here is if you took tissue culture cells

679
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,349
mixed in he like a backer putting

680
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:42,210
gentamicin I'm jeanna Meissen ends up

681
00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:44,399
being if you if he targeted right at the

682
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:46,380
right concentration gentamicin ends up

683
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,850
killing extracellular bacteria but

684
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,480
inside the cell is protected because the

685
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:54,869
gentamicin doesn't penetrate the

686
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,250
eukaryotic cell walls I was I just took

687
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:58,679
a shot in the dark but this seems to

688
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,029
work I think the right levels to go with

689
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,590
in the beginning with the bacteria and

690
00:24:00,029 --> 00:24:03,869
the fungi so what I'm showing you here

691
00:24:01,589 --> 00:24:05,699
is the initial this is a liquid

692
00:24:03,869 --> 00:24:08,489
population so this is just bacteria

693
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,700
inoculated into liquid I let this go for

694
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:13,109
three days again in minimal media so m9

695
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,100
I've got two populations they grow and

696
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:16,679
this is you know there's multiple

697
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:17,849
replicates within these populations so

698
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,460
multiple replicates here multiple

699
00:24:17,849 --> 00:24:21,839
replicates here a lot of bacteria and

700
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,880
then what I can do on day four is just

701
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:25,399
hit them with jenna Meissen at 49 and

702
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,630
grams per microliter

703
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,640
put that in and then measure the

704
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:31,140
cultural but culturable bacteria that

705
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,310
come out of the supernatant not

706
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,070
measuring the fungi that come out of the

707
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:34,509
supernatant

708
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:36,279
after that so here you'll see that in

709
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:37,420
the no gentamicin treatment they don't

710
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:40,299
grow anymore they're just kind of their

711
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:42,130
magenta mice and treatment universally I

712
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:44,619
get nothing back so either they're being

713
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:46,750
killed extracellular Lee I'm extra - Lee

714
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:47,889
or they're just being non culturable but

715
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,319
in this case I think it's a pretty good

716
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:52,680
selective measure where if I do this I

717
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,849
can at least screw up the outside of the

718
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,950
bacteria outside the fungi at a certain

719
00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:59,379
level where I think it acts as a sieve

720
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:01,930
to select at some level for ones that

721
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,880
get back inside so I was kind of happy

722
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:05,740
to see that that actually worked

723
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,240
all right so going forward now I have a

724
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:10,059
nasty to measure can we take different

725
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:12,880
bacterial isolates put them back into a

726
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:14,859
single fungal I slit and see again

727
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,320
primary question here is there something

728
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:19,449
as a host range is it just everybody

729
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:21,909
every bacteria that is available gets in

730
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,860
or is there some sort of way that fungi

731
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:26,380
can select for who gets back in or some

732
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:28,629
way that bacteria can actively evolve to

733
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:31,060
get back in alright so the way I'm gonna

734
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:32,350
do this assay is gonna grow up just like

735
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:33,639
I showed you in the last case grow up

736
00:25:32,349 --> 00:25:35,829
the bacteria and fungi together in

737
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,140
mineral media add gentamicin for a day

738
00:25:35,829 --> 00:25:39,609
which theoretically either kills or

739
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,890
renders non culturable everything in the

740
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:43,419
supernatant middle I'll take that fungal

741
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:45,220
mass which is growing in the liquid

742
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:47,620
culture clean it out on water auger

743
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,480
again really no nutrients the bacteria

744
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:52,000
none of these bacteria grow it's just

745
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,890
auger they're not gonna grow on it what

746
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,019
the fungal mass expand and then after

747
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:57,520
five six seven eight days I'll pick on

748
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:59,440
the outside growing edge of the fungal

749
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:01,480
mass I'm again in no case do I see

750
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,910
bacteria actually growing on the plate

751
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,710
and a lot of those comp opal images and

752
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:07,870
the microscopy images I've shown before

753
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,160
I miss taking place in this in this

754
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:11,379
plate context too so we've we've done

755
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,700
the controls to show it's not that the

756
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,380
bacteria are just kind of quitting on

757
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,150
the auger plate I think they're actually

758
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:19,240
in the hyphy here so we're gonna sample

759
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:20,410
on the edge of the growing hyphy just

760
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,640
like that I'll take a bunch of different

761
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:23,200
samples per plate this is what I was

762
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,970
just showing this sample was taking four

763
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,789
days five days six days and seven days

764
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:30,039
after growth but really is there's not

765
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:32,139
bacteria kind of clear it's truly just

766
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:34,839
fungal hypha so the data I'll show on

767
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:36,820
the next slide is just taking these

768
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:37,750
cores we think plating them out and I've

769
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:41,409
done this in a bunch of different

770
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:43,390
replicates I was kind of saddened at the

771
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:46,120
beginning because every worked was

772
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:46,360
probably a different bacterial end to

773
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:48,579
hide

774
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:49,809
bacteria that I was like oh there's got

775
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:51,339
to be some differentiation here in a

776
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:53,259
single fungal house like there's got to

777
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:55,269
be something when I did this assay they

778
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:57,789
all seemed to go into the same levels

779
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:59,859
and they're they're getting we get we

780
00:26:57,789 --> 00:27:02,680
get a lot of bacteria back out of the

781
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:04,449
single fungal course but all of those

782
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,920
endo Highfill bacteria seem to go in at

783
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:07,870
the same levels and so there's maybe

784
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,360
there's not a horse range but I've got

785
00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:11,889
my little four other a variety of other

786
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:13,329
side projects in the lab I like to work

787
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:15,000
with Pseudomonas that's RI which is just

788
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:17,109
a big witnessed environmental bacteria

789
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,369
it's naturally transformable so the

790
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:20,769
genetics is kind of interesting but

791
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:22,689
that's my baby my lab baby that I try to

792
00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:25,150
work in any experiment that I can I'm so

793
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:28,180
I took a Louie Becker strain reassociate

794
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:30,250
with fungal host and then took a

795
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:54,400
bacterial that Pseudomonas duster.i

796
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:56,170
strain did the same thing I've reached

797
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,860
the level of associate professor so I'm

798
00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:00,970
I've seen every technological challenge

799
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:03,699
alright so what you're seeing here is

800
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:06,940
just a bunch of those fungal hypha cores

801
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,440
this is log CF uses a log scale this is

802
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,940
just a Lutie back your species and again

803
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,769
we get you know 10 to the 5th out per

804
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:14,070
centimeter so there's a lot of Looby

805
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:16,779
back to there Pseudomonas that's RI

806
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:19,389
usually we get back nothing which is

807
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:21,039
good you know I think there really is

808
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:23,860
something as a host range in terms of

809
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:26,589
some bacteria can reassociate and some

810
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:27,819
can't that's awesome every once in a

811
00:28:26,589 --> 00:28:29,259
while I'll get a little bit of

812
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:30,789
Pseudomonas that's right coming through

813
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:33,250
these assays and there's some that get

814
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:35,649
into the hi-c the reason I don't show

815
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,670
that cleaned up data is because so

816
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,259
there's a number there it's a positive

817
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,970
number in every case where I've followed

818
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:41,589
up on this there's Lube actor

819
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,850
contamination in the fungal hyphae as

820
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:45,369
well they just you know you just kind of

821
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:47,319
cross get it in so whatever so if it's

822
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:49,419
just us right it doesn't get back in at

823
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:50,919
all if you mix it a little bit with Lou

824
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,150
do you back you're on the stud sir I can

825
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,380
get back in at a certain level so I

826
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:55,330
think there's something cool going on

827
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:57,510
there that I haven't fleshed out yet as

828
00:28:55,329 --> 00:28:57,509
well

829
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:01,440
so there are qualitative differences and

830
00:28:59,069 --> 00:29:02,878
reassociation capabilities which some

831
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,409
level means there's something like host

832
00:29:02,878 --> 00:29:06,118
range within these bacteria fungi which

833
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,379
again going forward is is kind of

834
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:08,638
awesome for the way I like to think

835
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:11,759
about the world and the way I like to

836
00:29:08,638 --> 00:29:13,348
test the world so that's the you know

837
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:14,249
somebody on some fungi now we can ask

838
00:29:13,348 --> 00:29:15,598
questions now that we can do

839
00:29:14,249 --> 00:29:16,769
reassociation x' and kind of do the

840
00:29:15,598 --> 00:29:18,658
controlled assays we can ask questions

841
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:20,548
about do these bacteria actually

842
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:22,340
contribute to to fungal behavior do they

843
00:29:20,548 --> 00:29:25,589
change anything at all

844
00:29:22,339 --> 00:29:28,038
we'll see so we can take this pestle OD

845
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:30,209
abscess nine one four three ISIL it

846
00:29:28,038 --> 00:29:34,528
naturally infected with lutea bacteria

847
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:36,719
species I'd I need to I hate bacterial

848
00:29:34,528 --> 00:29:39,028
nomenclature but indigo because they

849
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:41,940
have to do field trials I'm trying to

850
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:43,469
actually name this guy because they have

851
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,239
to do that for the USDA and releasing

852
00:29:43,469 --> 00:29:48,469
stuff so this is going to now be called

853
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:50,909
Louie Becker I think my co business

854
00:29:48,469 --> 00:29:53,460
there's a business this is my co

855
00:29:50,909 --> 00:29:55,830
business for fungal proximity soluti

856
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,489
backer nine 1:43 is isolate comes from

857
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:58,648
nine one four three

858
00:29:56,489 --> 00:30:00,659
this fungi is naturally infected with

859
00:29:58,648 --> 00:30:03,808
bat yellow blue tea back your bacteria

860
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:05,339
and we can hear that fungi that fungus

861
00:30:03,808 --> 00:30:06,928
by antibiotic treatments and so that's

862
00:30:05,338 --> 00:30:09,719
that's pretty straightforward and then

863
00:30:06,929 --> 00:30:12,059
we can resynthesize this strain with the

864
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:13,950
same bacteria and so the data I'll show

865
00:30:12,058 --> 00:30:16,678
you going forward is either they'll be

866
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:18,330
called natural infected cured or or

867
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:20,909
resynthesize so just kind of keep those

868
00:30:18,329 --> 00:30:22,168
in your head going forward those are

869
00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:23,759
variety different assays I could show

870
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:25,320
but I like this one because it kind of

871
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:28,889
makes makes an interesting point it's

872
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:31,558
it's somewhat quantifiable and so these

873
00:30:28,888 --> 00:30:33,148
fungal endophyte end up having again

874
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:34,528
that circle of life lifestyle where they

875
00:30:33,148 --> 00:30:38,128
can be plant growth promoting that can

876
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:40,048
be degraders hypertrophy and so again

877
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:41,488
for a variety of reasons we went down

878
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:46,259
the road of looking at degradation

879
00:30:41,489 --> 00:30:48,869
because in a maybe g so we were we were

880
00:30:46,259 --> 00:30:50,909
interested in quantifying the ability of

881
00:30:48,868 --> 00:30:53,158
fungi to degrade various plant materials

882
00:30:50,909 --> 00:30:54,599
with and without bacterial some ions and

883
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:56,879
then a i'll show you here is just a

884
00:30:54,598 --> 00:30:58,319
cellulose i say this is congo red binds

885
00:30:56,878 --> 00:30:59,398
to things like cellulose have you put

886
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:00,928
into play mice to a bunch of different

887
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:04,558
sugars to but we've kind of ruled those

888
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:06,359
out as a control this is a fungal mass

889
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:07,829
growing in the middle and then we're

890
00:31:06,358 --> 00:31:10,678
just going to measure this zoning

891
00:31:07,829 --> 00:31:11,609
this clearing outside of the fungal mass

892
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:14,250
of the

893
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:16,169
cellulase whatever it is I'm against we

894
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:18,359
get Lisi clearing outside of the fungal

895
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:19,410
masses growth and that's what we're

896
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:22,649
gonna measure in terms of our

897
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:24,150
quantitative ability here naturally

898
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:25,440
infected has a certain amount of

899
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:28,320
clearing which we've kind of normalized

900
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,250
to a level around one so naturally

901
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:31,529
affect it as a certain amount of

902
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:33,869
clearing the cured strain of this nine

903
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:35,548
one four three we see no clearing that

904
00:31:33,869 --> 00:31:38,939
was kind of a nice qualitative

905
00:31:35,548 --> 00:31:40,679
something's changing in these fungi we

906
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:43,410
take the bacteria away that clearing

907
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:44,759
zone goes away which is awesome now

908
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:46,019
because we can resynthesize we can

909
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:47,940
actually do the control put the bacteria

910
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:49,679
back in with the resynthesized that

911
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,600
clearing comes back and so whatever it

912
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,190
is whatever this bacteria is doing it's

913
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:54,959
affecting the whatever this clearing

914
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,539
zone means in terms of cellulose

915
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,179
clearing and so that's kind of cool

916
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:01,440
that was our foray into it and we then

917
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:02,280
were you know again you take a shot in

918
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,620
the dark

919
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:06,960
alright so this is just a quantitative

920
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:09,239
assay on a plate why don't we just mix

921
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,160
plants and fungi together and see what

922
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:17,220
happens I am still amazed that this

923
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:18,540
works we did stats they're different the

924
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,558
other thing to say is that the bacteria

925
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:21,569
themselves alluded back here has a

926
00:32:19,558 --> 00:32:23,250
little bit of cellulose activity but

927
00:32:21,569 --> 00:32:25,319
even in transposon mutants like we still

928
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:26,579
see that clearing zone going out so it's

929
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:28,439
not the bacteria that's doing it

930
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:30,539
specifically it's something happening to

931
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,910
the fungus that's leading to that

932
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:34,619
clearing activity all right so what

933
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:37,320
about rates of decomposition again I'm

934
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:39,209
amazed that this works but it works so

935
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:41,039
what we can do is take plant material

936
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:42,808
put it in a petri dish and then

937
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,909
inoculate you the with fungus seasoning

938
00:32:42,808 --> 00:32:47,069
fungus or fungus with that nine one four

939
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:49,590
three strain if we let that go for like

940
00:32:47,069 --> 00:32:51,960
three months which you can actually do

941
00:32:49,589 --> 00:32:54,089
is is way this petri dish over time and

942
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,590
obviously we do it in replicates if you

943
00:32:54,089 --> 00:32:57,750
weigh that over time you can actually

944
00:32:55,589 --> 00:33:00,000
measure like mass loss because it's a

945
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:02,039
pyro film them but they lose either

946
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,660
through water or co2 or something they

947
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:05,970
lose mass from this plate so we can

948
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,500
actually measure amounts of degradation

949
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:12,390
over time just by weighing the petri

950
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:13,769
dish very non-intuitive graph but the

951
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,540
higher the number here the greater the

952
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:19,710
mass loss so I apologize for it should

953
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:21,659
be greater the number the more the

954
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,740
masses lost I'm not a lot of mass is

955
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,570
being lost here but again we've done

956
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,450
this in a bunch of different replicates

957
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:28,750
and it

958
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:30,069
the stats worked out as I'll show you so

959
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,769
at a high end we've got three percent

960
00:33:30,069 --> 00:33:34,240
and then and zero and the naturally

961
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:36,849
affected just that naturally infected

962
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,220
fungus we get about a 2% mass loss over

963
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:42,219
again two or three months in the cured

964
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:44,680
fungus we get less and so it's maybe 75%

965
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,930
of the mass loss or so statistically

966
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:49,269
different again nonparametric stats like

967
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:51,910
bunch of replicates like this for

968
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:53,230
whatever reason it works out and then we

969
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:55,090
can do that recent assistance show you

970
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:56,319
know does this come back together sure

971
00:33:55,089 --> 00:33:57,970
enough it comes back we can actually

972
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:00,759
recapitulate that mass loss with the

973
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:05,200
bacteria so those are numbers those are

974
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:06,789
stats sometimes it's not the most yeah

975
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,559
sometimes people don't like numbers and

976
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:10,090
so picture I'm gonna show you next

977
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:11,110
hopefully convinces you that something

978
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,210
else is happening here because I'm going

979
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:14,320
to show you pictures of those various

980
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:16,269
treatments at least representative

981
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,370
pictures from those treatments here's

982
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:20,590
the control with nothing on so that's

983
00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:22,449
just the mass loss of you know no fungus

984
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:24,130
growing over time here's a different

985
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:26,199
fungus but the same kind of a treatments

986
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:27,670
this is a zenok fungus again after three

987
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:29,589
months hasn't broken down that plant

988
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:31,240
material at all that fungus plus

989
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,769
bacteria you get a nice mat that's

990
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:34,479
actually breaking down stuff like

991
00:34:32,769 --> 00:34:36,759
visually and this this happens really

992
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,980
repeatedly so it's you know we have

993
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,440
numbers but that's pretty striking like

994
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,969
you get growth and not growth so even

995
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,800
though it's like if you know 1%

996
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:47,589
difference you're measuring degradation

997
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,850
so it's kind of hard over time I believe

998
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:50,140
it I think something's happening here I

999
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:52,239
think something's cool happening here I

1000
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:54,789
don't have the data following up on this

1001
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:56,259
but we basically just finished so the

1002
00:34:54,789 --> 00:34:58,869
next step with this was to take you know

1003
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,700
plus and minus bacteria fungus put it in

1004
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:02,409
a litter box or a litter bag and stick

1005
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:04,000
it in the ground for three months same

1006
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:05,619
kinds of trends happen so that the

1007
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,710
degradation difference happens in the

1008
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:10,480
ground in Arizona in January which is

1009
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:11,740
weird because it's not and I'm amazed

1010
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,280
that it works but it works we get the

1011
00:35:11,739 --> 00:35:16,779
same difference in degradation over time

1012
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,420
so I think this might be ecologically

1013
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,890
relevant I'm really curious going

1014
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:23,950
forward in the future like with the

1015
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:25,650
genetics of all this because I think I

1016
00:35:23,949 --> 00:35:30,019
think there's a lot of questions here

1017
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:31,190
all right so yeah so that's the the

1018
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:32,840
behaviors I think things are changing

1019
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:37,070
Betsy has some other stories showing

1020
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:38,690
that plant group oxen production plant

1021
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:40,220
hormone production synthesis by the

1022
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:41,809
fungus kind of changes with the bacteria

1023
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:43,519
- I think there's a story here going

1024
00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:44,750
forward where that partnership actually

1025
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:47,509
matters for a variety of different

1026
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:49,480
fungal traits then we can ask what are

1027
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:51,980
the bacteria get out of this partnership

1028
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,510
what's going on here at some level it

1029
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,130
might be things like antibiotic

1030
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:56,420
resistance where if they hide out my fee

1031
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:58,430
I actually already showed you that there

1032
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:00,650
they can tolerate gentamicin at a

1033
00:35:58,429 --> 00:36:02,359
certain level but there might be

1034
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:03,829
something else there so with this

1035
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:08,050
question I'm gonna focus on that Lutie

1036
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:11,090
bacter mycav businness species that I'm

1037
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:12,260
focused on before because I noticed

1038
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:13,280
something weird with that species

1039
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,870
compared to a bunch of the other

1040
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,030
bacteria I was working with and if you

1041
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:19,069
actually look through we had a bunch of

1042
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:20,660
these ludia backers pop up in a variety

1043
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,740
of different fungi and it just seemed

1044
00:36:20,659 --> 00:36:23,359
like there was something there that was

1045
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:25,939
different with the Louie backers versus

1046
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,380
the other bacteria and if you do if you

1047
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,450
look at Philo sphere

1048
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,530
you know just microbiome samples you

1049
00:36:29,449 --> 00:36:32,509
don't get a lot of Lutie backyard

1050
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:33,710
they're not really there we see them a

1051
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:35,030
lot in the sunshine so I thought maybe

1052
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:38,780
this is a something to dig in and

1053
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:40,280
actually make the system out of I was

1054
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,600
just growing actually the the story

1055
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,790
behind this is that I have my Lutie

1056
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,170
backer and I teach microbials you know

1057
00:36:43,789 --> 00:36:46,699
this course every year and we do a

1058
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,920
transposon mutagenesis experiment with

1059
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:50,960
the students I just assume that things

1060
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,730
would behave and so I a new Lutie back

1061
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,190
your grew an lb media I'm like well we

1062
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:56,570
can do them throw it on lb make

1063
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:58,760
transpose I mutants and then we can look

1064
00:36:56,570 --> 00:37:00,680
for things like oxygen ease so I set up

1065
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,210
this whole lab with you know 80 by 80

1066
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:04,849
undergraduates and they were looking for

1067
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:07,220
us and it turns out Louie Becker doesn't

1068
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:08,860
grow and I media alone so it's kind of

1069
00:37:07,219 --> 00:37:11,569
naturally an oxygen

1070
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:13,190
anyway test before you set up labs 480

1071
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:15,769
people test that it works first before

1072
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:19,250
jumping in but that led me to that stood

1073
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:20,750
this so I knew that Lydia batcher so

1074
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,369
from that lab I knew at getting grow

1075
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:24,440
mineral media um but I knew that if we

1076
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:26,000
put Lutie backer in with the fungus in

1077
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,320
liquid mineral media I would get

1078
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,340
bacteria in the super date like you

1079
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,280
would get cloudy you would see the

1080
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:32,210
bacteria growing and so I just kind of

1081
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,900
recapitulated that experiment here this

1082
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:37,400
is just a growth curve in liquid culture

1083
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,840
in m9 mineral media here's Lou do you

1084
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,910
back your without fungus in the

1085
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,220
triangles really doesn't grow it does it

1086
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:43,869
just kind of stays static

1087
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:45,730
with the fungus

1088
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:47,589
put the fungus in there Louie bacter in

1089
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:49,300
the supernatant the density goes up over

1090
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:51,250
time and so the fungus is able to

1091
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:53,830
produce something that feeds the loonie

1092
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:55,539
back to something its mission typically

1093
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:56,889
we would interpret this as maybe there

1094
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:58,840
is an oscar the-- maybe there's some

1095
00:37:56,889 --> 00:38:01,000
pathway in the fungus in the bacteria

1096
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,380
that's missing an amino acid production

1097
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,420
pathway or something that's kind of a

1098
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,099
typical assumption you would make they

1099
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:08,190
stopped at this result so what I did was

1100
00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:10,059
I went back in tested every amino acid

1101
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,380
individually with the Lutie back to see

1102
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:15,250
if they could compliment growing within

1103
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:17,019
that liquid culture and I found that it

1104
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:19,300
was not a simple story but it's a cool

1105
00:38:17,019 --> 00:38:20,500
story so the there was two amino acids

1106
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:23,110
that could complement Ludi back to your

1107
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:25,030
growth in liquid culture in m9 cysteine

1108
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:26,849
Ameth I mean and so what are those

1109
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:30,130
having calm they're the only

1110
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:31,630
sulfur-containing amino acids so it

1111
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,369
turns out that if you add swapper

1112
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,780
containing amino acids to m9 who do you

1113
00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:36,369
badger can grow so I started digging

1114
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,840
around in genomes trying to figure out

1115
00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:39,039
what's actually going on here cuz Lou do

1116
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,200
you backed your it's like a Xanthomonas

1117
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:42,489
it's a proteobacteria should be able to

1118
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:44,379
grow on sulfate because all the mineral

1119
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:46,000
media's are derived from e.coli and they

1120
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,860
all have magnesium sulfate in them as a

1121
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,619
sulfur source so what's going on with

1122
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,849
moody back here here's just a from a

1123
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:54,099
different paper showing again across

1124
00:38:51,849 --> 00:38:55,329
proteobacteria like they all transport

1125
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:57,519
sulfate they're all really good at

1126
00:38:55,329 --> 00:38:59,829
acquiring sulfate from sulfur from

1127
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:01,539
sulfate when you look at Ludi bacter

1128
00:38:59,829 --> 00:39:03,519
it's actually missing all the sulfate

1129
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:06,759
transporters and kind of all the

1130
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:08,320
associated genes as well so it's weird

1131
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,300
for protein bacteria because it can't

1132
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,220
use sulfate as a sulfur source um I

1133
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,600
don't know what it's using in terms of

1134
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:15,129
growth with the fungus but I think this

1135
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,690
might be you know hand-waving Lee

1136
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:19,150
potentially a step towards more of a

1137
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:20,440
specialization going forward in the

1138
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,510
future with the fungus that's I think

1139
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:25,119
that's a cool you know early stage is

1140
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:26,590
maybe a more specialization that we're

1141
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,869
seeing because it's it's just weird that

1142
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:31,000
they don't use sulfate I should say in a

1143
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:33,519
couple of marine systems you do see a

1144
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,519
eukaryotic microbe supplying sulfur

1145
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:37,809
through DMS P to some of its microbes

1146
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:39,759
that actually grow on it so there's

1147
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:42,250
precedent with sulfur transport between

1148
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,960
eukaryotes and microbes as well alright

1149
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:46,300
last thing I'm going to talk about is

1150
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,769
you know how do we use this data going

1151
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,600
forward what can we do going forward in

1152
00:39:47,769 --> 00:39:51,099
terms of potentially manipulating

1153
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,269
microbe ions may be making the world a

1154
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:53,969
little bit of a better place and we

1155
00:39:52,269 --> 00:39:56,590
always like to write that in grants but

1156
00:39:53,969 --> 00:39:57,519
I'm cynical but well we'll see going

1157
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:59,019
forward

1158
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:01,800
so how can we actually make a difference

1159
00:39:59,019 --> 00:40:04,150
and engineer some microbiomes

1160
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,590
the thing about plant microbiomes is

1161
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:07,780
that they're really hard to change once

1162
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:08,950
they get established bacteria coming

1163
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,800
from the outside environment they're

1164
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:14,710
coming from everywhere the soil the air

1165
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,750
the vectors everywhere else and so once

1166
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:18,429
the plant is there it's really hard to

1167
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:20,619
change the microbiome that's actually on

1168
00:40:18,429 --> 00:40:21,849
the plant so when you start thinking

1169
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:23,079
about this there's there's a couple

1170
00:40:21,849 --> 00:40:25,179
places where I think you can really

1171
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:27,219
manipulate who's growing on the plants

1172
00:40:25,179 --> 00:40:28,299
and how you can change the physiology of

1173
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:31,539
the plants going forward with the

1174
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:33,130
microbiome I just like to slot I drew a

1175
00:40:31,539 --> 00:40:36,150
tree and I always like to show the tree

1176
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:38,800
that I draw so there's a little fly

1177
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:42,309
you got you got the small victories in

1178
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,840
science so what I'm gonna focus on is so

1179
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:45,940
the microbiome is hard to change once

1180
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,500
it's established but at the beginning

1181
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:49,329
maybe we can change it a little bit and

1182
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,980
kind of skew it towards manipulating

1183
00:40:49,329 --> 00:40:52,299
physiology a plant hosts in a way that

1184
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:53,800
might be beneficial going forward so I

1185
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,690
think we can do this at the stage of the

1186
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,450
seed because the seed typically is

1187
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:59,920
colonized by a few if any fungi and

1188
00:40:58,449 --> 00:41:01,599
bacteria and we might be able to make a

1189
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,800
difference if we actually do things like

1190
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,599
coat seeds and that might affect

1191
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,580
germination rates or survival of season

1192
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:09,849
different environments so I had a grad

1193
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:12,130
student in a Hoover Oda EPA fellowship

1194
00:41:09,849 --> 00:41:13,449
to go down to I think Panama which was

1195
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,920
awesome because he's like I'm going to

1196
00:41:13,449 --> 00:41:17,409
Pat him oughta do something go for it

1197
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,210
dude um so he had a fun time down there

1198
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:21,009
but what he was doing was investigating

1199
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:24,369
seed borne fungi and their bacterial syn

1200
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:25,900
myosin and can we can we manipulate the

1201
00:41:24,369 --> 00:41:27,340
the bacteria some ions of these seed

1202
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,650
borne fungi to manipulate germination

1203
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:31,570
rates the plant that I'm gonna show you

1204
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:32,920
data from was Cecropia this ends up

1205
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:35,519
being one of these pioneer species in

1206
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:38,079
the Panamanian rainforest or what a

1207
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:44,039
tropics I one of those one of those hot

1208
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:46,358
places that's not for now so sorry

1209
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:49,380
so Cecropia is one of these pioneer

1210
00:41:46,358 --> 00:41:52,769
trees where it's really limited by

1211
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:55,180
sunlight so in the rainforest you get

1212
00:41:52,769 --> 00:41:56,590
holes when trees fall down and then

1213
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,000
these pioneer trees pop up really

1214
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:59,980
quickly and it's kind of a life strategy

1215
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,269
thing so Cecropia is one of those trees

1216
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:03,280
that really pops up to capitalize on

1217
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:04,599
those those open spaces the season of

1218
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,130
being huge and they end up being pretty

1219
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:08,409
easy to collect and so that's why Justin

1220
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:09,880
actually went with these seeds the assay

1221
00:42:08,409 --> 00:42:11,319
he did was basically two just like

1222
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,780
before or the

1223
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,730
isolate fungi grow the fungi and

1224
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:17,080
antibiotics and know and try to cure

1225
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,460
them up the bacteria and then he had a

1226
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:21,608
bunch of different paradise lots of

1227
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:24,099
bacteria and no bacteria fungi isolated

1228
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:26,769
from Cecropia seeds yeah say he then did

1229
00:42:24,099 --> 00:42:29,170
was in like 50 days in a shade house in

1230
00:42:26,769 --> 00:42:31,030
Panama he would take all of these great

1231
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:33,039
grad students now great post doc doing

1232
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:34,090
CRISPR stuff but Justin Schafer's

1233
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:34,840
awesome if you guys have a chance to

1234
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:38,559
hire him in the future

1235
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:41,320
hire him he's awesome that's my plug for

1236
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:43,659
Justin um alright so I'm no clue whether

1237
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,710
he applies anywhere but nonetheless so

1238
00:42:43,659 --> 00:42:47,649
what Justin would do is you would take

1239
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:49,960
these individual seeds put them in a

1240
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:51,639
dish cover the dish for like 50 days and

1241
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,990
then go back and measure the amount of

1242
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:54,909
germination so you can see here some of

1243
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:56,409
these seeds germinate some don't so you

1244
00:42:54,909 --> 00:42:59,319
measure the percentage of germination of

1245
00:42:56,409 --> 00:43:01,029
these plates both with bacteria in fungi

1246
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:03,609
and just with fungi alone without

1247
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:05,440
bacteria on both of these plates or have

1248
00:43:03,608 --> 00:43:06,400
fungi on them and the fungi head back to

1249
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,630
here you can see there's a very

1250
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,190
different fungi very different

1251
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:11,108
strategies here but it's just gonna

1252
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:12,909
measure germination rates in Cecropia

1253
00:43:11,108 --> 00:43:14,858
seeds going through timeline you know

1254
00:43:12,909 --> 00:43:16,149
not the best genetically controlled

1255
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:18,039
experiment but you do what you can in

1256
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:21,190
the fungal rain and the rainforest out

1257
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:22,779
of Panama what he found was in a variety

1258
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:23,980
different cases with different fungi and

1259
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:26,560
we know kind of who the players are and

1260
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:27,880
all of this you can get different

1261
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:29,679
results depending on which which

1262
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,960
partnership you actually choose so in

1263
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:35,858
some cases in a majority of cases we

1264
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:37,599
actually saw fungi with bacteria had

1265
00:43:35,858 --> 00:43:39,789
more germination of the seeds than just

1266
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,858
lungile own with those seeds so this is

1267
00:43:39,789 --> 00:43:43,630
showing you know minus and plus minus is

1268
00:43:41,858 --> 00:43:45,819
without bacteria plus is with bacteria

1269
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:47,650
and then this is just again completely

1270
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:50,800
non-intuitive graph sorry about that but

1271
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:52,150
this is the germination rate so this is

1272
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,650
low germination this is higher

1273
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:56,410
germination low germination higher

1274
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:57,940
germination low higher so bacteria plus

1275
00:43:56,409 --> 00:44:01,089
the fungi seem to affect the germination

1276
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:03,940
rate of those seeds in that shade house

1277
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:05,619
so that's some cases other cases we get

1278
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:07,300
no effect so that's kind of a good

1279
00:44:05,619 --> 00:44:09,070
control and in some cases we actually

1280
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,720
get a negative effect and so whether you

1281
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:12,220
want to call us a pathogen or not it's

1282
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:14,169
know you get into the semantics about a

1283
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:16,419
culpas here but in this case we've got a

1284
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:18,490
fungus alone effects termination of a

1285
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:20,800
certain rate fungus bacteria lowers the

1286
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:22,419
germination rate so again maybe a

1287
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,039
pathogen maybe again it's a kind of

1288
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,500
sticky situations there and try to find

1289
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:30,170
them

1290
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:31,610
all right so wrapping up so the

1291
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:33,530
conclusions here so I've hopefully

1292
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:37,269
showing you at least at some level that

1293
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:40,760
many indefinite fungi contain bacteria

1294
00:44:37,269 --> 00:44:41,989
in a facultative bacteria in a way that

1295
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,340
we don't quite understand that their

1296
00:44:41,989 --> 00:44:44,629
specialization or not but I think that

1297
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,829
they're they're pretty prevalent in

1298
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:47,329
terms of who's out there and who's

1299
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:49,159
associating with you

1300
00:44:47,329 --> 00:44:50,569
Louie bacter strains can modulate at

1301
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:52,549
some level the ability of fungi to

1302
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:54,740
degrade plant material both in very

1303
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:57,140
synthetic contexts but also we think in

1304
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:59,149
very natural contexts blue do you back

1305
00:44:57,139 --> 00:45:00,980
your seems to require organic sulfur

1306
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:03,110
maybe from amino acids maybe from some

1307
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:04,849
other weird things you know plants have

1308
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:06,200
like sulfur lipids and stuff that might

1309
00:45:04,849 --> 00:45:07,610
get processed there's a variety of

1310
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:09,409
different organic sulfur sources that

1311
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:11,360
could be used by the booty back here I'm

1312
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:13,129
in the fungi in the plants but it can't

1313
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:15,110
use sulfate so that's kind of weird

1314
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:17,450
compared other Proteobacteria and then

1315
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:18,620
lastly that last slide and a Highfill

1316
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:20,299
bacteria can influence fungal

1317
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:22,699
interactions with plants in a variety of

1318
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,019
different ways then the other data that

1319
00:45:22,699 --> 00:45:26,299
I haven't shown that we haven't really

1320
00:45:24,019 --> 00:45:28,369
processed yet but it's taken us like

1321
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:30,350
five years to do this but we finally

1322
00:45:28,369 --> 00:45:31,609
have like transcriptomes and dual

1323
00:45:30,349 --> 00:45:32,659
transcript thumbs and do them at a

1324
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:34,460
Balaam's for all these and you know

1325
00:45:32,659 --> 00:45:36,289
expression changes when you put bacteria

1326
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:38,059
with fungus and there's what seems to be

1327
00:45:36,289 --> 00:45:39,440
the the theme and this is a dose

1328
00:45:38,059 --> 00:45:41,329
breakers work that I'll mention in a

1329
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,490
second but the theme here is that a lot

1330
00:45:41,329 --> 00:45:45,349
of these fungi have but we're thought to

1331
00:45:43,489 --> 00:45:47,149
be silent secondary metabolite clusters

1332
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:48,349
you mix them with these bacteria and

1333
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:50,030
some of those secondary metabolite

1334
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:51,349
clusters get turned on then we can see

1335
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:52,970
the metabolites actually showing up so I

1336
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:54,199
think there's a another cool story

1337
00:45:52,969 --> 00:45:56,269
they're showing about how these

1338
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:58,460
associations actually matter so with

1339
00:45:56,269 --> 00:45:59,750
that I all of this work like none of it

1340
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:01,760
would have happened without a simple

1341
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:03,199
email to Betsy and then Betsy's she's a

1342
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,000
force of nature

1343
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:06,230
I bring the bacterial side she brings

1344
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,389
the fungal side it works really well

1345
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:10,429
together I'm Kayla Aaron was a grad

1346
00:46:08,389 --> 00:46:12,739
student who did a lot of those early

1347
00:46:10,429 --> 00:46:15,019
reassociation work kind of figuring out

1348
00:46:12,739 --> 00:46:16,429
how to make it work justin was the guy

1349
00:46:15,019 --> 00:46:18,469
that got to go to Panama for a couple

1350
00:46:16,429 --> 00:46:20,480
months on the government dollar and then

1351
00:46:18,469 --> 00:46:23,259
Jos breaker as a postdoc now in Betsy's

1352
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,610
lab again Joe is applying for jobs so

1353
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:27,860
he's doing the transcriptome abalone

1354
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:30,019
stuff my lab couple of technicians and

1355
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:32,240
uh Kevin Hockett helped out with this

1356
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:34,280
project Kevin's now a p.i at Penn State

1357
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:35,719
and then a bunch of other postdocs and

1358
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,820
undergraduates and a variety of people

1359
00:46:35,719 --> 00:46:38,179
have contributed over the years to this

1360
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:39,980
works

1361
00:46:38,179 --> 00:46:41,869
I I could just get to be the lowly back

1362
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:44,090
heel geneticist a huge team of awesome

1363
00:46:41,869 --> 00:47:10,369
people so thank you very much and thank

1364
00:46:44,090 --> 00:47:12,350
you for the invite yeah yeah can I talk

1365
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:14,809
about hosts ranges for the better so at

1366
00:47:12,349 --> 00:47:16,789
a certain level the patterns don't make

1367
00:47:14,809 --> 00:47:18,590
sense Mia so every bacteria that I get

1368
00:47:16,789 --> 00:47:20,059
out of them to FIDIC fungi seems to be

1369
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:22,430
able to go back into that 9 1 4 3

1370
00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:23,809
isolate as we mentioned before so the

1371
00:47:22,429 --> 00:47:25,369
other thing that I'm trying to chew in

1372
00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:27,230
on this and it just finally I think I

1373
00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:28,579
have an isolate so the pestalozzi

1374
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:30,039
opposites ends up being a mess to work

1375
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:32,179
with genetically engineering

1376
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:34,429
so I've always tried to get the system

1377
00:47:32,179 --> 00:47:37,039
working in or aspera none of those endo

1378
00:47:34,429 --> 00:47:38,419
FIDIC and no - bacteria go into

1379
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:41,029
Neurospora using the assays that I've

1380
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:42,619
defined but now I found one that I can

1381
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:45,710
reassociate with nos bruh and I think

1382
00:47:42,619 --> 00:47:48,289
gets into the - or aspirin so at some

1383
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:50,300
level like the pestle OD abscess can

1384
00:47:48,289 --> 00:47:52,610
pick Pseudomonas versus yeah no -

1385
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:53,960
bacteria Nawroz pura doesn't like any of

1386
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:54,950
those but there's another one that gets

1387
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,420
in their roster so I think there's

1388
00:47:54,949 --> 00:47:58,039
something happening there but I don't

1389
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:01,700
know the phylogenetic patterns of what's

1390
00:47:58,039 --> 00:48:04,190
actually going on there as we've talked

1391
00:48:01,699 --> 00:48:05,750
about like I'm I I want that neuron

1392
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:07,809
system to work cuz I can do so much cool

1393
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:21,079
stuff in that if I can get it to work no

1394
00:48:07,809 --> 00:48:22,309
yeah that has bacteria so do any do you

1395
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:24,340
ever find any that don't have the

1396
00:48:22,309 --> 00:48:26,690
bacterial nature um so yeah so there's

1397
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:28,010
we've done some some sampling and

1398
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:29,720
Justins than a lot more sampling in the

1399
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:31,850
seed associated ones but if you look

1400
00:48:29,719 --> 00:48:33,980
somewhere between 60 and 70 percent

1401
00:48:31,849 --> 00:48:36,619
seemed to have bacteria and then about

1402
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:38,300
30 percent don't um it's not a

1403
00:48:36,619 --> 00:48:39,469
phylogenetic thing it really is like you

1404
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,880
know some haven't some don't and then

1405
00:48:39,469 --> 00:48:42,679
even within the - Matt's kind of like

1406
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,030
citrus greening where it's like there's

1407
00:48:42,679 --> 00:48:46,250
some in some places but not in the other

1408
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:48,740
places the way I like to contextualise

1409
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:50,539
this and maybe what what is happening is

1410
00:48:48,739 --> 00:48:51,929
there's a lot of work on them in the

1411
00:48:50,539 --> 00:48:54,088
microbiome world there's a lot

1412
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:55,858
plus and minus bacteria and mice and I

1413
00:48:54,088 --> 00:48:58,619
take it bacteria away from mouse you

1414
00:48:55,858 --> 00:49:00,269
compared to the nota biotic mice they're

1415
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:02,430
different um so that's completely

1416
00:49:00,269 --> 00:49:03,960
synthetic I think in the fungal world we

1417
00:49:02,429 --> 00:49:05,608
really do have this natural analog of

1418
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,990
plus and minus bacteria at certain

1419
00:49:05,608 --> 00:49:08,190
spatial parts of the hyphy and that

1420
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:10,259
might matter for differences in

1421
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:11,670
physiology throughout the eye if you

1422
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:13,140
really it maybe not at the specialized

1423
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:14,909
level of interaction but maybe plus and

1424
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:17,190
minus bacteria and then that changes

1425
00:49:14,909 --> 00:49:19,710
what the fungi are doing even within a

1426
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:21,829
single you know mass yeah so there's

1427
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:24,119
there's definitely a bunch of there's a

1428
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:26,460
much height be out there that don't have

1429
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:29,460
bacteria and then that we can see or

1430
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:32,510
that we can piece you are anything so

1431
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:32,510
that might be something that's going on

1432
00:49:42,079 --> 00:50:04,349
okay this has been a production of

1433
