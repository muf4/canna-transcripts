1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,160
This is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,400
University.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,879
Well, I had a good week this week, Doug.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,240
I took the kids to uh Yankee Stadium.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,759
Oh, that's fun. We had a We took our

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,679
turf class uh to Yankee Stadium uh with

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,560
some additional people interested. We

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,960
had about 25 people we took down uh to

9
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,799
visit my old college pal um Dan

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,240
Cunningham. And of course, you've been

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,679
down there with me uh as well. Um, and

12
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:29,839
you know, it reminded me of when I

13
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,640
taught in Matt when I taught at Madison.

14
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:34,960
I used to take them up to Lambo. Yeah.

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,159
Yeah. We had pictures of the class at

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,320
the center of Lambo and then we went uh

17
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,439
we took the train. We we took a bus down

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,679
to Yankee Stadium. Uh, and then got on

19
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,159
the subway and went down to Central Park

20
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,799
and visited Zack Holm who's the director

21
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:54,479
of turf care uh at Central Park. did

22
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,959
some grass ID uh of the ryrass and poa

23
00:00:54,479 --> 00:01:00,078
in the field there uh and then hung out

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,799
a little bit uh at Sheep's Meadow.

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,118
Super cool. Yeah. Yeah. Tuesday, that

26
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,920
was Monday. Tuesday, we got up and went

27
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:10,719
out to Delh High Sunni Delh High where

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,960
we had a walk and talk promoting the

29
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:15,118
apprentichip program that the New York

30
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,359
State Turf Grass Association is working

31
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:21,280
on with a bunch of the superintendent

32
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:23,680
organizations. Tyler Bloom's outfit and

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,040
there are about a thousand students

34
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,360
pursuing apprenticeships in gatekeeping

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,079
uh grounds management in New York State.

36
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,759
So this is a very exciting time and we

37
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,599
got to meet some and see some of the

38
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,759
students at Delhigh doing projects on

39
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,118
the golf course. Got to interact with

40
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,599
Tom Kaufman who's been the

41
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,478
superintendent there for many many years

42
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,719
now. Um, and so it was a great visit and

43
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:49,519
actually we got to see some robotic

44
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,599
mowers. Uh, MTE was there. That's Matt

45
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:55,199
Simon, a former superintendent now

46
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:57,759
selling uh, robots for MTE. And it was

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,680
very interesting because you know from a

48
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,399
workforce perspective you know

49
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,880
automation and apprenticeships those

50
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,680
apprenticeships better be teaching

51
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:10,079
technological skills because a lot of

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,080
what these uh folks are going to be

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,599
doing is going to be involving

54
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,520
technology now assumably so this

55
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,878
generation younger generation will be

56
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,159
more uh comfortable integrating

57
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:26,560
technology uh into their work life.

58
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:29,199
Okay, you know, Carl, thanks for joining

59
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,598
us. Glad to have you. I'm on time for a

60
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,119
change. It's so great. I was literally

61
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,199
sitting there like, "Okay, what do I

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,480
do?" Carl's not here. Okay, I owe you

63
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:41,119
now. Yeah, for all those years I've been

64
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:43,119
late, right? Um, but you know, we got

65
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,959
dog pictures. How about a shout out for

66
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,519
the cats? Now, I'm not a big cat guy,

67
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,759
but I got three barn cats, and cats have

68
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,879
their usefulness. They're not very

69
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:55,280
interested in you per se, but they are

70
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,840
interested in uh in some of the things

71
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,400
that bother you around your facility.

72
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,680
And then my man Will Benson with my

73
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,000
absolute favorite dog in the entire golf

74
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,840
turf industry. Will is the

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,239
superintendent at Laurelwood Golf Club,

76
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,439
Little Nine-hole MUN, uh in Eugene,

77
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,519
Oregon. And that is Sandy the Chihuahua.

78
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,318
And to watch Sandy cruise the golf

79
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,800
course is something that is worthwhile.

80
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:22,560
Anyway, to the weather. It was cooler

81
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,599
last week and now we're starting to see

82
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,680
the switch change, right? We're about

83
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:29,719
normal between three to seven days of

84
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,799
normal. You got to go into the highest

85
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:35,280
elevations up in the Aderondex and up in

86
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,760
the Green Mountains and into Maine where

87
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,439
you're more than a week behind. Uh

88
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,598
certainly those areas are a little bit

89
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,359
behind normal. almost everybody else,

90
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,199
especially with the heat. When we have

91
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,120
this conversation next week, you're

92
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,439
probably going to see most people going

93
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:54,640
to be normal. Bjney

94
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:58,239
Hornson tweeted a great picture of early

95
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:01,359
spring grass growth in Iceland. In case

96
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,239
anybody thinks their spring is slow to

97
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,920
emerge, there's always Iceland. Now, I

98
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,759
don't know if we propose to buy this

99
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,839
place yet. I know we're planning on

100
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,318
buying the other joint, but for now

101
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,719
looking at the grass types here,

102
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,798
obviously Bejney is saying those first

103
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:20,478
two rows there of creeping bench grass

104
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:24,000
completely straw brown. The next plot

105
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:27,120
fescue and creeping uh colonial bent

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,478
grass, fescue and colonial bent grass.

107
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,840
Then the row of straight fescue. Then

108
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,680
the row of straight colonial bent. So

109
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,359
you can see in this thing, you know, we

110
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,280
talk about bent being slow in the

111
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,000
northeast and Doug, you probably talk

112
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,000
about it with with Chris Zoo along the

113
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,560
lake, right? Where it's really cool,

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,519
man. You've got to do a lot of things to

115
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,720
get the bench grass growing and probably

116
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:55,198
not the best grass uh for Iceland golf.

117
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,919
Have you been to Iceland, Doug? Never.

118
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,759
Never. Okay. Be's got to get you there.

119
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:04,399
Okay. Um, you can see we're progressing

120
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,720
slowly in the sort of touch points of

121
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,038
spring, like when is a good time to get

122
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,600
a broadleaf herbicide out in the spring.

123
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:14,159
It's never ideal to do it at this time,

124
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,840
but this is a good benchmark of when you

125
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,479
might get an amine or an esester

126
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,879
formulation of a broadleaf weed control

127
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,918
product to provide some measure of

128
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,319
control. It is not ideal for sure. Fall

129
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:28,478
being a much better time. But you can

130
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,199
also pick up some winter annuals as

131
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:33,120
Randy Prosstac tells us a twofer where

132
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,199
you might get some winter annuals before

133
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,959
they flower and get some of the

134
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,360
perennial broadleaf weeds. And this is

135
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:42,000
from old work at Purdue from many many

136
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,160
years ago back in the thral Riker days

137
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
the ancient days. Okay. What this means

138
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,320
is if if we're getting ready to spray

139
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
weeds, it means some of the weeds are

140
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,839
beginning to flower. And we've got our

141
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,120
pollinator risk assessment, which you

142
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:59,679
can see with this map, is really sort of

143
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:02,399
tracking when you shouldn't be spraying.

144
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,879
As it becomes ideal, if you look here,

145
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,279
as it's becoming ideal for these

146
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:11,360
herbicide applications, it's also

147
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:14,239
becoming risky for the pollinators. So,

148
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,800
if you're going to use these products,

149
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,400
mow the flowers off as best as you can.

150
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,319
If the flowers aren't there, the the

151
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,318
bees aren't going to be around. And we

152
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,160
get a lot of visitors to lawns in the

153
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,919
spring, especially with the winter

154
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,960
annuals and the spring ephemerals like

155
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:31,038
lesser celandine that might be

156
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:32,879
flowering. Soils are still cool in some

157
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,439
places again in those high elevations,

158
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,000
you're in the 40s. Uh, and then you go

159
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:41,038
down to the Philly area and you're in

160
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,399
the mid60s. and Long Island in the upper

161
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:47,038
50s60s. And these are trigger points now

162
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:49,918
for where many of your root pathogen

163
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:52,159
fungicide applications will go down. So,

164
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,318
we'd encourage you to keep monitoring

165
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,720
your soil temperature and determine.

166
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,039
We're going to have Mingi on uh the show

167
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,479
at some point this spring to discuss

168
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:05,439
some of the new root pathogens that he

169
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:07,758
is actively uh uh finding with his new

170
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,839
molecular techniques which is obviously

171
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,639
going to shape the way we do control in

172
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:15,359
the future. All right, pretty dry last

173
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,038
week, right? Most areas got very little

174
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,720
rainfall. You had to go up along the

175
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:21,439
Great Lakes and northern areas to get

176
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,000
the rainfall, but the rainfall's coming.

177
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:26,240
You look at the forecast with uh preip

178
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,240
minus evapo transpiration and you can

179
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,960
see we're going to have an excess of

180
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,000
water uh in some of these areas and we

181
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:37,038
have another risk model on the forecast

182
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,519
website that indicates when that rain

183
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:42,399
comes there are parts of the region that

184
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,240
are at risk for runoff. Listen, we put

185
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,159
our pres down now. We put our broad

186
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,720
leaves down now. We put our root

187
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,800
pathogen materials down. You know, maybe

188
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,800
you're putting a broadleaf down. Maybe

189
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,120
you're putting a fertilizer down. We

190
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,000
tend to put a lot of things on the land

191
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,240
in the spring. Monitoring the runoff at

192
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,160
this time of year is really critical

193
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,160
just to get a sense of days you should

194
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,800
avoid. And you can find all this at the

195
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,199
forecast website. All right, we're

196
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,840
getting to it now. Doug got a couple of

197
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,319
guys posting about rolling fairways. Let

198
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:17,119
me tell you how much this warms my heart

199
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,680
to see people rolling more. And we're

200
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,918
gonna take up this topic of traffic and

201
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,840
rolling and organic matter because I

202
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,159
know Carl's got a few things we're going

203
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,959
to chat with you about. But the sort of

204
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,720
theme for today is traffic. And it's

205
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,478
something that I know you did some work

206
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,560
on. We're going to want you to speculate

207
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,879
and extrapolate from where you did those

208
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,799
rounds of golf in those plots, right,

209
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,799
with those fertilizer rates. Remember

210
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,278
that from years ago when you did that?

211
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:46,319
Yeah. Okay. So, here's rolling Jim

212
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:49,519
Pavanetti style at Fairview. And here's

213
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,839
rolling Meadowbrook John Carlo style uh

214
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:56,000
on Long Island. You know what I mean?

215
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:58,320
Big wide units rolling. Everybody's

216
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,799
starting to see the benefits of this.

217
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,800
The obstacle has been it takes too long.

218
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,319
I don't want to use a tractor. Blah blah

219
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,639
blah. But look what's pulling these

220
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,040
things, right? These are utility carts

221
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:11,360
now with very wide things. Now you can

222
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:13,360
get the big Trimax one that Beth Paige

223
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,800
has got. Then you got to use a tractor.

224
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,959
you're getting into the big heavy

225
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,799
weights and very few people to my

226
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:21,518
knowledge have sort of studied different

227
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:24,399
rollers uh on fairways. I'm not sure

228
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,560
Nikolai even studied fairway rolling but

229
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,600
Doug here's something interesting. Paul

230
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:33,199
Gardano did this work back in 2013,

231
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:36,399
right? Where he had a native soil and he

232
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,959
had a USGAA root zone, right? And you

233
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,839
know it, you know that what came out of

234
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:45,518
this is rolling reduces

235
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,839
infiltration, right? So here's my first

236
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,720
question to you. You're looking at a

237
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:54,160
graph here where I've drawn a line at 20

238
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,839
cm per hour, right? So that's what an

239
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:58,958
inch

240
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:02,000
No centime in 10 inches an hour. 10

241
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:04,879
inches. Yeah. 10 inches an hour. Okay.

242
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,120
If would pe many people will hear people

243
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:10,720
say, "Oh, rolling reduces infiltration.

244
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:14,399
I shouldn't do it." The eight times a

245
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:18,320
week rolling a root zone still keeps it

246
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:21,919
at 10 in an hour. My question to you is,

247
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,399
do you care that it reduces it if it's

248
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,039
still 10 inches an hour? Yeah. It just

249
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,240
means you can't play during Hurricane

250
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:31,039
Katrina. You know, you're going to have

251
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,399
to take a day off.

252
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:36,559
One day. One day. Yeah. One day. So, in

253
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:40,078
your mind, as long, you know, eight

254
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:42,159
times a week on a proper root zone still

255
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:44,078
provides enough infiltration. How about

256
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,799
a different question? What about the

257
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:49,439
native soils that at even at eight times

258
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:52,240
a week are roll are at 10 centimeters,

259
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,160
which is five inches an hour. Do you get

260
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,320
worried there?

261
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:59,360
No, I mean, and that's native, but it's

262
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,760
got to be a uh sand sand top, sand cap,

263
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,759
right? So, yeah, that's why we build

264
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,399
sand greens is because we don't care

265
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,919
about compaction. And, you know, you're

266
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,958
going to have to manage organic matter,

267
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,120
that's going to be the thing that you're

268
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,879
going to want to manage, but the these

269
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,639
reductions, even though they're

270
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,078
statistically

271
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,919
uh significant or you see the

272
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:21,679
differences, they they don't matter in

273
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:23,759
in terms of real life, right? So, we're

274
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,199
talking root zones, Carl, and I know

275
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,480
we're going to talk about measurements,

276
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,720
and it comes from the great grassroots

277
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,560
uh Wisconsin golf course superintendent.

278
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,440
Doug, I think sometimes this is the only

279
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,359
place you put this stuff, isn't it?

280
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,320
You you squirrel it away if somebody

281
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,480
isn't uh you know, honored like I am to

282
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,920
receive this monthly for the last 30

283
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,639
frigin years. Um uh and writing for it

284
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:50,958
for many years in my time there, I come

285
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,799
across this article. Well, I I I rip it

286
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,479
out. You can see it's on my desk. And

287
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:55,759
Carl's like, "Carl, you got to look at

288
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,399
this." He's sitting there taking a

289
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,559
picture like it's 1970, right? We got to

290
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,839
read this thing like it's 1970. Okay,

291
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,518
Carl, fire away. Yeah. So, so Doug,

292
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,560
maybe you could just set up what this

293
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,879
research was. There's different volumes

294
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,399
of top dressing over over three years,

295
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:15,039
right? So, different volumes of top

296
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,200
dressing, uh different frequencies at

297
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,879
which those volumes were applied, and

298
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,639
then different sand. So maybe you could

299
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,720
set some of it up before we get into the

300
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,720
the nitty-gritty here. Geez, this is so

301
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,040
cool. You guys make my slides for me.

302
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,519
Wonderful. All right. Um yeah, that's

303
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:31,759
exactly it. So we we did a USGA green.

304
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,480
We wanted to know, hey, what what

305
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:36,319
database management is is what we're

306
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,000
really interested in. So like let's

307
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,639
start to use some data to make some top

308
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,720
dressing decisions. So how much sand

309
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,120
should we put down down the year? uh

310
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,680
does the the particle size of the sand

311
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,919
matter or if we apply it weekly is it

312
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,759
any different than than monthly? And

313
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,838
then you know that we're interested in

314
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,600
firmness as being something that we're

315
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,880
starting to measure more and more and we

316
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,200
realize there's all kinds of different

317
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:02,240
firmness meters out there. So we wanted

318
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,160
to see uh what what we got from that.

319
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,079
And surprisingly

320
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,679
um you know first of all fine sand

321
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,439
versus standard sand. A lot of guys are

322
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,638
switching to fine sands because they

323
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,560
think that it's going to give them a

324
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,919
firmer surface. But if you look across

325
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:19,359
the sand size uh category in the middle

326
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:21,919
there, um you don't see you don't see

327
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,120
any differences at all really. Uh we so

328
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:29,958
that surprised us. Um I guess you do see

329
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:34,159
the GS3 ball picked up on

330
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:37,039
um uh the fine sand actually being

331
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,480
softer, but the other four devices

332
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,919
didn't pick up any difference at all.

333
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,000
So, one of the things was like, well,

334
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,278
these different these devices are doing

335
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,039
different things. They're showing us

336
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:46,559
different things. So, which one should

337
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,679
we do? And I don't have a great answer

338
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,439
for that. Um, but basically what we're

339
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:53,199
finding is a lot of these decisions

340
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,200
didn't matter. You see tiny differences

341
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,959
here, but the amount of sand you put

342
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,240
down, some devices you saw small

343
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:03,599
differences, other devices you saw

344
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,079
nothing at all. uh the frequency the s

345
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,879
like very very few of these decisions

346
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,799
influenced firmness which was surprising

347
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,078
to us. And so the other surprising

348
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,519
thing, Doug, and I don't have the the

349
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:14,879
organic matter, or maybe I do in the

350
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,360
next slide. I'm not sure if I do, Frank,

351
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:19,919
but you definitely saw the organic

352
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,919
matter. I I don't have the 100%. Yeah.

353
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,759
And the top one. Yeah. Talk about that,

354
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,879
Doug. Yeah. Basically, the the only

355
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:28,720
thing that mattered. So quality didn't

356
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:30,879
matter or I mean the these things didn't

357
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,278
affect quality, didn't affect growth, it

358
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,838
didn't affect ball roll speed, tiny

359
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,519
differences in firmness. So the only

360
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,519
thing that really showed up was that

361
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,360
these decisions do affect the amount of

362
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,600
organic matter in your top inch. And

363
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,039
when we did when we put down the least

364
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,639
amount of sand, we had the most amount

365
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,319
of organic matter. So you would have

366
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,759
thought, hey, that's going to be a

367
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,839
softer green. Not really. Um when we put

368
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,198
down the most sand, we got the least

369
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,279
amount of organic matter. That's going

370
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,439
to be firmst. No, not really. And that

371
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:01,278
the the USGA is the most amount of sand

372
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,880
and the pace turf is the least amount of

373
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,838
sand. So you can kind of scan across

374
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,600
there and see uh and look for those

375
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,199
differences. And and Doug, the relative

376
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,800
amounts of sand were pretty different.

377
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:13,599
So that USJ was something like I don't

378
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,519
know 20 per cubic feet per thousand and

379
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,240
the the Micah Woods method was like a

380
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:21,919
third of that, right? Yeah. The USGA

381
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,159
method which is uh was about like 20 25

382
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:27,278
26 cubic feet per thousand and the pace

383
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:31,039
turf was 14 and the woods was in

384
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:34,480
between. So basically twice as much sand

385
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:37,198
uh from USGA to to PACE and then the

386
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,600
woods was kind of in the middle

387
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:40,719
and that's a clipping volume way. So we

388
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,320
thought hey people are collecting

389
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,920
clipping volumes why don't we match up

390
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,760
sand with clipping volume production

391
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,120
makes a lot of sense and it's cool that

392
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,198
it that it fell right in the middle

393
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,799
there. Uh but in terms of the biggest

394
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,879
differences between the amount of sand,

395
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:55,359
it would be USGA versus PACE, which is a

396
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:57,679
climate based method. And USGA is just

397
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,360
kind of, hey, every every month, every

398
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,919
three weeks, go out and put this amount

399
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,159
of sand on regardless.

400
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,919
So, let's uh let's review the evidence

401
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,319
here, Carl. I just want to make sure we

402
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:11,599
don't we're not missing the lead. Uh and

403
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:14,800
I want to take apart two things, three

404
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,720
things. One is when you say fine sand,

405
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:20,719
you mean it it meets USGA

406
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,720
specifications, it does not meet USGA.

407
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,959
No, it's it's it's it's kind of like the

408
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,480
sand they're using at Ruckers where it's

409
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:31,198
uh it's got more fine uh sand than than

410
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,759
allowed, but it's not like grossly out

411
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,278
of spec. Okay. So, it's the stuff Jim

412
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,199
Murphy's been saying, "Yeah, this stuff

413
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:39,679
is fine. It doesn't have a negative

414
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:42,319
impact on on turf." And it just it's the

415
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,479
the higher fines helps the sand get into

416
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:49,120
the canopy of these more dense newer

417
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:51,759
cultivars. Okay, deal. But the theory

418
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,198
was that's also potentially going to

419
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:58,560
make it firmer.

420
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:01,278
Yeah. Yeah. And it did not. It Yeah.

421
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,278
Well, I mean it did, I guess, with uh

422
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:04,558
No, it didn't at all, actually. And And

423
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,078
you know, you thought, well, what what

424
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,959
does a fine sand do? It holds more

425
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:11,119
water. Um, but the difference wasn't

426
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,038
related to water content either. So,

427
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,038
we're just And the co the coefficient of

428
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:17,759
uniformity, which is kind of the higher

429
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:20,400
the CU, the firmer it is. That fine sand

430
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,240
had a higher CU. I can't remember the

431
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,919
exact number. I think it was like 2.5

432
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,558
versus the standard sand, which was a

433
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:29,120
two. Everything was pointing to this

434
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:31,440
fine sand should should make it uh more

435
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,599
firm, but it didn't happen. And what my

436
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,679
theory on this is like it's more about

437
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,759
the plant growth characteristics. you

438
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:41,759
know, the sand matters if there's not a

439
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:43,919
not a lot of uh roots or turf on top,

440
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,160
but once that stuff gets involved, I

441
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,840
think the the root zone makes less of a

442
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,240
difference. But I don't know, we got

443
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,720
more, you know, we got more to this is

444
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,038
just one situation. So, so and the other

445
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,038
thing be before before we leave this

446
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:59,440
slide is Doug, could you take a minute

447
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:01,359
because you did a separate study where

448
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,720
you looked at how these different

449
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:09,279
devices correlate to either uh surface

450
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:11,839
organic matter or soil moisture as I

451
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:14,960
recall. Could you review for the folks

452
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,798
watching and listening roughly, you

453
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,000
know, you've got a cle, you've got a

454
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:22,000
true firm, you've got the PGA method

455
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,200
where you drop a ball bearing and

456
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,599
measure the dimple depth and then you

457
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:32,000
got GS3. Oh yeah. Um, so it was it was

458
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,918
all the data from this study and we b we

459
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,558
just looked at the correlation between

460
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,400
the other measurements we had and so we

461
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,000
saw and I'm and I don't have the slide

462
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,759
in front of me and I'm not going to you

463
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,839
know I'm just going to talk in general

464
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:47,519
the heavier devices so that'd be like

465
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:50,159
the big cle and the ball drop um the

466
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:53,200
ones that put more force uh tended to be

467
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,360
better related to the soil moisture and

468
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,279
then the lighter drops which would be

469
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:01,439
the like the true firm the little clay

470
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:04,639
leg, the GS3 ball, uh, tended to be more

471
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,279
correlated with surface organic matter

472
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,960
and turf grass quality and things like

473
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,879
that, which kind of makes sense to me.

474
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,720
Those heavy drops are getting down into

475
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,280
the deeper in the root zone. The lighter

476
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,679
drops are measuring more the grass

477
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,759
surface. Okay. So thinking about what

478
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,919
they measure and thinking about what you

479
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:25,440
found

480
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:28,400
here, your theory is that the plant the

481
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,240
the soil moisture which also includes

482
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,200
the

483
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:35,759
plant is not as maybe you know I'm

484
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,840
trying to figure out how once the plant

485
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,919
gets involved it's absorbing most of

486
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:42,119
what we're measuring.

487
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,559
Yeah. Oh, I mean, think about when

488
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:46,159
you're as you're putting force down on

489
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:49,440
the surface, the first thing the ball

490
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,200
hits is the grass and the thatch, right?

491
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,320
And then if it gets through that, it

492
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,798
starts to be absorbed by the soil and

493
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:58,879
the soil strength is is influenced by

494
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:00,960
the moisture of it. That's right. So, if

495
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,880
you do a real light drop, it really

496
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,200
doesn't have a chance. It the the grass

497
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,200
and the thatch absorb it all. You do a

498
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,440
real heavy drop, you still get the grass

499
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,440
thatch interacting, but it then it

500
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,160
pushes down and maybe you get a signal

501
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,360
into the soil moisture. Okay. Um All

502
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,360
right, Carl. Well, you're going to ask

503
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,439
him

504
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:20,879
about action. Yeah, I Well, no. Now I

505
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,798
want to ask you about the organic matter

506
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,919
model. So, it the funniest part about

507
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:25,558
this research is you would have

508
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,240
predicted firmness goes up with more

509
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:31,599
sand. Wrong. But what you were able to

510
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,960
predict like very accurately was how

511
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:37,038
organic matter changed over three years

512
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,480
uh with just this model that has been

513
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:40,319
sort of sitting around. Can you talk

514
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,319
about like this Ohio State organic

515
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,519
matter model and and and how is it so

516
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:47,119
good? What do you what do you even put

517
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:49,759
into it to get it so good? Yeah. Well, I

518
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:52,479
didn't do any Ed McCoy at Ohio State

519
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:55,679
built this with uh Jeff Broadbelt of Dry

520
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,000
Jacks and so give those guys 100% of the

521
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,880
credit all and I think they made me

522
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,400
aware of it. Um this is probably six,

523
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,559
seven years ago. Yeah, we built it into

524
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,000
Greenkeeper. Um and it's it's an Excel

525
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:10,079
spreadsheet and that's how when I go

526
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,079
around uh and talk about this to people,

527
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,918
I just show the Excel spreadsheet and

528
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,480
can I do that now? Can I show my screen?

529
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:20,280
Yeah, 100%. Is that okay? 100%. And

530
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,679
basically what you uh

531
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:25,678
um what you see with

532
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:25,679
it

533
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:30,720
is and it's kind of complicated. So I'll

534
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,080
walk you through it, but it's based on

535
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:37,279
temperature. Organic matter builds up

536
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:39,038
and in cold environments because it

537
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,279
doesn't break down as fast. So it's a

538
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:43,119
story about accumulation and decay. So

539
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:44,720
the blue line here, this is this is

540
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,319
Madison, Wisconsin. And I just put in

541
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,519
the weather data, the or the climate

542
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:53,279
data for Madison. So here's how average

543
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:55,519
high is 26° in January. Average low is

544
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,119
11. You just go down the line, you enter

545
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:59,200
your average high and your average low

546
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,639
in Fahrenheit. And then it shows you

547
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,640
here's how your organic matter

548
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,400
accumulates. That's the grass roots

549
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,480
growing. And here's how it breaks down

550
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,360
by the soil microbes. And that's all a

551
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,159
temperature thing. Okay. So now um and

552
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,719
then you know if we grew a warm season

553
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:15,760
grass in

554
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,919
Madison, I wouldn't have to worry about

555
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:20,558
managing organic matter because my decay

556
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,559
is higher than my accumulation. I also

557
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,399
wouldn't have to worry about having a

558
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,399
job at a golf course because warm

559
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,240
seasoned grasses don't grow, right? So

560
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,080
you have to tell tell what type of grass

561
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,720
you're growing. So of course we're all

562
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:35,038
cool season people

563
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:38,159
here. And now let's go to that's

564
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:41,279
Madison. Let's go to Lake Placid. You

565
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:44,480
just grab the average highs and lows in

566
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:46,399
Lake Placid. And so you just look at the

567
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,798
VA factors here. For accumulation, we're

568
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,480
about one. And for decay, we peak around

569
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:55,279
6. So what's Lake Placid going to look

570
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,120
like? Very different. So peaks around

571
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:00,079
one. You get a little less accumulation

572
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:02,798
because it's cooler there in June and

573
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:05,279
September than Madison. And you get way

574
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:07,918
less decay. So th this is your

575
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:10,158
accumulation of organic matter. You got

576
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,159
you got problems up in Lake Placid with

577
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,159
and you know everybody knows that. I've

578
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,840
been up there to Lake Placid and seen

579
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,799
the thatch on the fairways. It's not

580
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:20,079
because the the managers are unskilled

581
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:21,679
or they're doing something wrong. It's

582
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,639
because they just have a massive amount

583
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,798
of accumulation. Now let's go to Beth

584
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,640
Page down on Long Island.

585
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:30,079
Obviously very different climate, but

586
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,840
again when people talk about growing

587
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:33,599
grass, you know, New York, it's all the

588
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:36,158
same, right? Look how different that is.

589
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:38,399
Wow. You're accumulating and you're

590
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,720
accumulating different patterns. Your

591
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,960
decay is you're getting you're matching

592
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,038
your decay with your accumulation in in

593
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,038
July and August. So nothing's happening

594
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:49,759
there. And you get the spring and fall

595
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,359
accumulation patterns. Um so does that

596
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:53,119
do you think that we should be just top

597
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:55,119
dressing everything and airifying

598
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,798
everything the same in New York because

599
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,158
it's New York cool season gr? No,

600
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:01,359
absolutely not. So that's the value of

601
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,440
this model. Now you can go you enter

602
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:05,759
your organic matter contents here maybe

603
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,960
5% at the surface two and a half one and

604
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:09,279
a half you have to you have to send

605
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,519
these into a lab and this follows the

606
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:14,720
USGA's kind of you know organic matter

607
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:16,558
246 Michael Woods has been promoting I

608
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,720
won't spend too much time on that but

609
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:20,879
once you enter organic matter if you

610
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,558
have your climate then it predicts what

611
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,520
your organic matter is going to look

612
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:28,158
like for the next five years uh based on

613
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:30,240
your top dressing. So here at soil

614
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,120
organic matter in the top inch here at

615
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,759
Beth Page you can see it's slowly

616
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:37,359
increasing and that's based on these top

617
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:40,319
dressing aeration

618
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:43,678
uh events that we have. So if you look

619
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:45,759
over here it says uh top dressings. So

620
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,400
if right now I put everything to zero.

621
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:50,240
So no top dressing, no drying, no hollow

622
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,360
time, no solid time, no deep furry

623
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,599
cutting. Now we're going to go back down

624
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,038
and see what happens. So if you stop

625
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:56,719
doing everything down at Beth Page,

626
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:59,119
you're going to start at 5%, that's

627
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,480
where we are today, and then five years

628
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:04,798
later, 60 months, you're going to be at

629
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:07,278
10%. Not good, right? So we have to we

630
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:09,679
can use this model to say how much stuff

631
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:12,159
do we need to do to keep our grass

632
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,798
around 5%. Now, one of the questions we

633
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,880
don't know is, is 5% good? What about

634
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:19,200
six? What about four? I'm just saying,

635
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,720
hey, five is kind of normal, so we're

636
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,558
going to start there and then we can add

637
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,600
these top dressings. So maybe you top

638
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:29,359
dress once a month. Oops, use the wrong

639
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:31,839
uh wrong one. We top dress once a month

640
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:34,798
starting in May, June, July, August,

641
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:38,480
September, and maybe we do a holotine

642
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:40,240
event. I'm sorry, do a holotine event in

643
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,919
October. And that includes the surface

644
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,519
top dressing. That's in the fine print

645
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,799
of this model. Let's go back and see how

646
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:48,639
that did. Oh, we're still going up. Now,

647
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:50,879
I don't know. Maybe again, like I'm not

648
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,799
saying six and a half percent's bad, but

649
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,159
we might have to be more aggressive than

650
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:59,558
that. Maybe we put in uh two top

651
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:03,039
dressings a month early in the

652
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:05,678
season. Do something like that. And we

653
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:07,679
go down and Oh, wait. That's too

654
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,759
aggressive. No, we can back off on this,

655
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:13,038
right? Let's Let's just uh let's get rid

656
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:16,319
of uh get rid of that one. Let's get rid

657
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:18,400
of that one. It's a planning tool. Yeah,

658
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,079
still going down, right? And for all the

659
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,080
guys who have to schedule out like, you

660
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:24,639
know, member guests and men's leagues

661
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,480
and women, you know, like by month, this

662
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,159
is like a really effective tool to

663
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,159
communicate either, hey, if we don't do

664
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,000
this, it's going to go up or hey, maybe

665
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,919
we can get rid of some of these, you

666
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,359
know, three of these hollow tine events

667
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,960
a year and can still maintain. It's uh

668
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:40,959
and because it's so accurate in your

669
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,200
data, like we're talking less than

670
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,519
0.05%.1.

671
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,960
Yeah. Well, right. So the so the thing

672
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:48,798
I'll say about that is you know when I

673
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,558
show this off like great it's a model

674
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:52,079
you know could be completely wrong right

675
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,558
you're just showing me dots so when we

676
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:56,879
tested it we did this study for three or

677
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:58,798
four years and we started at the start

678
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,159
and we entered our top dressing it was

679
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:04,079
like exactly on like dead on and we're

680
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,520
like even I didn't expect that I'm like

681
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,678
oh it's going to be close or something

682
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,759
but I mean if you go I'll stop sharing

683
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,600
here well let me do one more thing

684
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:12,440
before I do that let's go so now look at

685
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:14,798
these

686
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,519
operations this is Beth page, right? So,

687
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:20,599
we got one top dressing in May, two in

688
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:24,000
June. We'll put this back on down to

689
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:26,158
one, and you know, it's going down. So,

690
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,319
we start at five, and by the end of five

691
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,919
years, if we're that aggressive, we're

692
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,119
just above four. Now, we're going to go

693
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,200
back and we're going to change that to

694
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:38,639
Lake Placid.

695
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,640
Yeah. And so, same operations, different

696
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,240
climate. And we're going to go back

697
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:46,200
here. And it's even it goes down even

698
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,599
harder. Now we're down at three and a

699
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:52,000
half. So even though those accumulation

700
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:53,119
patterns were uh those graphs were

701
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,200
different, you can see you're probably

702
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:56,678
not top dressed in May in Lake Placid

703
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,080
and maybe do one

704
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:02,798
here. Um and maybe get rid of the

705
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:06,158
September one. We go down and now we're

706
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:08,079
at four now. So totally different stuff

707
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,320
and it's pretty accurate. I love it as a

708
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:12,000
planning tool and an educational tool.

709
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,480
The other thing I I like I learned about

710
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,480
it is nothing happens below one inch.

711
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,880
Yeah. Why are we air frying down three

712
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,919
inches? I'm not Oh my goodness. Oh my

713
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,440
goodness. It's 10:30 and if you start

714
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,640
that now, we're going to be here for

715
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:29,919
another hour and I didn't even get to

716
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,840
growth and traffic as a traffic as a

717
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:35,200
growth regulator and then looking at

718
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:37,038
fertility. But we are at it. And if you

719
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,120
wanted to know about top dressing and

720
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:40,879
measuring firmness, I guess I'll ask

721
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:41,719
this one question, Doug, and then we'll

722
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,399
let you

723
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:48,880
go. It if you use that tool and you're

724
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:51,278
looking at organic matter, you just told

725
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:55,520
me it sort of doesn't even matter how I

726
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:57,919
supply this sand. Uh if I supply enough,

727
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:01,759
right? Enough. It's like the MLS. It's

728
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:03,600
it's enough. More isn't better. Uh there

729
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,359
seems to be a sweet spot. This is

730
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:08,158
something that's going to take us years

731
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:10,398
to figure out, but you're really saying

732
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,880
you can, as Carl said, you can design

733
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:16,000
your top dressing program around your

734
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,760
events and not inconvenience people if

735
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,159
you just have to get a certain amount

736
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:22,720
out based on your planning. It gives you

737
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,880
more flexibility. Yeah. And then and the

738
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,038
big picture takeaway was the the

739
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,720
aggressive the USGA method brought our

740
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:33,599
organic matter to 4%. The cut that in

741
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,038
half, we were at 6%. couldn't tell a

742
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:36,000
difference. If you're gonna if you're a

743
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:37,519
superintendent, you're going to pick

744
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,480
one. You're going to put half the sand

745
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:43,200
down 100%. You know, so what we we need

746
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,440
to find is where what's too much? 6% was

747
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,720
great. How about seven? How about eight?

748
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,320
You know, that's that's what we really

749
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,319
need to to figure out is where those

750
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:52,720
thresholds lie. So great. All right,

751
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:55,119
Doug. Thanks very much, Carl. Glad you

752
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,960
could join us, Carl. Just made it in

753
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:58,558
time to get the modeling stuff that I

754
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,079
Thanks everybody. We'll talk to you next

755
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:02,398
week. Yeah. See you everybody. Thanks.

756
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:05,278
Take care. This has been a production of
