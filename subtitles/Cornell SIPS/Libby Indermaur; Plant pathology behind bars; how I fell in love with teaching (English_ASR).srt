1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,400
University thank you Bill for the

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,400
introduction um and good afternoon

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,760
everyone I thought that I would start

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,359
with an introduction of the program that

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,160
made the experience that I'll be telling

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,160
you about possible so this previous

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,480
spring I was a teaching assistant with

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,679
the Cornell prison education program or

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,278
cpep that's how I'll refer to it it is a

11
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:33,238
program that was founded at the

12
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:35,280
University in 2013 and and really

13
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:37,959
motivated by the same founding principle

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,239
of the University that I would found an

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,439
institution where any person can find

16
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:45,959
instruction in any

17
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:48,198
study and to that end they are dedicated

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,039
to supporting incarcerated person's

19
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:52,558
academic Ambitions and their preparation

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,760
for successful

21
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:58,518
re-entry and cpep operates in facilities

22
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:01,039
that are managed by the Department of

23
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:04,158
Corrections and community supervision or

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,760
docs that's how I'll be referring to it

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,200
currently they

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,799
offer um Associates of Arts degrees to

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,799
men who are incarcerated at four

28
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:16,159
Correctional Facilities they're shown

29
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,479
here in green um all are within an

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,240
hour's Drive of main

31
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:25,478
campus and I wanted to to emphasize just

32
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:28,839
how uh Humanities dominant the program

33
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:31,158
is for the students in a given students

34
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,799
program there might be five stem classes

35
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,759
that they could take to get their

36
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,079
Associates and unsurprisingly Plant

37
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,560
Pathology is not a staple course in

38
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,319
their curriculum sort of depends on

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,680
Bill's

40
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:48,319
schedule it is a medium security state

41
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,118
prison for men capacity it has just over

42
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,599
a thousand incarcerated individuals or

43
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:56,118
IIs and that's the docs

44
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:59,599
terminology and in a given semester

45
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:02,399
there could be between 30 and 40 IIs who

46
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:04,118
have applied for and are accepted and

47
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,519
enrolled in

48
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:09,520
cpep and also unsurprisingly there

49
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,479
aren't a lot of publicly available

50
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,319
pictures of the facility so this is a a

51
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:17,359
Google Earth image that I I put here to

52
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:20,039
try to illustrate what it could be like

53
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,800
to be there um you can see the wall

54
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:24,359
around the grounds uh this is the

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,439
parking lot where if you were a

56
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,959
volunteer or a staff member you would

57
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:30,919
park and you'd enter through this

58
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,199
Administrative Building

59
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:35,598
um go through a thorough security

60
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:38,439
screening process metal detector get

61
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:40,598
your prison ID and then be escorted

62
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:43,680
through a series of gates onto the

63
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:45,399
grounds and then as a volunteer you are

64
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,480
immediately escorted directly to the

65
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,840
school building here and this would be

66
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:52,719
the only building you would

67
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,878
see before starting as a teaching

68
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,878
assistant there were two trainings that

69
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:01,560
I had to complete one through docs and

70
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:04,239
one through cpep and and they're really

71
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,719
designed to set the tone really to to

72
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,759
scare you um one maybe more than the

73
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:13,400
other I think as you'll see um but I

74
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:15,878
wanted to share the most impactful U

75
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,959
lessons from the training um before I

76
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:20,479
get started with the rest so first the

77
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,239
the docs

78
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,238
training upon entering the facility you

79
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,080
will be directed to pass through a metal

80
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:31,560
detector you will be handstamped and you

81
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:35,200
may be subjected to additional Sur

82
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,840
procedures all items will be

83
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,479
inspected matters of discipline are the

84
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,319
responsibility of the security staff

85
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,318
under no circumstances should you

86
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:50,280
interfere do not bring into the facility

87
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:52,719
any items that might be defined as

88
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,598
Contraband promoting prison contraband

89
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,438
is a felony offense this includes

90
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,039
anything that is introduced with the

91
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:01,639
intent to transfer to an II with without

92
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:04,199
the permission of the

93
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:06,039
superintendent and I later learned that

94
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:07,919
it's not always a felony offense it's at

95
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:11,318
least a misdemeanor if you bring in

96
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,719
prison contraband um but it it can be a

97
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:15,879
felony

98
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:18,319
offense and you will not be working with

99
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:20,719
students you will be working with IIs

100
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:24,240
who are taking a

101
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,639
class then the cpep

102
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:31,639
training prison is to Outsiders a

103
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:35,120
foreign country it is wise to be quiet

104
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:38,400
observe listen learn the language and

105
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,680
identify the values of the prison

106
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,638
culture don't be afraid to Define

107
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,160
yourself clearly you are not required to

108
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:49,079
conform to any stereotype I eyes may

109
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,560
have about you even if you even after

110
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:54,959
you have clearly defined yourself expect

111
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:57,879
to be tested again and

112
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,319
again expect to meet many tremendous and

113
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:02,879
valuable people in prison

114
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,240
expect also to meet some Champion

115
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,038
manipulators do not be surprised if

116
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,439
these sometimes turn out to be one in

117
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,839
the same

118
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:14,360
person prisons have proven that people

119
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:17,119
do not learn very much from punishment

120
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,720
but more from example what you do in

121
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,399
prison is more important than what you

122
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,120
say there a broken promise to an

123
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:27,918
incarcerated person is even more painful

124
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,519
than in normal life and it is an act of

125
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,839
Cruelty and

126
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:34,279
if after an initial exposure you find

127
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:36,279
yourself fearful of the prison

128
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:40,879
environment you should not continue to

129
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:40,879
go into prisons this work is not for

130
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:48,000
everyone so I was pretty apprehensive

131
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:49,439
after the trainings um but I had already

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,439
signed up to work with Bill we had

133
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,879
talked about the the plans for the

134
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:57,279
semester and and I was really reassured

135
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,439
by the fact that that bill was a

136
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:02,638
seasoned cpep volunteer

137
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:06,519
so the the class that I was a teaching

138
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,160
assistant for was plsi 2225 healthy

139
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:13,519
plants healthy planet healthy people

140
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:15,280
taught by our very own bill fry and

141
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:18,240
there were three major learning outcomes

142
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:20,318
for the class first that students would

143
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,639
acquire a broad understanding of plant

144
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,039
diseases their pathogens and how to

145
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,960
manage them to explain plant disease

146
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:32,079
Dynamics at the cellular organismal and

147
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:34,120
population s and in the end to

148
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,639
illustrate their understanding and their

149
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,560
knowledge in a term paper describing

150
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,199
five important and diverse diseases on a

151
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,360
crop of their choice and and how to

152
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:47,199
manage them in an integrated

153
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:50,080
way and I also had a personal goal for

154
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,919
this experience and it was to to

155
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:55,079
determine what role I want teaching to

156
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:58,399
play in my career I'm in the last year

157
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:00,478
of my graduate program hopefully and um

158
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:03,679
and I've had some teaching experiences

159
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:07,038
before at NC State and here at Cornell

160
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,360
um but comparably you know in in ideal

161
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:12,680
environments

162
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,400
with inexhaustible resources and not

163
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,879
really but sort of and um and

164
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:19,719
professional students and so I I wanted

165
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,960
a different representation of what

166
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,520
teaching could

167
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:28,318
be so we we met once a week on Tuesday

168
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:31,478
Mornings for a um long and engaging

169
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,520
three-hour period from 7:50 to

170
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:37,240
10:50 um some days some days we could go

171
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:38,959
in um like on Mondays depending on

172
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,918
cancellations or if we were going to do

173
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,680
a study hall but usually it was just

174
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:46,038
once a week um it's hard to hold

175
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,439
attention for three hours it's not

176
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:51,240
necessarily a class that I would be

177
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:53,800
excited to take um and and I wanted to

178
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,879
emphasize how limited of a classroom it

179
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,120
was so we had no

180
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,039
PowerPoint we had no internet so no

181
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,280
screen

182
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:07,839
or computers or phones and absolutely no

183
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:10,038
samples so no microscopes no

184
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,119
slides you couldn't bring in plant

185
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:14,079
samples they couldn't even bring in

186
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,598
rotten produce from the meshall there

187
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:21,800
was nothing to point to um other than

188
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:25,279
our chalkboard and these four resources

189
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,879
here so we could bring in these

190
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:31,079
printouts of PDFs you know conversions

191
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:34,038
of PowerPoints as the lecture material

192
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:35,799
and we had these spiral bound readers as

193
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:37,240
companions to the lecture material they

194
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,679
were filled with

195
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,799
articles each student had a disease

196
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,158
compendium for the crop on which they

197
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:47,479
were writing their term papers and then

198
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:52,120
every student had a copy of the agrios

199
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:55,720
text so this was our

200
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,560
classroom um for me on first glance it

201
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,680
doesn't really look too different from

202
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:03,199
your regular sort of under underfunded

203
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:06,078
public school classroom it kind of looks

204
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,278
like where I went to high school um uh

205
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:12,559
but there are bars on the Windows here

206
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:15,278
and what you can't see here is a wall of

207
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:18,000
Windows for

208
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:23,000
observation but you can see the

209
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,879
chalkboard and the Really the total lack

210
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,759
of modern resources in a

211
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:29,919
classroom we had five students in the

212
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:31,519
beginning

213
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:33,199
um but one dropped out about halfway

214
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,720
through the semester and these were the

215
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,000
three students who were comfortable with

216
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:42,480
their photos being taken so we had their

217
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:46,519
permission um they were around between

218
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:49,159
30 to 60 years old and outside of cpep

219
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:52,240
they had no experience with college

220
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:55,360
level education or

221
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,919
agriculture but I found that what they

222
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,639
did have ample experience with was how

223
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:04,439
frighten the prison environment can

224
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:06,759
be you know I can't speak to what it was

225
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,440
like outside of the school building we

226
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:10,078
can

227
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,959
imagine but I found even in the school

228
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:14,559
building it to be a very intimidating

229
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:18,000
place to

230
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,278
work especially for a young woman you

231
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,958
can

232
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:27,759
imagine um correctional officers have

233
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:31,239
every Power to question your motivations

234
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:34,039
for volunteering and demand response to

235
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:38,320
that to deny you

236
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:42,159
entry and to interrupt class with a K9

237
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,320
unit and pull the students out and frisk

238
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:48,000
them along the wall of

239
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,839
Windows standing there watching you from

240
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,480
the

241
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,760
outside so knowing that all of that was

242
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,759
going to happen to them in the school

243
00:10:53,759 --> 00:11:01,240
building they still registered for for a

244
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:03,200
class let alone a Plant Pathology class

245
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,759
and most of the students said that they

246
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,720
registered because they needed it to

247
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:09,639
graduate uh or they heard that it was

248
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,800
challenging and they wanted to

249
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:15,519
challenge but there was one student this

250
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:18,278
student who said that he registered for

251
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,078
the class because his mom is a Master

252
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:23,399
Gardener in

253
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:26,159
Oklahoma and he wanted to spend more

254
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:29,759
time on his weekly phone calls with her

255
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:31,078
talking about what she was interested in

256
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,439
and he thought that our class could help

257
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:36,679
him do

258
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:40,800
that so knowing all of this bill and I

259
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:43,638
took a an intentional approach to this

260
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:46,599
semester what we did first and very

261
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:48,360
often uh was emphasize that everything

262
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,639
that they will be learning is

263
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,399
real all of the the ridiculous

264
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:56,320
scientific names that we were asking

265
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,159
them to memorize and Spell correctly and

266
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,200
the diseases that are caused by those

267
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,600
organisms the econom OMC losses that

268
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,839
result from those diseases that all of

269
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,920
that is very very real and we can't show

270
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:11,519
them but we're asking them to trust

271
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:14,479
us we also used phyra infestin as a

272
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,078
teaching model and this was in large

273
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,680
part because of Bill's career-long

274
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:21,919
expertise with the system so we had a

275
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:25,719
lot of material to pull

276
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:28,519
from um but we also thought that if we

277
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,600
stayed within one system to teach major

278
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:33,959
Concepts like Cox postulates and life

279
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,959
cycles epidemiology poost resistance and

280
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:38,239
management that for people who were

281
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:41,119
hearing it for the very first time but

282
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,759
that might make more sense um especially

283
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,320
then when we transition to talk about

284
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:46,679
other

285
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,360
organisms and we also had them read the

286
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:51,120
first two chapters of the evance of the

287
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,560
fungi before we even met which that they

288
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,959
all read um and and if you're familiar

289
00:12:54,559 --> 00:13:00,278
with the text it it really it sets the

290
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:02,799
tone for phyto festes a devastating

291
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:05,559
pathogen and I think helped sort of

292
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:08,278
establish where we would be for this

293
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:10,919
semester we followed a sort of standard

294
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:14,720
layout um for each class over the course

295
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:18,278
of this semester we always began by

296
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,480
answering what questions they had um

297
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:22,720
ideally about the lecture material but

298
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,240
that wasn't always the case and that

299
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,480
could take a while um but we had three

300
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,959
hours so um then we would review a list

301
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,159
of important important terms and summary

302
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:35,198
notes and Bill and I would compile the

303
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:36,639
terms from the previous week and and

304
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:38,559
hand them out to the students the

305
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,320
following week just to make sure to

306
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,799
clarify you know this is the information

307
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,639
that we want you to know and and to make

308
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,519
sure everyone had access to the same

309
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,159
information and these are just some

310
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:52,360
examples of the summary

311
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:54,399
notes then uh we spent the rest of the

312
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,278
time discussing lecture material and a

313
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:00,198
reading if there was one and I always

314
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:02,879
ended with a debriefing with

315
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:05,559
Bill and there are two sort of

316
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:07,120
strategies that that we utilized a lot

317
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:11,198
in the semester that I wanted to share

318
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:14,078
with you all uh the first was that we uh

319
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:16,599
we sat in as much of a circle as we

320
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:18,799
could the classroom was small so we

321
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,120
couldn't quite arrange our our desks and

322
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,879
chairs that way but we did it as best as

323
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,360
we could as this picture shows and we

324
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:28,639
would take turns going to the board and

325
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:31,240
so in many cases no one was standing up

326
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,600
front we were all in a circle sort of

327
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,399
equally participating in whatever

328
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,720
discussion we were having and if bill

329
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,240
went to the board then I was asking

330
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,440
questions of him as a student trying to

331
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,680
model for the others you these are the

332
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,079
kinds of interactions that we are hoping

333
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:49,919
that you have these are the kinds of

334
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:53,758
questions we hope you're thinking about

335
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:56,039
um and in the end I think I thought we

336
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:59,199
were successful in getting a dynamic

337
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:02,919
classroom where students appeared to to

338
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:07,198
feel very free to share when they were

339
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:09,679
frustrated and Confused then excited to

340
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:14,599
help each other to challenge each other

341
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:16,519
and to challenge us um and and I think

342
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,959
in the end really as I was hoping that

343
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:20,240
this picture would show for you all that

344
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,479
we had a lot of

345
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,159
fun and and that felt like one of the

346
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,360
most important things that we could be

347
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:30,799
doing the other strategy that we used

348
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:34,360
well I guess problem we were trying to

349
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:36,318
address was how to give the students

350
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,079
Hands-On learning experiences in the

351
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:42,000
absence of a

352
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:43,559
lab and what we ended up uh relying on

353
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,480
was getting students to come to the

354
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:49,599
chalkboard as much as possible to

355
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,319
diagram like a life cycle is the case

356
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,560
here um or to you know draw a disease

357
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:57,479
progress curve and the idea was that if

358
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:59,958
a student were at the board they were

359
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,000
not solely responsible

360
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:03,518
for diagramming whatever they were

361
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,799
diagramming they were relying on the

362
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,318
people in the classroom to guide them

363
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:11,039
through the process so it was a low

364
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:13,599
stakes environment for the person at the

365
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:16,360
board and a mentoring learning

366
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,240
opportunity for people in in the

367
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:22,079
classroom and we came about this not

368
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,959
because we thought of it on our own um

369
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:27,879
but because in the second week of class

370
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:30,318
we had sort of volen told the student to

371
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:31,879
go to the board to diagram the p and

372
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:34,799
fest's life

373
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:37,439
cycle um which he did fairly

374
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:39,758
begrudgingly um and with some amount of

375
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,720
pain uh but then when he was on his way

376
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,199
back to his seat he stopped and turned

377
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,920
to us and said that was the most I've

378
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:48,758
learned in this class so

379
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,838
far and so we could you know come up

380
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:52,959
with all of these what we thought were

381
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:55,920
Innovative and creative ways to teach

382
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:58,078
the information but at least for that

383
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:01,399
student What mattered was going to the

384
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:03,559
board and and drawing something and not

385
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:05,720
to illustrate understanding but to

386
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:08,279
cement

387
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:11,400
understanding and I had mentioned that

388
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:14,439
um that after um the course bill and I

389
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,079
would have our debriefing session and

390
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:18,038
there wasn't an office for us in the

391
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,759
prison right we couldn't stay we were

392
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:24,959
escorted out at the end of class and so

393
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:26,919
we went to our next best option um which

394
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,320
was a Speedway gas station a couple of

395
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:32,000
miles down the road because it had this

396
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:36,119
manyi Dunkin

397
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,880
Donuts um and it had literally just two

398
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:42,119
tables and so um every Tuesday late

399
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,520
morning this is where we would be

400
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:46,918
um debriefing about what we had

401
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:48,960
experienced mostly because you know it

402
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,520
was jarring but

403
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,160
meaningful um this is also where we

404
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:58,038
would grade quizzes and come up with the

405
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:01,320
summary term list for the next week um

406
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:04,038
and and an unlikely place to for me to

407
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:05,720
realize the sort of mentor that bill is

408
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:09,240
and and to develop a relationship with

409
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:12,600
him um so at a gas

410
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,679
station um so anyway that was happening

411
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:16,759
over the course of the semester and then

412
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:19,159
at the very end we had the term papers

413
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:21,038
do and we asked the students to give

414
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:24,120
presentations on the term

415
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:26,720
papers and we told them that we wanted

416
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:28,279
lightning talks 5 to 10 minutes you know

417
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,798
no more than 10 minutes that should be

418
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:33,038
sufficient for them to introduce the

419
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:34,879
pathogen the five pathogens on their

420
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:39,400
crop and how to manage them in an

421
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:42,600
integrated way and on average each

422
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,440
student took about 45 minutes to give

423
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:45,678
their

424
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:50,960
presentations which we did not

425
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:53,559
expect um and uh so it took two classes

426
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:57,319
to actually go through the four

427
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:59,678
presentations um and and we we realized

428
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:02,279
that this was probably for many of the

429
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,679
students the first time that they gave a

430
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:08,119
presentation to a respectful and

431
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:11,280
attentive audience so that was

432
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:14,839
okay and the student whose mother is a

433
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,879
Master Gardener in Oklahoma wrote his

434
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:19,480
term paper on the biology and management

435
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,320
of peach tree diseases because that is

436
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,599
an important crop to his mom and he

437
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,119
wanted to connect with her um throughout

438
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:30,038
the

439
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:33,678
project and I was really touched by by

440
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:37,319
her involvement in his success in the

441
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:40,919
class he had her mail him these printed

442
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:44,798
color photos of

443
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:48,159
symptoms um of the diseases that he was

444
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:51,480
studying and

445
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:51,480
as in his

446
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,960
paper so Not only was the student really

447
00:19:55,038 --> 00:20:00,119
invested in his success but also his

448
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:04,079
family um in contributing something as

449
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:07,759
well and so that was was very

450
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:10,079
impactful I wanted to um spend the rest

451
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,839
of the time talking about some lessons

452
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:15,158
that I learned from the experience and

453
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:16,319
then close with uh some Reflections from

454
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:19,000
the

455
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:21,359
students and I wanted to say first that

456
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,599
this was the single most impactful

457
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:27,000
experience that I've had all in grad

458
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:30,639
school and I would encourage really

459
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,839
anyone at Cornell because of CPAP here

460
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:37,440
but really especially graduate students

461
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:41,558
to say yes to an unlikely teaching

462
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,840
opportunity like this despite the

463
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:47,599
challenges I learned the importance of

464
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:51,918
trying to be precise and concise and to

465
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:54,119
seek narrow specific and unambiguous

466
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,960
words and that this was especially

467
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,279
important when the students you're

468
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:02,159
teaching are learning it for the very

469
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:05,839
first time and have little to no ability

470
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:08,039
to check you on anything that you're

471
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:11,399
saying I also learned that I should

472
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:13,798
admit often what I don't know and that I

473
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,320
thought I knew things that I

474
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:18,038
didn't my ego got in the way very

475
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,839
quickly in the classroom in the

476
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:22,720
beginning I was very concerned with

477
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:23,879
seeming like I was a good resource to

478
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,798
the students like I knew all the

479
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,760
information really really well um and

480
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:32,480
found that I could be are more effective

481
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:35,119
as an instructor to them if I were more

482
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,400
honest than I was inse

483
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:40,798
Secure um and so in light of that I have

484
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,480
a vulnerable anecdote um about thinking

485
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,000
that I knew things that I didn't that I

486
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,400
wanted to

487
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,640
share um about a third of the way

488
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,640
through the semester Bill asked me if I

489
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:54,880
would teach the students um mitosis and

490
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:58,759
meiosis give a lecture on it and I said

491
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:01,039
sure you know I I've studied subjects

492
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:02,278
years now that deal with some element of

493
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:04,679
mitosis or

494
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:06,599
meiosis um I feel comfortable giving a

495
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:10,240
meaningful lecture to the

496
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:11,639
students and as I was spending the

497
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,679
couple of weeks preparing for the

498
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:18,038
lecture I was thinking about what are

499
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,798
the what I would say are the Core

500
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:21,839
Concepts of cell division that come to

501
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:24,798
mind very quickly for me and maybe

502
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,639
that's how I'll inform the lecture and

503
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,879
that's what I'll share with the students

504
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,759
and one of those Concepts was this

505
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,080
notion I had that meiosis results in the

506
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,759
production of

507
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:40,278
gametes and um I thought that that would

508
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:42,679
be a a core concept I would teach them

509
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:44,839
and because we had used pinfest as a

510
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:47,720
model up to this point I thought I would

511
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:50,798
teach the subject through the pinfest

512
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:53,679
life cycle so I got up to the board and

513
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:56,038
I drew the scaffolding of this

514
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,278
table um comparing and contrasting

515
00:22:56,038 --> 00:23:00,158
mitosis and

516
00:22:57,278 --> 00:23:02,759
meiosis and I I told the students I'm

517
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,760
going to walk through the life cycle and

518
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:07,519
at each stage talk about how mitosis or

519
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:11,679
meiosis plays a

520
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:15,240
role and so that's what I did but really

521
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:18,679
I I distinguished the two here um saying

522
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:21,640
that in this system meiosis results in

523
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:25,679
the production of gametes and mitosis

524
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:28,120
does not and I thought that was concise

525
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,400
and precise and I think the students

526
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:32,639
also thought that um and that was where

527
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,278
we left

528
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,679
it and Bill didn't say

529
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:40,839
anything and then a couple of weeks

530
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,720
later bill was introducing askam my

531
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:45,759
fungi to the

532
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,319
class and he was walking through the

533
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:49,480
generalized life cycle and he got to

534
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:53,359
sexual

535
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:57,079
reproduction and he said something like

536
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:59,678
you have compatible hyy that undergo

537
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:04,240
plasmogamy and you end up with multiple

538
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:06,880
haid nuclei in a cell and those multiple

539
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,278
haid nuclei undergo rounds of

540
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:14,960
mitosis and then eventually two haid

541
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:16,480
nuclei fuse and very briefly you have a

542
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,319
diploid

543
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,319
nucleus and that nucleus undergoes

544
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:24,000
meiosis and then eventually there's

545
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:27,158
another round of mitosis and you get

546
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,159
four sets of twins your classic haid

547
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:31,039
eight ascospores

548
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:34,320
and the life cycle

549
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:36,519
continues and I was nodding along and

550
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:38,319
drafting my summary notes like yes of

551
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:40,000
course this is what I've always learned

552
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:42,158
and and then I was thinking about what I

553
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,839
had been telling the students previously

554
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,640
about mitosis and

555
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:50,678
meiosis and I was looking at this and my

556
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,679
notes and looking at this and I was

557
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:59,200
like

558
00:24:53,119 --> 00:25:02,839
wait in askam mys meiosis does not

559
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:05,798
result in the production of gametes it

560
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:08,918
happens in the

561
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:11,440
zygote and because meiosis happens in

562
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:15,159
the zygote the dominant nuclear State

563
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:18,278
for the rest of the life cycle is

564
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:22,000
hloy and how fundamentally different

565
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:27,159
that is from all organisms where meiosis

566
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:32,119
occurs before parental nuclei are

567
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:35,320
donated and and and I I was like surely

568
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:36,839
I I knew this like how did I get to this

569
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:39,079
point in graduate school and this is

570
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:41,240
just now making sense to me like it's

571
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:42,639
now feeling very important to me why

572
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,359
don't people talk about this all the

573
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,080
time this is so important there's this

574
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:51,038
is a level of difference that I didn't

575
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:52,678
appreciate between organisms and and

576
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:56,440
because the students had created this

577
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:58,840
environment where it was not shameful to

578
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:02,000
admit having not appreciated something

579
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:03,678
and now appreciating something um I

580
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,839
couldn't help but do the

581
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,000
same and and so I I hope I'm

582
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:10,398
illustrating to you the dynamic in the

583
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,200
classroom um it

584
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:17,278
feels very vulnerable to admit this to a

585
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:19,200
room of very real subject matter experts

586
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:22,720
um

587
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:26,278
but anyway that was an experience I had

588
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,919
where I admitted what I didn't

589
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:31,440
know I also learned that

590
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,038
teaching added dimmension to my research

591
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,440
I don't think that it hindered I think

592
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:38,798
that it only enhanced the experience for

593
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,000
me and there's a another little anecdote

594
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:43,519
I wanted to

595
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,960
share uh related to this so Bill had

596
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:48,440
mentioned that for my my research part

597
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,880
of what I do is I I am characterizing

598
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:53,480
diseases of rhubarb primarily those that

599
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,200
we think are the most um common in the

600
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:58,679
Northeast and really that has led me to

601
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:01,600
characterize a single fungal path that

602
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:04,080
causes Leaf spots that look like

603
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:06,119
this and so this is you know going on

604
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:08,918
before M and while

605
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:11,879
M and maybe two-thirds through the

606
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:13,640
semester Bill asked me if I would teach

607
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:18,559
the nematology

608
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:21,880
lecture and I agreed um with some

609
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:24,720
hesitation because I thought I should

610
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:26,320
admit that I didn't really know anything

611
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,558
of the subject to give a meaningful

612
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:31,720
lecture to these students

613
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:34,398
um so I spent a couple of weeks

614
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,960
preparing and while doing so and then

615
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:40,398
while giving the lecture I realized that

616
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,759
I found dagger nematodes and their

617
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:46,518
ability to transmit nepo viruses to be

618
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:48,319
really interesting like like somehow I

619
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:51,000
had ignored this in previous Plant

620
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,480
Pathology classes like how did I not

621
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,240
know that this was very cool it's very

622
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:58,880
cool to me now um and then at the same

623
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,159
time our lab started growing out a

624
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,559
number of rhubarb BC sessions in the

625
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:07,120
greenhouse that were previously in the

626
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:10,359
field so I had sort of closer eyes on

627
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:12,439
them and while they were growing out I

628
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:15,798
realized that in a single accession in

629
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:19,759
our collection um there were these

630
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:22,558
curious symptoms that initially

631
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:25,240
resembled the leaf spot symptoms that I

632
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:28,960
had seen before and these are clones of

633
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:31,679
each other these two plants and and so I

634
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,960
tried um to isolate from these Leaf

635
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:38,200
spots the same pathogen that I know

636
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:41,558
causes these Leaf spots

637
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:44,840
unsuccessfully and I approached Mark

638
00:28:41,558 --> 00:28:46,798
fuks and asked him if he thought that

639
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:48,959
any of these were worth screening for a

640
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:51,000
number of viruses in my experience I

641
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,519
have gone to Mark fuks many many times

642
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,880
with what I think a really cool symptoms

643
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,558
hoping that it's caused by some virus

644
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,840
and he always says no it's not worth

645
00:28:57,558 --> 00:29:02,480
testing so it was very exciting for me

646
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:07,079
when he said that's interesting let's

647
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:10,240
screen them so we did and what we found

648
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:12,038
has resulted in a new project and a

649
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,640
collaboration that I would have never

650
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:17,440
thought that I would have as a graduate

651
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,759
student studying fungal pathogens of

652
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:24,679
vegetables so we we found tomato

653
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:29,038
ringspot virus which is a NEPA virus in

654
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:30,519
this sucession causing uh or showing at

655
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:34,319
least these

656
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:36,919
symptoms um and and that motivated a

657
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:40,439
further collaboration um with members of

658
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:42,038
Mark's lab um and a collaborator at an

659
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,038
institution that I didn't think that I

660
00:29:42,038 --> 00:29:48,839
would be collaborating with um a high

661
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:50,919
throughput sequencing of RNA project and

662
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:52,199
we have some interesting results so our

663
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:55,880
next step is

664
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:58,720
validation um and I guess I'm not trying

665
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,799
to say that it's because I was realizing

666
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,759
that I was interested in nepoviruses as

667
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:07,839
a TA that I happened to find a nepovirus

668
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:10,038
in rhubarb um but it was that I had

669
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:12,480
learned enough to be interested in the

670
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:15,158
subject that it it made something like

671
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,038
this seem worthwhile last minute as a

672
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:20,919
unplanned project

673
00:30:18,038 --> 00:30:23,079
so that was something I

674
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:25,519
learned I also learned that any

675
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:26,480
expectation I have of the students I'll

676
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,278
have of

677
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,599
myself so if I want the students if I

678
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:32,480
expect them to be interested in

679
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:34,798
something I have to demonstrate that I'm

680
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,399
interested in it if I want them to spend

681
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:39,038
time on something I should demonstrate

682
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:42,000
that I have spent time on

683
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:44,720
it I also learned that I should expect

684
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,798
an experience to be interesting and

685
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,360
meaningful and then I may be better

686
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:51,480
prepared to appreciate it when it likely

687
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:53,759
will

688
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,798
be and I learned that I should be

689
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,000
affected by the people I

690
00:30:55,798 --> 00:30:59,359
teach and to let them know that I'm

691
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
affected by

692
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:05,759
them in a written reflection at the end

693
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,038
of the semester one student said I've

694
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:10,519
never wanted to get out and bump into

695
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:11,798
two people more in my life so I can

696
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:14,278
shake their

697
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:16,398
hands not only for what they did for me

698
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:20,119
academically but for treating me like a

699
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:23,319
human being I'll never forget

700
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:25,158
them so you know it mattered what we

701
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:28,759
were teaching them and how we were

702
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:30,519
teaching them but I really think that

703
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:33,000
we could have been teaching them

704
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:34,679
anything it was that we cared about them

705
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,558
that mattered the

706
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:41,080
most so some students

707
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:43,038
comments you started this class by

708
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:46,199
telling us that everything we learn is

709
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:50,000
real I

710
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:52,600
agree potato spindle tuber vroid it's

711
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,480
amazing that I know that I would have

712
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:56,439
never thought I'd say that before taking

713
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,919
this

714
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:02,120
class and one student in um talking

715
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:05,000
about preparing for an

716
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:07,719
exam do you know that I can walk the

717
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
yard with murderers and thieves and have

718
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:13,600
less anxiety than I do in this

719
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,798
class it's really not what we meant to

720
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,798
have

721
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,359
happen I'm using the disease triangle to

722
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:22,639
explain recidivism with my re-entry

723
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:25,119
program

724
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:28,079
mes they came here because of some

725
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:31,158
interaction between their behavior their

726
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:33,000
needs and their support system they have

727
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:35,399
to change at least one to keep from

728
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,398
coming

729
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:41,000
back I will never look at a piece of

730
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:43,240
fruit vegetable or food the same way

731
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,759
again knowing that a Grower's many

732
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,919
efforts somewhere along the line have

733
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:50,480
made that resource available to

734
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:52,799
me

735
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,798
and I would love to show my family

736
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:55,798
liness

737
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:03,439
I'm happy to

738
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:07,278
report that a number of the students in

739
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:11,240
our class graduated this

740
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:13,240
semester and those who are still

741
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:17,319
incarcerated will continue taking

742
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,319
classes through cpep as long as they're

743
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:25,398
offered I care a lot about this

744
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:29,278
experience and I really really

745
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:35,519
appreciate the people in this picture

746
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:35,519
with me especially bill for making this

747
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:43,719
possible and you all for your

748
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,720
attention and I'm happy to take any

749
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:57,719
questions are there some questions for

750
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,720
Li

751
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:05,798
get a started I have one how would you

752
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:11,119
compare your Cornell

753
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:11,119
undergrads with CCF

754
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:16,280
undergrads so how would I compare the

755
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,519
students in the cpep program with

756
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,519
students I've I've taught at

757
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:29,239
Cornell there is

758
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,358
a May major major difference in the

759
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:33,039
background

760
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:36,159
education um with the students at

761
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:37,679
Cornell versus students at cpep it's not

762
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,720
surprising

763
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:47,358
um uh the understanding of of plant

764
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:51,799
science of of DNA of of biology broadly

765
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:54,519
um uh that was a a surprise for me the

766
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,720
students at cpep did not have um a

767
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:59,559
strong

768
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:03,799
understanding um but

769
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:06,920
they they had almost no desire I think

770
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:09,000
to prove themselves to each other

771
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:13,200
perhaps in the way that I've observed

772
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,800
with undergrads here the what I had

773
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:16,838
found really meaningful about the

774
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,760
experience is something I had talked

775
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:21,039
about was

776
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,760
that the environment in the classroom

777
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:25,440
was it was very free and willing um to

778
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,560
to admit when you didn't understand

779
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:31,039
something and I think as a ta at in

780
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:32,920
Cornell classes I was would have been

781
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:35,480
very scared to say to anyone that I had

782
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:39,200
just appreciated

783
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:43,199
that meiosis occurs in the zygote in

784
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:45,799
asamy um but that was totally welcome in

785
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:45,799
a CPAP

786
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:55,240
classroom is there a prison program for

787
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:59,280
women so if if there's a prison program

788
00:35:55,239 --> 00:36:01,639
for women my understanding is that cpep

789
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,560
currently does not operate in women's

790
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:07,199
prisons and I don't know if there is a

791
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:10,078
reason for that in addition to maybe

792
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:13,960
they are too far away for people to

793
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,640
volunteer at um yeah I don't know where

794
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:19,559
the nearest women's prison is but there

795
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:22,000
are um other universities have prison

796
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:25,719
education programs at Women's prisons um

797
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:29,119
in New York state um Brown operates in

798
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:30,959
some um columia has a program but not

799
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,119
for

800
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:37,400
now

801
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:40,240
yeah talk and I want to follow up Bill's

802
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,440
question actually comparing the students

803
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:45,279
so if I understand if I understand

804
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,440
correctly this students uh in the prison

805
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,800
are not probably having the type of

806
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,838
background that's probably needed to go

807
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:56,318
into advanced topics and you're actually

808
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:59,440
teaching them pretty like specific terms

809
00:36:56,318 --> 00:37:01,358
and uh terminology and stuff like that

810
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,159
how in your observation do these

811
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:09,358
students react to like the frustration

812
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:13,920
compared to other like like on grass

813
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:15,838
have more backgrounds and stuff and like

814
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,880
are there any incidents where their

815
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:22,400
frustration could like lead to like

816
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,519
stopping the class or the getting the

817
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,039
guard

818
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:30,880
okay so so eag your question was about

819
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:33,519
um comparing perhaps how students react

820
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,039
in in cpep versus Cornell to not

821
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:38,920
understanding a concept and if their

822
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:43,800
frustration ever elevated a situation to

823
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:45,240
a point of concern um I would say that

824
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,160
there were many times where students

825
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:50,118
were frustrated by not understanding a

826
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:54,639
subject um but we would just slow the

827
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:57,039
class down and um and with five students

828
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:59,519
it's and eventually then four it was

829
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:02,719
very easy easy to make sure that

830
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:05,119
everyone was on the same page um they

831
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:06,799
often turned to each other for support

832
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,760
so they would tutor each other outside

833
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,280
of the class if they had recognized that

834
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:14,720
someone wasn't understanding something

835
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,960
um uh there was never any concern that I

836
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:19,559
had about safety in the classroom once I

837
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,240
felt comfortable not at first but

838
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:26,960
eventually after I learned the students

839
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:28,039
and um knew who they were um uh but but

840
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,559
they handled

841
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:32,880
frustration with the subject I think

842
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:35,679
similar to how I would have um expected

843
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,680
oral students

844
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:44,000
do yes copy I noticed that some of your

845
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:46,240
early summary notes had graphs in like

846
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,800
area under the disease progress curve

847
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:49,479
and I'm thinking of like my magical

848
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:53,079
mushroom students that if I put up a

849
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:56,480
graph I have to be like okay like like

850
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:59,440
how how did you explain the area under

851
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,440
the disease Pro

852
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:05,919
uh how did we explain yeah the charts

853
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:08,279
and figures I there was a lot of

854
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,240
repetition at the chalkboard and getting

855
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:14,560
the students to draw it out themselves

856
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:14,559
you got it I think so

857
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:22,838
some

858
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:25,480
yeah yeah um there there were examples

859
00:39:22,838 --> 00:39:27,880
where um I mean we spent maybe two weeks

860
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:31,639
on on disease progress curve

861
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:34,599
and exponential growth and um and trying

862
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:35,719
to compare um exponential growth to

863
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:38,440
maybe how they might have thought about

864
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:41,279
their finances before and what happens

865
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,599
in a savings account and and that maybe

866
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,960
wasn't as helpful as I thought it would

867
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:49,000
be but um um but walking them through

868
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,559
individual calculations getting them to

869
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,760
sort of debate each other on what they

870
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:57,639
thought the outcome would be and then um

871
00:39:53,760 --> 00:40:00,319
and argue their case yeah we did that

872
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:03,039
can I can I say one more thing like I

873
00:40:00,318 --> 00:40:04,599
really liked your reflection on

874
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:06,800
intellectual

875
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:10,920
humility you want to say that into the

876
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,920
mic for the zoom folks

877
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,039
okay you have the floor I think this one

878
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:19,559
is on I'm not giving this seminar but I

879
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:21,199
wanted to say this is Kathy Hodge I

880
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:23,799
wanted to say that I really liked your

881
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:28,159
reflection on intellectual humility and

882
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:31,640
I think um and I think it's a really

883
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:34,039
good attribute to have right and when

884
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:35,719
you think about it like we all we're all

885
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:37,920
just learning all the time and in fact

886
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:39,838
that's like why we're here right we

887
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,639
we're curious about the things we don't

888
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:45,960
know but I think when you first when

889
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:47,838
students first graduate often with a PhD

890
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,159
I think it you feel like you should be

891
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:51,679
an expert on things and I still feel

892
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,639
like I'm supposed to be an expert on

893
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:56,679
things but in fact I I got here for the

894
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:58,400
very opposite reason that I that I

895
00:40:56,679 --> 00:41:01,000
didn't know anything and I just want to

896
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,599
learn more and more stuff and I just

897
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,760
think that intellectual humility like

898
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:10,680
you've shown is just a beautiful way to

899
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:13,800
like let people in and just recruit them

900
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:16,960
to the process of science you know like

901
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:18,318
there's so much we don't know and so if

902
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,480
somebody asks you a question that you

903
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:23,279
don't know the answer to it's like

904
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,358
that's a beautiful moment if you can say

905
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:32,079
that's a really good question and you

906
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:35,799
know like I don't really know so good

907
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:37,480
job to say anything I that was lovely I

908
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:40,519
don't know if I can

909
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:43,519
follow but that was I think very much

910
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:46,039
the dynamic that I experienced in the

911
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:48,318
classroom yes I want to just say one

912
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:51,838
thing uh when Libby first started I

913
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:55,318
really did not know that you were

914
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:58,440
apprehensive about going into the prison

915
00:41:55,318 --> 00:42:01,279
I guess I'm not very observant um could

916
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:04,000
you compare your just describe your

917
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:07,519
experience early on with that later on

918
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,599
and maybe could stop with that one okay

919
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:13,800
um yeah

920
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:16,039
so in the first month or so of this

921
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,960
semester I tried really hard to hide

922
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:22,000
this from you I guess it worked um but I

923
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,760
didn't I didn't really sleep the nights

924
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:30,960
before going in um

925
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:33,040
and I was very afraid of what version of

926
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,720
a correctional officer I was going to

927
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:38,400
meet at the gate I had heard sort of

928
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:41,159
horror stories about uh previous

929
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,760
volunteers this didn't happen to me but

930
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:45,039
um you know your your shirt was too

931
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,040
tight so you can't come in today or

932
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:50,159
you're wearing a white shirt and it's

933
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:52,800
going to rain so you can't come in today

934
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:54,159
um or are you sure you're a volunteer

935
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,800
because we don't have your name on the

936
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:58,159
list even though you've been there for

937
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,559
weeks and and need to have someone come

938
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:01,159
over and look at your you know

939
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:03,680
identifying information to make sure

940
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:06,519
that you can go back and so I was really

941
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:10,199
scared simply to enter the

942
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:13,239
facility um I remember the the first

943
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:15,358
time that you took a bathroom break in

944
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:17,358
lecture and I was sitting alone with the

945
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:19,960
students and I it was our first class

946
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:21,400
and I didn't know anything about them

947
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,599
and they didn't know anything about me

948
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:27,720
and I was so afraid that all they could

949
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:30,440
see was that I was young and a woman and

950
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:35,439
um and I was very wrong about that um in

951
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:38,079
the end um by the end I think somehow we

952
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:41,039
achieved like

953
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:42,440
a another sort of classroom Dimension

954
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:43,838
that didn't exist in the prison like

955
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,159
you'd walk through the prison but get to

956
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:46,960
class and it was a classroom and that

957
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:48,960
was awesome and it

958
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,599
was could have been

959
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,599
anywhere

960
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:59,039
um so it very much changed by the

961
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:59,039
end okay me thank you very much
