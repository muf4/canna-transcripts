00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:32,880
times particularly in the autumn

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:36,159
about how gorgeous the campus and all of

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,000
the area is and i hope that you can all

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,160
so i'm going to take you on a bit of a

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,680
walk across north america

19
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:52,640
in 350 meters and we'll see

20
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,320
what the 350 meters references shortly

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,039
um

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,238

uh represented by over a thousand genera

58
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,039
so you'll see a small uh snippet of our

59
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,878
garden

60
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,639

the rest of the garden as well i also

65
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,399
wanted to acknowledge before starting

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,239
that university of british columbia

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,439
is on the land of the musqueam people

68
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,000
this is our local

69
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,400
indigenous band here and the university

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,039
campus in point grey where i'm located

71
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,120
is on the traditional ancestral and

72
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,318
unseated territory of the musqueam

73
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,319
people

74
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,839
so i wanted to acknowledge that before

75
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,479
moving forward

76
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,239
to give you a sense of where i am in our

77
00:02:54,479 --> 00:03:00,000
vast continent for those that aren't

78
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,400
familiar with the wild wild west uh

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,239
this is north america obviously and the

80
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,800
red circle on the upper left

81
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,158
is the location of southern british

82
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,400
columbia

83
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,079
it's quite a remarkable part of the

84
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,719
continent if you haven't had a chance to

85
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,599
visit

86
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,239
please do we zoom in a little bit more

87
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:18,639
this is

88
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,319
the greater vancouver area the fraser

89
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,878
river is a large

90
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,719
very important river here river system

91
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:25,598
for the local ecology and the local

92
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,158
people

93
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:29,199
and the red circle that you're seeing

94
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:31,919
this time

95
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:34,318
is vancouver's point grey campus this is

96
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,759
the site for our botanic garden

97
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:40,238
we have a wonderful coastal situation

98
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,158
looking out onto the salish sea

99
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,560
if we zoom in a little bit further this

100
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,639
is point grey campus itself

101
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,479
and if you look in the lower left you'll

102
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:52,479
see another shape sort of drawn

103
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:55,119
out this long sort of peninsular space

104
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,878
and uh this sort of awkward space that

105
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,000
wraps around a stadium here

106
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:02,919
this is the site of ubc botanical garden

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,080
currently our garden has celebrated our

108
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:06,318
103rd

109
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,799
anniversary and over that time we've

110
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:13,518
actually moved sites twice

111
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:16,478
we've been at this site since the 1970s

112
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,879
if we zoom in a little bit closer this

113
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,560
is the botanical garden site itself

114
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,959
vancouver has seen a tremendous amount

115
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,199
of growth over the last decades

116
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,319
and with that growth has come more

117
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,400
infrastructure

118
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,360
so what you see is our garden is

119
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,799
currently

120
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,360
divided into by a four-lane divided

121
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,960
highway this was not always the case

122
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,400
um so we have our southwest gardens

123
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,758
and our northeast gardens for today's

124
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,079
talk we're going to focus in

125
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,360
even further on the northeast gardens

126
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,000
and in particular

127
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,600
the space that's outlined here are the

128
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,959
north american gardens

129
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,320
here at ubc the north american gardens

130
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,680
are comprised of four

131
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:02,399
distinct garden areas representing the

132
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,879
biogeographical and floristic

133
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:08,239
communities of four

134
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:11,360
distinct regions the first is

135
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:15,439
our bc rainforest garden this is where

136
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,400
we will start our journey of 350 meters

137
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,879
the second being the pacific slope

138
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,159
garden

139
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,478
[Music]

140
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,160
then we'll move to the gary oak meadow

141
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:27,279
and woodland garden

142
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,199
and finally the carolinian forest garden

143
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,559
the title of the presentation references

144
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,360
the fact that you can

145
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,280
walk from the beginning of the

146
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,280
rainforest garden to the beginning of

147
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,319
the carolinian forest which is the walk

148
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,959
that we will do

149
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,560
in 350 meters and this is a really great

150
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,560
um

151
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,800
opportunity for people to come to our

152
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,079
garden and see the native flora

153
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,840
of this region but also of eastern north

154
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,839
america as well

155
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,680
so we're going to start with our

156
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,680
bc rainforest garden

157
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,038
i i showed you the region that we were

158
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,719
in a little bit earlier and

159
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:10,399
vancouver is fortunate to be situated in

160
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,240
one of north america's temperate

161
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:16,079
rainforest regions

162
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,960
um we receive annually over 50 inches of

163
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,399
rainfall

164
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:22,719
that happens here and we're extremely

165
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,279
moderated by our proximity to the

166
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,199
pacific ocean

167
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,079
our to give you a sense of just how

168
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,079
moderate our

169
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,879
our annual temperature in january which

170
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,159
is our coldest month

171
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:41,759
is 36 degrees fahrenheit so

172
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,680
still above freezing we do get snow here

173
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,280
but it never stays for more than a day

174
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,079
or two

175
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:50,719
and in the heat of summer in august or

176
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:54,079
sort of july which is our hottest month

177
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:57,440
we'll reach an average of 55 degrees so

178
00:06:54,079 --> 00:07:00,000
also quite moderate we do have some heat

179
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,160
for sure but overall we're quite a

180
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,120
moderate climate and as a result we have

181
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,960
this lush

182
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,918
temperate rainforest environment that

183
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,918
we're situated in

184
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:15,038
our bc rainforest garden does not look

185
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:17,120
quite as lush as that first image

186
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,159
we are situated in an area that has been

187
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,680
heavily developed

188
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,720
and altered over time so while this

189
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,478
garden does

190
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,360
seek to represent the local bc

191
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,758
rainforest

192
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,360
plant communities authentically there

193
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,360
are some aspects of

194
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,800
our local rainforest that we just can't

195
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,560
replicate

196
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,319
given lower humidity due to development

197
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,720
and increased air movement and that sort

198
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,720
of thing

199
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:47,120
the garden itself i wanted to

200
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,720
acknowledge a couple of people in the

201
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,720
creation of it and so the bc

202
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,720
rainforest garden is actually dedicated

203
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,039
to the man in the lower right and his

204
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,919
name is john davidson

205
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,839
he was the first provincial botanist for

206
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:02,000
british columbia and was

207
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,038
later brought on by the university to

208
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,279
start

209
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:09,839
the botanical gardens themselves in 1819

210
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,038
and above him is a man named al rose and

211
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,560
al rose was a very

212
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:16,159
active employee at the botanic garden he

213
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,519
was the first curator for our native

214
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,360
garden

215
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:23,839
in the 70s and 80s and he was

216
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,479
by all accounts an exceptional field

217
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,279
botanist

218
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,079
and horticulturist he did a tremendous

219
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,758
amount of work

220
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:31,120
collecting plants from all over the

221
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,240
province

222
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,918
from our wet rainforest coast through to

223
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,839
our dry interior

224
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:43,360
up to our far far north and alpine

225
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:45,360
areas he made

226
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,320
something like a thousand collections a

227
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,399
year for a decade and a half

228
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,399
and to give you perspective a good

229
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,839
collecting year for me

230
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,958
i would probably get a 200 maybe

231
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,880
so he was an exceptional individual in

232
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:06,319
building these collections

233
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:09,519
um however when he retired in the 80s

234
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,320
funding and staffing structures

235
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,080
didn't allow for his replacement so al

236
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,920
rose built this garden that was

237
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,759
representative of flora from all over

238
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:19,120
the province really really rich

239
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,919
collection

240
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,480
and then it was abandoned by by and

241
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,799
large

242
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,560
for over a decade and during that time

243
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,719
this garden space

244
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,319
a number of those plants that were not

245
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,600
locally adapted

246
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,360
and couldn't survive without the

247
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,360
horticultural care had died

248
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,519
uh out sad story but there are some

249
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,839
still uh some beautiful

250
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,200
relics from his time and so this is what

251
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,959
that garden looks like

252
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,759
now um we've narrowed the scope from bc

253
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,559
native to

254
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,759
bc rainforest native to reflect the

255
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:56,159
plants that can

256
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:59,278
survive and are locally adapted

257
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:01,679
it looks very much like some of the

258
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:02,879
park spaces that happen in and around

259
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,879
vancouver

260
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,559
and in some ways that's challenging to

261
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,958
get people to understand that they are

262
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:11,039
in fact in a garden and not in a park

263
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:13,359
when they're in this space however the

264
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:17,360
trade-off is that we have some really

265
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,360
lovely moments that happen that are

266
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,800
fully natural expressing the local

267
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:26,480
ecology and so on the right we see an

268
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:28,559
old stump of a western red cedar

269
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,600
and our western hemlocks grow out of

270
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,039
these stumps

271
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,040
and you end up with these incredibly

272
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,759
beautiful moments in a garden that would

273
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:37,199
be

274
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:39,838
almost impossible to recreate

275
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,800
if this garden wasn't given that time on

276
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,360
its own

277
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:43,919
so the the balance here is that we have

278
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,919
some

279
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,199
some really great demonstrations of

280
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:50,639
local ecology

281
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,320
and a number of ubc's gardens visitors

282
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,838
are actually tourists we have a huge

283
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,680
tourist population

284
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,360
so i love this garden because people

285
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:00,000
come from all over the world

286
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:04,079
and within the garden itself can see

287
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,399
intact functioning local ecology

288
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,838
there are a number of uh of accessions

289
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,839
in here that are

290
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,680
remaining from al rose's time and i've

291
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,120
also been fortunate to build these

292
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,278
collections up

293
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,039
over the last few years and it's amazing

294
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:18,240
what can happen when you get back into a

295
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,120
garden space

296
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,000
and and provide that care it's a

297
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,879
wonderful

298
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,159
uh garden particularly in the early

299
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:27,838
spring when things are

300
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,480
leafing out and it's just this lush

301
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,480
light green

302
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,679
and importantly you know they're the

303
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,919
gardens themselves are not all about

304
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:38,958
plants we do a lot of work with people

305
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,919
as well

306
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,719
and uh i wanted to just highlight one

307
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:44,958
particular

308
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,759
relationship that i'm privileged to be

309
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,679
involved in

310
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,799
and it's relevance to my role as a

311
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,519
curator

312
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:54,000
so on the left is a white fawn lily a

313
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,560
plant called erythronium oregonum

314
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,399
and this plant in the picture here is

315
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:59,278
actually one of al rose's historic

316
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,039
collections

317
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:04,879
being in the garden for uh 35 plus years

318
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:07,439
and i've always admired it in the spring

319
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:11,600
it's beautiful spring ephemeral

320
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,279
um very very beautiful plant

321
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,959
and through some partnerships i've

322
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:15,838
learned that there's just so much more

323
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,399
to this plant

324
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,920
and so on the right you'll see a photo

325
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,480
of

326
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,559
tara moreau is on the left she is our

327
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,320
associate director of sustainability and

328
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,559
community programs

329
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,680
and in the middle is vanessa campbell

330
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,958
vanessa is

331
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:36,239
a language specialist with the musculum

332
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:38,479
indian band and then there's me on the

333
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,320
right and we've been working

334
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,079
to do a lot of co-created

335
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,920
programming and knowledge sharing

336
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:47,199
between the botanic garden and the

337
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:51,439
musqueam people

338
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:54,000
and through this dialogue

339
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,959
i learned that the musqueam the name

340
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,720
musqueam

341
00:12:54,958 --> 00:13:02,000
for the indian ban translates to

342
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:06,160
people of the river grass and

343
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,278
the story is so powerful related

344
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:10,240
to the creation of the salmon streams

345
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,278
that sustain

346
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,440
the indigenous cultures here and

347
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,799
the story is that a double-headed

348
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,839
serpent carved these

349
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,759
these streams and in the wake of that

350
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:25,440
carving of those streams

351
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:28,480
the river grass grew along these rivers

352
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,920
however it's kind of been lost over time

353
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,959
what river grass is um

354
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:36,958
the written and oral histories

355
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,359
associated with a number of indigenous

356
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,679
cultures are only now just sort of being

357
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,720
pieced back together

358
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,879
and there's some talk uh through vanessa

359
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,600
she shared some wonderful

360
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,600
insights with me that the plant itself

361
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,320
there's one story that the grass

362
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,040
produced

363
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,079
a a white nodding flower in the early

364
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,799
spring and there's some

365
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,278
thought that it actually might be this

366
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,639
plant

367
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:04,879
and so as a curator my role is to

368
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,399
you know manage these collections and

369
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:08,720
all of the sudden

370
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,440
one of al rose's historic collections

371
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,680
takes on

372
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,120
even greater importance given its

373
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,759
relevance to

374
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,480
our our local our neighbors the musqueam

375
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,799
are literally

376
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,560
the garden's closest neighbors and whose

377
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,759
land we are on

378
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,919
so this has been one of the really

379
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,639
rewarding aspects of my job is working

380
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:29,039
with people as much as plants

381
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,399
i'm going to move on to the next garden

382
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,919
area

383
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,399
in our 350 meter journey

384
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:38,799
this is our pacific slope garden so

385
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,399
we're moving out of one of the oldest

386
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,479
garden areas

387
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,559
on site and certainly the oldest in the

388
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,199
north american collections to the newest

389
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,799
garden area

390
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:51,039
a little bit about you know what is the

391
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:54,240
pacific slope the pacific slope

392
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:55,278
uh basically denotes the western facing

393
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,079
slopes

394
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:59,519
of the coast range mountains and the

395
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:01,278
cascade ranges

396
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,560
including the klamath mountains and the

397
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,439
siskiyous

398
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:06,239
it's it's a an ecosystem that ranges

399
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,440
basically

400
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,278
from northern washington state

401
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,959
through oregon and down into northern

402
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,759
california

403
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,838
in this area if you've ever been it's

404
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,159
truly spectacular

405
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,199
and it's most well known for its

406
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,319
gigantic

407
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:26,000
conifers you see a picture on the right

408
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,600
this was a trip i was fortunate

409
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,278
to be on with some folks from the royal

410
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,440
botanical garden edinburgh when they

411
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:34,879
were doing some collecting here

412
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,680
and the smaller tree in the center is by

413
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:37,600
all accounts

414
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,198
a massive western hemlock but it's

415
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,680
completely dwarfed

416
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,919
by these enormous sitka spruce and this

417
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:47,519
is not an uncommon sight

418
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,519
along the pacific slope

419
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,079
it's important in particular for its

420
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,759
richness in conifer diversity so this is

421
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,399
a map that denotes

422
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,839
uh species richness in conifers

423
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,440
throughout the world

424
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,880
and what you'll see is you know we've

425
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,600
got some hot spots

426
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,198
in around japan southeast asia the

427
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,040
highest conifer diversity

428
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:12,879
is in new caledonia ubc botanical garden

429
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,958
doesn't have any collections under

430
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:16,720
glass we don't have greenhouses outside

431
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,078
of our propagation facilities

432
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,079
so we're not going to be growing those

433
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,359
plants but if you turn your eyes to

434
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,359
north america

435
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,199
what you see is that region that we saw

436
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,480
in the earlier slide

437
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,838
those western slopes have extremely high

438
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,879
conifer diversity

439
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,199
in a global context and this is a really

440
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:37,439
great opportunity for

441
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:38,399
conifer conservation a lot of these

442
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,880
plants

443
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,399
occur in very limited areas and if you

444
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:44,078
think about climate change and the

445
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,320
projections for that

446
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:48,078
well for the entirety of the world but

447
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,320
in particular that region

448
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:52,719
quite severe you know california's on

449
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,920
fire how many times do you hear that

450
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,480
uh a year um so we're

451
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,679
looking to turn our focus to conor for

452
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,159
conservation

453
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:04,480
and there are projections that in light

454
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,558
of climate change

455
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,798
our climate may actually be better

456
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:11,119
suited for some of these plants

457
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:13,199
in the long run and this is some of the

458
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,438
work that i do as a curator is planning

459
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,640
a garden not just for the next three

460
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,279
five ten years but hundreds of years and

461
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,199
so

462
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,639
we're focusing this garden in on the

463
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,400
conifers

464
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,280
however it's not all about conifers

465
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,000
we're also targeting the phage so the

466
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,759
oak family and these are a couple

467
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,960
accessions that are currently in there

468
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,960
that

469
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,840
i don't think people think oak as being

470
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,640
particularly gorgeous but there are some

471
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,879
examples um quercus callaghia the

472
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,799
california black oak on the left

473
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,160
it leafs out with these sort of velvety

474
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:48,160
pink leaves that

475
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,440
i think rival any of the magnolias in

476
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,000
terms of beauty

477
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,000
and nothing lithocarpus densiforus just

478
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,599
with these really cute little

479
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,720
um nuts starting to form and a nice

480
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:02,639
flush of velvety new growth

481
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,839
this garden is again as i say the

482
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,080
earliest so

483
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:11,678
last year received a very generous

484
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:13,279
donation from some of our

485
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,038
network of people that support the

486
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,599
garden and this is how project work

487
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:19,200
happens um you know so we've been

488
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,839
sitting on this idea for a number of

489
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,360
years

490
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,119
there's an injection of funds and we

491
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,038
start to move forward so this is

492
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:26,558
some of the early work that i did with

493
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,240
the landscape architect here

494
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:29,839
developing some concept plans and

495
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,919
refining the scope

496
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,599
and i'm happy to say that just last

497
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,320
month we started breaking ground and

498
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,079
this is

499
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,759
currently what this garden looks like so

500
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:38,798
you can see we've moved from a garden

501
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,798
that has

502
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,000
40 years of history in the rainforest

503
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:44,240
garden to one that is just

504
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,759
currently taking shape tremendously

505
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,599
excited about this garden

506
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:48,960
there's a lot of opportunity for

507
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:52,159
interpretation

508
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,919
to our our visitors about the impacts

509
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:58,320
of climate change on biodiversity in our

510
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,320
region

511
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,960
fortunately the photo i showed earlier

512
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,320
of

513
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,840
colleagues from the royal botanical

514
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,798
garden edinburgh on a collecting

515
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:09,439
expedition

516
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,000
fortunately we did participate in an

517
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,400
expedition

518
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,240
throughout this region a few years ago

519
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,600
so these young plants

520
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,919
in our nursery are ready to go out

521
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,439
into the garden and as you can see lots

522
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,840
of conifers

523
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,160
which is again the total focus of this

524
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:26,159
garden

525
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,840
we're about you know 200 maybe meters

526
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,840
into our journey across north america at

527
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:40,319
this point and we're going to move into

528
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:42,399
um it's hard to say what's my favorite

529
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,639
of the four gardens but this garden here

530
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,280
is a pretty spectacular garden

531
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,038
so this is our gary oak meadow and

532
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,918
woodland garden

533
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:52,480
um it's a garden that is neither the

534
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,400
oldest

535
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,079
nor the youngest it's been on site for

536
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,840
about 15 years

537
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:02,158
and is a representative of a local

538
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:04,879
meadow ecosystem that occurs here in

539
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,880
vancouver

540
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,359
so this is the distribution of these

541
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:13,038
gary oak meadows

542
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:15,918
in the wild they are characterized um

543
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:18,319
by a plant called the gary oak corcus

544
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,480
gariana it's the only oak native to

545
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:24,319
british columbia and

546
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:27,759
the range on this ecosystem you can see

547
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:30,000
sweeps down through on the

548
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,038
eastern slopes of those coastal

549
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,319
mountains

550
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:34,960
that we were talking about when we were

551
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:37,038
talking about the pacific slope garden

552
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,159
which is a lot drier this is in rain

553
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:39,919
shadow area

554
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,679
and then comes back out to the coast in

555
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,360
northern california

556
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:47,679
but if you look closely above the

557
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:48,399
national boundary there is a splattering

558
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,840
of red

559
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:55,120
in vancouver and

560
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,558
locally these meadows are restricted to

561
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:59,279
the eastern coast

562
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,720
of vancouver island similar to the rain

563
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:02,158
shadow that happens throughout the

564
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,319
coastal mountains there's a bit of a

565
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,960
rain shadow

566
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,439
on vancouver island so warm moist air

567
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,919
comes

568
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,080
over the crest hits the island drops

569
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,080
most of its moisture on the west side

570
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,399
and there's a bit of a sunnier break if

571
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:17,279
you will by vancouver standards i mean

572
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,919
still

573
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:23,119
it's it's not southern california but by

574
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:25,919
vancouver standards it's a little drier

575
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:26,558
and and with that uh supports a very

576
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,840
different

577
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:32,639
plant community most of our

578
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:35,599
native plant community is conifer

579
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,960
dominated forests large stature trees

580
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:40,158
very very damp very very dark and by

581
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,840
contrast

582
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,080
these meadows that creep up into north

583
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:47,038
america

584
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,720
are are open and sunny and exposed and

585
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:51,038
with that a whole different

586
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,798
plant community exists one of the

587
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:55,359
reasons that i would like to mention

588
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,960
the distribution is because there are a

589
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:58,479
number of plants in this

590
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,759
garden and i'll get to the garden itself

591
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,798
in a second that are

592
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:05,279
of local conservation concern so when we

593
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,000
have

594
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:10,240
forest or plant communities that have

595
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,159
this type of range

596
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,279
fairly extensive in the united states

597
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,840
but just come up

598
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:20,960
into into canada the way that plant

599
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:22,798
uh risk and threat is assessed is

600
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,960
there's three levels there's a

601
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,240
provincial or state assessment a

602
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,720
national assessment

603
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,919
and then a global assessment so a number

604
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,839
of the plants

605
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,759
that occur in the gary oak meadows by

606
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,599
the very nature of it being very

607
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:40,079
restricted here in canada

608
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:42,158
are considered nationally endangered um

609
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:43,599
a number of these plants are not

610
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,799
necessarily at risk

611
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:50,000
of going extinct in the wild but

612
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:53,440
we are at risk of losing them in

613
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,400
our local populations and

614
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,880
plants at these extended range uh sort

615
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,360
of

616
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,039
far extents of these ranges are

617
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,000
particularly valuable for plant

618
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:04,720
conservation

619
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,440
in that they may possess genetics that

620
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,640
allow them

621
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,360
to be better adapted to

622
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,320
extremes in throughout their um their

623
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,240
range

624
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:16,079
so when we talk about the conservation

625
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,038
value of the gary oak meadows here we're

626
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,879
talking about

627
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:25,200
by and large uh population conservation

628
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,039
as opposed to just a tax on conservation

629
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,000
and the gary oak meadows are extremely

630
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,440
at risk uh here in british columbia

631
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,599
i was mentioning that this is a little

632
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,919
bit drier a little bit sunnier

633
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,759
it's coastal it's got beautiful views

634
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,720
and this is exactly where people want to

635
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:41,679
settle

636
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,720
and it's estimated that um about two and

637
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,759
a half percent

638
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,319
of what was originally intact gary oak

639
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:50,240
meadows remain

640
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:51,839
the meadows themselves are totally

641
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,960
gorgeous this is the

642
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,399
gary oak meadow here at ubc

643
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,880
and what you can see is in stark

644
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,759
contrast to the rainforest garden that i

645
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,640
showed

646
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,440
open exposed sunny sites that just

647
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,880
support

648
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,880
really diverse grasses and forbs

649
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:12,798
the gary oak meadow even though it's

650
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,200
quite limited in its distribution if you

651
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:18,400
think back to that range map in canada

652
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,880
is is actually hosts more biodiversity

653
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,080
and specifically plant biodiversity than

654
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,720
anywhere else

655
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,879
in our province even though it's got

656
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,880
such a limited range

657
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,919
so a very important garden for

658
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,960
conservation

659
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:36,480
and our messaging around human impact

660
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,360
uh with plants um and

661
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,720
what people can do to help help the

662
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:43,119
cause

663
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,640
however this garden didn't always look

664
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:48,319
quite this lush when i

665
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,640
arrived in july of 2016

666
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,240
the meadow was largely dormant and the

667
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,360
following spring

668
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:58,558
um i did a bit of an assessment it

669
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:00,158
my job is to care for and oversee these

670
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,158
accessioned collections

671
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,919
but without knowing what's in them it's

672
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,799
hard to make decisions about how to best

673
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,440
do that

674
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:10,079
so in the first year i was here we did

675
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,480
an inventory of this meadow

676
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,240
and on the bottom right you see tim chip

677
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,278
char he's one of our horticulturists

678
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,120
here

679
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:18,319
and i was fortunate to work with tim he

680
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:20,879
has a number of years

681
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:22,240
of field botany experience as well so we

682
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,600
went through this meadow

683
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,519
and took herbarium specimens and

684
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:29,359
identified all the species that were

685
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,119
remaining in here

686
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,959
because over time this meadow had sort

687
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:35,038
of moved around as is the case with a

688
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,038
lot of these style of plantings

689
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:38,960
things had moved things had seeded

690
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:42,720
around things had died out

691
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:45,038
and the records weren't always kept up

692
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,759
when we finished the inventory and we

693
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:47,679
finally

694
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,679
you know settled on agreement on some of

695
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,240
the the taxes that we were seeing in

696
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,400
here

697
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,960
i don't know that i slept for about a

698
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,759
week because i was just in shock

699
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,519
this meadow in certain areas had become

700
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:03,759
completely overrun

701
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:05,519
by invasive grasses largely

702
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:07,759
sweet vernal grass and creeping bent

703
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,158
grass although a few others

704
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,960
so well the photo on the left may look

705
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,760
quite pretty

706
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,159
oh look a meadow with some canvas in it

707
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:16,240
that

708
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,080
sort of burgundy grass that you see is

709
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,480
sweet vernal grass and you can see that

710
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:22,000
is

711
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:25,919
almost all that's left in some instances

712
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,720
95 cover and sweet vernal grass is

713
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,038
incredibly allelopathic so it's actively

714
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,000
suppressing the growth and regeneration

715
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:34,720
of the native plants that were in here

716
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,880
um

717
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,360
and tackling this meadow is a bit of a

718
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,240
challenge because here at ubc we don't

719
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:44,000
use

720
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,240
um any herbicides pesticides this is a

721
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,159
garden-wide mandate

722
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,839
and so typically in a in a meadow

723
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,320
restoration you

724
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,519
in a in a situation like this you'd go

725
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,319
in and you'd apply

726
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:58,319
glyphosate a couple of times and

727
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:00,960
basically start from scratch

728
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:01,678
however um we've just been marching

729
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,240
ahead with

730
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,278
um basically digging this meadow out

731
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,000
over a series of three years

732
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:12,000
all is not lost though um there were

733
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
sections of our meadow that were still

734
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,240
intact and so this is what this meadow

735
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,599
looks like in the spring it's incredibly

736
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:22,880
rich with ephemeral plants

737
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:25,839
again mentioning that it's a dry

738
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,840
summer area and as much as our region is

739
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:31,199
a temperate rainforest we do experience

740
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:33,038
a very significant summer drought

741
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,720
and this meadow is totally adapted for

742
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:35,919
it so in spring you have all these

743
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,558
ephemerals that

744
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,559
come up a lot of geophytes bulbs things

745
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:42,158
like that but also annual plants they

746
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,158
put on this tremendous show

747
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,520
and then by mid-summer the garden is

748
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,159
going dormant

749
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,038
and we were able to identify through our

750
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,559
inventory

751
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:52,720
areas in this garden that remained

752
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:55,759
intact so on the left is actually

753
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,519
the garden at ubc on the right is a gary

754
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,480
oak meadow out on vancouver island i

755
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:00,240
visited

756
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,960
and you can see that there are still a

757
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,880
lot of similarities

758
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,399
and we did have these pockets that we

759
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,760
could pull from

760
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:09,519
and so what we've been doing is

761
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,519
propagating those plants

762
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:13,599
and as we march the meadow renovation

763
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:16,480
forward reintroducing

764
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,678
uh plants from those original accessions

765
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,839
that remain

766
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,440
again it's a lot of work but totally

767
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:24,398
worth it because this garden is

768
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,200
locally endangered checks all our boxes

769
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:27,839
from our mission

770
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,000
in terms of conservation supporting

771
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,678
scientific research research

772
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,960
education to the public we have a

773
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,600
tremendous amount of interpretive

774
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,759
signage in this garden

775
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:39,038
and as well as display it is absolutely

776
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,720
breathtaking

777
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:43,278
in the display that happens in this

778
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,000
garden and it's it's working on the

779
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:46,640
right is an

780
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,440
area that was renovated two years ago

781
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,759
and

782
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,600
uh what we see here is actually more

783
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,038
indicative of what these meadows would

784
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:54,959
look like these are

785
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:57,519
the grasses the good guys that should be

786
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,840
here a mix of annual and perennial

787
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:00,960
forbs and growing in and amongst those

788
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:03,199
grasses

789
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,159
and now that we've been able to rid

790
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,319
ourselves of those

791
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,159
allelopathic grasses these plants are

792
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:09,038
actually seeding themselves back into

793
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,600
the garden

794
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:13,038
so no shortage of hard work but a

795
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:16,398
complete success story

796
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:18,879
and and one i'm quite proud of

797
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:19,439
and as i mentioned the gary oak meadows

798
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,278
are

799
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,038
a threatened ecosystem here and there

800
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:23,519
are a number of endangered plants that

801
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:25,440
we have

802
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:26,639
in this garden these are just a few of

803
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,080
them

804
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,320
some of them are quite showy and

805
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:32,319
charismatic you know in the center

806
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:35,839
are a couple of our less charismatic

807
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:37,918
ones a sedge carrots tumula cola

808
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:39,278
and camisolemia contorted a little

809
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,559
yellow flower that's

810
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:43,839
a few millimeters across so not all of

811
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:45,440
our conservation

812
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:47,199
plants you would even notice when you

813
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,080
walk through this garden but it's

814
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,200
loaded with them all of these plants

815
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,439
that you see here though

816
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,840
are secure throughout the southern

817
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,960
portion of this range of the gary oak

818
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,678
meadow

819
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,200
however uh one particular plant that i'm

820
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,640
particularly interested in in this

821
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,519
meadow and that we've been successful

822
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,679
with

823
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:08,398
is called golden paintbrush and so this

824
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,798
is a plant called castella levasecta

825
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,719
castellaia are in the orobank ac family

826
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:17,119
and it's a family of plants that are

827
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:19,600
largely parasitic or hemi parasitic

828
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:22,158
castella levasecta is a hemi-parasitic

829
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:24,879
plant so it parasitizes other plants

830
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,159
but also produces chlorophyll so it can

831
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,440
self-sustain

832
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,320
but does much better if it has host

833
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,759
plants

834
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:36,879
castellaia are notoriously difficult to

835
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:38,960
propagate and then even more so

836
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,480
cultivate in a garden setting they're

837
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,120
one of those things that people always

838
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,640
say best

839
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:46,079
left in the wild don't even try um

840
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,320
but we've been trying here and we've had

841
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:49,839
a lot of success uh so castella

842
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:52,319
lovasecta

843
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:54,158
been able to propagate a few hundred of

844
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:55,918
these quite successfully with a few

845
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,720
different hosts you can see it on the

846
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:02,080
left it's growing with a native fescue

847
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,000
um and we also grow it with a few

848
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:05,839
crassula seed plants

849
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,398
and we've now planted these out into the

850
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:10,240
meadow for a second year now and we're

851
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:13,678
seeing about a 60

852
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,079
65 success rate which by all accounts is

853
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:19,360
very very good for this plant

854
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:22,398
so a bit of a success story here and

855
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:24,398
unlike the plants in the previous slide

856
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:26,719
this is a plant that is not only at risk

857
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:28,798
here in bc and canada at a national

858
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,600
level but is globally endangered

859
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:32,639
extremely limited range on this plant in

860
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,558
the wild

861
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,000
and the same threats that face the gary

862
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:37,759
oak meadows here

863
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
in british columbia are present

864
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:42,000
throughout the rest of this plant's

865
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,919
range to the south

866
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,359
i've been very fortunate to work with

867
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,519
some local

868
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:50,158
recovery teams who have supplied us with

869
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,880
high quality

870
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,159
known provenance seeds so we can grow

871
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,559
plants that are

872
00:31:54,159 --> 00:32:00,799
legitimately of conservation value for

873
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:02,960
this endangered species

874
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:04,558
and finally we're in the home stretch

875
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,038
we're about to cross the finish line as

876
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:09,759
we run the 350 meters

877
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:11,278
we're going to end off in the carolinian

878
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:14,558
forest garden

879
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:16,798
um this is a garden that

880
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:19,440
might be confusing to to many of you you

881
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:23,038
know is this the flora of the carolinas

882
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:26,320
specifically what is the carolinian um

883
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:29,599
the carolinian forest zone is

884
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:32,798
largely a canadian term it originated

885
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:35,759
uh from some plant biologists and

886
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:37,359
silviculturists um back in the 18th and

887
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:40,640
early 1900s

888
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:41,599
and it was a term used to describe a

889
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,038
very distinct

890
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:46,480
forest system that shows up just in

891
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:48,158
southern ontario

892
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,079
so if you're familiar with the area on

893
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:54,240
the top left

894
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:56,079
you see that there's this sweeping line

895
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,679
that says northern limit of the

896
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:59,759
carolinian zone

897
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,080
and it kind of sweeps from north of

898
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:05,679
toronto down towards london

899
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:08,839
and over to grand bend very very limited

900
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:12,000
distribution of this forest type in

901
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:14,480
canada and uh also

902
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,640
if you think about the development in

903
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,278
canada and particularly in ontario

904
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,880
this is also the most densely populated

905
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:24,398
and heavily human impacted

906
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,640
region in our country

907
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:28,079
so there's a lot of parallels between

908
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,399
this

909
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:31,839
this forest and the gary oak meadows in

910
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:35,038
terms of

911
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:35,678
national plant conservation northern

912
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:38,879
range

913
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,519
conservation and education around human

914
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,880
impact

915
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:45,759
in the landscape

916
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,240
the the photo on the left bottom does

917
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:49,200
show

918
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,359
that that light sort of lime green color

919
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,120
is the eastern deciduous forest

920
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:54,719
and that's really what you probably

921
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:58,479
would know the carolinian as

922
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,278
so uh an ecosystem and a forest type

923
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,079
that does

924
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:04,000
have a much larger range uh and a number

925
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:06,798
of the plants that we grow here

926
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,200
are very abundant um south of the border

927
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:10,159
but

928
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,519
quite rare from a national perspective

929
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,280
again a similarity

930
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:17,358
with this garden and the gary oak meadow

931
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,720
is the biodiversity here is extremely

932
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:23,838
high from a national level

933
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,959
the you can see just how limited that

934
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:28,078
range is

935
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:31,358
but half of canada's tree species grow

936
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:34,399
in that range and over half of

937
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:35,440
its vascular plant species so all the

938
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:38,319
grasses

939
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,398
and forbs and things like that over half

940
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,280
of our national plant biodiversity can

941
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:43,358
be found

942
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,359
growing in these forests despite their

943
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:47,279
extremely limited range

944
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:49,039
and on the right is typically what this

945
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,240
forest looks like in the wild i was

946
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:52,878
fortunate to grow up

947
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:55,039
in this forest when dawn mentioned i

948
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:57,279
spent my youth exploring the forest and

949
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:59,679
propagating plants from

950
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,280
my local surroundings this was the

951
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:04,559
forest i was trekking through

952
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,040
so i was very happy when i arrived here

953
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:10,480
to find that a little piece of home also

954
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:13,519
met me here on the west coast

955
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,800
and this garden is

956
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:18,079
also about 12 13 years old so not the

957
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,800
oldest not the youngest

958
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,920
and this is what it looks like right now

959
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,119
as you know

960
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,880
probably the the most well-known aspect

961
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,160
of the eastern deciduous forest is its

962
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,480
fall color

963
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,719
i have to say that we don't get the fall

964
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,039
color here in vancouver that

965
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:37,118
we get back in the east even though

966
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:39,838
we're growing the same plants

967
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,960
and i think that's largely um climactic

968
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:43,599
we don't get those

969
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,000
wild swings between cold cold nights and

970
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,440
warm

971
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,119
days that would very quickly break down

972
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:53,838
chlorophyll um but we do get some nice

973
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,760
fall color and then again this is the

974
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:58,639
shot of that garden you can see some

975
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,480
lovely light coming in however there

976
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:01,598
wasn't always lovely light coming in

977
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,960
when i arrived

978
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,880
in this garden it was

979
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,960
obvious to me that a number of trees

980
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,039
need to be cut down so because we don't

981
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,880
use

982
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:16,320
herbicides here when this garden was

983
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,559
created it was put on top of

984
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,000
what used to be sort of weedy herbaceous

985
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:21,599
ornamental beds

986
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,599
and those plants were dug out but a

987
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,880
number of them were very

988
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,800
aggressive and there were a number of

989
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,720
persistent perennial weeds so the

990
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,240
decision was made to plant this garden

991
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:33,679
extremely densely with

992
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,399
large stature trees in an effort to

993
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:37,039
shade out

994
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,160
those uh weeds which is part of an

995
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:43,358
integrated pest management plan when you

996
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:46,159
don't use herbicides

997
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:47,199
however these trees were not thinned as

998
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:49,519
they grew and so

999
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:51,199
the first few months that i was here i

1000
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:52,000
did a quick assessment and in my first

1001
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:54,639
winter

1002
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,639
we actually removed something like 85

1003
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:58,639
trees from this garden and i'm pretty

1004
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:00,719
sure it raised a few eyebrows like did

1005
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:01,039
we hire the wrong guy why is he cutting

1006
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,239
down

1007
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:05,838
our garden um but it was a decision that

1008
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:07,598
needed to be made because these trees

1009
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:08,000
are growing extremely fast in our

1010
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,160
climate

1011
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
much faster than they would back east

1012
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:14,399
and we were getting to this crucial

1013
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,280
point where

1014
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,440
if we let them live any longer they

1015
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,200
would become complicated removals based

1016
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,838
on their size and proximity to one

1017
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:23,838
another

1018
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,000
but the the result is that the remaining

1019
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,480
trees

1020
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
have responded exceptionally well and

1021
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,400
some of those trees are extremely

1022
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,880
important to us here at ubc

1023
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,079
um ubc botanical garden is part of the

1024
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,200
plant collections network

1025
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:43,119
and for magnolias and and maples

1026
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:44,799
uh cordell botanic garden is part of

1027
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,800
this group for the maples

1028
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,280
and and as a result of some of that

1029
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,079
thinning a number of our

1030
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,680
key accessions have done extremely well

1031
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,280
and responded well to

1032
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:57,199
increased light and increased air

1033
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,680
circulation

1034
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:01,919
a couple of super charismatic plants

1035
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,039
here magnolia macrophylla and magnolia

1036
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,838
virginiana

1037
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:07,599
are amongst our magnolia collections and

1038
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:10,639
the photo on the left is not

1039
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,559
a trick of the eye these these flowers

1040
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:16,000
are up to a foot across

1041
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:20,078
and and just incredibly showy plants

1042
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,320
i know there was one of these outside um

1043
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,240
the offices at cornell botanic garden

1044
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,519
that unfortunately came down while i was

1045
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:28,799
a student due to

1046
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:31,119
i think structural concerns um

1047
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,920
so i hope that the garden is considering

1048
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,760
having

1049
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,079
another in its collections because

1050
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,800
they're wonderful plants

1051
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,400
and also through the thinning we managed

1052
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,480
to be able to successfully grow plants

1053
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,720
in the understory so previously

1054
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,320
light was not coming through this forest

1055
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:47,919
after the clearing the

1056
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,559
shrub layer in the understory has

1057
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:53,119
responded incredibly well

1058
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:55,119
rhododendrons that previously bloomed

1059
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,960
only moderately have now

1060
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,440
decided to put on a riot of color in the

1061
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,159
spring this is rhododendron vasii

1062
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,800
another of

1063
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:05,118
our threatened plants this one's

1064
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,920
globally threatened and we have

1065
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,039
four accessions represented by 30 some

1066
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,960
odd plants

1067
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:14,880
all of known wild provenance

1068
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,720
conservation value aside this is just a

1069
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,559
spectacularly gorgeous plant

1070
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:20,159
um that blooms in the early spring

1071
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:21,039
before any of the leaves come out you

1072
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:24,799
see these

1073
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:24,800
pink puffballs in the landscape

1074
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:29,358
and then also with with the increased

1075
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:31,039
light we can now grow plants in the

1076
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:32,000
understory that are herbaceous

1077
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:34,079
previously

1078
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
this garden was too shady and too dense

1079
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,519
to really support these plants

1080
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,440
and really this is where a lot of the

1081
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:42,400
magic happens in this garden

1082
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,119
um the spring ephemerals that occur in

1083
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,079
the

1084
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,640
woods around campus if you think about

1085
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:51,920
how rich and beautiful that scene is

1086
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:53,440
we are now able to create that here and

1087
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,880
so i've been working very hard over the

1088
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,280
last few years

1089
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:01,440
to create that with a lot of success

1090
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,680
and i just wanted to show you how we

1091
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,240
create that so i'm fortunate

1092
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:07,279
that a number of our volunteers and our

1093
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:10,479
friends of the garden

1094
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,160
support me financially to do wild plant

1095
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,838
collecting and this is very important

1096
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,799
for our garden in terms of meeting our

1097
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:18,480
mission

1098
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:21,359
of curating a collection of

1099
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,240
known provenance wild collected material

1100
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:24,000
and so this is

1101
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:26,399
probably you know the highlight of my

1102
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,400
job there are bugs everywhere i get

1103
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,119
soakers i get banged up but it's

1104
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,920
incredibly

1105
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,880
rewarding to go out on these trips and

1106
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,838
collect plants

1107
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,280
uh to bring them back for our garden and

1108
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:40,880
it takes me everywhere from

1109
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:44,000
lakeside to forest to dry interior

1110
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,480
to alpine mountain tops and this is

1111
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,599
really

1112
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,358
um a crucial part of my job it seems

1113
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,000
like

1114
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:53,838
you know this would be minor but there

1115
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,920
aren't a lot of opportunities for

1116
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:57,759
wild collected seed available to me

1117
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,800
unless i do collecting

1118
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,640
um so a crucial part of what i do and

1119
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,240
that's largely how i build my

1120
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:08,639
collections here

1121
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:11,118
at ubc and so that's been a 350

1122
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:12,400
meter walk across north america and some

1123
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,640
of the exciting plants

1124
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,240
and plant communities and i encourage

1125
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,920
you all to

1126
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:19,759
get out into your local forest and

1127
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,838
appreciate them

1128
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,920
as well as come visit us at ubc if you

1129
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:26,400
can and at this point i'd like to

1130
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,318
thank cornell university for the years

1131
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,760
that i spent there the friendships and

1132
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:32,318
knowledge that i gained

1133
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,200
i'd also like to thank um cows in

1134

leadership

1137
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,838
program and to cornell botanic gardens

1138
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,400
for also making that possible i wouldn't

1139
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:45,920
be where i am without it and a special

1140
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,400

pictured here she's the one who reached

1143
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,440
out to me initially

1144
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,519

appreciated ben

1152
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,280
that you spoke not only about the

1153
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,920
horticultural considerations of the

1154
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,040
plants

1155
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:21,159
in your collections but also the

1156
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:25,039
botanical and biogeographic

1157
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:28,879
considerations so absolutely fabulous

1158
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:28,880
and i will now

1159
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:33,679

1162
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:38,960
feature

1163
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,760
where i believe that there is at least

1164
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,760
one question

1165
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:47,118
all right okay i've got the chat window

1166
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:47,119
open now

1167
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:55,440
uh okay so um um wreck beach i'm just

1168
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,159
going to address that first it is

1169
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,280
actually

1170
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:00,960
right across the road from us yeah so uh

1171
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,560
a number of our staff at the end of a

1172
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,920
hot day in august will head straight

1173
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:06,078
down to the beach

1174
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,280
um is prescribed there's a question is

1175
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,280
prescribed uh

1176
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,079
controlled fire used as a management

1177
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:15,040
tool um

1178
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,160
it is not um it's something that i would

1179
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:19,119
like to do

1180
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:21,519
from a demonstration perspective however

1181
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:24,559
in our gary oak meadow our

1182
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:26,639
our largest issue right now are the the

1183
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:28,480
grasses and the grasses we're dealing

1184
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:31,519
with are also fire adapted

1185
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,679
so it would be a tool that we could use

1186
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:34,559
if we got into situations where we were

1187
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:37,118
seeing

1188
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:37,679
um woody plants moving in and that sort

1189
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,200
of thing but

1190
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:44,639
right now burning that meadow would

1191
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:46,879
not actively solve too much of

1192
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:48,078
the the issue that we're dealing with

1193
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,440
however

1194
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,800
um i'm glad you mentioned fire because

1195
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,760
the gary oak meadows

1196
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,280
as they exist were also extremely

1197
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,920
important to the local indigenous

1198
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,119
cultures

1199
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:03,358
and they persist not only because of the

1200
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,318
soils and the exposure in the climate

1201
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:08,639
but also because

1202
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:12,079
of a history of prescribed burn by the

1203
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:13,920
local indigenous cultures to keep the

1204
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,000
the area open because a number of very

1205
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,358
important food and medicine plants

1206
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,358
grow in that ecosystem so in the wild

1207
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:22,159
fire is actually an incredibly important

1208
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:26,078
part

1209
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:28,399
of of that that ecosystem

1210
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,119
in our garden management not so much

1211
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,440
it's also

1212
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,960
very difficult to set any part of the

1213
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,119
campus on fire

1214
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,000
and the rules and regulations around

1215
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:40,079
that are are

1216
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,079
very very tight

1217
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:44,399
and i invite uh any of the other

1218
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:47,119
participants to

1219
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:50,079
unmute themselves if they do have a

1220
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:53,680
question for ben

1221
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:56,318
let me ask a question um

1222
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:57,679
the various collections that you showed

1223
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:00,960
us

1224
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:04,318
are more what i would refer to

1225
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:07,519
as naturalistic rather than

1226
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:10,719
highly designed how do you

1227
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:13,838
interpret them for the public so that

1228
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:16,000
visitors can appreciate these as

1229
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:19,039
horticultural collections

1230
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,639
and not as what you were saying just

1231
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:22,400
parks

1232
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:24,799
yeah it's a very good question and it is

1233
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,838
definitely one of our challenges i mean

1234
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:31,680
the whole of ubc botanic garden um

1235
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:34,159
by and large is focused on

1236
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:35,279
plants as they would occur in a natural

1237
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:38,480
way

1238
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,640
we do have some uh more formal spaces a

1239
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,800
physic garden and a food garden and

1240
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:44,000
a sort of an events lawn with a more

1241
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,240
traditional

1242
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,119
perennial border and that sort of thing

1243
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:50,799
um

1244
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:54,160
one of the things that we try and do is

1245
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:58,079
we luckily had an interpretive

1246
00:45:54,159 --> 00:46:01,519
plan developed three years ago

1247
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:04,560
now that involved a number of

1248
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:06,880
very large well-designed information

1249
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:08,159
boards to help people understand what it

1250
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,039
was that they were seeing

1251
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:11,679
so in front of strategic locations or

1252
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:14,400
strategic

1253
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:14,879
plants or plantings talking about the

1254
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,680
plants

1255
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:22,480
that they're seeing we also

1256
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:23,440
through our database we use a data

1257
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:27,599
behind all of this

1258
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:29,280
as a custom database called iris bg

1259
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,519
which is a software that was developed

1260
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:35,040
specifically for managing

1261
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:38,400
botanic collections and through that

1262
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:39,279
we have launched a garden explorer so

1263
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,400
people can go

1264
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,800
on this app and look for

1265
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,920
particular plants or based on the area

1266
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,039
that they're standing in

1267
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,440
know what plants are around them

1268
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:52,719
and we've also designed through that a

1269
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,000
number of specific

1270
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:58,078
tours that our guests can take

1271
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,039
that we'll take them around to specific

1272
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,400
plants

1273
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:04,960
um and yeah we try and make sure that

1274
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,200
all of our collections are accurately

1275
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,240
labeled but particularly those that are

1276
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:11,279
along those

1277
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:14,719
predetermined earth

1278
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,760
any final questions for ben ah here we

1279
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:20,719
go from

1280
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:24,480
raleigh ah yes okay

1281
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:26,399
so uh

1282
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,519
he's mentioning that we have a canopy

1283
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,920
walk here

1284
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:31,679
in the garden it's actually not in my

1285
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,318
rainforest garden it's in the asian

1286
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:34,799
garden

1287
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:35,519
and our asian garden um is planted

1288
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,480
amongst an

1289
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:40,159
intact uh coastal rainforest and you can

1290
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,559
go up through the canopy

1291
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:44,480
and one of the things that we do get

1292
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,119
here even though i was saying that we

1293
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,599
don't get

1294
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,400
as lush and moss sort of diversity

1295
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,039
hanging from

1296
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,200
branches and things like that in our

1297
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:55,759
asian garden in particular because it's

1298
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:56,639
has an irrigation system and and higher

1299
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,079
humidity

1300
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:03,519
we do get epiphytes growing so um

1301
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:07,039
various bryophytes in the canopy and

1302
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:11,280
a few fern species by and large

1303
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:14,558
um the canopy itself

1304
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:18,079
isn't sort of actively managed in that

1305
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:21,040
garden space beyond the way that it

1306
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,760
impacts the asian plant collections

1307
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:25,279
below

1308
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,880
so decisions are made about removals and

1309
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,079
thinning and planting

1310
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:33,039
of the overstory but it's largely

1311
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:34,000
in a way or decisions made about the

1312
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:38,880
impact that would have

1313
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,880
on the asian plants that grow beneath

1314
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,679
and to the best of my knowledge there

1315
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:46,800
haven't been any active studies

1316
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:48,799
up in that canopy

1317
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,000
we do engage with researchers from the

1318
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,519
university

1319
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,440
um but largely

1320
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:57,039
the the research that happens here is

1321
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,159
driven by the interests of

1322
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:01,519
of the labs on campus so we provide what

1323
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:04,318
we can based on

1324
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:06,400
what they need as opposed to actively

1325
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:09,358
sort of directing that research so

1326
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,880
if if people on campus aren't interested

1327
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:13,679
in studying it we actually don't have

1328
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:16,000
the capacity in our staff

1329
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:19,039
to study it our involvement in research

1330
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:23,119
is to supply material to researchers

1331
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:23,119
as opposed to in-house research

1332
00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:30,159
unfortunately we have run out of time

1333
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:33,919
so i want to again thank ben

1334
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:37,039
for an intriguing and information

1335
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,838
filled presentation thank you so much

1336
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:41,519
ben

1337
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:44,159
we are sorry that you can't be with us

1338
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:46,480
in person but look forward to seeing you

1339
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:48,960
again sometime in the future

1340
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,519
i look forward to visiting thanks don

1341
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,720
okay

1342
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:52,719
bye bye now bye

1343
