1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,399
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,399
university

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,559
thanks for having me i really appreciate

4
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:11,599
a chance to come up here i've been

5
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:12,638
enjoying

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,960
the last couple years i've been

7
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,640
collaborating a bunch with the ryan lab

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,560
and so that's been a lot of fun and a

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,439
lot of interesting research thrusts and

10
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:23,439
and so today's talk is to give you a

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,000
little bit of a taste of of some of the

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,839
work we're doing in beltsville uh

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,320
particularly in the development of of

14
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:33,280
high residue no-till grain production

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,640
systems uh we'll give you a a taste of

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,239
what's going on down there try to link

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,320
it to some of the things that are going

18
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,159
on up here uh reality is obviously we

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,759
have some climatic differences so we

20
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,279
have a little more flexibility in

21
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,199
maryland with some of the work we do

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,120
with corn particularly

23
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,000
so that's kind of why i focused on corn

24
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:49,919
was because i think that would be a

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,759
little bit something new for you guys in

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,320
in this department uh these high residue

27
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,599
no-till corn production systems where i

28
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,280
i take it you probably hear a lot about

29
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,520
soybeans

30
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,600
so this is an ambitious title and like

31
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,280
in every ambitious title not everything

32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,760
in the title might be in the

33
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,920
presentation so there's a few little

34
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,640
missing details just because uh uh i

35
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,760
wanted to kind of uh cover a wide swath

36
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,280
of things so so you know not everything

37
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,359
in the talk is going to cover

38
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,719
conventional and organic in fact most of

39
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,478
it is going to be around conventional

40
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,560
systems and i'll try to make some

41
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,959
linkages to the implications in organic

42
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,960
as well

43
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,200
so this is really what's been driving

44
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,359
conservation for so long now right the

45
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,040
dust bowl came and since then there's

46
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:36,078
been just a suite of various different

47
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,240
strategies uh in agriculture to to

48
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,199
conserve soil resources and and this is

49
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,438
an

50
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,759
ongoing dialogue for some time now

51
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:46,319
certainly uh no-till agriculture has

52
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,519
been one of the dominant strategies to

53
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,599
address uh soil erosion and and and to

54
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,920
conserve those soil resources

55
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,438
organic agriculture has its own paradigm

56
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,960
in which it tries to address soil

57
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,519
conservation in the building of soil

58
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,280
health as well and and so there's this

59
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,959
kind of linkage between these two

60
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,519
systems in that they're both very soil

61
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,438
centric and soil management centric uh

62
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,359
no-till being this cadillac in in

63
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,560
reducing erosion

64
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,360
from the standpoint of you know

65
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,400
improving you know water infiltration

66
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,640
uh increasing uh soil organic matter uh

67
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,560
again reducing the erosion and obviously

68
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,399
why one of the reasons this has taken

69
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,640
off so dramatically and this is just a

70
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,080
distribution of of no-till ground in the

71
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,238
country and

72
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,080
this is 30 for the mid-south so this is

73
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,319
30 and these regions here are 25 to 30

74
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,840
percent reason this has taken off so

75
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,079
rapidly

76
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,479
is because farmers can dramatically save

77
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,719
the amount of time the amount of labor

78
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,719
uh they can cover fields really rapidly

79
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,080
with machinery they're not you know

80
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,680
they're not running machinery through

81
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,239
the soil and so that's certainly been a

82
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,080
huge advantage but there's there's a

83
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,159
challenges associated with no-till

84
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,319
agriculture

85
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,840
um if you look at this fig this uh map

86
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:59,679
here this is a map of herbicide

87
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,120
resistance you know so this is

88
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,239
particularly glyphosate resistant

89
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,640
species across the us and well in

90
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,959
actually part of canada and if you look

91
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,559
this tracks pretty closely to the areas

92
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,640
that are dominated by no-till

93
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,598
agriculture right so so there's this

94
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,439
paradox in in our management between

95
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:21,679
practices that really conserve our soil

96
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:24,079
resources uh with practices that

97
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,319
result in some new challenges and some

98
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,239
new management constraints and so while

99
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:30,158
we're really excited what we can do with

100
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,840
no-till agriculture

101
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:35,199
herbicide resistance for example has

102
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,719
really challenged our current world view

103
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,518
when it comes to no-till agriculture and

104
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,120
so how do we address that and and and

105
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,480
and look at you can just see the rise

106
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,439
over the years and they might have

107
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,359
unique cases of herbicide resistance so

108
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,719
it's it's a it's a real issue for

109
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,360
conventional agriculture and in the

110
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:54,000
state of in organic agriculture weeds

111
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,080
are also a real problem in that system

112
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,080
and and particularly as organic

113
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,239
producers who historically have not been

114
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,239
reduced till or no start to try to

115
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,480
reduce tillage in their systems weeds

116
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,158
become even more problematic so weeds

117
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,479
really are at the center of this

118
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:11,438
challenge in conserving soil resources

119
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,280
and both of these types of systems

120
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:16,000
so the typical approach right is to

121
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,519
diversify our chemistries stack genes

122
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,040
that's kind of historically how we try

123
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,439
to address resistance and that's

124
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,960
certainly a very important aspect of

125
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,199
weed control and moving forward with

126
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,638
herbicide resistance issues but there's

127
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,800
other strategies there's a lot of folks

128
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,560
emphasizing integrated weed management

129
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,520
practices and this is by no means a

130
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,360
laundry list but it gives you a some

131
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,758
sample of the types of practices that we

132
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,560
target to

133
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,960
both

134
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,800
address we concerns in the system while

135
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,799
trying to conserve some of these

136
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,800
practices like no-till agriculture and

137
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,800
so the remainder of my talk is really

138
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,000
going to focus on these types of

139
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,960
practices and how we can particularly

140
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,199
manipulate cover crops in the system to

141
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,039
you know enable us to continue towards

142
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,560
these uh no these goals with soul

143
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,800
conservation and no-till agriculture

144
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,439
of course no talk would be complete

145
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,879
without mentioning cover crops without

146
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,800
going through all the list of services

147
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,240
that they provide certainly not a

148
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,759
laundry list but

149
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,720
there's a wide range of services that

150
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,639
cover crops provide they're

151
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,520
multifunctional tools and that's why

152
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,918
they fit well into kind of these

153
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:25,279
no-till systems or as a way of kind of

154
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:27,038
helping to inhibit or suppress weeds

155
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,519
as well as provide another number of

156
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,360
services in the system

157
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,879
so this is what we've been focusing on

158
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,879
for a number of years and when i say we

159
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,399
really this has been a collective effort

160
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,159
for some time now

161
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,159
folks throughout the whole mid-atlantic

162
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,080
and northeast region have had a really

163
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,840
great synergy and interactions and the

164
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,478
development of these high-residue

165
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,560
no-till systems many folks at cornell

166
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,399
have been key players and this certainly

167
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,839
i know a big influence to everything

168
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,959
i've done in these systems and all the

169
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,359
work that we've done over the years have

170
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,439
really come from chuck's early work with

171
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,360
john teasdale and all of those uh

172
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,839
questions they asked related to how

173
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,160
different mulch elements suppress weeds

174
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,519
and so what you're seeing now is kind of

175
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,120
where we've been taking that work and

176
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,599
how we've been trying to operationalize

177
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,079
that into production grain production

178
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,560
systems and so we've been historically

179
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,560
using a lot of rye and soybean systems

180
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,639
and hairy vetch and corn

181
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,360
this varies there's a lot of interest in

182
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,439
other cereals and other legumes for a

183
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,600
number of reasons but i'm going to just

184
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,680
focus on these these two cover crops

185
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,879
today and looking at them as in

186
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,240
monoculture and in mixture

187
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,000
most of you are probably familiar with

188
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,000
this piece of equipment at this point by

189
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,399
now and this is simply a tool that has

190
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,879
helped really operationalize our ability

191
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,719
to do uh uh

192
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,439
high residue no-till production systems

193
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,520
with cover crops because it's a way of

194
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:50,240
rapidly knocking down cover crops and

195
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,918
enabling us to plant cash crops behind

196
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,000
that and whether or not you're spraying

197
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,478
your cover crop and then rolling it down

198
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,240
to make a mulch that suppresses weeds or

199
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:00,478
whether you're killing it

200
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,160
effectively with the roller crimper in

201
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,000
an organic system both have the same

202
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,880
implications in the standpoint of of

203
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,879
creating this this uniform uh mulch mat

204
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,079
and this just gives you a a taste of

205
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,519
what some of this looks like and and and

206
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,839
the kind of residues that we're working

207
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,839
with

208
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,400
so what i'd like to first do is talk a

209
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:23,839
little bit about the equipment end of

210
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,918
things that's really where a lot of the

211
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:26,719
learning has been over the last decade

212
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,839
we've

213
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,759
implemented a host of biological studies

214
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:34,159
looking at interactions between weeds

215
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,479
and cover crops and cover crops and

216
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,039
fertility management but one of the the

217
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,560
constraints that's really

218
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:42,079
made it difficult for us to take this

219
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,000
from something that we're evaluating on

220
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,318
a research station to recommending to

221
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,439
producers is our ability to get

222
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,080
uniform populations of our crops in the

223
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,598
field and regardless of the conditions

224
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,598
of the cover crop and so i'm just going

225
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,759
to briefly review some of those

226
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:59,680
approaches

227
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,120
so we we certainly find planters to be

228
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,319
much more effective than drills you have

229
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,639
less steel that's going through the

230
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,120
field and so you you can get better

231
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,038
downward pressure and and the planter

232
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,639
certainly has better simulation of seed

233
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,478
and placement of that seed and so that's

234
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,160
been a big step forward for us we're

235
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,318
early years we're focusing on drills

236
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,639
particularly with soybeans

237
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,800
soil moisture content and weight is a

238
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,360
huge component of the efficacy of our

239
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,120
ability to cut residue and get seed into

240
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,879
the ground and so that's something that

241
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,199
we've looked at a lot over the years

242
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,039
when the residue is too wet sometimes

243
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,879
it's hard to to cut and it can get

244
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,718
pushed down into the ground and that

245
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,439
particularly applies to the soil if the

246
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,519
soil is is really wet then it's not firm

247
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,760
enough to provide that resistance to get

248
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,599
good cutting action with our coulters

249
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,120
and so there we don't get good cutting

250
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,959
of the residue when you don't cut the

251
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,959
residue the planter just rides up on the

252
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,799
ground and you deliver a nice row of

253
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:53,199
seeds all along the surface of the

254
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:56,000
ground and you don't get your crops so

255
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,160
this is a real big issue

256
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,519
uh residue quality i just mentioned a

257
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,079
little bit about that so we've been

258
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,320
playing a lot with timing of rolling

259
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,639
with timing of planting and the

260
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,920
combinations of those practices i'm not

261
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:09,838
really going to focus a lot on that in

262
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:11,199
this talk but we have a number of papers

263
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,720
over the years that have come out to it

264
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,640
that have addressed that issue and we

265
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,959
feel like we have a better handle now on

266
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,799
just the the interaction between when we

267
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,879
kill and when we plant and what the

268
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:23,278
residue quality needs to be and what the

269
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,200
soil conditions need to be

270
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:27,679
colder types generally we've been

271
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,440
focusing mostly with on on using these

272
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,838
type of ripple or bubble cultures

273
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,320
anything that has a wavy fluted edge on

274
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,839
it just creates more surface area to go

275
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,839
through that residue and and more

276
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,920
cutting action that has to occur and so

277
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,440
there haven't been really effective uh

278
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,919
folks like these different bubble or

279
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,480
ripper ripple or straight cultures for

280
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:48,319
various reasons due to soil texture and

281
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,480
and and uh what they're doing in their

282
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,720
individual operations but generally you

283
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,959
want a straight edge on that end to get

284
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,639
good cutting

285
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,759
closing wheels have been another another

286
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,759
issue that we've dealt with over the

287
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,799
years and what we're moving towards is

288
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:06,399
more of these curved tines coupled with

289
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:08,399
like either cast iron or rubber uh discs

290
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,080
because we get not only better closure

291
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,919
but you get some crumbling more of the

292
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,680
soil so that you get more seed to soil

293
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,278
contact so that's kind of the name of

294
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,958
the game in this right is is both being

295
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:18,559
able to cut through the residue that's

296
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,199
goal one and then after you cut through

297
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,958
that residue being able to uh get good

298
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,759
firming and seed soil contact around

299
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,759
your crop seed

300
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:29,039
and so these are some of the new

301
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,399
planters now that we're we're working

302
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,399
with we're working with planters that

303
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,399
have trash wheels like the shark tooth

304
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,720
out the front to either

305
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,078
totally remove or just partially remove

306
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,320
the residues in the front of these

307
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:42,399
coulters and then we have these heavy

308
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,079
residue slicers that come in behind that

309
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,919
to cut that residue to make sure that

310
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,519
it's clean and then we let the normal

311
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,838
planter configurations which is back

312
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,600
here do their usual work and they're not

313
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,600
dealing with the same amount of residue

314
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,600
as these front units are and so we

315
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,440
basically add another toolbar in front

316
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,440
of our planter just to address these

317
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,440
issues

318
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,360
okay enough with the uh machinery talk

319
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,879
i'm not an ag engineer so i i don't have

320
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,079
a lot more to say about that that's some

321
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,519
of the discoveries that we've had over

322
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:11,838
the years uh we're going to talk a bit

323
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,480
more about the biology and and

324
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,720
particularly focus on

325
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,600
managing cover crops for improving

326
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,600
the

327
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,720
persistence of the residues that we have

328
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,480
out there

329
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,079
for better weed suppression and then

330
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,079
trying to improve our nutrient

331
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,000
management and that's really been the

332
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:30,239
challenge in corn with soybeans we're

333
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,759
all focused on just getting big cereals

334
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,680
out there so that we can suppress a lot

335
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:36,159
of weeds and we have a

336
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:38,399
fixing a nitrogen fixing cash crop so

337
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,319
nitrogen isn't an issue for us really

338
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,078
when we're balancing both nitrogen and

339
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,320
weeds in these systems regardless of

340
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:45,759
whether they're conventional or organic

341
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,320
that's when it becomes a bit more

342
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,319
challenging

343
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,639
and so that's why there's been a lot of

344
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,480
interest in combining cover crops you

345
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,319
know you can get the benefits of grasses

346
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,159
which are highly weed suppressive they

347
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,320
don't produce a lot of nitrogen

348
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:03,278
with legumes that do produce a lot of

349
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,240
nitrogen but are not as weed suppressive

350
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:06,720
and so

351
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,560
the focus on combining these into

352
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,040
mixtures and trying to identify what are

353
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,599
these optimal configurations depending

354
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:16,078
on your production your production goals

355
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,839
is is a big part of

356
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,919
getting optimal performance out of our

357
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,279
cover crops and having a consistency

358
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,439
from year to year

359
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,120
so uh these are the the themes that i

360
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,200
think are important to cover from your

361
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,720
ideal cover crop mixture for no-till

362
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,639
corn right we want something that is

363
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,639
going to produce a lot of biomass so

364
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,320
both it has the potential for

365
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,839
suppressing weeds but that it also

366
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,560
produces a lot of biomass and which

367
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,440
translates into more nitrogen content

368
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,119
that it you know slow res residue decay

369
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,200
which also translates into better

370
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,759
synchrony of the release of that

371
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,120
nitrogen with crop uptake and so i'm

372
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,639
going to kind of cover these different

373
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,639
themes now in the next set of slides

374
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,760
so this is an experiment which we

375
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,759
establish and we've had about four years

376
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,200
of this experiment and we've conducted

377
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,919
this and we're it's done now we're not

378
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,920
it's we just finished it last year and

379
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,519
we did this on two replicated sites that

380
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:12,000
have fairly similar soil types we did

381
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,159
this on a certified organic field that's

382
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,078
been certified organic since 2000 and we

383
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,120
did it on a site that receives a lot of

384
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:19,359
the kinds of

385
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,919
diverse amendments and and cover crop

386
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,759
practicing uh has similar crop rotations

387
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,120
but is managed conventionally so they

388
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,720
have a lot of similarities in their

389
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,959
management history the commodities that

390
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,399
are in those systems like corn soybean

391
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:33,439
wheat rotation uh and and and in this in

392
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,958
this uh

393
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,839
in these two sites we created

394
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:40,879
essentially at a continuum of cover crop

395
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:43,120
uh mixture proportions so here is our

396
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,838
our cover crop mixture proportions from

397
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:50,879
a zero uh percent uh vetch all the way

398
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:52,560
to 100 veg and vice versa the 0 100

399
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,439
uh yeah i'm sorry doing that wrong here

400
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,638
so this is 100 vetch and this is 100 rye

401
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,279
and these are just

402
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,159
in a replacement series design based on

403
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,320
uh

404
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:05,439
maximum seating rates

405
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,440
of the monocultures

406
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,680
and so first let's look at some of the

407
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,078
biomass so here we these are collected

408
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,559
in half meter squared frames uh and they

409
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,479
were they're collected actually in every

410
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,000
single fertility treatment which i

411
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,680
haven't described yet so there's a whole

412
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,078
host of fertility treatments layered on

413
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,919
top of this and we took cover crop data

414
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,759
for every one of those points so our

415
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:28,240
biomass that you're looking at right now

416
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,759
is a tremendous amount of samples that

417
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,360
are in those because the fertility

418
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,039
treatments haven't been imposed yet

419
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,879
because we haven't killed the cover crop

420
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,799
uh yet but so when we're taking that

421
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,879
biomass samples we have quite a bit of

422
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,799
data that goes into these figures and so

423
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,600
what i want to introduce you to is just

424
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:45,919
a simple replacement series design where

425
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,320
you're looking at in this case a hairy

426
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:50,479
vetch cereal rye seeding rates so these

427
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,639
are our categorical treatments these are

428
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,039
actual just treatments that we imposed

429
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,198
out there and you're moving from

430
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,278
zero to a hundred percent vetch and you

431
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:01,838
can see here here's the vetch going up

432
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:04,958
here's the rye going up this direction

433
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,399
and this is the total biomass

434
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,679
so we're going to look at this in a

435
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,120
little bit more

436
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:12,719
that was exactly what i shouldn't do

437
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,720
there we go

438
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,959
um so this is a

439
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,040
a model that has had a lot of use over

440
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,559
the years to look at plant interactions

441
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,639
and plant competition it's a dewitt

442
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,319
model uh if you want more details about

443
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,720
this model you can look here i'm not

444
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,040
going to go into every aspect the nuance

445
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,120
of this model but just conveying that

446
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,838
essentially you're looking at how these

447
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,679
species perform in monoculture as as

448
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,160
compared to how they behave in mixture

449
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,719
and then the interactions of those uh

450
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,600
across these different seating rates and

451
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,120
then

452
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,759
the total model

453
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,399
represents the addition of these two

454
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,639
independent models

455
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,759
so again vetch is going up rye is going

456
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,560
to the left

457
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,879
and this is our monoculture biomass of

458
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:59,919
rye and this is our monoculture biomass

459
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,519
of etch and this solid line represents

460
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:02,958
total biomass

461
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,078
one of the reasons folks use this kind

462
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,638
of design

463
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:09,439
is because it is a useful way for

464
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,039
looking at over yielding so do the uh

465
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,600
combination of these two cover crops

466
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:16,159
produce more biomass than the sum of the

467
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,560
parts so to speak and and so there's a

468
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:20,078
lot of interest in over yielding for a

469
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,159
number of reasons and like such as in

470
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,679
polycultures inter-cropping systems and

471
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,240
in this case we're looking at it in the

472
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:28,799
case of cover crop performance

473
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,560
and so now all i've done is just taken

474
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,078
that one figure and show you the extent

475
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,399
of the data sets we have so this is the

476
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:37,758
north farm our organic site which tend

477
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,120
to have much higher uh soil fertility or

478
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,278
at least uh

479
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,360
typically does than on the south farm

480
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:46,240
which again similar soil types

481
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,560
but um uh one is conventional one is

482
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,799
organic and what you're looking at here

483
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:54,319
are uh three site years of data done

484
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:55,758
where both of these different cover

485
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,639
crops were established about very

486
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,560
similar time frame uh in in fields that

487
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,120
are not very far apart so climate is not

488
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,720
very different between these fields

489
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,279
but what i really want to cue you into

490
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,759
is just look at how strikingly different

491
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,599
the behavior of the species are like for

492
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,519
example here where harry vetch is not

493
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,038
very competitive early on and there's a

494
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:17,519
real lag and rye is extremely

495
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:19,519
competitive and dominates compared to a

496
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,679
system like this where vetch is

497
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,359
increasing biomass rapidly

498
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,839
so there's a lot of factors that go into

499
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,279
cover crop performance and i think

500
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,960
you know there's a lot of things we can

501
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,558
we can talk about in this figure the key

502
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,720
points here just that where these plus

503
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:33,839
signs are were years where we saw over

504
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,440
yielding

505
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,439
but what i really want you to queue into

506
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,038
is just how much variability there is in

507
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,400
these six site years

508
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,240
and there's a lot of factors that go

509
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,679
into cover crop performance and when

510
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,038
we're trying to get producers to use

511
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,400
cover crops

512
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:49,038
you know a big issue with using cover

513
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,720
crops is the consistency and precision

514
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:52,798
in which you can use these cover crops

515
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,519
in your production system and so part of

516
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:57,279
using mixtures is a way of kind of

517
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:58,798
reducing some of that variability

518
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,359
because of the plasticity of the two

519
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:03,359
species but even within just these two

520
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,959
species you can just see on sites that

521
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,119
tend to have a little bit more nitrogen

522
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,200
for example such as as these fields here

523
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,678
where the rye really dominated versus

524
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,160
sites that were a lower nitrogen levels

525
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:18,240
you can see big differences in just the

526
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,240
growth rates of the individual species

527
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,120
now we're taking this uh same uh

528
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,360
set of samples and we're analyzing it

529
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,119
for an uh nitrogen content and so this

530
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,038
is just one of those many site years

531
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,038
that we're just looking at

532
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:37,200
and now we're looking at total end

533
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:39,599
content we're looking at end content in

534
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,080
the veg and then content in the rye and

535
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,759
this is across this proportion gradient

536
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,519
but now whereas before we had

537
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,200
categorical treatments

538
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,038
now we're using the raw data whereas the

539
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,160
biomass that we actually harvested out

540
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:52,720
in the field

541
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,798
that just because we put out an 80 20

542
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,919
percent mix of ryan vetch doesn't mean

543
00:18:54,798 --> 00:19:00,798
we ended up with exactly an 80 20 mix so

544
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,880
this is the real distribution of

545
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:06,079
biomass in amongst those species in the

546
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,520
field and now let's kind of look at this

547
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:08,798
point here

548
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,679
you can see that and so this is

549
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:13,918
monoculture legume biomass

550
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,919
and that's how much i mean nitrogen

551
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,919
content not biomass sorry so this is how

552
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,240
much nitrogen we can produce

553
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,480
with the legume in monoculture

554
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,319
and what i want you to look at is this

555
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,720
region of missing information so this

556
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:28,399
isn't missing information this is

557
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,919
every year we put out

558
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,320
these different

559
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,720
experiments and some years

560
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:36,879
vets biomass dominated more and we were

561
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,600
able to span that region in other years

562
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,760
we didn't and you can see how how much

563
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,439
less veg biomass that we had and the raw

564
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,160
i tended to dominate

565
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,120
but what you can see is generally

566
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,080
despite that at our 50 mixtures or when

567
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,119
we start to get above a certain

568
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:55,359
threshold we notice that this solid line

569
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:58,639
that's the total nitrogen of the entire

570
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:02,159
cover crop that tends to be equivalent

571
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,919
to your legume biomass and monoculture

572
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,840
and legume nitrogen content in

573
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,799
monoculture so the idea is you're trying

574
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:10,639
to find that threshold where the end

575
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,720
content in your mixture

576
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,080
is equivalent to the end content in your

577
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,079
monoculture of your legume

578
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:22,879
and so when we look go back to this same

579
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:25,839
set of slides now here's the all six

580
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,760
site years in this data set as well as

581
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:29,599
data published data sets uh all over the

582
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,440
country we did a meta-analysis this was

583
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,918
presented at the last tri-society

584
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,679
meeting of mixtures versus monocultures

585
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,038
and the trends that we see both in our

586
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,679
data sets as well as across the

587
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:41,839
literature are some key points that uh i

588
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,840
think are worth mentioning one we

589
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:45,918
generally do see over yielding with

590
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,678
mixtures of grass legume cover crops

591
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,000
particularly in this case rye hairy

592
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,880
vetch so we do tend to get that greater

593
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
biomass production and mixture and that

594
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,559
generally when your legume

595
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,200
is 50 of the composition of the total

596
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:03,918
biomass and mixture that's when we get

597
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,360
to about that threshold in total end

598
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,600
content

599
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:10,000
and so just there alone if we're asking

600
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,240
quite if we if there's objectives with

601
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,079
having more grass in the mixture well

602
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,839
depending on what you're targeting

603
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,879
whether your nitrogen needs or weed

604
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:21,199
needs you might want to find yourself on

605
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,280
a different part of this trajectory

606
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,880
based on your your management objectives

607
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,639
so that really will depend on a given

608
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,720
farmer and so what we're trying to do is

609
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,960
just lay out the spectrum of potential

610
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,720
that's out there and and producers would

611
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,200
have to make those choices based on

612
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,720
their needs

613
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,720
and what the major factors we found

614
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,360
contributing to that uh this over

615
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,558
yielding uh are are really the

616
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:46,399
proportion of the cover crop and seeding

617
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:48,158
rate applied and gdd and what was really

618
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,400
interesting most experiments that have

619
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,159
over yielding of cover crops are not

620
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,600
when they're doing a replacement series

621
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,240
like us where we're actually decreasing

622
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:58,158
the seeding rate of one species for the

623
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,919
rate of another a lot of folks who are

624
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,440
working with mixtures are finding uh

625
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,280
this over yielding where they're having

626
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,759
higher seeding rates than what would be

627
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:06,960
the equivalent of a a one species

628
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,960
seeding rate

629
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,600
relative to the two species

630
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,440
so uh summary with those uh set of

631
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,119
figures that we looked at uh you can

632
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,679
achieve equivalent or greater biomass

633
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:21,918
than monocultures celerial rye tends to

634
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,679
dominate in our sites now maybe that's

635
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,919
because we have a history of manure

636
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,919
management a history of cover cropping

637
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,440
and soil conservation in our research

638
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,200
sites that we have a little bit higher

639
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,000
mineral mineral end than if you're going

640
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,159
to some of your sandier sites or or or

641
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,839
lower fertile sites but generally rye

642
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,840
dominates because of that excess

643
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,839
nitrogen availability and again what i

644
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:45,038
mentioned about the plateau at 50

645
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:46,000
percent hairy vetch biomass

646
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:47,679
so now

647
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,240
we follow this up with a decomposition

648
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,159
study looking at the release of

649
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,000
the decay of that cover crop biomass as

650
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,480
well as the release of nitrogen into the

651
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,960
soil and so here we're using litter bags

652
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,880
to do that and these are the proportions

653
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,720
we targeted so slightly different before

654
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,559
we were looking at six different cover

655
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,400
crop mixtures we replaced some of them

656
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:09,759
and just went to 25 75s and 50 50s

657
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,640
because it's a lot of work to do these

658
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:12,640
little bag studies

659
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,319
so i'm going to introduce you an

660
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,519
exponential decay model many of you are

661
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:19,839
familiar with this this is one of the

662
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,599
most common models that we use in

663
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:24,480
agricultural sciences for those who are

664
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,839
not uh cue into both the p and the k

665
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,599
because those are the two coefficients

666
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,839
that really that were that we're going

667
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:30,959
to be talking about quite a bit uh this

668
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:32,879
is somewhat almost of a double

669
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,640
exponential so for those of you not

670
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,960
familiar the main exponential model

671
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,440
decay models right here and this kind of

672
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,600
allows for some slower pool decay that

673
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,440
i'm not going to go into much discussion

674
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,519
about that but but just to give you a

675
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,360
little taste of folks have understanding

676
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,918
what they're looking at here if you hold

677
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,199
k constant which is our decay rate and

678
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,440
you vary p

679
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,120
this is our pool size so the the

680
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,519
distance the the difference between

681
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,439
these asymptotes represent the pool size

682
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,679
whether that's the pool of nitrogen or

683
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,200
the total amount of biomass that was

684
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,798
lost from the system

685
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,279
that's our pool size and so that's what

686
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,119
happens when you vary p when you vary k

687
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,918
that affects the shape of that decay the

688
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,759
rate of decay in in this model and so

689
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,278
what the next set of models we look at

690
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:16,480
are you're going to see differences in p

691
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:17,599
and k

692
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,519
and that's what's driving the

693
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:21,038
differences in the relationships of

694
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:24,079
these cover crop in their biomass

695
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:25,839
decomposition and then release

696
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:29,038
so here you're you're starting to get

697
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:30,558
familiar uh with uh uh the the various

698
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:32,558
different data sets we have here this is

699
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:35,359
the serial rye at the top this is hairy

700
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:37,599
vetch at the bottom so this is just

701
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:39,278
a decrease in

702
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:41,519
cereal rye and an increase in hairy

703
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:43,839
vetch as you go down and

704
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:46,798
as you'd expect as you increase hairy

705
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:48,079
vetch into the mixture you have a faster

706
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:50,879
decay rate

707
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,639
or you have a greater amount of decay

708
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,360
that mat for that matter and so what

709
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,038
we're generally seeing is an increase

710
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:58,719
as you increase hairy vetch proportion

711
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:59,679
you have an increase in the proportional

712
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,480
loss

713
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,240
and so that proportion loss is p

714
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,640
so that's just the total amount of

715
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,558
biomass in this case and another slide

716
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,799
would be the total amount of nitrogen

717
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:12,558
we also find uh that as you increase

718
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,720
hairy vetch proportion the you have an

719
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:17,200
increase in the rate of loss so in this

720
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:21,120
case you both have a rate

721
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:24,880
and a pool size change in the decay of

722
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,879
these cover crops across these mixtures

723
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,479
and we have a fair amount of variability

724
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,000
as you expect from year to year and uh

725
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,240
we're this is this kind of work we're

726
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,960
actually working with um the adapt end

727
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,480
folks and jeff melkonian on on uh

728
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,558
calibrating some of the models using

729
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,960
adapt end to estimate nitrogen release

730
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:42,158
and uptake and so this is the kind of

731
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,079
issue that we have to address that

732
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,960
there's just annual variations right

733
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:49,678
that this this year you had faster rates

734
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,919
of decay than this year and as you might

735
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,919
expect there were differences in

736
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,880
precipitation that year so we had just

737
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,640
it was just

738
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,159
a little bit more moist out there cover

739
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,720
crops decay better when they're wet then

740
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:03,120
when they're dry and and so being able

741
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,278
to build models that incorporate uh this

742
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:06,399
type of variability is important so that

743
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:08,079
we can make

744
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,759
models that would be able to extend

745
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:12,798
across broad regions and useful for

746
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:12,798
estimating and release

747
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:17,679
okay now we're going to look at

748
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,880
synchrony of release with crop demand

749
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,880
how are we doing time-wise

750
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,559
okay good all right great

751
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:30,719
so now we've looked at

752
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:32,000
how cover crop composition affects

753
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,480
biomass

754
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,919
the nitrogen content and even it's its

755
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,558
uh uh

756
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,840
decomposition of the biomass now we're

757
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:41,678
going to look at some of the nitrogen

758
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,839
dynamics so one of the reasons why we're

759
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,880
so interested in release rates and

760
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:49,038
decomposition of cover crops and how

761
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,159
we manage cover crops may influence

762
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:51,359
those rates

763
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,640
is because

764
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,240
we're trying to increase our use

765
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,360
efficiency of nutrients in our system

766
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,919
generally all any good you know uh

767
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:02,319
sustainable and conservative corn

768
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,759
management uh system is going to target

769
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:05,678
trying to improve nitrogen use

770
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:07,679
efficiency so the amount of nitrogen you

771
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,000
put out in the landscape you recapture

772
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,000
as much as that as possible back into

773
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
that cash crop and so in the case of

774
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,079
corn you can see when it starts to reach

775
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,319
exponential uptake of nitrogen that

776
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:21,839
happens around at v5 v8 and so that's

777
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:23,759
why we have a standard practice in

778
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,759
conventional agriculture to side dress

779
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,000
our corn and split our applications

780
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:30,400
amongst nitrogen put down at starter

781
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,599
versus at side dress so that we're not

782
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,440
dumping all our nitrogen out in the

783
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:36,000
field when there's nothing to take it up

784
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,960
and and we lose a lot of that nitrogen

785
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,960
early in the season

786
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,159
and what's interesting is that you know

787
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:45,839
we are always so focused on good

788
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,200
synchrony of n with

789
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:48,879
with our

790
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,600
crop uptake from mineral fertilizer

791
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,440
standpoint but we really

792
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,918
understate how much

793
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,278
available nitrogen comes from a legume

794
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,600
from the moment that it's it's

795
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:02,079
terminated it releases nitrogen very

796
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:04,319
rapidly and we have lots of nitrogen uh

797
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:06,319
leaching concerns and and potential

798
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:08,240
coming from a legume so that's why these

799
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,158
mixtures really provide a lot of

800
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,640
opportunity to manage that and so here

801
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,559
again you're looking at uh you don't ry

802
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,919
is not modeled here because we couldn't

803
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:16,879
fit a model to that because there really

804
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,440
was no

805
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,799
uh uh change in and and and

806
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,919
um and that and that could be both a

807
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:25,679
combination of of and uh not no loss of

808
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,960
nitrogen or what what's more common to

809
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,360
happen is not only are you losing some

810
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,880
nitrogen from the rye but rye is also a

811
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,199
sink for

812
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,520
fungal mediated nitrogen translocation

813
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,120
from the soil into the mulch above the

814
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,679
ground and so the nitrogen somewhat

815
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:42,079
cycling and stored in there but you can

816
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,759
see between 2012 and 13 while we did

817
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,918
have some differences the big thing that

818
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:49,119
stands out obviously is that the rate of

819
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,840
release of nitrogen is really rapid in

820
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:54,639
these monocultures and that as we

821
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:57,199
add grass into this mix we delay the

822
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,240
release of that nitrogen now we're not

823
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,679
just delaying the release of that

824
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,798
nitrogen we're also doing something else

825
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,120
where

826
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:06,000
we're decreasing the pool size right so

827
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:08,319
that these this dirt this is this is our

828
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,159
decay constant but this is our pool size

829
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:11,359
and so while we're slowing down the

830
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,278
release of nitrogen to get better

831
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:15,199
synchrony we're reducing how much

832
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:16,720
nitrogen that's going to the cash crop

833
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,159
which poses a management challenge right

834
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,759
because we want to hit our yields goal

835
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,360
and make sure we have enough nitrogen

836
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,798
out there

837
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,479
in this case though increasing hairy

838
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:26,398
vetch proportion

839
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,839
resulted in an increased proportion of

840
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:30,000
end loss but

841
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,158
whenever we had a grass and a doom

842
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,480
together there was not much of a change

843
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:37,278
in the rate so the pool size differed

844
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,599
how much we total nitrogen was released

845
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:42,240
but the rate of release was was was comp

846
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:42,240
was similar

847
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:46,639
and this is really just a repeat of what

848
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:48,480
i just said

849
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,520
so increasing hairy vetch composition in

850
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,839
the mixture

851
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:52,558
resulted in a proportion of mass loss of

852
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:54,398
the p

853
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:56,960
a proportion of n loss so both that

854
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:58,959
again that p constant and then the rate

855
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,840
of mass loss during corn growing season

856
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,759
so that's just the biomass had a decay

857
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,398
rate difference but not so much in the

858
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:10,000
form of nitrogen release when legumes

859
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:10,000
were with grasses and mixture

860
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,558
now this is just a yield response from

861
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:16,240
across the mixture so this is no

862
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:18,158
additional fertility applied but you can

863
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,159
see that we can get almost 90 bushels

864
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,320
difference when going from a pure grass

865
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:25,200
to a pure legume and our corn green

866
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:27,119
yields so the cover crops are certainly

867
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,278
providing a huge impact on the

868
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:31,599
performance of our cash crop but as i

869
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:34,079
mentioned before particularly as we move

870
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:35,918
towards mixtures that have a lot of

871
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:38,079
advantages we're reducing the amount of

872
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,080
nitrogen in the system and so we need

873
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:42,480
more nitrogen

874
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:44,558
this can come in on a range of different

875
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,880
sources for conventional producers

876
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:49,200
mineral fertilizer is certainly the the

877
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,919
easiest option putting down

878
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,600
u a n is is some of the treatments we do

879
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,320
have in this experiment i'm not going to

880
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:58,719
highlight that a big issue in our region

881
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:00,079
as is in your region is animal waste uh

882
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,079
we deal with more poultry litter than

883
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:05,199
you guys you guys deal with dairy but

884
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:07,439
again uh that it's a big uh management

885
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,919
issue and so getting a manure into the

886
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,159
system to supplement the nitrogen needs

887
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,720
uh with with our cover crop it was one

888
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,320
of our objectives um and and you can see

889
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,079
here uh that these are being surface

890
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:20,879
applied when we surface apply we lose a

891
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:23,199
lot of our nitrogen in in the form of it

892
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,000
volatilizes and plus you also are have

893
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,640
some risk of of erosion as well and so

894
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,679
surface applications is is is really uh

895
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,200
you know

896
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,440
been a a

897
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,880
challenge to get past it's been decades

898
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,640
worth of research and effort by both

899
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,880
farmers and researchers to develop

900
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,640
technology to address that issue uh

901
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,519
liquid dairy manure has certainly seen

902
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,640
the the fastest um progression in that

903
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,640
just because it's easier to work with

904
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,640
liquids

905
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,480
in maryland this is really heightened

906
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,919
for us because we have more and more

907
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,839
restrictions coming out for example we

908
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,759
have to now have any kind of animal

909
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:59,439
waste incorporated within 48 hours of

910
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:01,599
application

911
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,200
so there's a lot of interest in trying

912
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:07,359
to incorporate animal waste uh as a

913
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,519
source of fertility rather than uh

914
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:10,639
applying it on the surface or applying

915
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,079
another surface and incorporating

916
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,840
through tillage just because of the

917
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:15,439
obvious concerns we expressed about

918
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:16,798
tillage

919
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,558
and so these are some of the prototypes

920
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:19,278
that folks have developed over the years

921
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:21,119
to

922
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:23,119
to test this question these are small

923
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:24,719
plot units this can

924
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:26,879
this has been used in both pastures as

925
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,839
well as production systems mostly

926
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,760
pre-plant type of applications so we we

927
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:33,519
were kind of excited about that you know

928
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:34,640
it was it seemed like some opportunity

929
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,480
here people are starting to work with

930
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,880
poultry litter these dry solids to get

931
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,558
them incorporated and so i kind of

932
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,720
shopped around and looked at some

933
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,480
products that that might work for us uh

934
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,558
we're not ag engineers we're not

935
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,558
interested in in developing ready

936
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:50,319
technology for farmers to adopt we're

937
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:52,240
biologists so we're going to test how

938
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:54,558
this behaves how we can increase use

939
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,079
efficiency of nutrients and and what are

940
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:58,639
the benefits of the system and hopefully

941
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:00,079
the ag engineers uh will figure this out

942
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,840
and make this work and i know that this

943
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:04,798
has been a challenge for a number of

944
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:07,359
years so this is this is by no means uh

945
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:08,798
uh uh a piece of machinery that's farm

946
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:10,479
ready vegetable ready yes this would

947
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:11,759
work great in vegetable systems but

948
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,159
we're just working with pelletized

949
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,919
poultry litter because pellets are are

950
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,600
really easy to work with they behave as

951
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,159
far as decomposition kinetics very

952
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:22,000
identical practically to to bulk litter

953
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,600
and so from a behavioral standpoint it's

954
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,079
a let's test our questions but we're

955
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:27,759
able to put out very precise uniform

956
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:29,199
rates and

957
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:31,038
we're able to

958
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,798
abandon this poultry litter and the

959
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:34,158
machine we built allows us to apply it

960
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:36,158
at side dress

961
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,840
so whether or not side dressing poultry

962
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,159
litter is going to become a regularly

963
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:41,839
adopted practice or the focus is still

964
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,679
going to be pre-plant there's lots of

965
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:45,759
logistical constraints actually side

966
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,559
dressing corn with poultry litter then

967
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:50,720
then just coming in at planting and

968
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:52,798
just a lot of management issues but

969
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,038
this is uh we wanted to continue to test

970
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,480
that question of use efficiency where

971
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:57,679
we're side dressing our poultry litter

972
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,440
and take advantage of the types of

973
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,840
management practices we know

974
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,360
work with with mineral fertilizers and

975
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:05,359
so this is what that looks like here

976
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:07,839
we've got coulter cutting a trench

977
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:09,199
that's slightly skewed uh

978
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:10,319
it's on an angle and so it creates a

979
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,799
little trench as it drives through the

980
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,119
field and poultry litter shot right down

981
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,879
into that trench and then these clothing

982
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,320
wheels close that up and i kid you not

983
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:19,519
you walk into a field a couple weeks

984
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,280
later you don't even know where this

985
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:23,119
unit went i mean the residue is all

986
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,040
covered up you can't see the the

987
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,159
disturbance and you and you've just

988
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:28,480
dropped down

989
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,039
we can drop down up up you know anywhere

990
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,480
from uh three-quarters to

991
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:34,480
uh you know

992
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,599
five or six tons of poultry litter in an

993
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,199
application rate with this machine

994
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,119
so this generated several research

995
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,719
questions that link to this these cover

996
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,119
crop mixtures that that i'm going to

997
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,559
present on uh and so some of the

998
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,879
questions that came out of this is just

999
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:50,480
you know you know how does you know side

1000
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,679
dressing this unit work can we can it

1001
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,519
will will it will it affect the

1002
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,200
decomposition of the surface residues

1003
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,759
that we're getting a lot of benefits

1004
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,519
from um and and how does it

1005
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,440
distribute it to the soil profile and

1006
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:02,719
how does it behave over time i'm only

1007
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,400
going to give you just a little glimpse

1008
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:05,919
of this work we had a lot of

1009
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,920
work testing this question across a

1010
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,200
suite of different management treatments

1011
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,838
we're only going to look at a very

1012
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:13,598
subset of them so now this is

1013
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:16,000
the additional methodology but we're

1014
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,480
only targeting specific cover crops so

1015
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,280
just the monocultures and the mixture

1016
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,280
and

1017
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,720
we put down poultry litter in various

1018
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,119
different application methods where we

1019
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,719
broadcast it on the surface and it

1020
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,320
which is a typical practice historically

1021
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:29,519
where just put your poultry right over

1022
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,480
that cover crop

1023
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:31,440
or

1024
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,880
apply it over the surface and

1025
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,720
incorporate it and manage like a tillage

1026
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,559
based system organic site we managed it

1027
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:38,719
organically as you would tillage the

1028
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:41,119
conventional was just a chisel till uh

1029
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:43,279
conventional

1030
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,960
tillage based system and then we have

1031
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,400
all these subsurface banded treatments

1032
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,559
where we put subsurface banding at

1033
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,119
different rates and uh and then we have

1034
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:52,400
a no manure application and so

1035
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,440
i'm going to talk about a little bit of

1036
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,800
this if you have more questions about

1037
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,039
some of the treatments that i mentioned

1038
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,519
here certainly approach me later in the

1039
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:01,440
day uh so to understand just how that

1040
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:03,838
nitrogen is being released and you'll be

1041
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,440
able to quantify uh the availability of

1042
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:07,119
nitrogen now we have this whole spatial

1043
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,200
issue we've got to deal with we've taken

1044
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,800
a broadcast rate and we've narrowed it

1045
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:12,399
down to these little bands

1046
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,160
so the the types of questions you have

1047
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,880
to ask related to how you would take a

1048
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:18,960
soil sample and and test the the release

1049
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,200
rates of nitrogen and what is available

1050
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,920
uh became a whole research thrust into

1051
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:26,000
itself it was quite fun so here we we

1052
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,280
actually are doing depth structured

1053
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,119
spatial cores over the growing season of

1054
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,880
corn to see how that nitrogen is moving

1055
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,320
and so this is what a core would look

1056
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,760
like this is the band

1057
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,320
and these are the number of soil cores

1058
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,880
that we've taken across that band and

1059
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,480
then you know this it's a mirror image

1060
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,320
to the left and to the right of that

1061
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,480
band and so then those are compiled

1062
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,720
together and analyzed for inorganic

1063
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,639
nitrogen content

1064
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:52,078
and then also we segmented these into

1065
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:54,960
these different depths

1066
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:59,039
so we have a pretty good uh resolution

1067
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,039
of nitrogen in that soil profile

1068
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:04,719
and so then we developed a spatial model

1069
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,640
to assess nitrogen in moving from that

1070
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:08,639
band and so that had to both

1071
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,799
incorporate the band effect the cover

1072
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:13,279
crop effect and the residual spatial

1073
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,119
dependence and i could give a whole talk

1074
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,119
just on this model and what we had to do

1075
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,280
so i'm going to just be really quick

1076
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,920
this is a diffusion model we're using

1077
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,720
euclidean distances to estimate

1078
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,519
uh

1079
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:27,039
nitrogen across that spatial profile

1080
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:28,639
and and and this is what that model

1081
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:30,800
looks like there's a fair number of

1082
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:32,559
other steps involved in in

1083
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,760
in this model to get to this point but

1084
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:35,759
this is the pretty picture we want to

1085
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,160
look at to get a sense of how nitrogen

1086
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,079
is behaving spatially this is just one

1087
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:41,759
site year this doesn't include all of

1088
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,680
the other fertility treatments this is

1089
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,400
just the poultry litter ban that went

1090
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:48,399
down at side dress and that's our rye

1091
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,720
our hairy vetch and that's our mixture

1092
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,680
so these are just our three cover crops

1093
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:56,000
at five different growth stages of corn

1094
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:58,078
and the band is done at side dress so

1095
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,519
this is just the effects of the cover

1096
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,599
crop

1097
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:03,280
and then as you see over time the

1098
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,519
movement of the of the nitrogen away

1099
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,720
from that ban and what i think is the

1100
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:11,039
most startling from our results

1101
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:12,799
the nitrogen doesn't move very much

1102
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:14,079
it doesn't move very much at all we were

1103
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,079
expecting

1104
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,599
all sorts of of issues related to

1105
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,039
vertical and horizontal movement that we

1106
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,599
would have to build into these spatial

1107
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:25,440
models the reality of it is is that a

1108
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,880
lot of this nitrogen is becoming

1109
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,280
available when the corn is starting to

1110
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,760
grow rapidly and we see tremendous root

1111
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,200
proliferation around the band

1112
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,280
and so the nitrogen is actually being

1113
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:36,879
taken up almost as rapidly as it's being

1114
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,960
mineralized from that poultry litter

1115
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,320
band and so you're seeing very little

1116
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,320
movement away from the band

1117
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,480
and what's more just coming back to that

1118
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,000
other figure now

1119
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,920
what was really interesting is that we

1120
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,480
saw no difference from sub-surface

1121
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,159
banding versus you know no poultry

1122
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,760
litter whatsoever on the effects of

1123
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:59,199
cover crop decay

1124
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,960
so not only are we getting very

1125
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:03,199
localized nitrogen when we ban that

1126
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,039
poultry litter and and not a lot of

1127
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:07,919
movement from the band but we're getting

1128
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:09,838
no impacts on the decay of our cover

1129
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,519
crops on the surface and that's really

1130
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:13,199
important because when we're trying to

1131
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:15,920
manage our system and we're trying to

1132
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:17,358
know what our variables are

1133
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,960
the more interactions we have with our

1134
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:20,799
management the more challenging it is to

1135
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,639
make decisions so being able to know

1136
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,640
what's going on with the nitrogen in the

1137
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:27,838
soil and know that that's not having the

1138
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:29,199
same implications on on nitrogen or or

1139
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:30,960
mulch decay

1140
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:32,399
allows us to make more precise

1141
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,159
recommendations or farmers to make

1142
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,160
better decisions about their management

1143
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,280
so summary of these findings

1144
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,400
surface-banded poultry litter

1145
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,119
applications did not affect

1146
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,880
decomposition as i mentioned

1147
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,240
in fact all of this is really just a

1148
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,240
review of what i just said

1149
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,240
so i'm going to just give you another

1150
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,920
little taste of some of the supplemental

1151
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:58,319
work we did around this this is just one

1152
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,320
more piece of data so on top of all this

1153
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,559
we've created these this continuum of

1154
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,200
cover crops and nitrogen availability

1155
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:06,400
and and nitrogen source in the landscape

1156
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:08,879
we you know we have all these different

1157
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,960
mineral sources and manure sources and

1158
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,240
cover crops so

1159
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,320
we know that that has a lot of

1160
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:15,919
implications on n2o emissions coming

1161
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,559
from uh the

1162
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,039
soil and and and certainly corn is one

1163
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:22,639
of our biggest players in n2o emissions

1164
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:25,279
uh so it's it's certainly an important

1165
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:26,480
place to test this question and so

1166
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,680
i didn't really realize what i was

1167
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,679
getting into when we started this

1168
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:32,239
research but uh

1169
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:35,199
greenhouse gas measurements and n2o is

1170
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:36,719
quite labor intensive and exhausting uh

1171
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:39,118
and most of the expertise that was

1172
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:40,639
involved in guiding my graduate student

1173
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,400
and myself is coming from michelle

1174
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:44,239
cavagelli who has been doing kind of

1175
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,838
greenhouse gas emissions and beltsville

1176
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:48,479
for a very long time

1177
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:50,320
um so here are the frames that we use

1178
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,400
that they they span the distance from

1179
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,680
cornrow to cornrow

1180
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,519
and this is just an example of a

1181
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:57,358
sampling event we do this year round

1182
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:59,199
anytime it rains we're out there whether

1183
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:00,480
it's friday saturday sunday whatever day

1184
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:02,559
of the week it is

1185
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,519
holidays if it rains we're out there the

1186
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:05,119
next day

1187
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:08,079
sampling because that's what's driving

1188
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,920
n2o emissions and so just to give you a

1189
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,400
little taste of what that looks like so

1190
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,119
now what you're looking at is different

1191
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,838
rates of poultry litter applied and and

1192
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:20,400
so this is our tillage treatment so this

1193
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:22,239
is and this these rates just to kind of

1194
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,720
cue you in this is what we consider our

1195
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:27,559
p base rate so kind of nitrogen applied

1196
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:30,879
at the p removal uh level and then this

1197
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:32,880
135 is really our our nitrogen typical

1198
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,640
nitrogen base rate and then this is

1199
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,039
rates that we apply that are actually

1200
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:39,440
not untypical in in

1201
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:40,960
delmarva at all but but uh uh it

1202
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,519
represents our kind of our saturated

1203
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,240
nitrogen levels so we're uh for either a

1204
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:47,759
very low fertile site or or um

1205
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:49,358
just to help us you know have an

1206
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,440
asymptote in the in the data sets that

1207
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:53,440
we're looking at and then this nine

1208
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,200
kilograms is just because in the in some

1209
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,559
of these organic systems we're actually

1210
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,559
been experimenting with just putting

1211
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:00,719
down some pellets at planting so we're

1212
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:02,880
actually running the the fertilizer

1213
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:04,559
boxes the dry fertilizer box is open and

1214
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,519
dropping pelletized poultry litter at

1215
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:09,838
planting and we're getting about uh 500

1216
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:11,280
pounds of poultry put down at that point

1217
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:13,358
that kind of gives you a rough

1218
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,599
equivalent of a plant available nitrogen

1219
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:18,078
that's coming so this is a nitrogen

1220
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,480
gradient here of of application rate and

1221
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,480
this is just uh

1222
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,358
this is basically no-till and this is

1223
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,119
till

1224
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:27,199
and what we also have in there is our

1225
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:30,000
bare ground and then of course across

1226
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:32,480
this axis is our bare ground our rye our

1227
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,960
mixture and our hairy vetch

1228
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,480
this is a this is pooled for two years

1229
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,639
so we didn't have a year interaction

1230
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,639
this is two complete years of greenhouse

1231
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,480
gas measurements measured i mean

1232
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:46,000
sometimes you know in the upwards of 90

1233
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:49,280
to 120 measurements in a year

1234
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,920
and so this is a fairly uh comprehensive

1235
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,079
look at how our fertility and our cover

1236
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,680
crop management drives greenhouse gases

1237
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,280
and clearly the things that stand out

1238
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:58,960
obviously is that you have more nitrogen

1239
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,839
in the system you're going to get more

1240
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,079
n2o emissions that's not rocket science

1241
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:06,239
um what should be interesting to you is

1242
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,960
that the bare ground really comes down

1243
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:10,078
as the as having the least n2o emissions

1244
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,920
and there's a number of reasons

1245
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,920
obviously there's there's not some of

1246
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,838
the presence of of carbon coming from

1247
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,960
sources of cover crops carbon is a very

1248
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:20,799
important component of of n2o uh uh

1249
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,280
release and and creating the conditions

1250
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,920
for and and to oh production but then

1251
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,680
also your the soil dries out quite a bit

1252
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,159
more you know when you have a cover crop

1253
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:32,159
on the surface you retain soil moisture

1254
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,480
levels much higher which are our more

1255
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:36,960
conducive conditions environment for uh

1256
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,358
greenhouse gas emissions but what was

1257
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,440
really interesting was that when you

1258
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:42,799
look at the amount of nitrogen applied

1259
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,679
in the form of poultry litter with the

1260
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,680
amount of nitrogen losses n2o

1261
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:50,078
while sure the bare ground has its

1262
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:52,399
advantages from from from the standpoint

1263
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,240
of lower n2o but there's also other

1264
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,720
implications of having you know ground

1265
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:59,519
that dries out and and not having those

1266
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:02,000
carbon amendments going back in but

1267
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:02,000
clearly

1268
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:06,000
the mixtures shine

1269
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:08,559
we get a cover crop that can both supply

1270
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,199
the nitrogen for the cash crop

1271
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:13,440
it has a slower release rate and it also

1272
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:16,960
reduces our n2o emissions

1273
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,960
as a function of fertilizer applied

1274
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,240
so again cover crops can increase into

1275
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:26,639
emissions

1276
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:27,838
uh generally uh they respond in an

1277
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:30,078
exponential way although you were

1278
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:31,920
looking at log transform data sets

1279
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,119
and we have some you know future plans

1280
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,559
of following up some of this work in

1281
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,358
these systems some additional

1282
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:38,559
measurements

1283
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:40,480
you only caught a little glimmer of

1284
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:41,920
these data sets and and what we're kind

1285
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,440
of pulling together and so kind of the

1286
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,039
next phase of this is to kind of do some

1287
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,720
multi-criteria assessments of these

1288
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:48,800
systems looking at the various different

1289
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:51,439
factors and how they interact and kind

1290
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,880
of building a more uh complete data set

1291
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,880
and also part of the work that we're

1292
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,160
doing here is working closely with jeff

1293
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,440
in in some of the models that he's

1294
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:00,440
developing and that's been a really fun

1295
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,440
collaboration

1296
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:12,199
this has been a production of cornell

1297
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,200
university on the web at cornell.edu
