8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,160
necki uh we serve as an anchor for

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,878

so today I'm going to talk about

58
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,360
a grant funded program that both Melissa

59
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,319
cray and I work on and we affectionally

60
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:02,159
call it C3PO which is climate change

61
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:04,759
community programs and opportunities or

62
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,878
there is a very long name right below

63
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:10,158
that that our funer National Science

64
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:13,798
Foundation gave us and I am going to

65
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:15,798
provide an overview of of the project uh

66
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:19,239
Melissa cray and myself along with

67
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:23,280
Roslin mccan and art mesh are the pis on

68
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:26,080
this project and um then I'm going to

69
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,878
give a more detail specifically on the

70
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,640
work that I have done in Washington

71
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:32,639
state with the latine and Hispanic

72
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:38,519
communities so this project came

73
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:41,560
together in November of

74
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:44,480
2020 uh it was election season and I had

75
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:48,519
a lot of anxiety about who was going to

76
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:52,039
win the election um bit of deja vu here

77
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:53,879
with this picture and now that is 2024

78
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:56,840
and once again we're entering election

79
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:59,919
season but on the night of the election

80
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,519
November 3rd I sent out an email to Paul

81
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,000
Chappelle and said hey Paul do you think

82
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,519
anybody in necki would want to do a

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,400
grant with me on climate change

84
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,799
education Paul said you're sure and

85
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,519
Melissa was one of the people that

86
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,040
responded I didn't really know Melissa

87
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:17,519
at the time but uh she has been a great

88
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:20,439
collaborator and the project was funded

89
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,560
in the summer of

90
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:26,759
2021 uh as I mentioned it's an NSF Grant

91
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,519
it's advancing informal stem learning

92
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:33,000
the category of grant that we have pilot

93
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:35,599
and feasibility studies uh is not on

94
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,879
their current list of opportunities that

95
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,879
they are offering for their next

96
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:42,839
deadline in

97
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:45,000
2025 um but there's lots of things there

98
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:46,478
and I think uh it's a great fit for

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,160
people working on climate change

100
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,159
education and extension typ

101
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,759
work uh we have been working with four

102
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,639
different upper under representative

103
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,038
communities in Alaska our colleague art

104
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,360
Nash works with tribal and indigenous

105
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:07,719
youth he presented in this webinar

106
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,000
series earlier this spring um in Utah

107
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:14,440
our colleague rosn mccan has worked with

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,519
indigenous communities in southeast Utah

109
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:20,079
and then Melissa who will be presenting

110
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:22,000
after me works with women Forest owners

111
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,120
and then I work in Washington state with

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,478
the Hispanic and Latina community and

113
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:31,600
going forward I'm just going to refer to

114
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:33,318
that as the Latina community

115
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,280
so when the project started when we

116
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:40,080
wrote the grant we had this idea that we

117
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:42,758
would be doing uh a very interactive

118
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:45,159
creation of the work that we were doing

119
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,600
that we would spend uh a lot of time on

120
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:51,120
the design of the educational program

121
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,840
around climate change uh we would be

122
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,360
soliciting feedback from our Advisory

123
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:58,000
Board from different groups that

124
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,479
represented the different communities we

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,839
are working with and then we would be

126
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:05,439
testing the curriculum and the products

127
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:07,918
that we we were doing and so these

128
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,879
arrows represent that we were hoped to

129
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,839
have uh very much a two-way flow of

130
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:15,478
information between everyone that was

131
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:18,399
working on the project today I'm mainly

132
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:22,000
going to focus on this testing portion

133
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:25,239
of the project and um how that has

134
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,439
worked for the past two years in 2023

135
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,439
and

136
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,280
2024 uh when we started this project as

137
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:36,839
a team we came up with learning

138
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:40,239
objectives that we thought that all four

139
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:42,519
locations can follow we were using a

140
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,079
curriculum based out of University of

141
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:48,240
California called climate stewards and

142
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:50,478
we were each modifying and co-creating

143
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,000
that curriculum for our specific

144
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,758
community in our

145
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,598
state and I had not reviewed this

146
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,120
diagram in a while until this morning

147
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:01,079
and I looked through it and what really

148
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,399
stood out out to me was the social

149
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:05,918
cultural values perspectives and

150
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:08,799
practices of specific communities and

151
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:12,359
how you respond to climate change and

152
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:16,520
how our work really needed to focus on

153
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:19,360
that and how we could not take a

154
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:22,758
curriculum um make a few changes to make

155
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,919
it state or region specific in many

156
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,319
cases there were pretty substantial

157
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:31,120
changes that we made for it to fit our

158
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:33,598
communities that we are working with

159
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,639
in Washington state what we started with

160
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,038
was a very thorough needs assessment of

161
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:41,000
our community we did lots of focus

162
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:42,318
groups and interviews with people in the

163
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,639
Latina

164
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,598
Community um and I could do a whole

165
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,960
webinar just on that portion of our work

166
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:54,399
but some of the advice that community

167
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:56,560
members gave us was to adapt how the

168
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:59,719
information was presented to make it

169
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,759
specifically for them they like things

170
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,800
to be very active interactive and fun

171
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,720
and

172
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,038
tangible uh they they encourage us to do

173
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,319
field trips and ecological outings to

174
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:14,519
show the importance of caring for the

175
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:17,199
environment and then recognition and

176
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:19,839
awards are very important to people in

177
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:24,158
the Latina Community as well as gifts

178
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:26,839
and um prizes and then you know make

179
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:29,120
sure that these events are fun and

180
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,439
providing food and music it's more of a

181
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,879
part

182
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:37,200
than just an educational

183
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:41,158
event so the curriculum co-creation that

184
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,560
we did um we took input from all of the

185
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:45,838
interviews focus groups and the needs

186
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:50,000
assessment that we did we worked with

187
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,920
four Community um leaders and then we

188
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,799
had an education consultant on the

189
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,919
project as well as myself and so we were

190
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,958
taking the curriculum from University of

191
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:59,958
California climate stewards and not only

192
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,359
were we

193
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:05,239
integrating to make it Washington State

194
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:08,000
Pacific but we were brainstorming on how

195
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:11,879
to make this informal learning and how

196
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,440
to make it appealing to the Latina

197
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:17,159
Community um the course components we

198
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,760
changed a bit from the organization that

199
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:21,639
is in the UC climate stewards uh we

200
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:24,679
started very much with community

201
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:26,720
building and trying to encourage a

202
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:27,679
community and create a community within

203
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,278
our

204
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:33,479
course uh then we went to environmental

205
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:36,958
systems and talked about that as well as

206
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,480
um some general ideas about climate

207
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:42,199
change and then from that point we went

208
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,360
to more into unit three which was foced

209
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,519
on local mitigation and Community

210
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,399
resilience we talked about that instead

211
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:50,600
of using the term

212
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,720
adaptation and then we finished the

213
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,480
course with how you talk about climate

214
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,920
and climate communication and then our

215
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,839
participants in our course they do a

216
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:02,519
final project which they can do as an

217
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,920
individual or they can work in groups in

218
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:08,440
doing

219
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:11,679
that so this is a Saturday morning at

220
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,480
WSU Everett um you can see that all our

221
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:16,078
participants in the course you know

222
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,320
they're actively working on a Saturday

223
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:20,759
morning um it's not everybody that's

224
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,079
going to be dedicated enough to come to

225
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:27,679
a course on Saturday morning but we did

226
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:30,679
this for 10 weeks and uh I would say

227
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,559
about three four of our classes were in

228
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:33,759
person and then we had maybe three that

229
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:36,638
were virtual

230
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:39,039
classes we had all of our classes were

231
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,000
very family friendly we provided Child

232
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:44,319
Care uh when they got there in the

233
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,039
morning we had a um Mexican pastry

234
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,959
called pendul so it's a sweet bread uh

235
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:52,679
fresh fruit coffee and tea to make it a

236
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:55,078
very welcoming atmosphere for them uh we

237
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:56,638
did have it in a university building and

238
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:59,919
facilities and I think that was

239
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,759
important to connect them to do the fact

240
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,679
that you know all of them and their

241
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,720
families are welcome at University

242
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:09,159
spaces and to encourage them for their

243
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,800
family members to uh be part of the

244
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:13,480
university and the different activities

245
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:16,519
that we have there uh another thing I

246
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,360
want to point out is that the University

247
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:22,159
of California program is called climate

248
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:25,278
stewards that does not translate uh as

249
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:28,240
well into Spanish and so we use the term

250
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,838
promotur Dela which translates to

251
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,839
climate ambassador

252
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,360
for this section of the program that I'm

253
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,240
going to talk

254
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,120
about so I'll be using promoturist Delo

255
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,360
or just promus going

256
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,759
forward so one aspect of the course was

257
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,240
to have people that were the lead

258
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:49,639
instructors and the um guest speakers in

259
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,000
the course to be members of the Latina

260
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:55,879
Community to be fully bilingual in

261
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,519
English and Spanish and so Christina OS

262
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:59,519
um she's my friend and colleague here on

263
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,560
the right she's a fabulous lead

264
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,000
instructor she also helped with the

265
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:06,799
co-creation of the curriculum and so she

266
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,519
has been involved for a very long time

267
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:13,479
in creating this uh promoturist

268
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:16,360
clima and then we were able to find um

269
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,399
six different guest speakers to talk

270
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:22,639
about different aspects of the work that

271
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:25,320
they do on climate change um Maria was

272
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,120
is from California she used to work for

273
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,278
California um extension she's now with a

274
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,600
nonprofit in California

275
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:34,360
uh Isabelle uh used to work at

276
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,240
University of Washington I have

277
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,039
collaborated with Isabelle for probably

278
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,600
six seven years now and she's a great

279
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,039
colleague to collaborate with and then

280
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:47,278
she was able to introduce me to Migel

281
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:49,879
from Earth corpse um Dr Garcia Perez is

282
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:53,240
a professor at WSU and a colleague of

283
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:55,559
mine and then Dr Ernesto Alvarado is a

284
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,919
professor at University of Washington

285
00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:00,559
and then in reading the the newspaper

286
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:03,198
local newspaper Christina learned about

287
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:04,838
Dr Jesus Perez lerz who's a science

288
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:08,639
teacher and does a

289
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:12,240
bilingual um course for his classrooms

290
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:15,000
in Burlington and so they were really

291
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,000
critical to be able to find this diverse

292
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,958
array of people to give their time to

293
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
speak and answer the students questions

294
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,479
I think it was very inspirational to

295
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,198
them to see members of their Community

296
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,959
being professors and working for these

297
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:32,799
organizations AC across the United

298
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:35,359
States and so we generally appreciated

299
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,359
their

300
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:42,399
contribution so part of what we did in

301
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:45,958
this course is that we tried to make it

302
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,120
very interactive and to bring fun into

303
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:50,758
the course uh within the climate

304
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,078
stewards curriculum there's uh several

305
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:55,159
metaphors that are used that talk about

306
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:58,319
climate change and several of those

307
00:13:55,159 --> 00:14:01,240
translated well into Spanish uh early in

308
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,800
the course we talked about the effect of

309
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,839
greenhouse gases in our atmosphere being

310
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:08,719
being uh a heat trapping

311
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,680
blanket uh here on the left of your

312
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,120
screen is my friend and colleague

313
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:16,159
Tatiana haraldo and she was involved in

314
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,639
doing all of the interviews and focus

315
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:21,159
groups and helping to create the

316
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,159
curriculum and so by showing the

317
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:26,879
Greenhouse Effect and having each

318
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:28,799
blanket represent a greenhouse gas you

319
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,078
know you start with one blanket then you

320
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:34,240
add another and another and another and

321
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:36,039
at this point um our volunteer for this

322
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,000
process has six blankets on there and

323
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:41,039
they're feeling a little warm so it's a

324
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,360
very visual representation of what is

325
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,759
happening to the

326
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,199
Earth uh the same thing we do to

327
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:50,079
illustrate another one of the metaphors

328
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:53,319
which is regular um carbon Cycles versus

329
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:56,078
a rampant carbon cycle and so what we

330
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,278
start is with these green tennis balls

331
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,559
and we show how the carbon cycle works

332
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:01,240
when there are are no fossil fuels in

333
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:04,000
the

334
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,839
equation and how it changes going

335
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,759
throughout the year how it goes up in

336
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,279
the summer and then down in the winter

337
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:12,959
in the northern H Atmos uh Northern

338
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,600
Hemisphere and then the opposite in the

339
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:19,000
Southern Hemisphere and then we take the

340
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,639
cycle and we integrate uh gray tennis

341
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,360
balls which represent coal we integrate

342
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:28,360
black tennis balls which represent uh

343
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,839
petroleum and what that does to the

344
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,278
carbon cycle

345
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,639
and then we either have a box or a

346
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:37,159
bucket or something and that represents

347
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,639
the earth and the atmosphere of Earth

348
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:41,159
and once we integrate these all these

349
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:44,240
different tennis balls at some point you

350
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:46,879
can easily see that it is overflowing

351
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,240
and so very visual representation of

352
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,919
what is happening with the carbon cycle

353
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,639
and how it's totally out of whack and

354
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:56,360
once you make it visual it's easier to

355
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:59,399
see and easier to understand um I did

356
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,399
part of this activity in Spanish I have

357
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,879
now given myself a challenge that I'm

358
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:05,000
going to learn to be able to lead this

359
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,838
entire activity in Spanish by the next

360
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,759
time I do it so we'll

361
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:13,360
see uh we did a lot of Team activities

362
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:16,399
and that was one thing our participants

363
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,480
loved doing was working in groups uh

364
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,679
this was an assignment early in the

365
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,360
course where they had to do a concept

366
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:26,439
map about Community connect connections

367
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,919
on this side of the screen this group

368
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:32,079
was thinking more globally in terms

369
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:35,318
terms of um the community and the the

370
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:37,799
global community that we all live in um

371
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:39,519
the picture on the right um that person

372
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:41,758
is thinking that group is thinking more

373
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:45,399
locally in terms of you know what's the

374
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,959
impact of all our urban communities on

375
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:51,919
for us here in the Pacific

376
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:54,318
Northwest and um one other thing was

377
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,159
that in both classes that we've done we

378
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:58,278
we're in the process of completing our

379
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,838
second is that we've had talented

380
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:01,879
members of the community that are good

381
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,639
artists and so that is a way to

382
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:06,558
integrate their skills and their

383
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:09,959
information into the

384
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,759
program um we did some of the courses we

385
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,959
did

386
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:17,439
virtual and part of what we realized

387
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:19,360
that we had to do in this class was that

388
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,480
um some of our participants were not

389
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,038
familiar with technology and so we had

390
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:28,199
to spend time helping them learn

391
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:30,519
technology uh so we use qual trick for

392
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:33,080
course Reg registration but we also use

393
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:36,000
that as a way for them to provide us

394
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:40,240
feedback after every class and then also

395
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,200
to submit their homework the original uh

396
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,038
climate stewards curriculum is designed

397
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:48,319
to be on campas and um that just wasn't

398
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:51,000
going to work for our community to use

399
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:53,558
that much technology we did have some

400
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,798
Zoom meetings and within that you know

401
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:58,399
they were able to learn about um

402
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:59,879
breakout rooms and how to use chat how

403
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,519
to use Jam

404
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,840
boards uh we also worked in glogle

405
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,519
classroom we didn't do that in the first

406
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:09,639
year but we've used that in the second

407
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:11,720
year and it's worked well and then uh

408
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:15,240
another online learning technique we've

409
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:20,960
used is parck learning platform which is

410
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:24,000
a interactive way um the first year it

411
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,480
did not work quite as well and what we

412
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,599
realized is that we needed to walk

413
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,640
through the program and the questions

414
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:33,599
with our participants and we got much

415
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,880
better results and interaction by doing

416
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,599
that as opposed to just letting them do

417
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,120
that

418
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,240
themselves uh we integrated field trips

419
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:45,079
into the course uh the first year we had

420
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:49,480
three the second year we've had two um

421
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:52,240
this was from in Spring

422
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:55,558
2023 uh and we went to the Northwest

423
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:58,960
streams dinner a very familyfriendly

424
00:18:55,558 --> 00:19:01,319
place where we tour the the restoration

425
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,679
project that they had there and learned

426
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:06,000
a lot about the water cycle uh learned a

427
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,600
lot about forests and how forests are

428
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,558
important to carbon storage and

429
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:13,119
important to maintaining the water

430
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:16,279
quality here in the Pacific

431
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:19,000
Northwest and then more most recently we

432
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:21,759
went to a low tide Beach exploration and

433
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,880
did that on uh Saturday I think it was

434
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:27,119
May 11th it's beautiful day to be at the

435
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,600
beach to observe the low

436
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:31,678
tide um the one one thing that happened

437
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,038
during that event and I don't think any

438
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:37,640
of our participants are going to forget

439
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:40,720
this is quite a ways from Shore we came

440
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,520
across this concrete structure that was

441
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,159
kind of like a grid and it had pools of

442
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:48,879
water in it and there were a lot of

443
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:51,360
marine organisms in this in these pools

444
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,480
of water a lot of starfish uh sea stars

445
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:56,879
a lot of cucumbers um couple fish in

446
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,120
there it was just full of marine life

447
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,320
and if you can see in the distance like

448
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:06,319
way back here is a shoreline so our

449
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:09,200
leader on this field tour felt that uh

450
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:12,158
it was going to be hours before high

451
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,919
tide had reached would reach this area

452
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,080
and she also thought that this was not

453
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,520
natural that these organisms were

454
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:22,279
probably placed there by somebody and so

455
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:25,480
we ended up transporting them back to um

456
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:27,599
safe places closer to the actual

457
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:30,038
waterers Edge and hope that some of them

458
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:33,319
would survive it was also quite a warm

459
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:36,319
day um so it was also illustrating the

460
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:39,960
stress of having higher temperatures and

461
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:42,558
how global climate change is going to be

462
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,279
affecting our marine life during low

463
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:47,319
tide events when you have abnormally

464
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:50,158
warm summer days which we had during the

465
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:50,158
heat dome in

466
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:57,038
2021 uh as part of the the course uh the

467
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:58,759
promoturist do a final project in the

468
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:01,759
climate sewards curriculum is called a

469
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:04,440
Capstone project but um FAL project is a

470
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:07,759
terminology that that is better for our

471
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,400
group um last year they did a wide

472
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,400
variety of projects they worked

473
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,798
individually where they worked some in

474
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:18,440
groups um this participant on here had a

475
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:21,440
background in in health and so she did a

476
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:24,200
booklet specifically on uh climate

477
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,558
change and health uh so salude is the

478
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:31,038
word for help in uh Spanish another one

479
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:34,200
did a video on uh fashion and climate

480
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:37,720
change and uh others specifically worked

481
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:40,759
on um Recycling and very much interested

482
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:43,679
in that uh another participant did

483
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:46,720
specifically on women in science and the

484
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,480
environment and U made kind of a a

485
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,759
little booklet on that that was quite

486
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,640
informative and then we also had a

487
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:56,278
participant that um total P Tiera

488
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,640
everything for the Earth that was a

489
00:21:56,278 --> 00:22:00,038
small book that was for children on how

490
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,559
to learn climate change that was

491
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:04,839
beautifully Illustrated all in Spanish

492
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:07,720
so it's quite exciting to see their

493
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:10,119
their final projects the current group

494
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,240
that we have now they're working on

495
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:14,879
their final

496
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,278
projects at the end of the course we ask

497
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,320
all our participants why they were

498
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:24,200
participating and um this is from 2023

499
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:26,278
their their data and we had 24 that

500
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,038
responded to the survey and the majority

501
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,679
of them are wanting to learn about

502
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:31,200
Solutions

503
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,400
and they're wanting to learn more about

504
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,319
climate science so those the two most

505
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:39,960
popular answers they were able to select

506
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:43,879
all that they felt were revent as the in

507
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:47,200
this survey questions the other um

508
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:49,080
top categories were to meet others that

509
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,600
had similar interests and then to learn

510
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:52,599
more about Community

511
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,200
resilience so this is our graduation

512
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:01,720
class from uh 2023

513
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,558
uh we are here at WS Everett they have

514
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:08,079
their certificates you can see they're

515
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:10,519
all pretty darn happy here's me um

516
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:12,599
here's my colleague Christina and the

517
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:15,759
one thing that's easy for me to point

518
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:19,678
out in this photo is this is very much a

519
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:23,640
family centered program it was last year

520
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,880
it was this year um let's see we've got

521
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,880
two people here I hope you can see my

522
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,480
arrow um

523
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,440
Lorina and Louise so they're a married

524
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:37,440
couple U we have over here we have

525
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:40,159
another married couple and then their

526
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,200
children are also part of this program

527
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,919
that's their son hob um over on the

528
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,080
right we've got another married couple

529
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,679
and then here's one of their sons and

530
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,158
then I think their other son is over

531
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,840
here on the right um mother daughter

532
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,278
pairs

533
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:59,199
siblings um and it's just exciting that

534
00:23:56,278 --> 00:24:01,440
they bring the whole family to learn

535
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,798
about climate change and that they are

536
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,480
thinking about this as a family some of

537
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:08,679
our speakers that I mentioned earlier

538
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,038
this year they brought their brought

539
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:12,320
their Partners brought their spouses

540
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:15,519
with them when they came to present at

541
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,759
the course and so family is so important

542
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:19,480
to this in

543
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:21,599
community and designing the work that we

544
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:25,519
do to make it very

545
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:29,158
familyfriendly and appealing to all

546
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:31,558
ages um some of our prom tours last year

547
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:34,000
were selected to be interns over the

548
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:36,879
summer uh they went to a couple

549
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,440
different fairs and and carnivals and

550
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,240
they had a um what we call a climate

551
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,278
wheel and um people at the festival

552
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,798
would spin that and they get a question

553
00:24:44,278 --> 00:24:48,720
about climate change and uh they'd

554
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:51,240
answer three questions if they got them

555
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,880
all right with some guidance with with

556
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,240
the person that was Manning the booth

557
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,200
they get a small

558
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,480
prize um here on the bottom these are

559
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,480
like compost bins that we were giving

560
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:05,159
out as part of this

561
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:08,079
event uh in the fall in 2023 we had a

562
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:10,360
climate Carnival where we specifically

563
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:13,038
had lots of different tables and booths

564
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:15,038
with different types of activities for

565
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:19,519
them to learn about climate change in a

566
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:20,960
very interactive way um that uh part

567
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,759
that we did in our class where we did

568
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,600
the heat trapping blanket and show the

569
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:26,119
different blankets and how that mimics

570
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:28,278
what's happening to the earth that is

571
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:31,759
one of the activities that we demon

572
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:31,759
demonstrated during the climate

573
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:36,119
Carnival so some of the feedback that we

574
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,840
got from our

575
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:40,839
promus um I'll read these in Spanish and

576
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:43,798
then I'll say briefly what what they

577
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,798
translate to

578
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,960
muchas so this is thank you for

579
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,799
everything this is one of the best

580
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,798
experiences that happened to me in the

581
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:59,359
past

582
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:59,359
year migusto

583
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:08,639
thank you for educating us about this

584
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,440
topic I mean so appreciative that we

585
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,240
were doing this for them that we're

586
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:19,120
making information available in Spanish

587
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:21,960
uh one thing I will Hammer home on is

588
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:25,079
that it is not enough just to translate

589
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:28,720
information to another language you have

590
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:31,678
to directly engage with that community

591
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,000
to help them learn to help them to work

592
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:38,559
with them to understand be involved and

593
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,839
cocreate The Learning Experience some

594
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:43,319
people reading is not their thing and

595
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:46,639
they're not going to read it and I was

596
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:48,759
at a conference last week and someone

597
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,759
who said to me who's from the Latina

598
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:53,558
Community you know printing a bunch of

599
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:56,640
translated materials is just a waste of

600
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:58,879
paper um so you need to interact you

601
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,759
need to engage and you need to make get

602
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:05,679
Hands-On um these are the impacts from a

603
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:07,960
prur 2023 class we had 23 promotur

604
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,320
Delina graduates eight of them were

605
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:13,600
selected to be interns in

606
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:16,439
2023 they had over uh direct

607
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:18,879
conversations with over 300 community

608
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,558
members this is in SN homish County and

609
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,240
we believe we really raised the

610
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:25,678
awareness about climate change and what

611
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,319
we need to do is talk more about it if

612
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,159
you look over here on the right of the

613
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:32,759
screen you can say um whoops that the

614
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:34,559
majority of them they shifted their

615
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:36,200
opinion from before the course to after

616
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:37,798
the course and their thoughts about you

617
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,558
know what we need to do about climate

618
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:44,158
change and their their feelings of

619
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:46,119
empowerment uh Lessons Learned you know

620
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,840
it takes time to build these

621
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:50,639
relationships I have been working on

622
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:54,079
different educational programs with the

623
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:57,278
Latina Community for about eight years

624
00:27:54,079 --> 00:28:01,240
now and um you know it's it's taken that

625
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:03,440
much time to make it so that I am uh a

626
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,120
respected member of the community that

627
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,000
knows that I'm not going to just

628
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:08,959
disappear when the funding's gone and

629
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,440
only going to show up again when I have

630
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,480
another project that I want them to do

631
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,360
you have to make things inter

632
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:19,079
intergenerational so that it appeals to

633
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:21,558
um teens to grandparents is what I say

634
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:23,720
has to be fun engaging and

635
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:25,879
interactive and and one thing that I've

636
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:29,079
noticed is is talking about climate

637
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:31,960
change it can be extremely depressing it

638
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:36,000
can be very heavy but with this group it

639
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:38,600
seems lighter we're having these hard

640
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,558
conversations but there seems to be more

641
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:46,079
optimism more empowerment that we can

642
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:48,839
actually do something about this problem

643
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:50,918
um this is my team uh this is Christina

644
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:53,599
here in the middle this is Leonor who

645
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:56,600
does child care and this is Molina U

646
00:28:53,599 --> 00:29:00,158
Molina's in Spain currently uh learning

647
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:01,839
to be bilingual in Spanish in English

648
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,000
and right now her mom's helping me so

649
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:07,519
just another idea of how the family

650
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,558
sticks together and then the extreme

651
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:12,839
number of people that have helped with

652
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:15,558
this project um I'm probably leaving

653
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:18,119
somebody off this list but we had over a

654
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:20,240
dozen people on the C3PO team that we

655
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:22,839
were meeting monthly we had an Advisory

656
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,038
Board um some of the Advisory Board were

657
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:27,720
people that responded to that email

658
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:30,359
blast I sent on out on Election Day in

659
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,798
201 20 and then we each had different

660
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:34,839
partners that worked with us there's my

661
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:36,720
contact information and I'll leave it up

662
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:38,079
to Jenny if there's time for maybe one

663
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,319
or two

664
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:42,038

question Scott thank you for

685
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:43,240
that I don't know that we really did

686
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:45,479
that I mean one hard part about this is

687
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:50,679
the Spanish speaking community that I'm

688
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:53,240
reaching to they are extremely diverse

689
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:55,639
in terms of their life experiences how

690
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,720
they ended up in the United States the

691
00:30:55,638 --> 00:31:03,759
the countries that they come from I mean

692
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:07,038
all of that is just um it's a lot to

693
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:09,398
handle and I think this is a great idea

694
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:11,038
for for future work and I appreciate

695
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:13,439

696
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:17,000

698
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,278

703
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:32,558

704
