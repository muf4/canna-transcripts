1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,199
University hello this is a closer look

3
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:15,399
at hemp micropropagation my name is Adam

4
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,679
Ganon and my wonderful partner for this

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,240
project was UD

6
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:22,719
Patel for a little bit of history on

7
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,959
hemp micropropagation uh there wasn't

8
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,160
really any published research on have

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,839
Micro propagation before the late 1990s

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,359
due to the illegal status of the

11
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:33,320
cannabis plant the first published work

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,600
was done by rali and mandolino in the

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,039
late '90s that I could

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,239
find and then as regulations and

15
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:43,119
legislation have become more lenient

16
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:45,599
research efforts on H micropropagation

17
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:48,479
have increased and gained traction into

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,079
the late 2000s the first systems for H

19
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:54,519
micro propagation being published in

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,198
2009 So currently all kinds of different

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,120
aspects of hemp propagation are studied

22
00:00:56,198 --> 00:01:02,079
including different media types photo

23
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:04,759
period anoint synthesis genetic

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,400
variation among other

25
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,600
things and some great work has even been

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,400
done by our excellent teachers Dr virin

27
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,599
and

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,680
Victor so who would like to Mich

29
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,759
propagate

30
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,880
hemp first place I thought of was

31
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:21,200
nurseries and professional propagators

32
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,078
so this is becoming more specialized I

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,200
would say as the hemp industry continues

34
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:28,798
to legalize in different states and

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,879
countries but probably not yet a lot of

36
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,520
professional hemp propag

37
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,640
ators another place would be commercial

38
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,560
cultivators in the Cannabis space so

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,159
commercial cannabis operations may want

40
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,079
to use

41
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,079
micropropagation as a way to preserve

42
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:44,639
clean genetics uh these genetics could

43
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,239
be of high value for

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,799
them and then so obviously researchers

45
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:52,199
places like the USDA Cornell and several

46
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,399
other universities micropropagated hemp

47
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,200
for various research

48
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,359
purposes and finally maybe

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,320
hobbyists I had a friend I met back when

50
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,000
I started growing cannabis who was

51
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,559
trying to micro propagate hemp I don't

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,519
know four or five years ago uh just at

53
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,759
home still something I've never tried to

54
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,479
do I was impressed by that always but uh

55
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:15,559
do you know anyone who has done hemp M

56
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,560
micropropagation as a

57
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,160
hobby why would someone micro propagate

58
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,560
hemp there are many reasons to micro

59
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:25,799
propagate hemp so a few of these include

60
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,840
rapid clonal propagation genetic

61
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,160
preservation sanitation of a mother

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,360
stock space preservation Canon

63
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,598
production as a solution to poor

64
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,560
germination

65
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,318
rates so of these genetic preservation

66
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,800
and sanitation of the mother plants are

67
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:43,639
of growing importance in the commercial

68
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,120
cannabis industry right

69
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:48,479
now the first and one of the most

70
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,959
important steps in micropropagation is

71
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,679
selection of the source or a stock plant

72
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,319
um as mentioned in the previous slide

73
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,800
there could be many reasons to micro

74
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,518
propagate so selecting Source material

75
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,040
based on the right reason is the first

76
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:02,439
step

77
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:04,639
the stock plant or Source material has

78
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:07,039
been selected good sterilization

79
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,798
Protocols are utilized and specific

80
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:12,759
selections of the stock plant are

81
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:12,760
selected as xplants for further

82
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,959
culture here we will go over some common

83
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,439
supplied used in the micropropagation

84
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:22,199
process starting with the laminer flood

85
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,280
this workbench uses a continuous stream

86
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:26,919
of air pass through a HEPA filter to

87
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,080
maintain an Airborne contaminant free

88
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:31,399
space following that we have a petery

89
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,159
dish for easy propagule

90
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,438
handling the micro bead sterilizer uses

91
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,519
very hot glass beads to sterilize tools

92
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:39,840
between

93
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,799
usages in arranging in this picture we

94
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,120
have four steps of varying lengths along

95
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:47,760
with a small razor blade for ease of

96
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,599
cutting and this is a closeup of a set

97
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,158
of forceps that have tooth tips um I

98
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:54,158
find this particularly useful when

99
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:57,359
handling delicate

100
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:59,280
stems finally 70% ethanol is a simple

101
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,720
and cost effective way to sterilize a

102
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,719
workspace

103
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:06,359
for the containers in media we've had

104
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,840
good success with both test tubes and

105
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,720
magenta boxes the test tubes are

106
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,280
particularly good for long-term growth

107
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,598
since they accommodate hemp's vertical

108
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,560
growth habit while the magenta box is

109
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:18,839
nice since it offers a larger space to

110
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,280
start multiple cuttings in without all

111
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,119
of the extra hassle of setting up

112
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,399
individual culturing

113
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:29,720
vessels for the growth media uh Mig and

114
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:29,719
skoo has worked well for us

115
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:33,120
setting up your workspace correctly

116
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,839
within the flo hood is important to

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,000
avoid creating turbulent air currents

118
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:38,478
that might bring in contaminants

119
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,319
pictured on the left is a cluttered

120
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,159
bench toop while on the right adequate

121
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,959
space and clearance has been made to

122
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,759
allow for good air flow to understand

123
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:49,638
good Flowood technique let's take a look

124
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,680
at some examples of what not to do in

125
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,680
the first image Adam's Body is too far

126
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,918
into the flood and is likely causing

127
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,160
turbulent air currents over his

128
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,198
workspace in the middle image another

129
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,520
container is open under Adam's right arm

130
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,478
and he runs the risk of it being

131
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,399
contaminated as he works over

132
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:08,279
it in the final image the culture vessel

133
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,638
is being worked on too close to the edge

134
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:12,519
of the flood where its Effectiveness is

135
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,840
being

136
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:17,319
reduced good flood technique can be

137
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:19,719
summed up in the single image here we

138
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:21,680
can see Adam's Body is out of the flood

139
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,000
with the material being worked on deeper

140
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,400
within the hood and Adam's arms are

141
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,439
extended to work on the plants at that

142
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,519
location the container here is closed so

143
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:34,199
now accidental contamination can occur

144
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,719
before it is ready to be worked

145
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,720
with the micropropagation workflow

146
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,440
begins with removing the xplant onto a

147
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,560
clean work surface in our case we used

148
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:46,319
an autoclave petri dish the two forceps

149
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,519
were particularly useful when trying to

150
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,120
manipulate tender stems at this

151
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:54,279
stage to subculture our xplant we needed

152
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,240
a small fragment of the current plant

153
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:58,559
typically a segment with two nodes is

154
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,120
sufficient and here is the result of one

155
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,439
cutting being prepared for

156
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,478
subculturing now to add the prople to

157
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,959
the culture vessel it isn't necessary to

158
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:09,918
insert a node into the media the only

159
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:11,719
requirement is enough stem tissue is

160
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:12,959
inserted to hold the cutting upright as

161
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,199
it develops

162
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,159
Roots a crucial final step in the

163
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,560
micropropagation process is sealing and

164
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,680
labeling your containers sealing can be

165
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,439
done by wrapping plastic wrap or paril

166
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,280
at the lid to vessel Junction Point

167
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:27,879
labeling can either be done directly on

168
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:30,000
the container or the tray holding or

169
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:31,759
culture vessels

170
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,279
hemp's preferred lighting at this growth

stage is 100 to 300 ppfs per square

172
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:40,519
meter lighting should be kept at the 18

173
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,279
hours on 6 hours off Mark to ensure the

174
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:43,560
plants remain in a vegetative state and

175
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:46,399
don't start

176
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,720
flowering warm attempts are preferred 76

177
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,318
to 80° Fahrenheit is a good range um but

178
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,919
while the conditions I described are the

179
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:54,400
optimal ones hemp in the

180
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:56,120
micropropagation environment will

181
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:59,959
tolerate lower lighting and varying

182
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,959
temperatures to an extent
