1
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:18,160
um hi everyone I'm Ruby wiel I use she

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,000
her pronouns um I'm the policy and

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:26,480
research manager at climate exchange and

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,679
I will just pull up um my slides start

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,200
the slideshow um so I will primarily

6
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:34,359
Focus on the dashboard but also wanted

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:38,559
to give an overview of who climate

8
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:43,159
exchange is and we have three programs

9
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:45,679
um so climate exchange is uh an

10
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:50,038
organization focused on state level

11
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:54,238
climate mitigation policy um we are do

12
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:56,558
have a 50 state scope but um don't

13
00:00:54,238 --> 00:01:00,078
really work on local policy or federal

14
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:02,518
policy um it is primarily at the state

15
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,439
level um we have a mission to achieve a

16
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:06,640
rapid and Equitable transition towards

17
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:09,959
zero emissions economy by advancing

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,200
State climate policy um and we do this

19
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:15,280
through three programs um our State

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,320
climate policy Network or scpn our State

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,000
climate policy dashboard um and we also

22
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:26,399
have a pro bono policy assistance

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,920
program um so first up the scpn um is a

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,280
network of over 15,000 Advocates

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,799
legislators government officials

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,079
Business Leaders researchers and more um

27
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,280
all sorts of people working on climate

28
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:42,599
policy uh and kind of related issues and

29
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,718
and policies in their states looking to

30
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:49,199
reduce emissions and and put forward

31
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:51,478
strong and Equitable policy um we do

32
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,840
have all 50 states represented in the

33
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:59,399
network um we do also have a lot of uh

34
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,560
people like who are interested in

35
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,399
learning out State policy but that might

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,399
not be their main focus uh we do have

37
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:12,239
people um who primarily focus on local

38
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:16,878
policy federal policy um but the bulk of

39
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:20,280
our network is um uh State policy makers

40
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:23,679
and NGO uh

41
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,800
Advocates um a couple of uh pieces of

42
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,280
programming that we do through the scpn

43
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,439
uh we have monthly webinars um sometimes

44
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,280
more than one month uh these kind of

45
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:37,318
provided a deeper dive into a specific

46
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:41,400
topic or policy uh we just had one last

47
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:44,039
week on uh datadriven climate

48
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,000
Communications um so sometimes they're

49
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:49,158
more broad but other times they do focus

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,519
on specific policies like uh methane

51
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:57,039
abatement or um we have a transmission

52
00:02:52,519 --> 00:03:00,640
focused series on how State policy can

53
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:04,959
uh kind of Reform and build out the the

54
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:07,279
country's transmission system um we also

55
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,598
uh have monthly National calls the last

56
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,280
Wednesday of every month um this is

57
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:16,359
where people uh on the ground in their

58
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,840
states will provide updates on uh like

59
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,840
what's going on in their state what are

60
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,560
the most relevant bills under

61
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,920
consideration rules regulations um kind

62
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,519
of where F's attention is in the climate

63
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:31,518
movement in their states um it's a great

64
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,280
way to connect with people across the

65
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,039
country learn what other states are

66
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,919
doing how it might be relevant to your

67
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:40,639
state um and we also have expert

68
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:43,280
presentations at the beginning of those

69
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:46,679
so people can come on and and give an

70
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:50,959
overview of a tool or report or resource

71
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:53,319
um that they'd like to share um we also

72
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,400
have a bi-weekly newsletter um we'll

73
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:59,560
share articles in that uh policy

74
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,519
resources I also draft a lot of state

75
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:07,079
and federal policy updates um focused on

76
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,438
climate policy um so another way that we

77
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:12,159
serve to be a resource uh to our

78
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:14,078
audience um the last thing is you'll see

79
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,079
there's the pro Bona policy assistance

80
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:19,879
access to peers and expert

81
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,960
connections um this kind of ties into

82
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:27,360
our assistance program um so we do

83
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:30,279
provide pro bono policy assistance um we

84
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,400
can do anything from provide

85
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:35,559
uh like example States and and model

86
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:39,679
States uh as well as model rules for a

87
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:45,000
given policy so say you're interested in

88
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:47,360
um solar sighting uh we can provide uh

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,240
best practices for that if there are

90
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,840
model rules um we can share those with

91
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,400
you we have part we can connect you to

92
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:59,000
folks who do draft those model rules uh

93
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,519
we can also help with identifying gaps

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,439
and opportunity ities uh in your State's

95
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,639
climate policy landscape um and then a

96
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:10,160
big thing that we do through the network

97
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:13,280
is uh provide connections to um either

98
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,039
experts or other people working uh in

99
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:19,359
your state or in other states that have

100
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:22,599
uh maybe like similar uh policy issues

101
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:26,840
maybe economic drivers um that type of

102
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:29,800
thing so um the network and this

103
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:31,758
assistance program is a great way to get

104
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,720
connected to people in your state get

105
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:39,319
connected to experts um learn more about

106
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:42,560
uh specific policies and topics um and

107
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:46,319
we do also like to um complete a lot of

108
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,759
these requests ourself um I've helped

109
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:52,080
with uh landscape analyses Bill

110
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:55,280
drafting um research to identify best

111
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:58,079
practices um all those types of things

112
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,879
so uh you can email one of my colleagues

113
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:03,879
Kristen who is our scpn manager manager

114
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:06,399
um or you can also on the dashboard

115
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:09,439
website you can directly request uh

116
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:11,519
policy assistance to through that so um

117
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:14,598
I'll make sure you have the links and

118
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:17,719
the our contact information if you are

119
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:21,360
interested um this is just a a quick

120
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,840
example of uh something we've done um

121
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:29,080
through the assistance program so uh

122
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:30,879
someone who is a new uh state agency

123
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:34,240
Environmental Justice staffer kind of

124
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:36,959
what first position of its kind in a

125
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,879
state um reached out for kind of two

126
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:42,959
reasons uh the state didn't really have

127
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:45,439
a Statewide strategy to attract Federal

128
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,719
funding um and again it was a new

129
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:50,399
position created uh they kind of wanted

130
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,960
to learn what other states are doing um

131
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:56,918
and how they can learn um from those

132
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:59,079
best practices so uh we identified

133
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:00,038
similar States based on political and

134
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:03,439
economic

135
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:06,560
contexts uh we provided connections to

136
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,879
technical assistance providers around uh

137
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,918
Federal funding

138
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:14,720
um uh a lot of people do provide

139
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:17,240
technical assistance to secure Federal

140
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,840
funding and and help strategize around

141
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:25,439
that um also identified some best

142
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:28,478
practices of uh EJ positions and uh

143
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,519
offices within state governments um and

144
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,159
then provided some connection

145
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:37,318
connections to State and local um

146
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:39,840
organizations who uh could kind of help

147
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,479
uh guide the strategy around

148
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,239
environmental justice and adjust

149
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:48,878
transition in the state um we also

150
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:54,038
identified uh like connections

151
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:57,280
to uh people in similar States uh we

152
00:07:54,038 --> 00:08:02,478
provided examples of what an EJ office

153
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:04,359
or EJ position can look like um and uh

154
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,878
identified some kind of similar

155
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:11,439
positions in other states as well so

156
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:13,879
this is kind of a different topics uh

157
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,918
obviously based on what people request

158
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:19,919
but kind of a common way we approach

159
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:25,639
these um both doing in-house research

160
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:25,639
and then connecting folks to um relevant

161
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,959
actors um

162
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:35,639
okay um on to the dashboard so the

163
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,519
climate exchange also runs the State

164
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:40,319
climate policy dashboard I'll just call

165
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:43,719
it the dashboard from now on um it's an

166
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:47,240
online tool that provides uh information

167
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:50,879
on 62 level 62 State level climate

168
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,480
policies across all 50 states um these

169
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:57,799
policies span seven sectors which I'll

170
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:00,839
get into um in a little bit um but it's

171
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:03,919
designed to kind of provide an overview

172
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:06,079
of what uh your State's policy landscape

173
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:08,679
is and help you identify policy

174
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:11,159
opportunities to increase your State's

175
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:13,599
climate ambition and reduce emissions

176
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:16,319
equitably um a couple highlights it's

177
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,240
free and accessible um like I said

178
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:23,000
information on 62 policies across all 50

179
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:25,600
states um we do want this and make sure

180
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,679
that it's regularly updated and it's

181
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,399
it's accurate it's ground truthed by uh

182
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:32,838
folks in theet networ who are working

183
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:37,278
directly on these policies and in their

184
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:41,120
states um we relaunched the dashboard to

185
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:44,399
its own site um in October of this past

186
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:48,039
year um and so that made it a lot easier

187
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,519
to update it regularly um so we had the

188
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:53,799
launch in October we just did a big

189
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,278
content update at the end of January um

190
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:58,958
and then from there we're going to do

191
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:01,639
kind of a six-month uh Cadence so the

192
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:06,639
next up date is planned for June or July

193
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:09,480
I would say um and it's a big uh kind of

194
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,439
consolidator of resources uh we feature

195
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,560
resources from over a 100

196
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,839
organizations um and like I said we

197
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:19,159
crowdsource a lot of data um from the

198
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,600
scpn and and from um other organizations

199
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:24,519
as

200
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:27,959
well um a really brief overview of the

201
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:29,799
policy framework um you might recognize

202
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:32,119
a lot of the sector-based

203
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:36,078
policy areas uh climate governance and

204
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:38,759
Equity focuses on how states are setting

205
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,319
uh emission reduction targets um how

206
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:44,278
they're reporting on those creating

207
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:47,040
climate plans building out State uh

208
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:50,320
government capacity to address climate

209
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:54,599
policy environmental justice um how to

210
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,200
in integrate an EJ Into Climate policy

211
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,639
um as well as a handful of just

212
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,320
transition policies and then cross

213
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:04,519
sector f focuses on economy-wide

214
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,720
policies and policies that span multiple

215
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:09,320
sectors uh a common one is carbon

216
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,639
pricing that can just be in one sector

217
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,000
or it can be

218
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,560
economy-wide um and then we have

219
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,839
electricity buildings and efficiency

220
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:20,679
Transportation industry and natur and

221
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,000
working lands um there's a couple ways

222
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:25,000
to see that full policy framework um you

223
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,399
can go to our methodology page we have

224
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,559
an all policies page um you can also on

225
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,078
a specific State page if you scroll down

226
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:36,439
to the big data table uh which I'll show

227
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,439
you in a little bit um you can see the

228
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,120
full list of those 62

229
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:44,639
policies as

230
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:47,240
well um really quickly on the

231
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:50,440
methodology um a lot of the information

232
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,278
is manually tracked um as well as

233
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:57,000
through secondary research we have some

234
00:11:53,278 --> 00:12:00,240
organizations who uh contributed some

235
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,879
data um they do some policy tracking and

236
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,120
uh most notably spot for clean energy

237
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:08,039
develops policy components um and so

238
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,679
we've Incorporated some of their policy

239
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:13,399
components and and data um into the

240
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:15,638
dashboard as well and you can see this

241
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:20,480
shaded map just is providing a really

242
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:23,440
high level uh landscape of uh number of

243
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,360
enacted policies so you can see a lot of

244
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,920
the well-known climate leaders are are

245
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:32,240
in darker colors um and then shading

246
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:32,240
kind of varies across the

247
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:38,799
country um so some key features you can

248
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:40,799
identify State policy opportunities uh

249
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:44,879
you can explore the status of those

250
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:46,639
policies by state um or by policy you

251
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,838
can identify the whole 50 state

252
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,959
landscape uh we do have four different

253
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,040
statuses um we have enacted so the

254
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:58,559
policy exists it's on the books in the

255
00:12:55,039 --> 00:13:00,919
state um in progress is kind of it's a

256
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:04,278
policy that has been established but

257
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:07,439
maybe final rules or regulations or a

258
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:11,000
plan is f pending P final

259
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,320
approval um an example of this is in

260
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,720
Oregon the uh legislature passed

261
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,760
legislation requiring the development of

262
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:23,160
an environmental justice mapping tool um

263
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:25,799
by I think October of next year so

264
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:28,120
legislation requires that tool to be

265
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,159
developed but it's not currently it's

266
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,278
under development now so that's an

267
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,919
example of what's in progress we're not

268
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:37,039
a policy tracker in the sense you'll see

269
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:40,278
bills under consideration in the

270
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:42,559
legislates uh this session but there are

271
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:46,519
some policies where they're required to

272
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:50,399
be finalized um so we do feature some of

273
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:52,560
those uh partially enacted refers to the

274
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,320
policies with components and it means

275
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,879
that some components are fulfilled but

276
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,879
not others and then not enacted means it

277
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:02,720
doesn't exist in the state um

278
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:05,399
and that can either just be binary yes

279
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,560
or no for the non-component based

280
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,600
policies um or four components it means

281
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:13,319
that zero components are

282
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,600
enacted um you can also identify keep

283
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,278
policy opportunities that's a future

284
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,600
we're going to be building out over time

285
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:24,958
kind of identifying the highest impact

286
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:27,440
policies um a state can either enact or

287
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,679
increase their ambition for uh you can

288
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,720
sort and filter States and policy by

289
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:36,198
status by year region and more um and

290
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,360
then we also provide State specific

291
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:42,278
summaries and establishing policies and

292
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,199
we link directly out to those um so

293
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:47,039
before the dashboard I found it really

294
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:49,439
difficult to find all of the actual

295
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:52,439
pieces of legislation rules and

296
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,000
regulations that uh establish these

297
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,800
policies so we uh made it really easy

298
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,078
for everyone to directly find those and

299
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:05,198
and uh View view the policy text itself

300
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:08,479
if interested um we also provide state

301
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:10,879
level emission projections through 2050

302
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,720
um this is using energy Innovation and

303
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:16,159
rmi's energy policy

304
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,240
simulator um right now uh business as

305
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:21,600
usual projections are featured on the

306
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,320
site for most pages but um as we build

307
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,519
out the key policy opportunities you'll

308
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:30,240
be able to see how

309
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:32,120
um how a state if they enacted those

310
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,399
opportunities how the emission

311
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,600
projections could change um we also

312
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:41,278
provide a lot of resources to further

313
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,759
your learning and understanding of the

314
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:47,958
policies and and how to enact them in

315
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:51,318
your state so we um identify State

316
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:54,638
examples um we have Key Resources listed

317
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:57,639
on all policy pages and then where they

318
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,680
exist we do also link out to uh model

319
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:02,879
rules so these are kind of

320
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:04,919
template uh policies that you can fill

321
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,480
in the blanks and adjust the language as

322
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:10,559
needed and as desired um but really

323
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,560
helps with a lot of that policy drafting

324
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,719
um and as I mentioned you can re request

325
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:16,638
technical assistance directly from

326
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,680
climate exchange uh through the

327
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,120
dashboard um that's both more of the

328
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,758
policy and research examples I provided

329
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,399
and then connections to experts and

330
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:29,480
advocates in your

331
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:33,480
state um I think that's it for the

332
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,159
slides um I'm also aware of the time but

333
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,159
I can

334
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:41,240
briefly um

335
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:43,399
just uh walk through the dashboard and I

336
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:47,959
do also want to

337
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:50,639
see where folks are um if I want

338
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:54,278
to

339
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:57,759
uh uh Kentucky Washington Minnesota

340
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:59,679
Georgia New Hampshire North Carolina

341
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,079
okay um

342
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,038
I'll do North Carolina because there are

343
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:05,678
some

344
00:17:03,038 --> 00:17:08,759
interesting uh things to highlight

345
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:13,600
there uh but this is the homepage I said

346
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:14,919
you can see our uh oh actually I won't

347
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,759
do North

348
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:20,240
Carolina uh Rebecca will cover North

349
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:23,439
Carolina um I'll do another state uh let

350
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,400
me just pull up that list again um I'll

351
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,199
do maybe Minnesota and we do have a

352
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,559
state comparison tool so I'll throw in

353
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:34,000
some other states as well

354
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:36,038
um uh if you want to go to the all

355
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,640
policies page you just click on policies

356
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:40,359
if you want to learn more about who our

357
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,960
partners and contributors are you can go

358
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:44,879
there the methodology will kind of

359
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:47,600
explain our policy tracking methods how

360
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,440
we developed these shadings all of that

361
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:53,279
um and you can see we have definitions

362
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,919
of what those statuses are um if you

363
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:59,200
just hover over you can see a really

364
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:02,440
high level summary of just the statuses

365
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:06,720
um across the 62

366
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:09,120
policies um I'll go to Minnesota um the

367
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,360
one it says partially enacted is that

368
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:14,558
like P like the legislature but is

369
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:17,158
signed by the governor or um yeah that's

370
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:20,879
a good question I'll go down to

371
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:25,120
electricity um so you can see we use uh

372
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,720
we do incorporate some spot data um they

373
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,639
are a great resource they develop policy

374
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,200
components that look

375
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,520
that kind of break a specific policy

376
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:38,120
down into

377
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:39,679
more uh granular aspects of its design

378
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:42,439
um I'm not sure if you can see for the

379
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,400
screen sharing but if you hover over the

380
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,759
bars you can see what those components

381
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:51,360
are and then we do link out directly to

382
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:54,038
spots website so you can um view the

383
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:56,359
sources for those you can see uh very

384
00:18:54,038 --> 00:18:59,720
easily what components are fulfilled or

385
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:02,240
what's not um so partially Ed just means

386
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,798
that some components are enacted and

387
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:09,519
some are not um so it can it ranges a

388
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:13,759
lot in terms of what the state uh what

389
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:17,720
the components look like across States

390
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:19,480
um but yeah looking at just the specific

391
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,038
policies with components would be

392
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:25,319
partially enacted so Ruby you're looking

393
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:29,240
right now at Minnesota's policies right

394
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:32,158
Soh and only of the renewable energy

395
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,798
section or all related to

396
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:38,720
climate yeah so I just clicked

397
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:41,599
electricity um if you wanted to only

398
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,720
look at one policy area you could click

399
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:45,798
on these so I clicked on electricity and

400
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,279
it brought me down to the table you can

401
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:52,119
see it's only filtered by the

402
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:56,119
electricity policy area um if I wanted

403
00:19:52,119 --> 00:20:01,199
to uh undo that you could see it's a

404
00:19:56,119 --> 00:20:03,599
full list of the 62 policy is um kind of

405
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,919
presented in the order that I showed on

406
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:09,918
the slides um so you can see at least in

407
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:14,280
clate governance and Equity the state is

408
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:16,600
uh it has most policies enacted um the

409
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:20,918
state uh does have a green Bank it

410
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:24,240
doesn't have carbon pricing um it has a

411
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:27,080
clean energy standard um you can you if

412
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,558
you wanted to you could filter by your

413
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:31,639
enacted uh C being the most recent ones

414
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:36,119
uh

415
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:38,880
2024 um you can also expand these rows

416
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:41,759
like I said and and see those

417
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,320
specific uh the policy description in

418
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:48,240
the state um as well as we do link out

419
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:51,558
directly to those um pieces of

420
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:55,079
legislation if it's like a a report or

421
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:56,399
some type of tool um then we do link out

422
00:20:55,079 --> 00:21:00,480
to those as

423
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:04,798
well um all I'll go maybe to a policy

424
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,880
page quickly um so we provide uh a brief

425
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,798
summary of the policy here you can

426
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,760
request that policy assistance you can

427
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:14,000
see the map across all 50 states and the

428
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:16,400
status um this is one that's not

429
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,798
component based right now so it the only

430
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:23,159
statuses are enacted or not enacted um

431
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:25,720
here are some key resources that kind of

432
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:28,278
focus on emission reduction targets how

433
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:32,038
they can be designed well kind of a lot

434
00:21:28,278 --> 00:21:34,960
of reports on uh how states are doing to

435
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:37,640
meet those targets uh we have some model

436
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,600
States uh Colorado for example is one of

437
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:44,440
the only states that has uh uh targets

438
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:48,678
every five years starting 2025 through

439
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:50,759
2050 um so that's a model State um and

440
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:55,200
then also highlight some of the more

441
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:57,200
ambitious States as well um here is how

442
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,360
you could see the full 50 state

443
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,319
landscape um if if you only wanted to

444
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:04,399
see which ones are enacted you could

445
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:06,960
filter by that um you can expand all of

446
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,000
them see how they compare uh their

447
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,038
targets what their Baseline years are um

448
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,839
all of that and then a nice feature is

449
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:17,679
you can download this um if it's

450
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:22,278
something that you've filtered the

451
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:24,038
download will only download like The the

452
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:27,119
table shown so if you only wanted

453
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:29,079
enacted you could uh specifically

454
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:31,038
download this table if you wanted the

455
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:34,278
full 50 state list you could do that as

456
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:37,679
well um and another thing that's nice is

457
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:40,759
you'll see that the URLs also change as

458
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:43,640
you filter and sort stuff so if you

459
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:46,000
wanted to share um the list of the 25

460
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,880
states with targets uh you could just

461
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,480
directly copy this and and share it and

462
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,919
uh the page will open up uh to this

463
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:57,519
filter

464
00:22:53,919 --> 00:23:00,400
table um I will very very quickly go

465
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:02,519
over the state comparison tool cuz um

466
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,559
this is one of my favorite features uh

467
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,639
you can select up to four states and as

468
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:10,079
many policies as you want and just see a

469
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,640
sidebyside comparison um we also

470
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:17,319
feature um the model States and the

471
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:21,240
model rules on this as well so I

472
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:23,200
do I remember Minnesota

473
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,038
um yep

474
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:30,159
Washington

475
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:35,599
Kentucky uh and uh

476
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:38,000
Georgia okay cool um I'll do maybe

477
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:40,079
buildings and

478
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,119
electricity um maybe some climate

479
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:44,519
governance and equity in there as well

480
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:49,639
um I'll do just uh emission reduction

481
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:51,319
targets um as kind of a baseline policy

482
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,440
uh maybe clean energy

483
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:58,079
standards um I will show maybe a

484
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:02,720
component based policy as well and then

485
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:05,639
I'll do maybe like Pace um to get a

486
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,960
broad sense of them uh so this is a

487
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,440
state comparison tool it also has the

488
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:13,960
customized URLs um if you wanted to

489
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:17,038
share those and you'll see just a high

490
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,440
Lev side-by-side comparison uh between

491
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:23,240
the four states and the policies I've

492
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,840
selected um you can see the model States

493
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:28,000
um if you wanted to click on that it

494
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:31,240
would bring you to a state page again um

495
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,599
but uh you can see there is kind of a

496
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:38,319
variety in what the programs are um

497
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:41,359
Georgia most recently enacted Pace

498
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:43,720
enabling legislation um whereas uh

499
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:46,759
Kentucky Minnesota and Washington their

500
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,399
policies uh kind of have their Pace

501
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:51,119
programs have been established for a

502
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:54,119
while can you describe Pace just briefly

503
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:58,599
for people what is Pace what does it do

504
00:24:54,119 --> 00:25:02,959
um it provides like clean energy Finance

505
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:07,759
ing that's tied to the property value um

506
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:12,558
so it's kind of a financing mechanism to

507
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:16,200
uh uh make like energy efficiency

508
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:18,319
improvements um you can also see all the

509
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,880
states have net metering partially

510
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:22,599
enacted um Minnesota is kind of

511
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,480
Minnesota and Washington are kind of the

512
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:29,639
farthest along whereas in

513
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:32,839
Georgia they the states utilities are

514
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,840
required to offer a net metering program

515
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:38,798
and distributed generation Technologies

516
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:41,599
are eligible but uh they're missing a

517
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:44,960
lot of the other components in the state

518
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:47,558
um and lastly I'll just highlight um

519
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,159
where they exist we do also link

520
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:52,839
directly out to the model rules um so if

521
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,480
you were in Georgia and Kentucky and

522
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:57,959
said my state doesn't have a clean

523
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:01,319
energy standard or renewable portfolio

524
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:05,079
standard but we're interested in that um

525
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:08,398
this model law for example could uh help

526
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:11,158
with a lot of that Baseline Drafting and

527
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:15,158
the model language in

528
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:19,240
there um so I'll stop there um I'm happy

529
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:22,440
to answer questions in the chat um or

530
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,679
time permitting um at the end of that

531
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,679
but thank you so

532
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:30,960
much that was wonderful Ruby thank you

533
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:34,480
Rebecca you start your screen share and

534
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:38,120
I'll put the poll so yeah hi guys my

535
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,720
name is Rebecca delamora I am a senior

536
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:41,879
policy Analyst at the North Carolina

537
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,919
clean energy oh I'll put that like that

538
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:47,840
hold on I was like there we go okay

539
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:49,120
that's better um I'm a senior policy

540
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:52,798
Analyst at the North Carolina clean

541
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:54,278
energy Technology Center and first I'm

542
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:55,759
going to go over kind of what the center

543
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:57,759
does and then I'm going to get into like

544
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:00,798
Ruby did a kind of tutorial and quick

545
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:04,839
run through of um our data our database

546
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:06,558
desire so first um the clean text Center

547
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:07,759
we are an extension Center of north of

548
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,158
the College of Engineering at North

549
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,480
Carolina State University so we do

550
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,760
public education and Outreach

551
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,759
specifically related to clean energy the

552
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:19,798
center as a whole has its hands in a lot

553
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:22,319
of Pies I'm on the policy team we also

554
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:24,679
do we also have a training Team Clean

555
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:27,480
Transportation uh clean Power Industrial

556
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:29,360
efficiency AKA engineering and then

557
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,519
across all of those we just do in

558
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:34,079
general extension and engagement

559
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:37,398
work so like I said I'm on the policy

560
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:39,359
team and we do legislative and

561
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:41,158
Regulatory analysis related to clean

562
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:42,359
energy specifically so we run the

563
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,120
database of stay incentives for

564
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:47,319
Renewables and efficiency AKA desire and

565
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:49,239
then associated with desire we also have

566
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:51,918
our desire Insight subscription services

567
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:54,679
and our 50 states reports so like the

568
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,519
climate dashboard um desires free to use

569
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:58,720
it's a it's a public good it was

570
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:01,038
originally funded by um the department

571
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,038
of energy back in like the N 1996 I

572
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:07,079
think and since then it's grown a lot

573
00:28:04,038 --> 00:28:09,079
but um like it's free for you guys to

574
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:10,480
use but it's not free for us to update

575
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:12,000
so that's where desire Insight comes in

576
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,480
so that's our subscription service that

577
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,159
looks at um all of the pending

578
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,038
legislation so any bills that are

579
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,240
introduced any regulatory dockets that

580
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:22,079
are ongoing any proposed utility

581
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,240
programs that haven't officially been

582
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:26,359
decided yet or officially enacted goes

583
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,640
into desire insight and then once you

584
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:29,439
actually you know it's enacted or you

585
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,200
have a decision and it's available for

586
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,759
people to use or look at then it can go

587
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,558
into the full desire database along with

588
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:37,960
that we also do um customized research

589
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:39,798
and Analysis upon requests mainly for

590
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,759
government entities or private corpor

591
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:44,440
corporations that are interested in

592
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,278
clean energy policies across the

593
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,759
US

594
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:51,759
uh our clean our training team does

595
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:53,679
Workforce Development so we host on-site

596
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:56,079
and hybrid trainings related to clean

597
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,480
energy it's mainly focused on the solar

598
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:00,759
industry at the moment so a lot of

599
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,278
operations and maintenance um

600
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:06,440
installation the business aspect of

601
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:09,119
these types of um companies then we also

602
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,200
do with our trainings are also aligned

603
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:12,879
with um national standards and

604
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,480
certificates so you can take the courses

605
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,799
to learn and then take and then take the

606
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,200
test and get your certificate we also

607
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:20,278
started a new course specifically now

608
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,558
for solar and storage paired together

609
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:23,558
and we're actually also developing one

610
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:25,519
specifically for um electric electric

611
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:28,079
vehicle trading

612
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:30,079
stations um next is our clean trans

613
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:31,439
Transportation team so the quean

614
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:33,038
transportation team is specifically

615
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,798
dedicated to like electric vehicles and

616
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:36,359
things like that they do a lot of

617
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:39,398
technical assistance and Fleet advisory

618
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:40,798
Services both for um public and private

619
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:43,359
fleets so a lot of working with local

620
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:45,398
governments a lot of working with um

621
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:48,000
small companies to help them Electrify

622
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:50,199
their company or government fleets um

623
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,759
they do a lot of Education Outreach so

624
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,278
they also usually about once a month

625
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:56,398
hold the webinar on some sort of clean

626
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:58,398
Transportation issue they do a lot of

627
00:29:56,398 --> 00:29:59,959
ride and drive events with the public

628
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:01,759
and then every August they host the

629
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:05,319
sustainable Fleet technology conference

630
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:07,558
here here in Ry in the Raley D area

631
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:08,839
where Fleet fleets Fleet managers can

632
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:10,960
come from across the country to kind of

633
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:12,639
learn about what the situation is like

634
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,720
with electri fighting

635
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,720
fleets and then we have our engineering

636
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,038
team which we like to call CPI and so

637
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,880
CPI does a lot of the real technical

638
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:22,640
assistance and Analysis related to

639
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,559
onsite energy and a lot industri

640
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,159
degeneration so they can do energy

641
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:28,319
assessments feasibility analyses

642
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,399
Consulting studies they they get into

643
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:34,200
the really nitty-gritty of actually

644
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:36,239
helping clients get clean clean

645
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,440
energy and then we have our extension

646
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,079
and engagement work and that some of it

647
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,519
is on the fee for service side so a

648
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:44,519
client comes to us and they pay us to do

649
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:46,640
it for them but a lot of a majority of

650
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:49,278
it is actually through um Grant work

651
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,200
whether it's federal grants or state

652
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:55,278
level grants so this is this is a list

653
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,519
of all of the current major grants that

654
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:57,638
we are on there's other grants that

655
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:59,960
aren't listed here that are still

656
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:01,278
running and there's lots of grants that

657
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,679
have finished

658
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:06,759
already um just to pick out a few so the

659
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:09,240
one at the top is with our engineering

660
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:11,000
team and that's the technical assistance

661
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,798
partnership or the tap so they provide

662
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,839
free technical assistance to Commercial

663
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:17,278
and Industrial customers who want onsite

664
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:19,678
Generation Um our our engineering team

665
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:21,919
also works with Farmers to help them

666
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,120

sighting and permitting for utility

670
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:33,359
scill solar and renewable energy we are

671
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:35,919
part of the solar for all Coalition for

672
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:38,638
North Carolina and solar for all is run

673
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:41,399
by the EPA through I think it was was

674
00:31:38,638 --> 00:31:42,879
either Ira or viil funding can never

675
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:44,959
remember and that's specifically

live in multi family homes they can get

679
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:53,839
rooftop solar or Community solar um our

680
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,399
transportation team works with the Clean

681
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:57,119
Cities Coalition helping local

682
00:31:55,398 --> 00:31:58,359
governments across the southeast meet

683
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:02,000
the Clean City

684
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:03,558
standard um we also are working on a I'm

685
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,679
working personally on a grant that's

686
00:32:03,558 --> 00:32:07,918
looking for Community resilience using

687
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,200
solar Plus Storage microG grids and so

688
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,278
we're working with around 10 communities

689
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,600
across the state um our transport or not

690
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:17,480
our our training team is working with uh

691
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:18,638
Native American communities for work

692
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:21,079
Workforce Development in the clean

693
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:22,678
energy sphere and then also developing

694
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:28,480
new training programs for other people

695
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:29,759
to use so that's a lot I know um but

696
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,798
it's I feel like it's really important

697
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:33,960
for you guys to understand that we do a

698
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:35,759
lot of things in this sphere and so much

699
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,960
of it is specifically extension and

700
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:41,000
engangement work so when it comes to

701
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,240
desire oh this is our contact

702
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,839
information so when it comes to desire

703
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:50,120
so like I said before desire is a free

704
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:52,638
online tool um for people to use and I'm

705
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:53,759
going to go here there we go you guys

706
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:56,398
can see

707
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:58,079
this Okay cool so this is the desire

708
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:59,719
website um it provides provides

709
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:02,558
information on policies and programs

710
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,079
related to clean energy across the US so

711
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:05,398
it's not just the national level but

712
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:07,199
like like the climate exchange Dash

713
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:10,479
board it's also at the state level and

714
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:13,080
then we even have um utility utility

715
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,759
level programs and if big enough some

716
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:17,798
Municipal level programs so you can

717
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:19,679
search by state by clicking on the map

718
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:21,638
and you can see on the map how many

719
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:25,399
programs might apply to a state so

720
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:27,918
Mississippi has 23 Kentucky has 33 North

721
00:33:25,398 --> 00:33:29,759
Carolina has 71

722
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,080
California has

723
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,960
158 so you can actually click on a state

724
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:37,439
and see um all of those States policies

725
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,278
so like I I'll go to North Carolina you

726
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,480
know and then what on the state websites

727
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:45,558
we have kind of a a large summary of

728
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,240
kind of the major programs in that state

729
00:33:45,558 --> 00:33:50,599
so Energy Efficiency we portfolio

730
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,079
standards um footnotes and you can

731
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:54,798
scroll down you can

732
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:57,519
see the list of all of the programs

733
00:33:54,798 --> 00:34:00,759
within the state and programs are sort

734
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:03,000
of what the name is if you're looking

735
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:04,480
just at General programs the state

736
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,440
whether it's a financial incentive or a

737
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:11,079
regulatory policy the type of incentive

738
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,838
or policy when the entry was created and

739
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:14,560
then when the entry is less updated and

740
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:17,119
it defaults to whatever the last update

741
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:19,918
was so our most recent update was all

742
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,800
right February 6 and it was the South

743
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:25,239
River EMC which is electric cooperated

744
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:27,760
an area for a heating rebate program one

745
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:30,279
so if you want to check that out we can

746
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,960
come into the incentive program you can

747
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,760
see kind of all the information that is

748
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,119
provided on this program so who

749
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,119
implements it it's utility it's a

750
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:39,919
Cooperative it's a financial incentive

751
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:42,399
in the state of North Carolina and it's

752
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,319
specifically a rebate program we also

753
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:45,759
then link to the website where you can

754
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,440
where the main website where you can

755
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,359
take advantage of this so This links

756
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:53,320
directly to the Cooperative website the

757
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:55,480
administrator Cooperative utility The

758
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,559
Cooperative then we list the eligible

759
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:01,199
Technologies for the program so here

760
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:04,078
it's solar water heaters who can take

761
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:07,239
advantage of it residential commercial

762
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:10,200
industrial agricultural low-income

763
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:12,879
residential multif family residential

764
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:15,879
manufacturers local government state

765
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:18,920
government tribal government it's all in

766
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:21,400
it the amount of the incentive the

767
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,920
maximum value of the incentive if it's

768
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,720
if it's different than the standard

769
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,159
incentive value um any equipment or

770
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:29,639
technical requirements that are needed

771
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:33,399
to actually be eligible to receive the

772
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:35,679
incentive and then if relevant ownership

773
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,760
of of renewable energy certificates or

774
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:40,319
credits then below all of that then

775
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,400
we'll have a quick quick summary so that

776
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,880
you can kind of get an understanding of

777
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,639
what the incentive is for and desire

778
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,280
since desire is aimed towards a general

779
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:49,920
public these entries should be pretty

780
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,160
easy to read and understand even if you

781
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,480
don't know anything about clean energy

782
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:56,159
or soil water

783
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,280
heaters and then below that we try and

784
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:59,960
always have a contact for whoever the

785
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:02,079
administrator is so here you have the

786
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,480
information for the Electric Cooperative

787
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,640
so you can go directly to them if you

788
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,159
have any

789
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:10,118
questions and then we'll also have memos

790
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:12,118
that show you um when we updated it and

791
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:14,280
what changes we might have made so this

792
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:16,920
was last updated by our intern Seth and

793
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,319
so it was an annual review and so he

794
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,880
made sure that all the program details

795
00:36:18,318 --> 00:36:21,279
were accurate and up to date based on

796
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,119
what the quer is

797
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,960
offering and the types of things you

798
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,358
might see in these programs are going to

799
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,920
vary based on what type of program entry

800
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:33,159
it is so like let's go if we just go to

801
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,599
all the programs we have in desire this

802
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:37,879
is everything it's all the states it is

803
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,720
all the programs and again you can see

804
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,800
it defaults to what was most recently

805
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:44,639
updated it looks like the intern is

806
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,440
focusing on utility incentives let's see

807
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:48,799
if we can't find something

808
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,599
different all right regulatory policy

809
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,839
cool so Colorado we recently made

810
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,160
changes to the renewable energy standard

811
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:58,119
we can go check this out and you can see

812
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,118
here while this the form formatting is

813
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:01,358
the same the information included this

814
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:03,079
table at the top is going to be

815
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:05,279
different so we still have the sector

816
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:07,760
the category the state incentive type

817
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,839
and the website again but then we also

818
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,359
have because it's a policy when did it

819
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:14,078
start all of the technologies that are

820
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:17,159
eligible for the renewable energy

821
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:20,480
standard um who the standard applies to

822
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:22,039
investor own utilities M Unis and co-ops

823
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,719
what the standard actually is so all of

824
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:26,159
the final goals and

825
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:28,279
targets the technology minimum that they

826
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:30,239
must reach and any compliance

827
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:33,280
multipliers or things like

828
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:36,318
that um the Renewable Energy Credit

829
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,599
lifetime the tracking system they use

830
00:37:36,318 --> 00:37:38,880
they have an alternative compliance

831
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,880
system set

832
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,480
up and then you come down you can see

833
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,400
this is a lot the summary here is a lot

834
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,599
more in- depth than maybe that Co-op

835
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,599
incentive

836
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,519
was and you can see you know it gets

837
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,079
into what technologies were because not

838
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:52,519
everything is maybe clear if it's just

839
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:54,800
in the

840
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:57,119
table the differences between the

841
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,599
investor owned and electric Municipal

842
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,280
util fa ities how it applies to

843
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,838
generation transmission

844
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:07,720
cooperatives any car vs they may have to

845
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:09,880
apply to credit multipliers compliance

846
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:11,598
requirements uh the new clean energy

847
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,440
standard that they recently passed a few

848
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,440
years ago and then here you can see we

849
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,000
also have the authorities so the

850
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,159
Cooperative because it's Cooperative it

851
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,119
doesn't have any legal standards or

852
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:23,519
requirements that it has to meet or

853
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:25,240
comply with so we didn't have any

854
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:26,880
authorities there but with things like

855
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:29,078
regulatory policies or financial

856
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,680
incentives that are mandated by

857
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:32,200
regulatory commissions or legislators

858
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:34,039
will have the authorities in place so

859
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:36,159
you can go directly to the statutes to

860
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:38,079
see exactly what it is and here we even

861
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:39,799
have you know executive orders you can

862
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,880
see when it the date that it became

863
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,000
effective and scrolling down again and

864
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:47,480
again we have the contact information in

865
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,159
the memos you can see we updated it uh

866
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,760
like five days ago and we added the

867
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:54,159
section on the clean energy standard

868
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,599
bottom and so that's kind of what this

869
00:38:54,159 --> 00:39:00,279
entries look like as for the actual

870
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:02,318
types of Entry we have a lot so you can

871
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,960
sort by the technology type that's

872
00:39:02,318 --> 00:39:06,079
available so maybe you're only

873
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,519
interested in you know solar energy

874
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:11,960
incentives maybe you only want to look

875
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:13,960
at you know requirements for building

876
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,838
efficiency so you can choose the type of

877
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,559
Technology you want based on all of that

878
00:39:16,838 --> 00:39:20,159
you can choose the date that it was

879
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:22,559
updated that the program was most

880
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:24,920
recently updated or if we have it the

881
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:27,599
expiration date of a

882
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:30,240
program um categories again BAS

883
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:34,440
Financial incentive regulatory policy

884
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:36,959
then the program type of which again we

885
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,519
have hold on we have a lot we even have

886
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,639
Pace financing so we can actually get

887
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:43,159
into that one if we want as a comparison

888
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:43,159
going down

889
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:49,960
still can I request go ahead could we

890
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,599
look for a New York water heater a

891
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,519
friend's water heater just

892
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,160
broke yeah we can totally do that see

893
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:57,960
what she can

894
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:01,960
do yeah

895
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,280
so we want State and then we can

896
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,880
actually search here so then I want to

897
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:09,760
scroll again go New

898
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,200
York and then me apply that I to apply

899
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,880
one it's it's an old website we're

900
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:16,838
trying to get it updated um but you got

901
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,318
you gotta go through the cycle all right

902
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:21,639
and then we said

903
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:25,199
technology so I think a water heater

904
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:29,318
should be under Energy Efficiency let me

905
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:29,318
see water heater there we go

906
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:34,719
actually this might be helpful hold on

907
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:37,519
do you know your friend ZIP code or like

908
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:40,399
a New York ZIP code yeah it's

909
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:43,480
10463 all right so going back

910
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,720
to you can search by ZIP code

911
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,318
one6

912
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:49,559
463

913
00:40:47,318 --> 00:40:51,480
463 all right so yeah you can search by

914
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:53,119
ZIP code for specific because again

915
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,719
remember we have local and utility level

916
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,559
programs so if you're like well I don't

917
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:59,000
care about you know utility programs for

918
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:02,000
utility that isn't me you can filter

919
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
those out so look now we have 74

920
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,760
programs that match this and it's all

921
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,559
look it's all in New York and now this

922
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,240
ZIP code will be saved once I apply the

923
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:14,199
filter

924
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:17,719
for forgot where it was water

925
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:20,919
heers and now we have 15

926
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:22,679
programs so you can see here we do have

927
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,400
Federal programs mixed in so just make

928
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:26,719
sure to be careful because all federal

929
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,039
programs are going to be eligible across

930
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:30,598
the US so going to show up for every

931
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:32,199
single Z code in every single state so

932
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:34,039
let's say I want to just see only ones

933
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:37,719
that are from the the state or city of

934
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:40,000
New York all right so we have a reate

935
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:42,000
program with nerta which is an assisted

936
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,960
home performance with energy star let's

937
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,199
see what that's

938
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:50,318
about all right so we got an incentive

939
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:53,598
that can cover 50% of costs for let's

940
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:55,599
see grants for low income homeowners in

941
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,880
single or multi family buildings for 50%

942
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,640
of cost for Energy Efficiency

943
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,160
Improvement

944
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:01,920
and so if this applies to your friend

945
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:04,159
she can go straight to the website to

946
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,000
see exactly what is available for her at

947
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:08,239
this Nera program but yeah that is one

948
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,440
thing that I think is important is you

949
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:12,919
can search by ZIP code you can search by

950
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,159
state you can search by the implementing

951
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,680
sector of a program so is it

952
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:19,838
administered by a feder the federal

953
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:21,960
government a local government nonprofit

954
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:25,480
a state or

955
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:27,318
utility um the eligible sector so we

956
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,599
have it split mainly into residential

957
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:31,800
and non-residential so we cover just all

958
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,838
sort all residential standard single

959
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:37,079
family multif family low income things

960
00:42:34,838 --> 00:42:40,199
that are specific senior

961
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:44,280
citizens non-residential we have

962
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:46,879
commercial industrial agricultural the

963
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:52,519
manufactures can we do something with

964
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:55,119
agriculture yeah so let me clear here me

965
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:56,838
clear these not that zip code yeah not

966
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,680
the ZIP code so now this is back to the

967
00:42:56,838 --> 00:43:01,599
to the main program and I have it sort

968
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:03,719
of by state now so Alaska shows up first

969
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:06,920
so you said agricultural right so

970
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:10,279
eligible sector non-residential

971
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:12,200
business agricultural programs so we

972
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,400
have 400 programs where someone in the

973
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:16,078
agricultural sector is eligible to

974
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,599
participate

975
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:22,280
in um so okay we have Alaska so they've

976
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:24,519
got a sustainable alternative power

977
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:27,319
program Alaska has net metering rules

978
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:29,039
that allow for agricultural customers um

979
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:31,960
Alabama agricultural customers are

980
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:33,079
eligible for Alabama's PACE program so

981
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,480
you have a lot of things that you can

982
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:37,519
search up

983
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,159
um yeah and then again you can search by

984
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:42,838
state technology type and then coverage

985
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:45,399
area I think that's a zip code so that's

986
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:47,119
all just you know this is that's and

987
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,440
that's just the main part of the website

988
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,680
like with the climate exchange dashboard

989
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,800
there's lots of other things you can

990
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:54,440
take advantage of Stacy has a question

991
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,680
Stacy what state are you from can you

992
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,280
put in the

993
00:43:55,679 --> 00:44:01,639
state if you filter by count uh County

994
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,280
does it only pull County specific she's

995
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:07,199
in Arizona okay it only pull County

996
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:09,000
specific or also the state the county is

997
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:11,838
in so in other words if you put in

998
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:17,440
County do you lose your state

999
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:19,639
incentives um so do something in Arizona

1000
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,720
uh I need an Arizona ZIP code yeah put

1001
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:23,799
in his Arizona ZIP code Stacy I can't

1002
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:27,799
you're G to tell to me because I can't

1003
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,800
see yes I will 86305

1004
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:33,880
all right

1005
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,920
1ar all right so it looks like so it is

1006
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,280
going to be Statewide so you'll still

1007
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,280
because when you put in the zip code

1008
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,400
it's going to give you anything that

1009
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,880
that zip code could take advantage of so

1010
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,960
that includes anything that is only

1011
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:48,358
local specific it includes Federal

1012
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,760
programs and it also includes state

1013
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:52,679
level programs so let me see if the ZIP

1014
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,359
code has

1015
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:57,239
anything like yeah like here like if

1016
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:59,920
there's APS the Arizona public Public

1017
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:02,199
Service utility and so it has those in

1018
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,599
there because you can take advantage of

1019
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,679
those

1020
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:09,239
[Music]

1021
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:11,318
um yeah and then and then not we don't

1022
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:12,719
always have the ZIP code listed in a

1023
00:45:11,318 --> 00:45:14,279
program just because sometimes it can be

1024
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:16,199
very difficult for us we're a team of

1025
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,800
seven people we don't have zip codes

1026
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:20,118
memorized for every single utility and

1027
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:22,039
municipality in the country um but we do

1028
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:23,680
try to when it's a local utility program

1029
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:25,000
to kind of put those in there but yeah

1030
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,519
so when you search by ZIP code it will

1031
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,519
always include Statewide and and

1032
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:32,880
Nationwide

1033
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:33,719
programs um if you're like wow that's a

1034
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,200
lot of

1035
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:39,039
information we have summary

1036
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:41,639
Maps so for these summary maps you can

1037
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:44,279
choose a program let's go building

1038
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:46,318
energy codes and you can see how many

1039
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,319
states have an incentive in desire for

1040
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:51,800
building energy codes Illinois has one

1041
00:45:49,318 --> 00:45:54,759
Washington has one Texas has

1042
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,680
nine you can even sort by technology

1043
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,200
which I'm not going to do because it's

1044
00:45:55,679 --> 00:46:01,279
deing energy codes and you can actually

1045
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:01,279
export the map out if you

1046
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,119
want oh I've never actually messed

1047
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,680
around with this part

1048
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,280
before here here under under the summary

1049
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:11,639
tables which you can find under the

1050
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,280
overarching programs tab you can see

1051
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:15,960
these are all the incentive types that

1052
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:18,839
we have and if you click one let's Okay

1053
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:21,358
we want a bond program

1054
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:22,960
right now we can see all the bond

1055
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:24,960
programs that we have listed in desire

1056
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,358
which is pretty

1057
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,318
cool um

1058
00:46:28,358 --> 00:46:33,078
but now I want to show you guys all the

1059
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:36,119
resources that we have so this is just

1060
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:37,880
the overarching resource views um we

1061
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:41,119
have a list of all the Publications and

1062
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:42,880
presentations that we've done as a team

1063
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,318
so these are all like the Powerpoints

1064
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,880
where we presented at conferences over

1065
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:50,558
the past year of which again um what I

1066
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:53,760
use all the time is our detailed summary

1067
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:55,440
maps and so these are kind of annually

1068
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,200
updated maps that provide information on

1069
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,480
one specific policy so let's go

1070
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:03,199
with energy storage targets because

1071
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,679
that's coming in you can download it as

1072
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:05,759
a PowerPoint or a PDF we're going to do

1073
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:08,000
PDF that's

1074
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,960
easier and so here we have the map of

1075
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,960
states that have energy storage targets

1076
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:14,280
as of September 2024 it's colored in if

1077
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,838
it has a Target and we also have the

1078
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,599
final Target there available so this is

1079
00:47:16,838 --> 00:47:20,719
a pretty new program that we a new

1080
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:22,119
policy type we've been seeing recently

1081
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:23,598
so it's always interesting to see like

1082
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:25,960
what states are

1083
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,480
adopting along with the summary map we

1084
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,880
also have a list under other resources

1085
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,599
of kind of similar organizations uh that

1086
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,480
you can take advantage of or look into

1087
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:37,359
related toan energy national federal

1088
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:39,000
state Regional International and then

1089
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:40,558
other energy tools you can use you

1090
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,760
should probably B yours on actually I'll

1091
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,760
think about it I'll I'll bring it up the

1092
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,200
team so I can get the The deim Exchange

1093
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,760
daspo on

1094
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:50,439
there um and then if you look I think

1095
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,400
under help and

1096
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,960
support if you're like I don't know what

1097
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,599
you're talking about we have our

1098
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,800
frequently asked questions and we need

1099
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,640
even have a glossery of all the programs

1100
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:02,640
so like we were bringing up pace before

1101
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:04,598
right so here if you're like I don't

1102
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:06,480
know what pace financing is now you can

1103
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:08,200
find out what it is what happened Google

1104
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,880
Google it you can find out what a loan

1105
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:14,838
program is you can find out

1106
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:17,800
here what a renewable energy credit is

1107
00:48:14,838 --> 00:48:21,318
or a solar Renewable Energy Credit and

1108
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,839
we have our fact and then if you still

1109
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:25,440
need help we have our 20 minute

1110
00:48:22,838 --> 00:48:27,759
presentation of how to use desire which

1111
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,039
also gets more in depth

1112
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,000
and I think that is mostly

1113
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:36,199
everything

1114
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:39,079
so I hope that was useful that was

1115
00:48:36,199 --> 00:48:41,679
fantastic um if does anybody have any

1116
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:44,359
requests that they want us to search on

1117
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:44,358
either of these

1118
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:50,318
platforms put them in the chat perhaps

1119
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:54,920
maybe I'll ask the two of you to sort of

1120
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:58,679
speak to each other about how

1121
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:01,240
how how can we as extension

1122
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:04,919
professionals improve the communication

1123
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:06,838
with our communities in order for

1124
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,559
helping our communities access these

1125
00:49:06,838 --> 00:49:10,920
resources like

1126
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:13,160
specifically like I will share with my

1127
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:16,720
friend how to find her water heater

1128
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:19,239
incentives right but you have had this

1129
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:21,798
experience for quite some time what are

1130
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:24,439
some of the the ways to help people

1131
00:49:21,798 --> 00:49:28,719
connect the dots for local action with

1132
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:28,720
local resources and policies

1133
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,400
so I mean from a desire standpoint I

1134
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,838
actually do know a lot of government

1135
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,880
agencies or local governments or

1136
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:41,960
utilities might actually link to the

1137
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,880
desire website because they're like if

1138
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,599
you want more information or incentives

1139
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,440
check out this website here and every

1140
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:51,079
time I see them like oh my God that's

1141
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:53,000
us so I mean one way is like if you know

1142
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:54,440
someone is going to your website

1143
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,719
regularly like you know the state

1144
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,039
government knows if someone's looking

1145
00:49:55,719 --> 00:49:58,798
for a tax incentive and come to their

1146
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:00,358
website they're going to see the website

1147
00:49:58,798 --> 00:50:01,679
and so if you know you have half traffic

1148
00:50:00,358 --> 00:50:03,078
on your website and you just put the

1149
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:05,639
resources there that it's easy for

1150
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:07,400
people to see then it's a really good

1151
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:09,838
way to like get the information out

1152
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:12,358
there I mean another thing is again we

1153
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:13,400
are similar like engagement focused like

1154
00:50:12,358 --> 00:50:15,838
for

1155
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:17,119
example the the sighting and the

1156
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:20,159
sighting and planning grant that were're

1157
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:21,880
on for like local governments um as a

1158
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:25,639
part of the as a part of the grant we

1159
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:28,760
have to have regular um like Community

1160
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:35,118
meetings can't call them not anymore um

1161
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:38,359
Town Halls um with local like residents

1162
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:39,720
and government institutions and so our

1163
00:50:38,358 --> 00:50:41,598
team members have been like traveling

1164
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:43,358
all over Northern South Carolina to come

1165
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,960
to these communities and be like hey

1166
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:47,519
this is what this stuff

1167
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,920
means and so I'm not on that Grant so I

1168
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:52,159
can't tell you like what their marketing

1169
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:53,720
scheme is um but I'm assuming it's a lot

1170
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:55,199
of you know working with you have to

1171
00:50:53,719 --> 00:50:56,759
work with the local governments I think

1172
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:58,519
also it's really important to make make

1173
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,440
sure to get this information out there

1174
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:00,719
because again a lot of this stuff

1175
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,119
happens at the local

1176
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:07,279
level so what about Workforce

1177
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:11,318
Development what are your thoughts on

1178
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:15,359
helping uh helping connect the dots on

1179
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:17,558
on renewable or climate worthy uh

1180
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:20,598
Workforce Development you have some

1181
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:23,280
thoughts on on how you can help activate

1182
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:23,280
that in your

1183
00:51:23,798 --> 00:51:29,159
state I mean we have our training team

1184
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:31,079
that does a lot of that already and in

1185
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:32,558
general the center itself works a lot

1186
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:34,480
with the local government so like we

1187
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:36,359
have good relationships with the North

1188
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,039
Carolina Utilities Commission and the

1189
00:51:36,358 --> 00:51:40,440
Department of Environmental Quality and

1190
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:42,759
the go and the state Energy Office like

1191
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,519
the state Energy Office is the is the

1192
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:48,000
group running their solar for all grants

1193
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:49,639
so we are a sub awarde under them so but

1194
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,960
you're you're you're just talking in

1195
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:54,558
this particular case like desire is

1196
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:58,318
National right desire platform is

1197
00:51:54,559 --> 00:52:01,798
National or database I forget me

1198
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:05,440
um but when you say the workforce are

1199
00:52:01,798 --> 00:52:07,519
you does North Carolina invite folks to

1200
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,639
come to North Carolina to work about

1201
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:12,280
work on Workforce Development like do

1202
00:52:09,639 --> 00:52:15,759
you provide Consulting for

1203
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:18,480
that so I know our training team does do

1204
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,480
like fee service work related to

1205
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,880
Training

1206
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:24,880
Services um oftentimes just because you

1207
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,559
really need that physical experience it

1208
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,880
has to be in person a lots of time with

1209
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:32,960
local commun like local governments or

1210
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:34,680
local companies um but I do know it's

1211
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:37,920
possible to like do

1212
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:40,279
things um like remotely through you know

1213
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,559
through Zoom or even have people come in

1214
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,839
like I remember we had I think they came

1215
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:46,000
in from as a part of one of the grants

1216
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:49,480
we had a group come

1217
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,440
from a university in the Navajo Nation

1218
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,079
came to Raleigh to take one of our

1219
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,639
training courses but that that part's

1220
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:57,680
really going to vary and I do have to be

1221
00:52:55,639 --> 00:53:01,838
honest I'm not an expert in our training

1222
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:02,719
team's um practices um but if that's

1223
00:53:01,838 --> 00:53:04,159
something you want to talk about in

1224
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:07,598
another webinar I can definitely bring

1225
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:09,920
it up okay Ruby what about you how about

1226
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:13,480
Workforce Development you mentioned it

1227
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:16,760
in your platform but how how can we help

1228
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:19,199
uh local communities build out uh

1229
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:23,319
Workforce Development

1230
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:24,639
opportunities yeah um so that is not

1231
00:53:23,318 --> 00:53:28,358
currently an area that's on the

1232
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:32,118
dashboard it is do have like a a whole

1233
00:53:28,358 --> 00:53:37,159
long running list of topics and policies

1234
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:38,400
to explore in the future um I will just

1235
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:41,759
say I do

1236
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,720
think uh I think there's a lot of energy

1237
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,680
around Workforce Development um I've

1238
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:47,519
seen

1239
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:50,000
States uh create like state level

1240
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:52,960
climate uh Workforce Development

1241
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,880
programs like climate cor at the state

1242
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:58,280
level um a lot of states are looking

1243
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:04,440
into like

1244
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:10,319
uh the EV transition uh just uh

1245
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:12,559
like uh other other areas where

1246
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:14,558
um States especially with a lot of

1247
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:17,839
federal funding are seeing booms in

1248
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:20,200
these Technologies and these sectors um

1249
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:23,880
so yeah I would just say like States

1250
00:54:20,199 --> 00:54:26,439
states providing support uh identifying

1251
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:29,119
needs and gaps in their workforces

1252
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:31,599
providing grants for training or

1253
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:34,760
retraining or educational programs all

1254
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:37,519
of that can help push it Forward um just

1255
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:39,880
a perspective from the state level so

1256
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:42,159
another question for you Ruby of all of

1257
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:44,160
the policies that you've had to look

1258
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:46,920
across I mean because you are sort of

1259
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:50,358
this really unique individual who has

1260
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:51,798
been Tethered to this platform but also

1261
00:54:50,358 --> 00:54:54,719
Tethered to all the policies that are

1262
00:54:51,798 --> 00:54:56,920
embedded what is one of your favorite

1263
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:59,798
policies that you have seen that just

1264
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:04,119
gives you hope and

1265
00:54:59,798 --> 00:55:08,440
happiness that's a great question um I

1266
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:11,318
think uh seeing how states

1267
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:12,480
are trying to incorporate a lot more

1268
00:55:11,318 --> 00:55:16,719
environmental

1269
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:20,880
justice positions and policies um into

1270
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:24,439
their like climate policy framework

1271
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:26,358
almost um like the last five six years

1272
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:30,599
or so we've seen a lot of States create

1273
00:55:26,358 --> 00:55:32,798
EJ positions EJ offices uh update or

1274
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:35,359
Define uh environmental justice

1275
00:55:32,798 --> 00:55:39,798
communities develop tools to identify

1276
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:41,558
them um all of that and I do think the

1277
00:55:39,798 --> 00:55:43,880
federal justice 40 initiative also

1278
00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:45,359
played a big role in that but um now

1279
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:49,480
it's really up to States and local

1280
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:51,119
communities to continue pushing uh

1281
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,920
environmental justice and making sure

1282
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:56,760
that that's a mainstream movement and

1283
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:59,039
concern uh yeah

1284
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:01,640
so well with that that was a perfect

1285
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:02,920
segue I promise I did not ask for that

1286
00:56:01,639 --> 00:56:06,358
question

1287
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:08,000
