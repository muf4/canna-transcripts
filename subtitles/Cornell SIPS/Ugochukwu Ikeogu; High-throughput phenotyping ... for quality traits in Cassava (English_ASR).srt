1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,629
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:09,240
University all right thanks I look for

3
00:00:06,628 --> 00:00:14,388
that introduction and thank you everyone

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:21,390
for coming around it's been a long road

5
00:00:14,388 --> 00:00:23,640
but at least we're going to I'm

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,350
presenting on hydro phenotype in and

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,268
then genomics our sister bleeding for

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:32,969
politics ever and maybe for the record

9
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:38,460
my full name is Abbot we code I saw the

10
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:58,469
advert it has landed me to trouble it in

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:01:01,620
China like yeah so I'll be given our

12
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:05,070
account of my five-year staying on L and

13
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:08,519
then I will talk about him a little bit

14
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:10,408
background on Chris ever three studies

15
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,009
that are part of my dissertation and

16
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,900
then some other things I don't look said

17
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:18,090
we're little be trying to see things

18
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,340
changing cassava so there are a few

19
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,340
other studies I know reported but I'll

20
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,710
just mention them well the first thing

21
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:29,700
looking forward and then thinking

22
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:32,750
globally we need to avoid global

23
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,840
undernutrition crisis we should be the

24
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:39,629
vision of everyone here as a scientist

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,180
one thing to note here or see is like

26
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:46,739
there are millions of people who are in

27
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:49,079
need of food all around us and another

28
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:52,349
thing I want to mention is that all this

29
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:56,039
is from us ate their food assistant

30
00:01:52,349 --> 00:02:00,478
needs pair of 2017 it was unprecedented

31
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:03,630
so while we have some basic drought

32
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:05,640
related things we can predict ok whom I

33
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:09,090
need so so a man of who there are a lot

34
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,150
of natural hazards and all the rest of

35
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,060
them insecurity problems that can lead

36
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,099
to

37
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:20,229
the security and sudden need for food

38
00:02:15,098 --> 00:02:23,649
around us so I like this picture what we

39
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:26,500
need to do we need to be proactive so if

40
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:29,409
we don't prepare we have a little space

41
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,419
and then we have a lot of need people

42
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:32,229
are hungry and and if we don't have

43
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:35,889
enough room

44
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:38,469
um create or produce more food it's ham

45
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:43,839
week or maybe a lot of people would be

46
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:47,560
hanging around I'm so a little bit about

47
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,299
cassava when we are talking about global

48
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,959
food crisis cassava is one of those

49
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:56,049
crops we can depend on to help us manage

50
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,659
food global food crisis I got this quote

51
00:02:56,049 --> 00:03:00,790
from Fe o and he said that cassava was

52
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:04,629
once regarded as the food of the poor

53
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:09,430
but he's not becoming one of the crops

54
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:12,189
that nations depend upon and then a crop

55
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,860
that is affecting the global economy of

56
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:17,459
a lot of nations and part of the

57
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:20,739
developing countries sub-saharan Africa

58
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:23,500
cassava is a key crop that we look up to

59
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:26,109
you it's so important because cassava

60
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:30,250
more than 800 million who depend on

61
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:33,069
cassava daily and globally and is a

62
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:36,400
unique review he's Hadi and low in feed

63
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:40,030
crop cassava can travel in a imaginal

64
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,389
areas and one other thing I want to

65
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:46,689
emphasize upon is that even though

66
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:49,769
cassava is a food crop is also one of

67
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:52,900
the crops to depend on upon see

68
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:55,109
industrialized agriculture in most of

69
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:59,859
the developing countries

70
00:03:55,109 --> 00:04:02,109
um this is another quote I saw and then

71
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:05,500
trying to compete with the present

72
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:08,549
condition where we are say despite it is

73
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:12,340
potatoes cassava has the lowest research

74
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:14,469
intensities so it has been like an

75
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:18,608
abundant crop for a while but I notice

76
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:21,370
it as some of us are changing we are in

77
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:25,379
an a period I tagged as a new era in

78
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,560
cassava research and that era I think is

79
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:29,350
marked with

80
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,759
a lot of increasing funding nest Jane is

81
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:36,430
one of it and basics and all that

82
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,409
I think Gates Foundation alone I don't

83
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,689
know how much I I don't have the figure

84
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:42,520
here there are a lot of investment and

85
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:45,180
interest in cassava research currently

86
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:47,349
we have abundance of genomic information

87
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,230
improvement in computational and

88
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:53,010
analytical techniques there is also rich

89
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:55,090
in human and material capacity and

90
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:57,668
currently there is a heightened demand

91
00:04:55,089 --> 00:05:00,129
for cassava for food and by offer

92
00:04:57,668 --> 00:05:03,849
especially in Asia and Europe

93
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:06,639
so the ongoing developments are creating

94
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:09,280
on the audience need for us to reshape

95
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,990
how we do things and then meet up with

96
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:16,209
the rising demand for cassava products

97
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:20,650
but in doing so we need to understand

98
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:22,449
cassava breeding challenges our ultimate

99
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:25,929
goal is to increase unity gain over time

100
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:27,849
and then that we can do when we take

101
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,610
care of so many important factors

102
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:33,879
increase our solution accuracy selection

103
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:38,229
intensity and above all if we can reduce

104
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:40,930
the breeding cycle of cassava which by

105
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:44,288
the way has a very lengthy a breeding

106
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:47,500
cycle um it takes up to a decade for you

107
00:05:44,288 --> 00:05:50,228
to release a variety and cassava has a

108
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:53,560
poor flowering and Sid said we have

109
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:57,129
limitation plasm and diversity and we

110
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,410
also have the need to get expose or have

111
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:01,839
access to better tools and that could

112
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:06,780
range from phenotype in and data

113
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:11,859
management tools so maybe a little bit

114
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:14,319
disruption so that leads to some of the

115
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,660
things I'll be discussing one is the

116
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,129
fosston I that is part of my

117
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:25,300
dissertation is to look at a problem of

118
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:27,310
phenotyping in cassava so I try to this

119
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,560
the first or the rapid quantification of

120
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:33,879
quality traits in cassava using potable

121
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:38,680
near infrared spectrometer well

122
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:43,839
I need to mention here that most of the

123
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:46,150
quality traits we we have we want to

124
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,729
improve on cassava we don't have a lot

125
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:51,159
of high troop and and standardized

126
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:53,560
method or phenotype in them and I want

127
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,040
to give an example using these two

128
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,410
traits these are carotenoid evaluation

129
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:02,140
usually it's easy to separate between

130
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:05,650
yellow and white clones but when you

131
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:08,740
have a lot of variation in yellowness it

132
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:11,649
becomes difficult and what we usually do

133
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:15,610
is a visual assessment we can go for to

134
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:18,489
go into laboratory instruction or using

135
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:21,250
high-performance liquid HPLC

136
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:24,519
chromatography but one thing with all

137
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,500
these method is that one they need

138
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:29,469
laboratory need standard laboratory

139
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:34,089
equipment you need skilled technicians

140
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:37,450
and when we are talking about low

141
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:39,279
resource breeding institutions some of

142
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:41,610
these things could be challenging having

143
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:44,829
constant light and power and all that so

144
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:48,189
we started thinking about and these are

145
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:50,199
indirect methods they see visuals Kareem

146
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:53,589
is an indirect method of quantifying

147
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:56,319
karate know and instead of just getting

148
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:58,419
a feel or Battuta carotenoid we are

149
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,120
thinking about carotenoids I have some

150
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:05,350
other individual components so we are

151
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,569
just at the point of I'm 25 for to

152
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:09,970
Tecate noise and then going over to dry

153
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:15,360
matter which cassava on his own is

154
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:19,570
almost 60 to 70% water and then forever

155
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,460
valuable component our coma from cassava

156
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:23,829
we need to have a good feel of the drama

157
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:26,079
that I evaluations so we use the ovum

158
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:28,269
method and specific gravity method also

159
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,250
like what I emphasize here is the

160
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:32,500
time-consuming and low precision

161
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,019
specific gravity is just what you are

162
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,840
seen in the diagram here you weight in

163
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:39,549
air dip it in water try to get it

164
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:44,820
specific gravity and then from there

165
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:45,959
derive content and start using it but

166
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,150
currently

167
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,509
there is a development in the use of

168
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:53,879
Gnaeus technology and I just want to

169
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:56,730
show like electromagnetic radiation

170
00:08:53,879 --> 00:09:00,179
skill when we talk about years who have

171
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:04,409
visible lights here covering from 400 to

172
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:08,189
700 nanometer and me a species between

173
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:12,389
700 to 1100 nanometer and then you can

174
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:14,850
have medium Freret a colossal 2500 so a

175
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:17,279
little bit about knees Nia studies the

176
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:20,909
interaction between electromagnetic

177
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:23,610
radiation and their mother so um

178
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:27,240
earlier studies have proved that once

179
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:30,029
you are exposed a matter to

180
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,220
electromagnetic energy it could do these

181
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:35,069
frequencies of vibrational frequencies

182
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:38,340
that are you can use to quantify the

183
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:41,190
chemical component of diameter so they

184
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:45,930
have used it over time to quantify and

185
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:50,070
then quantify so many modern own

186
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:52,589
molecular components in many food

187
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:55,470
samples they are using it in health and

188
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:57,540
in so many other places what are the

189
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:00,930
advantages of using is if you know type

190
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:03,389
in I need to make sure here that you are

191
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:06,209
it's the newest technology has been

192
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:09,029
evolving we used to have a tabletop is

193
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:11,070
still available but the recent

194
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:13,889
developments we were having handheld and

195
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:17,610
currently maybe you see some people have

196
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:22,049
the my ghost lab is working on this

197
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:26,820
currently you are having near stools in

198
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:28,829
a very portable format and one may be

199
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,690
good things to think about looking at

200
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:33,240
the ranges are not aggressive and so

201
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:35,670
like I explained in the previous slides

202
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,649
looking at what you want to measure with

203
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:41,459
weather is just nears

204
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:45,029
need near infrared or covering between

205
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:47,519
visible and infrared so most of the

206
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:51,740
things I I I did was with the handheld

207
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,740
which covers both the visible and

208
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:59,579
meet near infrared region so Nia's is

209
00:10:55,379 --> 00:11:02,278
fast we can scan a example in in a

210
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:05,128
matter of seconds is non-destructive and

211
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:07,708
inexpensive is versatile and there one

212
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:10,019
thing to know is that from the same one

213
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:12,358
spectrum you can if you have a good

214
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:15,629
calibration you can derive a lot of

215
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:17,129
trades at the same time it's here we are

216
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:20,479
using years we are not talking about

217
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:23,908
waste and then other has are related

218
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:26,969
disposal and that are associated we use

219
00:11:23,908 --> 00:11:29,729
of chemical and laboratory method we can

220
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:32,339
perform anybody can once you train

221
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:35,249
people this is just like shooting a gun

222
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,959
you just shoot and then it takes the

223
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:39,928
spectrum so you don't need to be a

224
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:44,388
scientist a chemist to use Gnaeus to

225
00:11:39,928 --> 00:11:47,158
call a beta so a little bit about

226
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:49,619
application on years you don't just get

227
00:11:47,158 --> 00:11:52,528
it and then you have to do a little work

228
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:54,798
about before you start and using means

229
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:57,869
in your phenotype and so we go through

230
00:11:54,798 --> 00:12:00,298
calibration phase and what it involves

231
00:11:57,869 --> 00:12:03,509
is that first you want to match your

232
00:12:00,298 --> 00:12:06,269
spectral data with a reference meter so

233
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:09,928
for whatever trait you are interested in

234
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:12,269
I maybe talk more about carotenoids

235
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:14,639
before interested in total carotene or

236
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:17,609
want to much the spiritual value we have

237
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,639
and then you have to go through a lot of

238
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:22,619
a little bit of spectra pretreatment so

239
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,288
Cora for scattering and their

240
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:28,678
differences in nature of sample and

241
00:12:25,288 --> 00:12:31,470
order and then match it with a reference

242
00:12:28,678 --> 00:12:33,869
method value you get from the lab or

243
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:37,139
whatever that looks like a standard form

244
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:39,379
is your industry then you have to tray

245
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:41,879
your model develop a calibration model

246
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:45,329
train and then have your validation

247
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:47,489
before you can use it to process samples

248
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:50,428
the house spectral value but don't have

249
00:12:47,489 --> 00:12:52,829
laboratory values so for us in cassava

250
00:12:50,428 --> 00:12:57,778
one of the things we are trying out is

251
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:59,399
to have a few base because one of the

252
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:01,558
things we consider before going for

253
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:04,038
disease we don't just want to get a

254
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:06,299
desktop that it sits in the lab and also

255
00:13:04,038 --> 00:13:08,189
the one thing I didn't

256
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:10,529
Shawn is that the desktop is also can be

257
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:13,290
affected by temperature and all that so

258
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:15,120
you also need lie sauce and so he's

259
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:17,639
almost like having a standard laboratory

260
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,710
too so we needed something that is food

261
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:22,559
based and then that's why we went for

262
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:25,470
these and we are asking can we just

263
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,629
here we are caught in a cassava root and

264
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:30,660
then scanning from da region and then

265
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:32,490
take some scans and then use it in the

266
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:34,620
LA instead of coming back to the lab or

267
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:37,139
current things here's a picture of one

268
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:39,629
of our stations so some of them are

269
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:41,279
about eight hours drive from the normal

270
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:42,840
station so you don't want to stay

271
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,539
establish in laboratories and our

272
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,550
stations and all that so one is that we

273
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:50,189
are trying to develop calibration on

274
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:54,959
impact cassava root and the next thing

275
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:58,110
we are doing also trying to just create

276
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:00,150
a so we went into construction and get

277
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:01,649
somebody that can help apples with a

278
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:03,959
grinder that doesn't depend on

279
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:06,090
electricity so that you can carry these

280
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,970
all around and then even few days to

281
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:12,690
grind and then homogenized because for

282
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:14,850
some traits in cassava maybe I show a

283
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:16,650
picture of if you have seen cassava you

284
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:19,200
have a variation in thread concentrate

285
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:22,049
and some trait concentration along the

286
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,000
route so want to homogenize and then see

287
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:28,319
how that can possibly improve our

288
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:32,750
calibration accuracy so for objective of

289
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:35,460
this study is to develop calibration for

290
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:37,110
major trade carotenoids when we talk

291
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,060
about carotenoids who have been

292
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:42,180
presenting most times with a carotenoids

293
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:44,159
but let's just remember that we have a

294
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:47,149
lot of components of carotenoids that

295
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:49,789
are also that have health benefits

296
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:52,529
example is lutein while we talk about

297
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:54,839
night blindness trying to correct for

298
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:57,629
karate night routine and other traits

299
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:00,509
actually active duty are not profit I

300
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:05,070
mean eight carotenoids but they are

301
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:06,990
important in taking care of I related

302
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:10,230
problems because they absorb the

303
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:12,000
ultraviolent rays that protects your eye

304
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:15,659
against cataracts and all the rest of

305
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,340
them so let's also not just focus on two

306
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:20,189
that are ottoman so our aim is to

307
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:22,440
develop calibration as much as we can

308
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,890
for individual carotenoids dramatic

309
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,780
content and then like I said earlier on

310
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:30,750
developed and probably compared

311
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:33,990
calibrations between at a mosh roots and

312
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:36,899
then we try to see how far we've gone

313
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:39,629
comparing specific gravity meter and

314
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:41,759
hoof emitted from using our knees

315
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:45,720
derived dramatic content to compare with

316
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:49,129
the existing meter for dry matter so for

317
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:52,160
reference and calibration development

318
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:54,840
throughout my walk I had a lot of

319
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:57,569
collaborations we developed calibration

320
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,399
with people in Ch Colombia somewhere

321
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:02,550
developed in national lucre researches

322
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:05,399
to 2 mu DK and for carotenoids we use

323
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:07,829
HPLC as a reference and lobby's Russian

324
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,860
method in a nursery for dry matter

325
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:13,770
mostly we use an oven drying and then

326
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:16,680
specific gravity method for models

327
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:18,840
I tried compared a lot of pretreatment I

328
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:21,419
mentioned earlier you don't just your

329
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:24,149
spectrum has a lot of noise in addition

330
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:26,699
to the real information you are

331
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:28,470
interested in so you have to see how

332
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,110
much you can remove the noise so that

333
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:33,450
you can focus on the view thing we tried

334
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:37,019
both linear and nonlinear models and

335
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:39,240
then for validation try cross-validation

336
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:42,899
between training and validation set

337
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:47,930
provided the calibration set we had into

338
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:51,350
two so I am sure you some results to

339
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:54,599
just emphasize that when we're comparing

340
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:57,570
calibration between impact and massroots

341
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,340
I'm showing result on to Tecate noise or

342
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:02,490
transmitted occur at annoyed and then

343
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:05,699
total karate night at Summa DK just to

344
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:09,269
prove like from here I mean there are a

345
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:11,759
lot of things that he sticks to use to

346
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:13,588
check your calibration model but one of

347
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:17,369
them is arrow square in cross-validation

348
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:19,019
and having this high value gives us the

349
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:22,049
assurance that we are doing something

350
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:24,689
even from impacts route even though when

351
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:27,539
you compare in most of these other trees

352
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:30,150
like dramatic contents we had beta

353
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:33,029
calibration we mash done the intact but

354
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:35,580
they are still high enough that we can

355
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:38,799
use for screening

356
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:41,669
another thing we try doing is to compare

357
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,669
between the metals were using so here

358
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:47,410
try developing calibration using

359
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:49,630
specific gravity as a reference and then

360
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:54,670
using oven mitt or also as a reference

361
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:57,520
so that gives us like the real value for

362
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:59,529
specific gravity and then when you fit a

363
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:02,769
model with specific gravity you haven't

364
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:06,490
in years a nice value predicted value

365
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:09,519
from in tax route using specific gravity

366
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:13,660
as a reference the same thing for using

367
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:16,690
the mash cassava root samples they're

368
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:19,360
using the oven and you have a prediction

369
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:21,940
from years from the intact and mashed

370
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:24,459
what we can see here is that were

371
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,650
specific gravity one thing we'll also

372
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:29,590
did was to try to make sure we remove

373
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:31,630
outliers I will emphasize that we had a

374
00:18:29,589 --> 00:18:34,289
lot of outliers a specific gravity and

375
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:36,970
if you just use the raw data the

376
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:38,589
correlation was really low well we tried

377
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:41,110
looking at it and then removing things

378
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:43,480
that we felt like we're really high but

379
00:18:41,109 --> 00:18:45,429
without you we still had like the

380
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,849
relationship between over method and

381
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:52,120
specific gravity method he's around 0.64

382
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:55,539
and wanting to report as concern and

383
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:58,479
consonant use of nears is that if we

384
00:18:55,539 --> 00:19:00,879
develop calibration with Reuven method

385
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,130
and then comparing its knee as predicted

386
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,520
we're having height for relations that

387
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:08,740
we give so that confidence that whatever

388
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:10,299
that is predicted from the nearest is

389
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:13,509
something we can use that it's close to

390
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:17,740
the values we get if we're trying it in

391
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:20,589
the oval so I tried looking at some

392
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:23,620
laboratory values to check was the cost

393
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:26,409
are we saving anything in deploying

394
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:28,929
years for phenotype in I looked at lab

395
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:34,150
you can ask me for the names I removed

396
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:36,190
them for maybe security so I looked at

397
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:39,430
two laboratories that are doing years

398
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:43,269
one so these are different laboratories

399
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:47,710
so if you want to use the spot enzymatic

400
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:49,778
or color metric method in on

401
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:53,230
defying for starch that takes you up to

402
00:19:49,778 --> 00:19:55,480
like 75 dollars P example and I

403
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:59,048
estimated a for us in a breeding program

404
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:03,190
like a nursery we have multi locations

405
00:19:59,048 --> 00:20:06,099
on average we are certain to measure up

406
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:08,950
to have up to four thousand samples in a

407
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:10,329
year and if you calculate that as giving

408
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:13,179
you more than three hundred thousand

409
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:15,189
dollars but if we are using me as these

410
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:17,730
another laboratory there do specialize

411
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:20,440
in using years for calibrating for of

412
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:24,880
phenotype in forced arch our values

413
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:26,980
drops to 19 and then for us now the good

414
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,278
game going back to maybe a national

415
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:32,589
breeding program if I I didn't use up to

416
00:20:30,278 --> 00:20:35,470
200 but if I see me that both

417
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:37,558
calibration and then validating my model

418
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:41,798
every year I'm spending up to or

419
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:44,288
investing up to such amount in building

420
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:46,259
a reference all I will be doing is

421
00:20:44,288 --> 00:20:49,658
having through points spending is about

422
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:52,240
0.05 from this amount so in other words

423
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:54,549
if we apply this we are sure that we are

424
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,099
saving a lot for the breeding programs

425
00:20:54,548 --> 00:21:00,308
and this is not just I'm using one trait

426
00:20:57,099 --> 00:21:02,469
we're quantifying for carotenoids these

427
00:21:00,308 --> 00:21:05,139
not to Tecate noise if you go for

428
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:08,169
selective you have out you select more

429
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,730
than that like what I have seen in HPLC

430
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:13,360
with individual carotenoids you are

431
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:16,450
having up to 125 the last example so

432
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:19,629
with this I think I want to conclude

433
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:21,610
that m-me has provide a good phenotype

434
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:23,890
in eternity for the evaluation and prove

435
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:26,500
Menomonee trees and then this can also

436
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:28,509
help us discover some novel traits that

437
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,759
we have not been quantifying in cassava

438
00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:32,589
breeding the potable news is highly

439
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:35,048
adaptable for feud based screening and

440
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:37,750
then even though we had higher

441
00:21:35,048 --> 00:21:40,929
calibration in mash then on impact roots

442
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:42,398
what we had and calibration results we

443
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:44,679
have from the in touch with is good

444
00:21:42,398 --> 00:21:48,479
enough for screening purposes and then

445
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:52,690
this saves time and then production cost

446
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:55,538
the nested is to go back have a little

447
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:59,649
more detailed and study on carotenoids

448
00:21:55,538 --> 00:22:00,650
and since nears opened the door for us

449
00:21:59,648 --> 00:22:03,259
to measure

450
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:06,100
individual karate noise so want to see

451
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:11,180
how the individual karate noises

452
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:14,929
correlates matata carotenoid so it's one

453
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:17,600
of the ambassadors of cassava is it's

454
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:20,029
easy here for you to a little background

455
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:22,490
they say you look as I don't know how

456
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:24,769
he's looking and these are yellow ones

457
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,500
and if you see far away here the

458
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:29,389
difference is clear but then in terms of

459
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,779
quantity we don't have so much to say

460
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:35,060
about it and not just that we want to

461
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:38,059
check how much we have in their raw

462
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:41,029
samples it will be interested to also

463
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:43,579
know the irritation of carotenoids when

464
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:47,240
we have the products as Gary and again

465
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:49,730
so one thing to note is that most of the

466
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,589
studies will focus on an avid emphasis

467
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:53,569
on these on total karate know but it's

468
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:57,439
big you to Buddha find to the individual

469
00:22:53,569 --> 00:23:00,049
carotenoids so the objectives here would

470
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,410
be to understand if body phenotypic and

471
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:05,779
genotypic correlation between especially

472
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:08,390
between TCC and other individual wants

473
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:10,430
to know why were improving tota karate

474
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:13,580
now whether we also improving the other

475
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:15,650
individual carotenoids if we can

476
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:18,470
understand some of the studies are focus

477
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:21,259
on TC seed we know the regions are

478
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:23,660
associated with variation and individual

479
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:25,970
carotenoids and then check the option of

480
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,230
using gears in improving carotenoids

481
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:31,339
comparing cassava

482
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:32,930
so one thing we use here is that we had

483
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:35,769
about nine hundred and ninety four

484
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:38,269
cloves and we analyzed these using a

485
00:23:35,769 --> 00:23:40,849
nonlinear resource I should wear mainly

486
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:43,700
linear model from bascially square

487
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:48,409
regression we used tried a nonlinear

488
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:51,289
model because one apart from nonlinear

489
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:55,070
models capturing non-linear relationship

490
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:57,019
between your predictive and m dependent

491
00:23:55,069 --> 00:24:00,079
and independent variables no random

492
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:03,259
helps you to capture the relationships

493
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:05,299
are no there and then also easily to be

494
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:09,069
direct and then makes your

495
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:09,069
resorts interpret evident

496
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,390
linear models that are based on Latins

497
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:16,969
of principal component

498
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:19,070
so we tries in nonlinear model to

499
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:21,500
analyze this and then woody care has

500
00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:23,779
like two trials the training population

501
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:26,650
is just B's on when they were collected

502
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:29,509
and then they have been managing to like

503
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:32,630
replications but we just got them TP 1 +

504
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:35,900
TP - we had seen replications be a clone

505
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:39,950
in a trial and then fournier's we had to

506
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:42,200
the pre and post a plot location we have

507
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:45,769
data from woody ho to be on con when we

508
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:48,200
use mod and hundreds and thousands need

509
00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:51,009
Marcus for these and then we focus on

510
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:53,509
these trades that have automation before

511
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:57,319
so the result I'll be showing here

512
00:24:53,509 --> 00:25:00,769
muscled EMA closely related to genotypic

513
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:03,139
and phenotypic correlation so here I'm

514
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:06,799
showing the narrow-sense heritability

515
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:10,250
for all the trades and then for the

516
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:13,190
correlations we saw more importantly one

517
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:16,730
of the encouraging thing is that is also

518
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:19,370
shown before that all transmit Authority

519
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:21,500
which is gives you a value of beta

520
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:24,529
carotene container he is highly

521
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,509
correlated Matata carotenoid so we are

522
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:28,399
so sure that why we went proving to

523
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:31,400
tackle tonight's by having a good field

524
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,200
of all transmit authority in which is

525
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,500
like totally tackle routine there are

526
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:39,259
other isomers of beta-carotene which are

527
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:42,109
also they have also high correlation

528
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:44,420
with GCC but one good thing to repo here

529
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:47,329
is that for all the traits we studied

530
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,560
they have positive correlation with TCC

531
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:52,309
which is encouraging

532
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:54,740
we saw some levels of negative

533
00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:58,369
correlation between the traits but I

534
00:25:54,740 --> 00:26:00,620
think is a good news to know that while

535
00:25:58,369 --> 00:26:03,649
we are striving to improve to Tecate now

536
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:08,869
we're improving the other individual

537
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:13,310
keratinized to 4GS model I tried to fit

538
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:16,339
in some models to check prediction for

539
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:18,980
carotenoids so our sure these I hope you

540
00:26:16,339 --> 00:26:21,319
remember but maybe I went for size on it

541
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:24,049
in a slide so that you don't forget so

542
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:27,109
one thing is that usually when you have

543
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:28,200
your raw data is like a usual practice

544
00:26:27,109 --> 00:26:33,839
we do it

545
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:36,960
to stage approach force feet in your

546
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:38,579
model and then take care of different

547
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:44,899
factors and get your blog Museo

548
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:47,609
blob-like estimated value to fit in the

549
00:26:44,898 --> 00:26:50,788
genomic blob so that you can get your

550
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:52,888
estimate a breeding values but the one

551
00:26:50,788 --> 00:26:55,440
staged is like a project to the one

552
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:57,928
stage means fitting in everything from

553
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:02,548
different locations at the same time so

554
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:05,519
and then we report calibration using

555
00:27:02,548 --> 00:27:09,048
single trait and mati trait who have

556
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:12,690
seen that most times you can improve the

557
00:27:09,048 --> 00:27:15,058
prediction of low heritable trait using

558
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:18,048
either a highly correlated with other

559
00:27:15,058 --> 00:27:20,940
traits and we tried using multi trait

560
00:27:18,048 --> 00:27:23,220
method also and then we compare that

561
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:27,690
with nonlinear methods using random

562
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:31,009
forests - don't worry I think I will I

563
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:34,230
try to cover it so that you can remember

564
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:37,440
so you have trouble try to remember was

565
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:40,278
the prediction accuracy for this so once

566
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:45,679
more don't forget that is a single trait

567
00:27:40,278 --> 00:27:50,450
two-stage prediction accuracy this is a

568
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:54,870
multi trait linear d-block linear model

569
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:58,620
using a single Motty trait and here you

570
00:27:54,869 --> 00:28:01,408
have the random forest in two stage here

571
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:04,939
you have single trait using one stage

572
00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:10,019
and Motty trait one stage and then

573
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:11,788
nonlinear random forest one stage so we

574
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:13,230
have values for that trait but I'm

575
00:28:11,788 --> 00:28:15,569
trying to use these streets we

576
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:19,259
illustrate that most times what we saw

577
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:20,788
is that multitrader semester was we're

578
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:24,000
doing a little bit better on average

579
00:28:20,788 --> 00:28:26,940
compared to the single trait model but

580
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:33,058
that reversed when we use the single

581
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:35,190
stage model so overall using nonlinear

582
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:38,099
model was doing a little bit better than

583
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:41,179
in your mother so the result is about

584
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:41,178
the same for that trait

585
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:46,629
the next thing we did was to fit a gos

586
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:49,928
model for other traits

587
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:52,540
I hope my stars are really showing very

588
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:58,059
well I tried expanding and realized this

589
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:59,769
cottage move so one thing we found out

590
00:28:58,058 --> 00:29:04,178
is that even though we didn't have any

591
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:06,940
significant afar carotenoids and 14

592
00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:12,340
further traits we're able to discover

593
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:14,080
some regions that were significant for

594
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:17,139
most of the traits we studied especially

595
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:20,769
in chromosome 1 for lutein we have up to

596
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:22,590
about 5 regions and then 4 to Tecate

597
00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:30,099
know as a mu so the beta carotene

598
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:32,048
components chromosome 18 so overall we

599
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:35,349
were able to track look at the genes

600
00:29:32,048 --> 00:29:38,589
that are related to carotenoid in in

601
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:41,379
cassava and we saw like two basic genes

602
00:29:38,589 --> 00:29:44,048
have been reported one this has been

603
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:46,480
reported with 40 CC and now we are

604
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:49,200
reporting if not just for TCC before the

605
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,808
individual traits and then this also

606
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:55,330
also another gene we we found out within

607
00:29:52,808 --> 00:29:58,210
those regions but then for the other

608
00:29:55,329 --> 00:30:00,548
significant regions we didn't see a lot

609
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:02,529
this has been reported many studies we

610
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:05,889
didn't see but we found a lot of stud

611
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:07,418
genes that are have biological functions

612
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:09,429
that we believe there may be further

613
00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:12,970
studies can help us understand the

614
00:30:09,429 --> 00:30:17,259
relationship with carotenoids another so

615
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:21,308
in conclusion we have seen that if we

616
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:23,500
are utilizing nears its roof a sleep aid

617
00:30:21,308 --> 00:30:25,089
not just understanding carotene oil will

618
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,819
change the way we are doing things if

619
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:30,009
you know type in and then that gives us

620
00:30:27,819 --> 00:30:32,189
hope in further study in the

621
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:34,119
relationship between TCC and other

622
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:36,880
component Ares that we have not been

623
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:40,058
looking at and back help us redefine our

624
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,530
selection index and all that one good

625
00:30:40,058 --> 00:30:43,509
news is that we got a positive

626
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:47,168
correlation between thesis and

627
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:51,009
individual traits and we verified a

628
00:30:47,169 --> 00:30:54,700
major trade agenda was been reported for

629
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:57,548
variation in TCC alongside other regions

630
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:59,619
previously reported and we're shown with

631
00:30:57,548 --> 00:31:01,898
the level of accuracies we got that you

632
00:30:59,618 --> 00:31:07,449
can use GS to improve carotenoids in

633
00:31:01,898 --> 00:31:10,959
cassava so quickly trying to make sure

634
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:14,528
every time the last study that is part

635
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:19,149
of my dissertation is part of the things

636
00:31:14,528 --> 00:31:21,278
I said we have assays to snip marker

637
00:31:19,148 --> 00:31:24,668
information and we're asking how can we

638
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:28,690
use it to redefine Nasri system in

639
00:31:24,669 --> 00:31:30,970
cassava so a little bit background I'm

640
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:37,509
showing a poly cross we have a 2d idea

641
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:39,940
and one thing we need to do is that and

642
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:43,389
making control process in cassava is

643
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:46,778
very difficult one is a little bit of

644
00:31:43,388 --> 00:31:48,488
yours we have closed that flower early

645
00:31:46,778 --> 00:31:50,618
two moons from two months three months

646
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:53,409
after planting and other ones that delay

647
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:56,048
but within the same clothes our flower

648
00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:58,299
within the same flower in them but I

649
00:31:56,048 --> 00:32:01,388
have the same flowering happy we see a

650
00:31:58,298 --> 00:32:05,918
lot of variable flowering habit some

651
00:32:01,388 --> 00:32:07,959
close the open up early in the day so if

652
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,690
you are used to crosses maybe it's very

653
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:13,569
difficult but is something I did like

654
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:15,489
every day so some clones we opened

655
00:32:13,569 --> 00:32:18,038
between L in the hours of the morning

656
00:32:15,489 --> 00:32:19,989
why some clones you have a bridge

657
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:22,419
crossing scheme and you're waiting for

658
00:32:19,989 --> 00:32:24,608
the female maybe the man has open and

659
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:26,649
then where you need to call a flower the

660
00:32:24,608 --> 00:32:28,658
other one has not opened after wait some

661
00:32:26,648 --> 00:32:30,788
time before you go to the next board and

662
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:33,970
come back you realize that it has opened

663
00:32:30,788 --> 00:32:37,298
behind you so a lot of variation and

664
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:41,379
then a lot of magic in cassava that you

665
00:32:37,298 --> 00:32:44,558
need to love before you can India and

666
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:47,589
working cassava because also so one of

667
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:52,349
the things I did by John you said is a

668
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:54,608
managing casual workers we hire

669
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:56,498
sometimes you have to hire up to 20

670
00:32:54,608 --> 00:33:01,028
people for crosses and all the rest of

671
00:32:56,499 --> 00:33:01,230
them is not cheap at all and producing

672
00:33:01,028 --> 00:33:03,450
boo

673
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:07,110
Danika seed when you are doing had

674
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:10,319
others kind of variation and then to get

675
00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:13,109
seeds that you can completely say that

676
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:16,319
these are true crosses most times easy

677
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:18,479
enough to design in a scheme of up to 20

678
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,220
clones are not a resume in those risky

679
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,589
you might end up getting five thousand

680
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:25,350
in a year and that is not good enough

681
00:33:22,589 --> 00:33:27,990
for any valuable breeding program so

682
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:32,759
that is one of the things we are looking

683
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:34,769
at and what had previously breeders have

684
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:38,369
tried relying on form of open

685
00:33:34,769 --> 00:33:40,589
pollination to improve creased increase

686
00:33:38,369 --> 00:33:43,048
the production of botanical seen or one

687
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:46,048
problem and one of them is fully cross

688
00:33:43,048 --> 00:33:49,079
which is more like isolation and then

689
00:33:46,048 --> 00:33:50,879
you pick your clothes that you're

690
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:53,519
interested in and then plot them in

691
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,950
isolation and allow them to miss

692
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,259
naturally so you don't have a problem of

693
00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:00,480
trying to control it but the problem

694
00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:02,429
here is that you laughs food parental

695
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,529
information so you don't know the

696
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:06,179
pudding do not know that right so they

697
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:09,779
have used it and then we are asking the

698
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:12,148
equation can we use the available marker

699
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,609
we have to see who can resolve and

700
00:34:12,148 --> 00:34:17,398
modify these kind of schema cassava so

701
00:34:14,608 --> 00:34:20,519
you can get a lot of seeds from open

702
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:26,069
pollination but then you need the

703
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:29,190
progeny yeah true parents so what we did

704
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:30,960
was to design a poly cross using the

705
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:33,418
same method I'm just showing a kind of

706
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,550
design on what you have to do you need a

707
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:39,269
good design so that you can implement

708
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:41,669
this is not like well cassava is

709
00:34:39,269 --> 00:34:44,489
naturally and are crossing crop but you

710
00:34:41,668 --> 00:34:47,549
still need to introduce a lot of design

711
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:49,648
so let's see this is one clone so you

712
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:52,139
want to make sure you randomize it such

713
00:34:49,648 --> 00:34:54,469
that you have to possibly increase the

714
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:56,700
probability of each cross and

715
00:34:54,469 --> 00:35:00,269
intermitting with a neighboring clone

716
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:03,929
that is not itself so for this we

717
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:08,119
selected 29 clones from our genomic

718
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:11,608
selection pipeline girls I have high

719
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:14,280
gbbs and one thing also we consider was

720
00:35:11,608 --> 00:35:15,000
trying to be sure that those clothes

721
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,580
have a

722
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,550
by the same flowering habit so that we

723
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:22,920
don't introduce well cassava is an issue

724
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:25,830
but then you still need to use tea see

725
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,570
that between sunflowers do they flower

726
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:30,210
early but they still have an overlap

727
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:33,260
between the long ones so but we try to

728
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:36,360
choose the ones that have an average the

729
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:39,540
similar flower in habit we try bringing

730
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:42,960
them randomisation using modified this

731
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:43,889
quasi Latin square design and then for

732
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,250
isolation

733
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:50,250
we tried observing 50 meters looking for

734
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:52,010
a few that has a kind of 50 meters

735
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:55,980
distance from any neighboring cassava

736
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:57,690
phobia we succeeded we're lucky we spoke

737
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:01,440
with the young breeding program so they

738
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:06,389
gave us a site with India am reading

739
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:08,610
program and yam yam experiment so we had

740
00:36:06,389 --> 00:36:10,109
a lot of em around this side and then we

741
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:12,900
were sure that we don't have any

742
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:15,990
neighboring cassava clone around but for

743
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,970
this study well the effect of the seed

744
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:20,389
production we succeeded in getting up to

745
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:22,799
17,000 seats that we processed and

746
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:25,109
fallujah they were modern since 5000

747
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,570
people just harvested and I know that

748
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:31,680
would be a gia produces more supports

749
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:34,019
more flowering and that shows us that

750
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:36,629
with these in terms of seed production

751
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:38,969
at least we are covered and then we are

752
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:42,869
faced with the issue of how do we is it

753
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:48,480
possible we can at least derive or have

754
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:51,299
a hood on the parantha or clothes that

755
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:55,289
contributed to those progenies so we use

756
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:58,289
about three to eight seeds they clone

757
00:36:55,289 --> 00:37:00,989
out of the 29 replications we had in the

758
00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:04,009
field and one approach of the parentage

759
00:37:00,989 --> 00:37:07,259
is using a relationship matrix

760
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:08,520
idea is that if genomic markers across

761
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,330
the genome can be used to measure

762
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:15,659
genetic similarities can we look at the

763
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:18,809
genomic matrix and then use the

764
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:20,940
coefficients of relationship matrix to

765
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:24,239
say something about parentage

766
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:26,720
a relationship of clones progenies with

767
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,848
parents so

768
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:37,489
that also we tried another approach

769
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:39,500
using an analyze regression so we looked

770
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:42,319
at this as a regression problem and

771
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:45,858
trying to fit the genotype of each

772
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,269
progeny a tip at a time against that of

773
00:37:45,858 --> 00:37:50,210
all the putative parents that are

774
00:37:47,269 --> 00:37:52,340
involved in this scheme and then get the

775
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:56,570
confident coefficients and then using

776
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:59,680
lasso as if as a restriction to put down

777
00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:03,950
some coefficients that are around 0 to 0

778
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:06,879
so the data set we use for this we try

779
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:09,379
simulating data set to represent

780
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,930
typically what we can have in a breeding

781
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:13,970
program we'll have a simple model where

782
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:17,389
we have like from each by parent across

783
00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:19,189
who have one seed and then we for here

784
00:38:17,389 --> 00:38:21,589
we assume like we have like a uniform

785
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:25,450
and random distribution going from

786
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:28,099
parents to progenies and another case we

787
00:38:25,449 --> 00:38:30,769
tried is simulating the second one but

788
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:33,859
here we use rahem allele frequencies

789
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:36,588
using one of the data from him across in

790
00:38:33,858 --> 00:38:38,179
mastery of our programs iit a just

791
00:38:36,588 --> 00:38:41,088
getting the whole thing and then using

792
00:38:38,179 --> 00:38:43,250
even the number of snips and the nesting

793
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:46,759
and also we tried to increase the number

794
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:48,920
of progenies so we have progenies are

795
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:51,140
related in the scheme and also the last

796
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,599
thing we did was sorry I should have

797
00:38:51,139 --> 00:38:56,900
reference you use the written language

798
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,369
scheme to bring in a level of since we

799
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:01,190
assuming that we have a random

800
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:03,559
distribution and any heritance here can

801
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:06,170
we account for the engage and then in

802
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:08,509
case in a pool where we had before do it

803
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:10,789
as always a crossing who have a mixture

804
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:13,099
of true crosses and surfing is there

805
00:39:10,789 --> 00:39:16,338
where we can separate the two so we try

806
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:20,480
see a simulated data set has both true

807
00:39:16,338 --> 00:39:23,900
self and then true and process we also

808
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,338
got data from our breeding programs

809
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:29,150
knackery and ITA

810
00:39:25,338 --> 00:39:33,139
Beatrice in Missouri we had about 379

811
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:35,690
crosses from Mochrie and then 764

812
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:38,960
progenies coming from a mixture of 80

813
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:40,670
progeny 80 parents and their lastly we

814
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,699
use those methods to check

815
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:49,789
the poly cross experiment we had in Puma

816
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:52,669
DK 2015 so the traditional assignment we

817
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:55,429
got one here reporting the three methods

818
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:58,369
are the two methods and then for the

819
00:39:55,429 --> 00:40:01,609
simulated data set we were able to

820
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:04,730
account to say okay e to parents there

821
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:07,039
are two recorded parents how accurate

822
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:09,619
are we in getting two of them so what we

823
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:11,239
did is to rank the coefficients we go

824
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:14,960
from the two methods and then the

825
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:17,000
topmost two we want to like give them

826
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,400
the chance that our assumed that they

827
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,489
should be different of the progeny

828
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:24,950
involved so for those top two parents

829
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:26,989
how sure how do they relate with the

830
00:40:24,949 --> 00:40:29,509
written record so for the simulator

831
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:30,949
results we add hundred percent accuracy

832
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:34,460
using the two methods

833
00:40:30,949 --> 00:40:37,569
but when we go to the data from the

834
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:40,909
breeding programs we had a level of

835
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:43,789
shift in accuracy is not 100 percent but

836
00:40:40,909 --> 00:40:46,909
then some of them were a bit low and

837
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:49,029
then for predicting male so it showing

838
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:51,649
like okay if they wrote male how

839
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:54,260
accurate are we in predicting the male

840
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:56,869
that is recorded against predicting the

841
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:59,180
male that is recorded for our progeny in

842
00:40:56,869 --> 00:41:01,549
all we realize the accuracies we're

843
00:40:59,179 --> 00:41:04,190
slightly I am analyze regression and

844
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:07,280
using regression will realize

845
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:09,470
relationship method even though most of

846
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,980
them we're still like about the same

847
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:15,949
range but accuracies in female we're

848
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:17,840
mostly better than in email which

849
00:41:15,949 --> 00:41:20,539
ordinary should be the case because

850
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:24,590
you're harvesting seeds from the plants

851
00:41:20,539 --> 00:41:26,300
so well while we are still asking a lot

852
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:29,210
of questions this is one of the initial

853
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:31,370
studies still room for development and

854
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:33,500
improve on some other things but we are

855
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:38,029
looking back on some of the things that

856
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:41,239
can affect or Ohio expected outcome some

857
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:43,670
of them range range from long

858
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:46,759
receptivity of the stigma cassava stigma

859
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:51,559
the normal process usually you make a

860
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:54,420
cross you cover for about 48 days but 48

861
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:56,449
hours but now we have seen that

862
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:59,220
from some experiments that are coming up

863
00:41:56,449 --> 00:42:02,308
specially from seeit the actually knows

864
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:06,058
that some autism plume still stay viable

865
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:08,010
or receptive up to five days so we might

866
00:42:06,059 --> 00:42:09,630
have to change it could be possible that

867
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:13,470
why you cross was not the one that was

868
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:17,010
taken and clone mislabeling that was

869
00:42:13,469 --> 00:42:20,909
also affected the experiment we had at

870
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:26,430
Moody K we gave people a design like row

871
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:29,670
column and then somebody's reading plot

872
00:42:26,429 --> 00:42:32,608
number in a zigzag method where we give

873
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:34,260
you from one direction one to twenty

874
00:42:32,608 --> 00:42:36,509
nine and you should come back to stop

875
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:39,059
I'd see from here but somebody starts

876
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:40,500
from this side so those things also it

877
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:43,019
can also happen when we are cutting

878
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:46,318
cassava use for teas and other cool

879
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:47,759
introduce miss labeling in the few that

880
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:50,338
were you Apple in igloo might actually

881
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,130
be something else bugging conditions

882
00:42:50,338 --> 00:42:55,048
with experience I realized that is not

883
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:58,108
like maze where you bag and then three

884
00:42:55,048 --> 00:43:00,719
we really use backs when sometimes over

885
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:02,900
years and that is giving us an idea

886
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:05,788
maybe we should start asking questions

887
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:08,940
looking at what is the effect of those

888
00:43:05,789 --> 00:43:12,450
battery usage whether they're open hosts

889
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:14,789
that these also eventually used cross

890
00:43:12,449 --> 00:43:16,259
and we clone that while we cover and

891
00:43:14,789 --> 00:43:18,480
think we have covered they were not

892
00:43:16,259 --> 00:43:20,730
really covered so those are some issues

893
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,219
do not have in error so we are still

894
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:25,559
trying to understand more about a study

895
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:28,500
and like I said is the initial one

896
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:30,359
another thing we ask is okay if you want

897
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:35,068
to separate between through process and

898
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:36,869
where you have probably soften events so

899
00:43:35,068 --> 00:43:39,239
we tried to look at the coefficients so

900
00:43:36,869 --> 00:43:40,798
here I'm showing a plot of the top most

901
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:43,618
number one predicted per and the

902
00:43:40,798 --> 00:43:46,079
coefficient of the where top most parent

903
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:50,059
and then the second one so when you plot

904
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:52,829
it we have seen a kind of pattern that

905
00:43:50,059 --> 00:43:54,990
most of them are within the true cross

906
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:57,298
sees within contribution of fifty

907
00:43:54,989 --> 00:43:59,879
percent from both parents they're about

908
00:43:57,298 --> 00:44:02,460
four therefore safe materials we are

909
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:04,619
having something hired and that he's

910
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:06,929
hired a hundred here because we use a

911
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:07,710
percentage of all the coefficients we

912
00:44:06,929 --> 00:44:12,568
have so

913
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:14,699
you might ask why is it above 100 so so

914
00:44:12,568 --> 00:44:16,409
with that also we try to get the ratio

915
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:18,509
between these the coefficient of the

916
00:44:16,409 --> 00:44:21,118
first one and the second one and we

917
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:22,980
realize that if is about 50/50 percent

918
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,559
contribution it should be about one

919
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:28,650
order above what values that are both

920
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:31,050
free or that we give them a red sign

921
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:33,030
both of them should be self material so

922
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:36,300
the same thing goes with the diameter

923
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:38,880
I'm just writing for the last method so

924
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:40,859
in conclusion we

925
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,490
easily use the abundant market

926
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:46,759
information to redesign one the

927
00:44:44,489 --> 00:44:49,858
advantage we have here is that we have

928
00:44:46,759 --> 00:44:53,190
access to abundant seeds that we can use

929
00:44:49,858 --> 00:44:57,719
to increase diversity improve accuracy

930
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:59,970
and then if we have a good recombination

931
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:04,368
between those traders also given a good

932
00:44:59,969 --> 00:45:09,209
news that we can use the method and

933
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:11,400
current genomic selection scheme and one

934
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:14,548
other thing is that we can with this

935
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:17,579
method be able to have a hold on the

936
00:45:14,548 --> 00:45:20,518
true parents of those progenies and that

937
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:23,369
would give us also if we are talking

938
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:26,669
about combination in all from our

939
00:45:23,369 --> 00:45:29,190
results we used 29 parents and in most

940
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:31,528
of the methods up to 28 parents even

941
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:33,990
though we use about 6% of the season we

942
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:36,480
generated showed up as one of the top

943
00:45:33,989 --> 00:45:40,018
two parents so what is sharina's I will

944
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,429
have a good hood of random combination

945
00:45:40,018 --> 00:45:43,979
of all the parents you have in a

946
00:45:41,429 --> 00:45:46,588
population so that's good and there we

947
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:51,240
can be thinking about trying to compare

948
00:45:46,588 --> 00:45:53,429
and get combining abilities between

949
00:45:51,239 --> 00:46:00,028
those parents and back and also redefine

950
00:45:53,429 --> 00:46:05,669
what we're doing cassava so in all I

951
00:46:00,028 --> 00:46:07,440
think try to be time nears come from

952
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:09,599
more phenotyping of known and emerging

953
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,000
quality traits we can use improve

954
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,700
phenotyping computed abundance genomic

955
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,818
information a good hood is that is good

956
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:21,179
tools to do more in added five regions

957
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:23,298
around there are significant for

958
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:25,639
variation in most of the non traits and

959
00:46:23,298 --> 00:46:28,858
currently we are doing some work to

960
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:31,828
identify some and user preference traits

961
00:46:28,858 --> 00:46:33,690
so we still need to have a good hood of

962
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:36,450
good infinite typing for all those

963
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:38,730
traits and then we can use you know why

964
00:46:36,449 --> 00:46:41,730
traditions to fast-track genetic in a

965
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:43,619
chaton cassabi didn't cycle and the last

966
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:46,740
thing i showed is that if we use the

967
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:48,568
abundant markers we can to stop at a

968
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:50,068
good we have a good results you are

969
00:46:48,568 --> 00:46:52,679
still going to study more and and

970
00:46:50,068 --> 00:46:56,460
develop on it but if we can do that

971
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:58,259
that gives us a good hold on changing

972
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:00,119
the pattern and breeding method

973
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:01,760
reshaping and redesigning breeding

974
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:05,789
method in cassava

975
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:09,028
so I want to just mention because over

976
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:12,539
time some other studies I was fully

977
00:47:09,028 --> 00:47:15,088
involved implementing years in NRI I

978
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:17,609
have data for calibration for starch and

979
00:47:15,088 --> 00:47:20,608
pasting protein cassava I'll be working

980
00:47:17,608 --> 00:47:23,278
on that after now I this part of the

981
00:47:20,608 --> 00:47:26,278
kind of mentoring program one of the MSC

982
00:47:23,278 --> 00:47:28,619
students that in energy is trying to

983
00:47:26,278 --> 00:47:32,099
compare the audiometers that people have

984
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:36,809
developed for TCC IJ from a mamita and

985
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:39,630
using comparative color chart so over so

986
00:47:36,809 --> 00:47:41,430
trying to also helping me as graduated

987
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:44,760
and then we have saluted our people now

988
00:47:41,429 --> 00:47:47,038
and other things we tried doing we have

989
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:50,460
bit effort to be working at the end of

990
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:53,069
the program trying to stand as I that

991
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:55,260
dies between the dextrose och has it a

992
00:47:53,068 --> 00:47:58,500
desktop nears and we have the pata

993
00:47:55,260 --> 00:48:00,539
bunions and they have developed cassava

994
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,088
calibration based over three years of

995
00:48:00,539 --> 00:48:05,490
for model so we are trying to see how we

996
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:08,338
can standardize between the two devices

997
00:48:05,489 --> 00:48:11,909
and possibly hear it yeah database in

998
00:48:08,338 --> 00:48:15,179
happiness improve on calibration model

999
00:48:11,909 --> 00:48:17,068
in Africa and then I was involved in few

1000
00:48:15,179 --> 00:48:20,818
studies trying to understand energies

1001
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:23,460
are preferences and all so publication

1002
00:48:20,818 --> 00:48:25,920
we have some of these already written

1003
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:29,099
and they're ready to go this one was

1004
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:32,608
like collaboration and then trying to

1005
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:35,609
put somebody up in yes technology too so

1006
00:48:32,608 --> 00:48:38,960
we saw meet early just like two weeks or

1007
00:48:35,608 --> 00:48:42,269
three weeks ago and the first study

1008
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:46,230
published in PLoS ONE and then involved

1009
00:48:42,269 --> 00:48:48,509
in general GS and energy and project so

1010
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:53,010
with this a whole lot of people I have

1011
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:57,990
the best committee members and then

1012
00:48:53,010 --> 00:49:02,039
thanks to Allah members both Sora's lab

1013
00:48:57,989 --> 00:49:03,598
and John Luke's lab want to thank people

1014
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:06,390
like Denise and all the rest of the

1015
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:09,480
amazing force in Anna's here everyone

1016
00:49:06,389 --> 00:49:12,089
and most importantly I want to thank the

1017
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:16,380
Gates Foundation and Reba Gates himself

1018
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:17,940
I wish sometimes I think he has the

1019
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:21,300
option of using his money for something

1020
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:24,210
else but that's good we Lin trying to

1021
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:25,740
invest it in Kesava research has seen

1022
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:28,829
some of us doing some of what we're

1023
00:49:25,739 --> 00:49:30,269
talking about so I want to appreciate in

1024
00:49:28,829 --> 00:49:34,019
we have collaborations with a lot of

1025
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:36,630
brightest yet and a saranac me another

1026
00:49:34,019 --> 00:49:38,369
race and Oh somebody I want to mention

1027
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:40,230
she was one of the people that

1028
00:49:38,369 --> 00:49:42,389
encouraged me to apply for the first

1029
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:45,659
time I met her I was like well I think I

1030
00:49:42,389 --> 00:49:47,579
don't think I know much about yes she

1031
00:49:45,659 --> 00:49:50,549
was like no go for it go for it apply

1032
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:52,730
let's see so I wish she's around so they

1033
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:56,640
had a I went for it and then I'm

1034
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:58,440
presenting today well those are some of

1035
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:02,279
the Oh stories I know the rest I want to

1036
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:04,230
thank my family it was rough my wife and

1037
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:09,390
I have a little boy that he's trying to

1038
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:12,929
reshape my life it was difficult or the

1039
00:50:09,389 --> 00:50:17,429
way especially in 2018 I almost gave up

1040
00:50:12,929 --> 00:50:19,169
like one of the shocking moments lost

1041
00:50:17,429 --> 00:50:22,440
one of the people that were so close to

1042
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:24,180
me a biological mom she told me go I

1043
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,630
will be dealt with receive me when you

1044
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:27,269
finish

1045
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:29,340
so those are emotional moments I just

1046
00:50:27,269 --> 00:50:31,860
taught myself to do try and behave

1047
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:35,410
myself so thanks for listening and then

1048
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:40,380
I'll be happy to take some questions

1049
00:50:35,409 --> 00:50:40,379
[Applause]

1050
00:50:42,960 --> 00:51:01,659
for me germinating I think it was your

1051
00:50:53,170 --> 00:51:04,300
second second chapter a single step

1052
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:07,839
model and 2 step model and for some

1053
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:10,570
reason we're two step was doing better

1054
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:13,329
than the one step no there's no reason

1055
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:14,800
why I mean it's the reason why did you

1056
00:51:13,329 --> 00:51:16,840
should be different right unless you

1057
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:21,550
give the true values that you're using

1058
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:25,300
are different or explanations yeah I

1059
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:29,710
guess I'm really issues this photo ID

1060
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:34,000
when you get it so for here when you're

1061
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:53,980
usually there single state motto for

1062
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:56,619
single trait I just write what I mean

1063
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:59,199
using the single stage are not into

1064
00:51:56,619 --> 00:52:01,119
athlete we had reps on all the rest of

1065
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:04,149
them because we don't have balance and

1066
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:06,250
beta only used location and set and we

1067
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:09,130
still had like something higher than the

1068
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:18,639
two stage I mean for once they should be

1069
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:22,140
the ideal thing but no I I don't live

1070
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:22,139
there people from genever

1071
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:35,969
any other questions we go hey um do you

1072
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:41,759
think of cosmos like taro turaga sets of

1073
00:52:35,969 --> 00:52:45,259
Hawaiian room those are similar sorry

1074
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:57,000
and that's your said central question

1075
00:52:45,260 --> 00:53:00,840
it's a lion okay also yeah um we call it

1076
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:04,380
in Nigeria similar yeah the they don't

1077
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:06,240
do root crops I thought I have a lot of

1078
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:11,000
each other woods

1079
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:17,009
[Laughter]

1080
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:21,449
this arrow is always like little small

1081
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:28,410
and then different and cassava is almost

1082
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:28,889
like a shrub and that kind of so they

1083
00:53:28,409 --> 00:53:32,449
are different

1084
00:53:28,889 --> 00:53:32,449
yeah but they are all

1085
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:38,239
in the in the last chapter there was a

1086
00:53:36,769 --> 00:53:45,318
thing where you dictate which one's the

1087
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:47,298
damage the data the females not 100% if

1088
00:53:45,318 --> 00:53:49,190
somebody recorded which plan things get

1089
00:53:47,298 --> 00:53:51,769
off up and that plan is the correct plan

1090
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:54,798
then you should that should be a hundred

1091
00:53:51,769 --> 00:53:56,088
percent right so then is is that can you

1092
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:58,730
go to that's life

1093
00:53:56,088 --> 00:54:01,420
is that female value essentially the

1094
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:04,969
maximum possible without Yugi

1095
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:07,519
you know without quality no human

1096
00:54:04,969 --> 00:54:11,808
qualities goal and then and then if

1097
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:15,318
that's true yeah like so for example in

1098
00:54:11,809 --> 00:54:17,298
here a beautiful one they're like let's

1099
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:20,750
save the penalized aggression and the

1100
00:54:17,298 --> 00:54:23,179
females in eighty percent of males 76 so

1101
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:26,780
so if you think about your ability to

1102
00:54:23,179 --> 00:54:31,068
actually predict that it it's really a

1103
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:33,140
lot better than yeah this event that

1104
00:54:31,068 --> 00:54:36,949
neater than you're saying right so so I

1105
00:54:33,139 --> 00:54:40,940
guess these another way that you can ask

1106
00:54:36,949 --> 00:54:44,000
the question of how how you should think

1107
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:46,429
of the name so how you can get those

1108
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:51,559
female prediction actors things to be

1109
00:54:46,429 --> 00:54:53,779
better yeah I mean this is the initial

1110
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:57,170
thing and then when we saw their desire

1111
00:54:53,780 --> 00:55:00,319
but it was like okay we need to check

1112
00:54:57,170 --> 00:55:01,818
back and ask a lot of questions we had

1113
00:55:00,318 --> 00:55:03,889
discussion with some of the breeding

1114
00:55:01,818 --> 00:55:06,130
programs and people and even we see it

1115
00:55:03,889 --> 00:55:08,750
that was when she borrows so does that

1116
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:10,849
covering and removing the bag within two

1117
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:12,650
days doesn't solve the problem some

1118
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:15,289
things could also happen but then for

1119
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:17,450
female we actually expected to have like

1120
00:55:15,289 --> 00:55:19,579
hundred percent accuracy if everything

1121
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:22,699
is alright so like I said there are

1122
00:55:19,579 --> 00:55:24,920
other factors we are not sure of we're

1123
00:55:22,699 --> 00:55:28,669
looking up to see how much we can do and

1124
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:33,670
if possible going forward set up more

1125
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:33,670
like ether experiments to see if we can

1126
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:59,149
right so you know we're gonna let a

1127
00:55:49,579 --> 00:56:01,068
system where when you make across a lot

1128
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:03,608
of things coming to the ISD stem

1129
00:56:01,068 --> 00:56:06,318
Cotton's most times these are done by

1130
00:56:03,608 --> 00:56:08,179
casual workers and you are having 50

1131
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:10,099
they are caught in every day one is

1132
00:56:08,179 --> 00:56:12,858
flying from here to the other point you

1133
00:56:10,099 --> 00:56:14,630
can also mix up clones I know that so a

1134
00:56:12,858 --> 00:56:16,489
lot of things that we have - we are

1135
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:30,019
improving trying to improve quality

1136
00:56:16,489 --> 00:56:33,739
control in Casa so we use these markers

1137
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:36,170
were using for GS I know something yeah

1138
00:56:33,739 --> 00:56:38,989
I know some people have done some

1139
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:41,139
studies looking at that you can use opt

1140
00:56:38,989 --> 00:56:43,338
I was talking with someone that

1141
00:56:41,139 --> 00:56:47,288
development package he said that from

1142
00:56:43,338 --> 00:56:50,750
his own experience he can use up to like

1143
00:56:47,289 --> 00:56:54,140
he was as low as 200 if you are sure

1144
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:57,079
there is a lot of polymorphism between

1145
00:56:54,139 --> 00:56:59,838
those traits that you can capture use as

1146
00:56:57,079 --> 00:57:02,329
low as 200 or thereabout so bow for us

1147
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:04,460
we didn't go into that some who have

1148
00:57:02,329 --> 00:57:07,010
done some studies on that but just for

1149
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:08,809
like a simple thing we are using I still

1150
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:12,289
want to Ronnie may be within my GS

1151
00:57:08,809 --> 00:57:15,410
pipeline now going into extra walk to

1152
00:57:12,289 --> 00:57:18,109
genotype or Lou for specific markers to

1153
00:57:15,409 --> 00:57:51,269
do that if I just uses a random and then

1154
00:57:18,108 --> 00:57:57,049
simple straightforward approach so

1155
00:57:51,269 --> 00:58:01,139
my name is here he's the quality champ

1156

and we are getting to ask deeper

1160
00:58:08,250 --> 00:59:39,719
questions can we change in region we

1161
00:58:13,800 --> 00:59:43,440
have a so this has been a production of
