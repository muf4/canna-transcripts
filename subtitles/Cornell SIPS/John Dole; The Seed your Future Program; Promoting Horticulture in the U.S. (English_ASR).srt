1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,030
all right well thank you all for coming

2
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:13,410
I appreciate it what I'm going to talk

3
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:14,730
about is our project to increase the

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,669
number of students in horticulture

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,528
programs now there's a number of authors

6
00:00:17,669 --> 00:00:22,800
on this and we're gonna see in a slider

7
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:24,899
to where these folks all fit in it truly

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,310
has been a very big project and a lot of

9
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:30,148
folks have been involved with it as

10
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:31,829
you're gonna see here in a bit um so how

11
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:34,530
did it all get started I'm gonna do just

12
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:37,320
a little bit on on what got us to the

13
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,750
point we're at today and it really in a

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,590
lot of ways is like the perfect movie

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,469
theme you know where these movies where

16
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,940
they've got one set of characters and

17
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:49,320
there's a little bit of on that and then

18
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:51,988
they bring in another set of characters

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,730
and then a third set of characters and

20
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:55,709
you know eventually all three sets of

21
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:57,029
characters are gonna interact but you're

22
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,469
not quite sure when that's going to

23
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,198
happen well that's kind of what was

24
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,838
happening here Mary Meyer was president

25
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:07,170
of the AHS and she was very focused on

26
00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:09,480
what we call plant blindness which is

27
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,240
where people or plants are all around us

28
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,880
I mean we were eating them you know with

29
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:17,609
the fruit salad but yet people aren't

30
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,159
aware of them as plants people just

31
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:23,670
don't pay attention to the plants that

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,519
are all around us and she was focusing

33
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,670
on that for her presidency for a SHS

34
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:32,549
about the same time Doug Needham and

35
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,040
Paul Redmond at Longwood Gardens had

36
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,840
been watching with interest what they

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,540
were all horticultural society was doing

38
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,250
now the United Kingdom is probably one

39
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,150
of the areas in the world that is most

40
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:48,120
into horticulture okay and yet they were

41
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:50,430
seeing declines in awareness and

42
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,290
interest in horticulture there and they

43
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:56,190
got very concerned about it so they

44
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,990
commissioned a study and a a project to

45
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,450
increase horticulture called

46
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:02,640
horticultural matters so Doug and Paul

47
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,530
we're seeing this seeing the success of

48
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,038
this and thinking we needed something

49
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,349
similar here in the United States and at

50
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,599
the same time as all that myself and the

51
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:14,189
horticultural administrators we meet

52
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,349
annually in one of the year

53
00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:18,419
we actually met here Marvin Pritz hosted

54
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:20,639
the meeting and what became very clear

55
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:23,129
is that for a number of us we were

56
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,439
losing ground in terms of students in

57
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:29,120
horticulture okay so that was one issue

58
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:31,800
but also it was becoming pretty clear

59
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,580
from the number of emails I was getting

60
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:39,240
that industry government agencies were

61
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:44,670
needing horticultural employees okay so

62
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:46,620
with that we we we did a real quick

63
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:49,949
survey and I'm not going to show you all

64
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:53,370
of it but just two at the main point

65
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:56,969
here the number of undergraduates in

66
00:02:53,370 --> 00:03:00,689
your program has increased greatly or

67
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:04,050
slightly so around 20 percent stayed the

68
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:08,099
same around a little over a third and

69
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:10,590
then the key point there over 40 percent

70
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:13,049
had either a slight or a major decrease

71
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,240
in the numbers of students now this is

72
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:18,360
one of those surveys that's good news

73
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,790
and bad news the bad news was yes a lot

74
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:24,540
of programs were going down but the good

75
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:27,569
news that gave us hope was up here some

76
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:30,000
of the schools were going up so what

77
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:32,609
were they doing how are they doing how

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,020
are they presenting the programs and as

79
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,360
we talk to some of those schools it

80
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:39,689
became clear that we could this was an

81
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:45,420
issue we could change if we focused on

82
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:46,530
it so a group of us came together we

83
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:48,988
were called though we called ourselves

84
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,699
the steering committee for a while three

85
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:52,830
folks from Longwood Gardens Doug Needham

86
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:54,419
Brian trader and Marnie Connolly and

87
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,550
then from the American side

88
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:59,369
horticultural science myself Mary Meyer

89
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:03,719
Mike Neff Mike Neff is the executive

90
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:06,269
director of a SHS and I came in a couple

91
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:09,509
years later as incoming president and

92
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:12,500
president of aho so we all got together

93
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:15,149
and we put together a white paper

94
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,370
basically this was our thoughts on what

95
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,798
the issue was and what we thought we

96
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,560
needed to do about it and we had three

97
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:25,019
very big goals first one improve public

98
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,490
perceptions of horticulture increase the

99
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:28,019
number of horticulture students in two

100
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,759
and four-year programs

101
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:31,799
and there was a number of actions we

102
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,770
thought we needed to do there and then

103
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,098
ultimately increasing the number of well

104
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:40,109
trained horticultural employees okay

105
00:04:38,098 --> 00:04:46,889
first one and the third one these are

106
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:49,949
very big ideas with our white paper in

107
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:52,970
hand we talked to other organizations

108
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:54,990
and we found a very receptive audience

109
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,789
this first group here these are the

110
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:01,129
signing partners they agreed to support

111
00:04:56,788 --> 00:05:04,110
the initiative in a big way okay and

112
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:05,728
this number 2013 is when we got them

113
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,310
lined up and then over a hundred and

114
00:05:05,728 --> 00:05:10,469
fifty others said they were very

115
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,300
supportive and would try to support it

116
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,169
in terms of financial and otherwise and

117
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:18,538
that was universities public gardens

118
00:05:15,168 --> 00:05:21,389
horticultural organizations so that

119
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:23,699
happened very quickly and it brought a

120
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:25,408
lot of people together now a lot of

121
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,990
organizations had been concerned about

122
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,288
this some hadn't started on working on

123
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,288
it

124
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:33,060
others had okay one of our principles

125
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:35,189
right from the very beginning was not to

126
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:40,500
duplicate what other people were doing

127
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:42,418
but try to draw it all together it

128
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,209
became clear this was quickly becoming

129
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:48,089
bigger than the steering committee could

130
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:50,598
handle so we brought in some help and we

131
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:53,478
put out a call for proposals and

132
00:05:50,598 --> 00:05:58,009
fleischman-hillard and scholastic

133
00:05:53,478 --> 00:06:00,089
put in the winning bid and the they were

134
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:02,009
what they were going to do was help us

135
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:05,218
with the research the marketing and the

136
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:07,319
education now we certainly are all

137
00:06:05,218 --> 00:06:09,629
familiar with research but the social

138
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:14,550
science stuff was a little bit outside

139
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:16,050
of our bailiwick okay so that's the

140
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,728
introduction on how we got here so let

141
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,199
me show you where we're at now I'm gonna

142
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:20,818
start first with some of the

143
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,240
organizational things then I'll get to

144
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:26,158
some of the research we have three

145
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,069
entities the national leadership cabinet

146
00:06:26,158 --> 00:06:31,740
which is co-chaired by Anna ball and

147
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:36,120
Paul Redmond from Longwood Gardens this

148
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,838
group is fundraising is a big part of

149
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,759
what they're doing

150
00:06:36,838 --> 00:06:39,870
spreading the message to other groups

151
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,790
okay

152
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,709
providing leadership for it

153
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,939
and we're the advisory council I'll show

154
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:47,819
you the list here in a minute

155
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:50,279
Charlie Hall and Sarah Cathcart are the

156
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:51,509
co-chairs of it this involves a lot of

157
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,949
the people from the various

158
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:56,009
organizations that we had been working

159
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:57,060
with okay the intent this group is

160
00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:01,680
really to help with the day-to-day

161
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:03,209
matters of the initiative and spreading

162
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,310
the word back to the various

163
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:08,129
organizations and one of the great

164
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:10,589
things we did fairly well about a year

165
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:12,089
and a half ago it's just made all the

166
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:14,039
difference in the world is by that point

167
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:16,529
we had raised enough funds and we were

168
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,750
able to hire an executive director and

169
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:20,039
Susan Yoder

170
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:23,730
you get a chance to meet her I hope you

171
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:25,980
do she's a force of nature and she has

172
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,750
just been doing a lot of great stuff she

173
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:31,530
came with a lot of experience from other

174
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:38,430
associations and has really made this

175
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:42,509
what it is totally coincidental surname

176
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:45,660
Yoder yeah yeah no relation that we're

177
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:50,009
aware of to the Yoder mums No yeah

178
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:51,300
pretty cool in it yeah all right so I'm

179
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:52,829
not gonna go through these names but

180
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,650
here's the list of the folks that are on

181
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:57,089
the leadership cabinet and again Anna

182
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:59,219
ball I think many of you know the name

183
00:07:57,089 --> 00:08:00,949
Anna ball and then Paul Redmond

184
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,050
executive director of Longwood Gardens

185
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:05,490
and then this Advisory Council now very

186
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,040
long and I know the print is pretty

187
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:13,680
small but you see a lot of a broad range

188
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:15,900
of associations companies and various

189
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,400
organizations and individuals coming

190
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:20,489
together and this is a very dynamic

191
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:22,289
group the next meeting the next

192
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,019
organizational meeting will be here in

193
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,100
Obion Longwood in February and when this

194
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:28,859
groups tickets together

195
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:31,790
lots of great ideas lots of energies and

196
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,918
they've really been getting a lot done

197
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:37,710
financial support one of the things we

198
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:40,529
did very early on was we went to the

199
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:42,599
universities with with horticulture and

200
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:45,829
asked them to donate we asked them to

201
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:49,410
donate a very specific amount of money

202
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:51,900
four thousand nine hundred and ninety

203
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:54,389
five dollars per year for three years

204
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,879
why four thousand nine hundred and

205
00:08:54,389 --> 00:09:00,058
ninety five dollars

206
00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:01,889
big traffic I don't know it's most

207
00:09:00,058 --> 00:09:05,990
schools 5,000 and up you have to go

208
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:08,009
through bid oh and a lot of schools did

209
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,649
Cornell being one of them very quickly

210
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:12,509
stepped up and that money was very

211
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:15,198
helpful for two reasons one is it got it

212
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:17,818
started in two when we went to industry

213
00:09:15,198 --> 00:09:20,219
they were very pleased to see that

214
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:22,409
academics were stepping up to support an

215
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:25,110
issue that affected academics quite a

216
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:27,178
bit and that had a big effect I know

217
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,399
that several the companies when they

218
00:09:27,178 --> 00:09:30,448
found out how many universities were

219
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,928
supporting it and what they were doing

220
00:09:30,448 --> 00:09:36,599
and they knew they knew how slim most of

221
00:09:33,928 --> 00:09:38,308
the university budgets were and not all

222
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,769
the universities were able to provide

223
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:42,749
the close to five thousand but a number

224
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:45,389
of them were it really made a difference

225
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:48,240
in terms of getting support from from

226
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:54,178
the industry and you can see we've got

227
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:56,789
quite a donor list now okay so since

228
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:58,588
then we've refined things and I will say

229
00:09:56,789 --> 00:10:02,610
actually Susan Yoder and the crew ever

230
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:04,050
find things into two main goals changed

231
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,209
the perception of horticulture by

232
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:08,219
increasing public awareness of the

233
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:10,888
positive and diverse attributes of the

234
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,360
profession and second was the increased

235
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:14,789
capacity in horticulture through a

236
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,169
perception shift that gets people to

237
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:25,019
view horticulture as a viable career

238
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:27,479
okay alright so what we're looking at is

239
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:30,058
we want to see a world where everyone

240
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:34,319
understands and values the importance of

241
00:10:30,058 --> 00:10:37,620
plants and the people who work in the

242
00:10:34,318 --> 00:10:41,998
art science technology and business of

243
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:44,789
horticulture where parents are always

244
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:49,278
key and educators encourage horticulture

245
00:10:44,789 --> 00:10:52,019
as a career but not shy away from it

246
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:57,028
where horticulture is viewed as a vital

247
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:59,428
viable and diverse career path and where

248
00:10:57,028 --> 00:11:03,928
we build a stronger pipeline of talent

249
00:10:59,428 --> 00:11:07,048
to bolster our industry okay so that in

250
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:08,850
a sense is the mission of seed your

251
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:10,078
future all right

252
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:14,788
so now let's get into some of the

253
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:16,258
details research you know not

254
00:11:14,788 --> 00:11:18,749
surprisingly this is something that

255
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:20,009
involves academia so of course research

256
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:22,979
was going to be at the core of this and

257
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:25,399
there's three phases of research the

258
00:11:22,979 --> 00:11:28,229
first one was internal to the industry

259
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:31,499
and I will say that each of these phases

260
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:33,660
could very easily be a talk in and of

261
00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:35,489
themselves but I'm gonna condense it

262
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:37,918
down quite a bit just gonna hit a few

263
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:39,720
highlights alright so the first one was

264
00:11:37,918 --> 00:11:41,220
internal the industry the second one was

265
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,879
focusing on the general public and the

266
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:49,288
third focused on middle school teachers

267
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:51,659
parents educators okay so in the first

268
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:53,519
part here the research consisted of

269
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:55,889
informal interviews literally

270
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,038
fleischman-hillard with convene groups

271
00:11:55,889 --> 00:12:03,089
and talk to people focus groups and then

272
00:11:59,038 --> 00:12:07,168
a formal online survey of around 500

273
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:08,910
respondents okay so I'm just going to

274
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:11,009
hit a couple of the points here why is

275
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:13,198
horticulture important and I know I'm

276
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:15,028
speaking to the choir here so this is

277
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:19,338
should not come as any big surprise

278
00:12:15,028 --> 00:12:22,649
reverse preserves diversity ensures life

279
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:23,970
you know all the aspects of horticulture

280
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:25,708
I mean we've had horticulture of the

281
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,869
food horticulture in terms of the

282
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:29,488
environment horticulture in terms of our

283
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:32,069
of about the internal and the external

284
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:35,639
environment provides food helps feed the

285
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:38,639
world enhances life and beauty ecosystem

286
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,198
restoration and sustainability okay so

287
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,329
these were all some of the responses

288
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:44,758
that we got what fleischman-hillard did

289
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:47,219
is they summarized and categorized a lot

290
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:49,168
of their responses so what are some of

291
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,658
the challenges lack of awareness and

292
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:54,178
understanding okay we're going to get to

293
00:12:51,658 --> 00:12:55,979
one of the key elements of awareness of

294
00:12:54,178 --> 00:12:57,688
horticulture here in a bit but a lot of

295
00:12:55,979 --> 00:12:59,609
people just really don't have a good

296
00:12:57,688 --> 00:13:02,368
understanding I think back to when I was

297
00:12:59,609 --> 00:13:03,809
a an undergraduate and people would ask

298
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:06,089
me what's my major and I would say

299
00:13:03,808 --> 00:13:07,798
horticulture either got a blank look or

300
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:09,929
something like that has something to do

301
00:13:07,798 --> 00:13:13,158
with corn right you know that was about

302
00:13:09,928 --> 00:13:15,538
as far as folks got even back then

303
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:17,338
skilled labor shortage just came up a

304
00:13:15,538 --> 00:13:19,678
lot from industry and government in

305
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:21,049
particular shrinking university programs

306
00:13:19,678 --> 00:13:22,559
we've talked about that already

307
00:13:21,048 --> 00:13:24,959
consolidation of degree

308
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:30,209
programs and then of course lack of

309
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:33,980
funding on the academic side so why do

310
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:36,210
we as horticulturists recommend careers

311
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:39,930
okay why would we encourage somebody

312
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:42,450
else to do it in the various aspects of

313
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:45,329
horticulture I know it's kind of small

314
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:49,070
print there but rewarding okay

315
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:53,160
time and time again that's what came up

316
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:56,070
28% diversity variety range of careers

317
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,689
available okay I think about my own

318
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:00,390
careers at zigged and zagged

319
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:03,540
okay ability to work outside working

320
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:05,870
with nature this will come up a lot

321
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:09,209
nature environment with a lot of

322
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:12,360
students good for the community helping

323
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:14,639
others impact the world environment

324
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,860
impact is another word that showed up a

325
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,220
lot and we're gonna see that at various

326
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:24,560
points through here with all the good

327
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:29,970
there's a bad gosh what did people look

328
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:31,889
low pay 59% all the rests kind of right

329
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,779
down there on that is something we're

330
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:35,759
aware of and we're working on we think

331
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:37,850
actually the perception of low pay is

332
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,620
probably greater than the low pay

333
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:43,290
actually is with the exception of

334
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:46,710
graduate students as way so I will start

335
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:47,299
with that following up on dinner last

336
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:50,400
night

337
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:52,769
okay so switching gears here gone to

338
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,539
Phase two this is the general public

339
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:56,730
asking them about awareness of

340
00:14:54,539 --> 00:15:00,870
horticulture in attitudes having to do

341
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:03,629
with horticulture okay part of this

342
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:07,560
research people were given various

343
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:09,389
phrases and they were asked to react to

344
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:11,789
how strongly they agreed with or

345
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:13,470
disagreed with these phrases now there's

346
00:15:11,789 --> 00:15:15,439
a number of them and for the sake of

347
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:18,120
time I'm just going to show you one here

348
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:22,980
horticulture is essential to our food

349
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:26,220
water and environment only 34 percent of

350
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:29,970
18 to 34 year olds strongly agreed with

351
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,779
this on the surface okay that's a third

352
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:35,509
that's not bad

353
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:35,509
but think about what that saying food

354
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:41,970
only a third of folks thought that

355
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:43,919
horticulture was essential for food okay

356
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:46,170
and you think about what you eat in a

357
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,969
normal day you know the row crops

358
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:50,189
agronomy provides the bulk of our

359
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:52,320
calories but really it's the

360
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:54,060
horticulture that provides a lot of the

361
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,810
taste it provides a lot of the

362
00:15:54,059 --> 00:16:00,199
phytonutrients okay and how critical

363
00:15:56,809 --> 00:16:03,389
horticulture is to what we eat and yet

364
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,220
only about a third made that connection

365
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:10,379
so that's why that was pretty

366
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:13,200
significant um marry familiarity with

367
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:15,659
horticulture in general unless is very

368
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,300
broadly defined and this is going to be

369
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:21,360
important for later it tended to be a

370
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:25,740
little bit more better with older folks

371
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:29,459
35 years and older a little higher with

372
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:32,220
Caucasian the wealthier they were more

373
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:36,649
aware of horticulture college degree

374
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:40,709
more aware of horticulture although not

375
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:43,049
significally significant the younger the

376
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:45,419
less likely people were to be aware of

377
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:47,219
horticulture and again the researchers

378
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:49,828
in this case we're taking a very broad

379
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,110
definition of horticulture if they

380
00:16:49,828 --> 00:16:54,449
mentioned just anything in I could

381
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:59,639
remotely be connected they counted it as

382
00:16:54,450 --> 00:17:01,528
aware okay but when we flip it around

383
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:05,759
when you tell people what is involved

384
00:17:01,528 --> 00:17:08,279
with horticulture they get very very

385
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,509
positive in fact I'm going to step back

386
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:11,549
just a little bit when we were

387
00:17:09,509 --> 00:17:14,669
interviewing firms to do the marketing

388
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:17,279
and the research fleischman-hillard had

389
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:19,829
done a quick survey to get ready for

390
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:22,099
their presentation and they said they at

391
00:17:19,828 --> 00:17:26,399
that time had not worked with an issue

392
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:28,259
or the basics were so positive okay

393
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,640
because some of these firms work with

394
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:33,079
you know companies that are trying to

395
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,800
resurrect their image or you know

396
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:37,799
professionals that are trying to raise

397
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,480
their L their image they said no this

398
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:41,940
one they were excited about this one

399
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:45,029
because the basics were there everybody

400
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:47,990
likes horticulture they just don't know

401
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:47,990
it's horticulture Oh

402
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:56,230
now getting to the Phase three parts

403
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:58,299
here consistent of online surveys part

404
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:00,759
of this was two reasons one is to get

405
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:04,329
information and two was to get an idea

406
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:07,450
of what the the populations view of

407
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:10,509
horticulture was the next phase is going

408
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,980
to be trying to change that and so if

409
00:18:10,509 --> 00:18:13,569
you want to change something and you

410
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,210
want to assess it you want to have

411
00:18:13,569 --> 00:18:18,490
numbers to compare it with so the idea

412
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:20,650
was to find out what are the baseline so

413
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:26,200
as we go forward hopefully will effect a

414
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:28,330
change and carrot 7th 8th to 9th graders

415
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,009
a thousand a thousand parents five

416
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:32,199
hundred teachers and two hundred

417
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:34,660
guidance counselors that's the number of

418
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:41,230
people that participated in the online

419
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:44,140
surveys ok the slide deck that they sent

420
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:46,329
us for this part was over 80 slides so

421
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:49,840
I'm just gonna pick a couple all right

422
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:54,189
um remember this is seventh eighth and

423
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:56,649
ninth graders already almost a third

424
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:59,559
want to get a bachelor's degree in a

425
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:02,130
quarter of oh my masters or a PhD now I

426
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:07,240
don't know about you but when I was a

427
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:09,340
ninth grader I had not a clue I mean I

428
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,230
was still I'm sure I was thinking about

429
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:12,970
going to college at that time but yet a

430
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:15,549
quarter of students are already thinking

431
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:18,579
that they're gonna get a masters or a

432
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:22,329
doctorate so they're already thinking

433
00:19:18,579 --> 00:19:24,789
about stuff and then a fair number ready

434
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:25,809
thinking about associate's degree so we

435
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:29,200
got a lot of students that are already

436
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:33,579
thinking about what's next after high

437
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:37,299
school okay so what they did was they

438
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:39,639
asked these students parents educators

439
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:42,789
counselors about a broad range of

440
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,620
careers we've got education psychology

441
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:47,349
nursing biology communications

442
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:50,129
accounting agriculture and then the nice

443
00:19:47,349 --> 00:19:54,819
short little bar here is horticulture

444
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:56,650
okay even less than agriculture so it

445
00:19:54,819 --> 00:20:00,309
shows that people really are not aware

446
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:02,100
of horticulture as a career as a degree

447
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:04,419
program

448
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:05,709
now this craft takes a little bit of

449
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:08,470
explaining okay

450
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,450
so this on this axis here is the

451
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:13,779
percentage and then here are very

452
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:16,750
various attributes so we have impact

453
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:19,000
creativity flexibility passion location

454
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:24,519
of job status compensation job

455
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:27,250
availability the blue bar is what folks

456
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:29,470
thought about in terms of horticulture

457
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:31,809
so they're given a general idea of what

458
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:38,049
horticulture is and then they're asked

459
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:40,779
to react to that okay the red line is

460
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:45,730
what mrs. students the red line is what

461
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:48,639
students want in their career the

462
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:52,630
difference the gap between the blue and

463
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:55,960
the red is an issue we have to work with

464
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:59,500
other careers don't show this gap okay

465
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:04,329
other careers the awareness of the

466
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:07,299
career is much closer to what students

467
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:10,899
want out of a career so the difference

468
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:12,789
here in particular passion I know a lot

469
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,430
of very passionate horticulturist trust

470
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:17,440
me but yet the general public doesn't

471
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:20,080
view horticulture as being a career one

472
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,450
would get passionate about and a lot of

473
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,609
students wanted a career that they could

474
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:27,220
really get passionate about so you see

475
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:29,979
the difference there that percentage is

476
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:32,620
what we have to work on okay and it was

477
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:35,589
very clear there was some cases where

478
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:37,449
this line went below but it was on

479
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:39,579
characteristics that a lot of students

480
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:44,100
didn't think were that important so

481
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:46,539
we've got to increase/decrease that gap

482
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:48,219
okay the next part of the pastry

483
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:51,009
research was focus groups bringing

484
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,480
people in and talking with them the six

485
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:54,700
of these were in urban areas and they

486
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,470
were conducted in person another six

487
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,830
were in rural areas and they were

488
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:02,170
conducted online with cameras and and

489
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:05,039
it's very cool how this stuff happens

490
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:05,039
okay

491
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:13,059
what became clear from the focus groups

492
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:14,500
is that dudes really want to do

493
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:17,970
something that they're passionate about

494
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:20,859
okay passion has come up multiple times

495
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:24,880
they want to be creative and they want

496
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:26,109
to see impact from their work and they

497
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,030
want to do something that makes a

498
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:31,750
positive impact on the world

499
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:33,250
it was really fascinating because you

500
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:36,910
know again I think back to when I was

501
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:40,230
younger how really advanced in some ways

502
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:43,269
young people are today in terms of

503
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:46,150
seeing the world and where they fit into

504
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:50,200
that and wanting to have an impact even

505
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:53,050
at that young age okay they want to use

506
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:56,610
words well we have to use words that

507
00:22:53,049 --> 00:23:00,389
resonate with you the participants liked

508
00:22:56,609 --> 00:23:03,029
sophisticated sounding names you know

509
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:09,480
and let me talk a little bit about

510
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:09,480
awareness of Horticulture here okay so

511
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:23,400
in these focus groups what percentage of

512
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:26,550
people do you think were aware of

513
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,620
horticultural knew what horticulture was

514
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:33,639
okay

515
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:41,319
what percentage so this is a class

516
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:46,060
question here 15% okay very good other

517
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:50,429
suggestions 30 a very positive person

518
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:50,429
very good other suggestions

519
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:59,349
unfortunately it was zero this is where

520
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,940
they were being asked the word and they

521
00:23:59,349 --> 00:24:06,579
were not being given anything leading up

522
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:09,670
to it yeah zero well and parents and

523
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:13,809
teachers now it's a small group because

524
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:15,490
it's focus groups zero not a one in this

525
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:17,500
particular groups now we had some

526
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:19,870
awareness earlier but a lot of that was

527
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,450
where they were people were led into it

528
00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:23,889
you know the components of horticulture

529
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:28,538
then they were able to put it together

530
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:31,509
so zero in all of our you know we've had

531
00:24:28,538 --> 00:24:33,009
conference calls regularly or the

532
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:35,019
steering committee and then later on and

533
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:36,640
that's a question we often came back to

534
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:40,240
was what do we do with the word

535
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:42,309
horticulture because it is clear that

536
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,798
the general public does not know what

537
00:24:42,308 --> 00:24:48,158
horticulture is but if you try to think

538
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:51,730
about what one word encompasses all that

539
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:54,700
horticulture is yeah that's a tough

540
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:56,380
that's a tough question so we finally

541
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,909
just had to stop talking about it

542
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,760
because we kept going down that rabbit

543
00:24:57,909 --> 00:25:03,039
hole and this really these focus groups

544
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:05,379
really clearly showed that we have an

545
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:06,940
issue so one of the fun things they did

546
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:10,330
in these focus groups as they asked

547
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:13,058
alright so if not horticulture what else

548
00:25:10,329 --> 00:25:14,379
and different categories came up plant

549
00:25:13,058 --> 00:25:18,700
science of course we know that's already

550
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:20,890
being used plant ology tells me now the

551
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:24,819
academic in me when I first saw that

552
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:27,220
it's just like Oh made up word you know

553
00:25:24,819 --> 00:25:30,009
but I have since grown to actually kind

554
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:32,950
of like that one land arts plant mastery

555
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:38,579
buying arts I suspect there were some

556
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:40,960
adults here having to do with wine the

557
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:42,639
the corresponding part of culture is

558
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,190
plant scientists plant ologist

559
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:51,909
food and flowers specialists land

560
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:53,860
artists and plant master okay so one of

561
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:56,679
the things we susan has done in

562
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:58,298
workshops is to ask people to take a

563
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:01,778
moment to think about what they would

564
00:25:58,298 --> 00:26:04,000
call themselves so think about that what

565
00:26:01,778 --> 00:26:06,880
would you Amanda here was calling

566
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:11,159
herself plant master what would you call

567
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:14,649
yourself to somebody who has no idea

568
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:17,740
what horticulture is and is not an

569
00:26:14,648 --> 00:26:20,548
academia so we don't really care think

570
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,548
about that alright

571
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:25,049
okay so just to summarize real quick

572
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:26,759
finish up here students want to career

573
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:28,470
that off is more than a paycheck they

574
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:31,140
want to be creative and they want to

575
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:34,589
have an impact okay again creativity

576
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:36,840
impact so what do we have to do we have

577
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:39,629
to create a favorable perception of

578
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:43,009
horticulture and the careers associated

579
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:43,010
with it okay

580
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:50,190
parents those who were familiar with

581
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:53,160
horticulture had a very narrow view of

582
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:55,410
what it was and what I mean by that is

583
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,420
somebody might have some awareness of

584
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:59,460
horticulture but they might think it

585
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:03,750
only had to do with being a landscaper

586
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:08,400
or only had to do with being a gardener

587
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:11,160
or a vegetable gardener very few had any

588
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,200
awareness of the breath aboard of

589
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,610
culture from the you know just think

590
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,220
about in the university here we've got

591
00:27:14,609 --> 00:27:19,079
applied science to very basic science

592
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,089
all the various careers that our

593
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:24,000
students go into you know most people

594
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:27,329
just do not have awareness of that um

595
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,450
talking about the variety of jobs when

596
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:31,919
parents are looking into information to

597
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:35,130
try to help their children out with

598
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:38,640
careers they cast a very broad net the

599
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:41,190
Internet educators counselors they draw

600
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:45,030
in all the information that they can to

601
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:46,380
help their their their children one of

602
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:48,569
the things we've got from this is we

603
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:51,450
need a very robust digital presence

604
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:54,269
because a lot of time by parents is

605
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:57,660
spent online researching various careers

606
00:27:54,269 --> 00:28:00,059
and offering suggestions to their to

607
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,050
their their children so we've got a lot

608
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:02,909
of work to do here

609
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:07,740
and we have already started on some of

610
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:10,529
that teachers the summary while some

611
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,150
have heard of horticulture no one

612
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:13,980
encountered a student who was actually

613
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:15,300
interested in horticulture now again

614
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,420
we're going back to this fairly narrow

615
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:21,119
group the focus groups but still that's

616
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:23,250
that's an issue however once they

617
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,019
learned about it and as I mentioned

618
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:27,660
before they became very positive about

619
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:29,309
it again horticulture in and of itself

620
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:33,630
is something that a lot of people like

621
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:34,289
once they learn about it and they came

622
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,410
up with a lot

623
00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:39,829
connections that they could see between

624
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:42,900
the the more general public sort of

625
00:28:39,829 --> 00:28:44,460
activities in horticulture nature and

626
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,470
the outdoors food and cooking health

627
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,960
nutrition science and experimentation

628
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:50,730
environmental environmental ISM all of

629
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,090
this can be connected to horticulture

630
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:56,670
and teachers want lesson plans and

631
00:28:54,089 --> 00:28:59,369
activities to help integrate plants into

632
00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:01,019
their curriculum okay and that's one of

633
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:02,759
the things we're working on we know

634
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:03,119
there's a lot of information already out

635
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:05,730
there

636
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:08,479
FFA for example 4-h has a lot of great

637
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:11,240
curriculum so what the intent is to be

638
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,490
seen your future be a clearinghouse for

639
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,650
that information and then look for the

640
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:18,509
gaps and what might not be there we

641
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:22,350
might have to fill in but at least not

642
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:25,559
recreate the wheel so guidance

643
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:26,819
counselor's in middle school guidance

644
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:28,470
counselor's are actually doing

645
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:31,349
relatively little in terms of career

646
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:34,769
they're doing a lot of be the counseling

647
00:29:31,349 --> 00:29:36,529
they're the metrics the sort of thing

648
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:40,109
they're managing the day-to-day issues

649
00:29:36,529 --> 00:29:41,940
so middle school counselors we have

650
00:29:40,109 --> 00:29:45,240
decided are not going to be a primary

651
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:49,320
focus okay but I will say high school

652
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:51,329
counselors they tend to rely a lot on

653
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:53,099
what they get from universities which is

654
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:55,109
very nice this came up in some of the

655
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:59,669
early work and I should have mentioned

656
00:29:55,109 --> 00:30:02,369
back earlier as we were getting into the

657
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:04,320
information it became clear that we

658
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:06,839
needed to change our focus just a little

659
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:08,609
bit going into this the steering

660
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:10,159
committee we thought that we were going

661
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:13,589
to need to be focusing on high school

662
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:15,779
okay what we realized through the

663
00:30:13,589 --> 00:30:18,750
research is that by the time students

664
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:22,559
are in high school the general path is

665
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:25,170
set the individual career is not now I

666
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,490
mean I deal with a lot of incoming

667
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:28,230
freshmen and some of them have a very

668
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:32,490
good idea what they're gonna do and some

669
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:36,299
don't but almost always they have a

670
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:38,309
direction figured out okay what we

671
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:41,430
realized is that we needed to help

672
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:43,319
change the direction towards plants in

673
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:47,879
horticulture and that was going to need

674
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:51,298
to happen earlier so somebody in hi-c

675
00:30:47,878 --> 00:30:52,228
cool you know they they might you know

676
00:30:51,298 --> 00:30:55,918
they might be narrowing it down to

677
00:30:52,229 --> 00:30:58,499
plants environment biology lawyer doctor

678
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,749
this sort of thing so we decided we

679
00:30:58,499 --> 00:31:02,308
needed to go earlier to start getting

680
00:31:00,749 --> 00:31:05,429
people interested in plants in general

681
00:31:02,308 --> 00:31:07,459
to help set the direction and then the

682
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:10,190
actual career will come later and

683
00:31:07,459 --> 00:31:12,989
luckily as I mentioned by the time

684
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:15,629
counselors are in high school they

685
00:31:12,989 --> 00:31:17,788
actually rely a lot on universities we

686
00:31:15,628 --> 00:31:18,808
have a lot of cachet to them because

687
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:21,778
think about it all the information

688
00:31:18,808 --> 00:31:25,608
that's on the internet you want to rely

689
00:31:21,778 --> 00:31:28,138
on information from universities ok so

690
00:31:25,608 --> 00:31:30,028
overall campaign we want to use words

691
00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:33,238
that resonate we have really learned

692
00:31:30,028 --> 00:31:36,509
that words make a big deal we need to

693
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:38,969
describe horticulture in terms of impact

694
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:40,769
food environmentalists you know

695
00:31:38,969 --> 00:31:44,548
environmentalism making those

696
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:46,348
connections we need to talk about how

697
00:31:44,548 --> 00:31:48,598
horticulture affects that we need to

698
00:31:46,348 --> 00:31:51,448
stress the diversity of jobs highlight

699
00:31:48,598 --> 00:31:54,028
job availability tell the right stories

700
00:31:51,449 --> 00:31:55,889
with the right imagery and give the

701
00:31:54,028 --> 00:31:57,659
tools to the teachers that just sounds

702
00:31:55,888 --> 00:31:59,058
so simple doesn't it we just got to do

703
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:02,579
that and everything will be better

704
00:31:59,058 --> 00:32:05,459
there's a lot involved with that what's

705
00:32:02,578 --> 00:32:08,009
really nice is I can speak as a former

706
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:10,259
department head when we started to go

707
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:11,459
down the path of what to do try to

708
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:15,989
recruit more students into horticulture

709
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:18,269
at NC State and it's just such a broad

710
00:32:15,989 --> 00:32:21,088
field and you get half a dozen people

711
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:23,399
together and all the great ideas people

712
00:32:21,088 --> 00:32:25,528
came up with we were quickly overwhelmed

713
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:29,728
what the research has done has allowed

714
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:31,528
us to focus we know that for high school

715
00:32:29,729 --> 00:32:35,038
guidance counselor's for example they

716
00:32:31,528 --> 00:32:37,469
want stuff they want pieces short

717
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:39,719
one-page pieces they can hand to their

718
00:32:37,469 --> 00:32:40,909
students they can keep a stack on the

719
00:32:39,719 --> 00:32:44,159
desk and just very quickly

720
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:46,079
not so much videos not so much some of

721
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,119
the other things so we've been able to

722
00:32:46,078 --> 00:32:51,328
target what we need to do for which

723
00:32:48,118 --> 00:32:52,918
group like I said early on I was just we

724
00:32:51,328 --> 00:32:55,528
were getting overwhelmed as to what we

725
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:57,749
what we could do so how are we going to

726
00:32:55,528 --> 00:33:01,348
make this happen the next step is an

727
00:32:57,749 --> 00:33:01,798
education plan with tools curricula web

728
00:33:01,348 --> 00:33:04,230
resource

729
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:06,569
partnerships of course in an advocacy

730
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:11,429
and marketing plan to get all this

731
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:13,678
information out and that is that's in

732
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:16,139
progress and there's some of the imagery

733
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,820
right there that's moving forward and

734
00:33:16,138 --> 00:33:23,939
that's going to be the next stage so

735
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:27,019
with that I'll just kind of did it this

736
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,019
is a video we put together

737

751
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:56,318
right questions comments this is yeah

752
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:59,890
it's final for this this phase of the

753
00:35:56,318 --> 00:36:02,739
project the next phase of the project is

754
00:35:59,889 --> 00:36:04,809
really focusing on very specific videos

755
00:36:02,739 --> 00:36:08,139
in fact I think they've got one done

756
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:10,568
already interviewing folks why they got

757
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:13,358
into horticulture and what their path

758
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:15,190
was so at this point it's going to get

759
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:18,400
more specific and it's going to be

760
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:36,990
specific videos to help do certain parts

761
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:36,990
of the campaign oh yeah yes yes yes

762
00:36:50,429 --> 00:36:56,980
clearly a branding issue with with the

763
00:36:53,679 --> 00:37:00,159
neem horticulture yes yeah there is not

764
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:06,219
an issue with the lack of teaching plant

765
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:11,949
biology or botany he gets a lot of

766
00:37:06,219 --> 00:37:16,539
education in right now and suddenly

767
00:37:11,949 --> 00:37:18,969
respiration so it seems like the target

768
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:22,389
while building some lesson plans and

769
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:24,639
activities is great but getting into

770
00:37:22,389 --> 00:37:28,299
textbooks the name horticulture and

771
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:30,429
defining that in the textbooks difficult

772
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,990
to do and expensive but it seems like

773
00:37:30,429 --> 00:37:33,429
that's where teachers that's where

774
00:37:31,989 --> 00:37:35,709
students are going to get it that's what

775
00:37:33,429 --> 00:37:39,429
teachers are gonna teach out it exactly

776
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:41,019
yeah yes that is that's that's part of

777
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:43,629
the curriculum so these things are going

778
00:37:41,019 --> 00:37:45,309
on if they can use horticultural crops

779
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:48,070
if they can use horticultural plants and

780
00:37:45,309 --> 00:37:51,429
make that connection yes you're exactly

781
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:56,010
right that is part of what they what

782
00:37:51,429 --> 00:37:56,009
we're trying to do yeah exactly

783
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:10,029
no we need to make that connection

784
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:19,900
exactly right yes Geneva do you have any

785
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:23,380
questions jump to the the one problem

786
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:26,289
that you showed so clearly and I'd say

787
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:28,660
even so we report on the starting

788
00:38:26,289 --> 00:38:30,909
salaries of graduates and various majors

789
00:38:28,659 --> 00:38:32,739
here and horticulture usually looks

790
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:35,589
terrible in part because a lot of

791
00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:37,149
students will go to a seasonal job or an

792
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:40,030
internship or something it's their first

793
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:43,000
job and so the median ends up low as a

794
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:44,830
result right and that's that's kind of

795
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,980
what people see so that's obviously bad

796
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:50,559
advertising do you have examples that

797
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:52,840
you can use of the more room you know

798
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:56,920
if jobs a horticulture graduate might

799
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:57,490
get straight out of school that's a very

800
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,530
good question

801
00:38:57,489 --> 00:39:02,409
and we are aware of that and we think

802
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:03,340
that once a lot of this gets launched

803
00:39:02,409 --> 00:39:05,559
that one of these we're going to need

804
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:09,280
you to do is to really get a much better

805
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:10,869
idea of salaries and I can great I need

806
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,360
to rely a little bit on my floor

807
00:39:10,869 --> 00:39:17,139
cultural background one of the magazines

808
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:19,630
for many years did a release a survey

809
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:23,049
and it broke out the greenhouse industry

810
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:26,079
by manager grower s control and that

811
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:28,570
really did a very good job of splitting

812
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,090
out the various job types and the

813
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:32,350
salaries and the salaries in those cases

814
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:33,880
looked pretty good especially for the

815
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:36,039
manager you know in some of those other

816
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,240
categories what we're seeing is partly

817
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:39,489
what you're talking about

818
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:43,089
it's the blending together of

819
00:39:39,489 --> 00:39:45,429
entry-level jobs along with professors

820
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:49,240
and that sort of thing and business

821
00:39:45,429 --> 00:39:51,489
owners you know when you when you blend

822
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:54,279
it all together yeah you know the large

823
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:56,829
number of low numbers from folks that

824
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:59,260
are making minimum wages on a landscaper

825
00:39:56,829 --> 00:40:01,929
you know working on a landscape crew

826
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:03,580
really brings down the overall averages

827
00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:06,099
so I think what we need to do there is

828
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:09,309
for each of the industry is really pull

829
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:12,969
out the job categories and separate out

830
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:15,670
entry level which is low I will you know

831
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:18,069
I will reef 'really admit that but it's

832
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:21,400
low for most careers entry level tends

833
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:23,620
to be very low and separate that out

834
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,599
from the higher level jobs and those are

835
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:29,920
the jobs really that we are training our

836
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:32,230
students or yes we know that a lot of

837
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,599
you I mean I mowed lawns when I was

838
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:37,960
young but that's not what I went to

839
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:39,730
college for I went to college to train

840
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,940
for other kinds of jobs including one

841
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:43,929
right here in front of you now so we've

842
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,829
got to do a much better job of

843
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:47,559
separating that out

844
00:40:44,829 --> 00:40:49,299
we don't other than in a few narrow

845
00:40:47,559 --> 00:41:19,900
instances we don't have that data right

846
00:40:49,300 --> 00:41:22,560
now that's a very important thing and

847
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:25,150
we're doing I'll bet a lot at NC State

848
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:27,639
the Horticulture Department NC State now

849
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:29,320
requires an internship

850
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:32,440
soon to have an internship before they

851
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:34,120
go out and on a broader scale we've done

852
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:37,780
a lot of survey work at the College of

853
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:41,199
Ag level looking at what components of a

854
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:43,960
resume does industry want or look for

855
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:47,889
the most and one of the highest scoring

856
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:49,179
is internships so that shows up a lot so

857
00:41:47,889 --> 00:41:52,239
we do know that internships are

858
00:41:49,179 --> 00:41:55,809
important that is something that we're

859
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:58,689
trying an NC State to to make it easier

860
00:41:55,809 --> 00:42:00,849
for students to do and yet it also came

861
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:02,679
up in the seed your future under the

862
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:04,449
phase one one of the other questions

863
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:06,449
which I didn't show was we asked

864
00:42:04,449 --> 00:42:10,239
industry what do you think you could do

865
00:42:06,449 --> 00:42:12,549
to help increase awareness of

866
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:14,679
horticulture and they suggested

867
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:30,370
internships as well so I think on both

868
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:34,169
ends of things surprised me because most

869
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:38,440
horticulturist I know about horticulture

870
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:41,289
it would seem to be an area to really

871
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:44,619
emphasize in future videos and

872
00:42:41,289 --> 00:42:47,230
educational efforts to really bring out

873
00:42:44,619 --> 00:42:48,489
the passion that people feel about field

874
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:50,110
of horticulture

875
00:42:48,489 --> 00:42:52,119
I agree completely and that's one of the

876
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:54,190
ones that surprised us the most because

877
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:57,579
we do know so many folks that are just

878
00:42:54,190 --> 00:43:00,309
so into what they do but yet that didn't

879
00:42:57,579 --> 00:43:01,960
come through so a lot of for people not

880
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:04,630
aware of horticulture just don't know

881
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:06,460
that we really like what we do and we're

882
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:07,920
into it and yeah we've got to work on

883
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:13,329
that

884
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:16,298
yeah so it seems like there's this

885
00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:17,589
pipeline where you looking undergraduate

886
00:43:16,298 --> 00:43:19,838
enrollment and you're talking about

887
00:43:17,588 --> 00:43:21,849
interstate moisture for our professors

888
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:24,009
academics what's the thought about

889
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:25,568
people who work in horticulture but

890
00:43:24,009 --> 00:43:27,460
might not necessarily need to mind a

891
00:43:25,568 --> 00:43:29,798
graduate degree are you guys working to

892
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:33,548
facilitate any kind of apprenticeship

893
00:43:29,798 --> 00:43:35,288
programs or some other high school yes

894
00:43:33,548 --> 00:43:37,150
and that's a very good point I mean I've

895
00:43:35,289 --> 00:43:39,700
been in land-grant universities I

896
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:40,838
believe very strongly and what we do but

897
00:43:39,699 --> 00:43:43,598
it's not for everybody

898
00:43:40,838 --> 00:43:46,268
not everybody needs a four-year degree

899
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:48,068
some folks are a two-year degree is

900
00:43:46,268 --> 00:43:51,848
enough and for some not even a two-year

901
00:43:48,068 --> 00:43:53,679
degree is needed so I you know the we

902
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:55,869
speak a lot about a pipeline but in a

903
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:58,538
route we probably need more of a tree

904
00:43:55,869 --> 00:44:01,900
analogy with the idea that people come

905
00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:04,480
in at various points and go out of it at

906
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,920
the point that best suits them so I

907
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,338
would have to say yeah I agree

908
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,920
completely again I'm very Pro University

909
00:44:09,338 --> 00:44:12,969
but some of the students I work with you

910
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,400
know when you sit and talk with them

911
00:44:12,969 --> 00:44:18,419
it's like you really don't need to be

912
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:22,329
here you know I don't tell my Dean it

913
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:26,680
but so yeah in terms of apprenticeships

914
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:28,240
I remember I'm not sure where I'm not

915
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:30,818
sure that we're specifically working on

916
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:33,818
it but that would be that would be a

917
00:44:30,818 --> 00:44:35,798
useful thing I think especially early on

918
00:44:33,818 --> 00:44:44,858
like in high school where we might be

919
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:47,048
able to get folks I think this is a

920
00:44:44,858 --> 00:44:48,190
secure industry it's not getting

921
00:44:47,048 --> 00:44:52,268
outsourced to India

922
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:54,068
our jobs are staying here comment being

923
00:44:52,268 --> 00:44:56,459
it's a secure industry yes I agree

924
00:44:54,068 --> 00:44:56,460
completely

925
00:44:56,759 --> 00:45:03,818
parts of it might get robots but that's

926
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:10,960
mostly going to be the entry level not

927
00:45:03,818 --> 00:45:14,050
the not the higher up so I agree yeah

928
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:17,880
driscoll's whatever yes yeah

929
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:17,880
thank you all very much I appreciate it
