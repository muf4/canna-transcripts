1
00:00:00,549 --> 00:00:05,310
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:05,309
University

3
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:15,629
thank you so we all know we all try to

4
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:18,559
read to maintain a healthy and diverse

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:22,589
diet but this is not always easy

6
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:24,868
although many although the nutrient

7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:28,320
deficiencies are less common in

8
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:31,349
developed nations surprisingly high

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,238
proportions of the u.s. population still

10
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,179
do not obtain the daily amount

11
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:39,689
recommended for several nutrients

12
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:42,119
including vitamin E so what if I tell

13
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:44,039
you that we could help with that by

14
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:47,969
increasing the nutritional quality of

15
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:51,810
sweet corn which I bet many of you I so

16
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:53,879
my project my project is trying to

17
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:56,429
understand the mechanism of vitamin

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:01,020
accumulation in order to convert the

19
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:03,988
locally adapted corn lines into a dark

20
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:08,780
yellow grain with high provitamin a and

21
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:12,450
vitamin E so curtain eyes are compounds

22
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:15,570
produced by plants and some of them are

23
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:19,350
pro vitamin A why Oracle criminals are

24
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:21,569
vitamin E so there are several compounds

25
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:23,728
within each class so from now on I'm

26
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:27,649
going to be using the colors orange and

27
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:30,629
green to distinguish between them as

28
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:32,570
antioxidants they might decrease the

29
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:35,219
risk of several health complications

30
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:38,489
including cardiovascular disease

31
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:42,179
age-related macular degeneration which

32
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:47,489
can cause blindness and specific cancers

33
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:50,729
I study showed that about 26 to 26 to 41

34
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:53,569
percent of u.s. population has low

35
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:56,459
levels of vitamin E and this may be

36
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:59,759
associated with increases risk of

37
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:02,489
cardiovascular disease also

38
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:08,549
age-related macular degeneration affects

39
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:12,658
about 25% of people of 65 years old and

40
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:16,650
older and northeast is the region with

41
00:02:12,658 --> 00:02:19,409
the highest proportion of people over

42
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,879
that age so this

43
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:25,030
this demonstrate the importance of

44
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:30,490
studies to increase the vitamin in the

45
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:32,800
food crop so sweet corn because it's a

46
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,890
it's widely consumed this could be a

47
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,860
good candidate for biofortification

48
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:42,250
which is the increasing nutrition

49
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:46,390
nutritional priority of food crops for

50
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:49,689
by breeding sweet corn is the third most

51
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:52,569
we consume vegetable in the US it is

52
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:55,740
estimated that each person is about 11

53
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:58,569
kilograms of sweet corn high year and

54
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:01,420
New York is one of the most important

55
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:03,849
state it is among the the top five

56
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:07,030
states in production production and

57
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:10,180
value of fresh sweet corn and also it

58
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:13,390
has is it is the second state with the

59
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:16,120
highest number of fresh market and this

60
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:22,169
is a great opportunity for address

61
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:24,400
common dietary deficiency biosynthetic

62
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:27,569
biosynthetic pathways for these

63
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:31,210
compounds are well endures characterized

64
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:34,449
from here the main idea to remember are

65
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:37,320
the alpha and beta carotene as well as

66
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:40,750
beta crystals ending I provided in a

67
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:43,060
lutein and zeaxanthin are associated

68
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:46,479
with reduces risk of age-related macular

69
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:49,120
degeneration and alpha tocopherol has

70
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:53,829
highest highest the highest vitamin E

71
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,590
activity also the enzyme denoted by the

72
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:59,890
stars were were previously reported to

73
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:02,409
be associated with increase of this or

74
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:05,439
some of these compounds and this

75
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:10,329
information could be used to improve

76
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:13,030
sweet corn as well however when you

77
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:16,569
consider when you look at the genetic

78
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:20,199
distance of sweet corn to the all the

79
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:22,959
few a few corn you can see that sweet

80
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:27,789
corn is a distant breeding pool and it

81
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:30,939
has also less variability also the new

82
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,540
to treat the nutrient analogies of sweet

83
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:33,910
corn

84
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,910
needs to be done during the fresh stage

85
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:40,030
which is when it when sweet corn is

86
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:42,370
didn't as a vegetable so our main

87
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:45,609
question here is are the genes

88
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:48,699
responsible for increasing vitamins the

89
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:51,730
same at both stage and are the favor

90
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:56,259
alleles found in few corn as present in

91
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:59,350
our panel so my the goal for my project

92
00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:03,159
is to understand the mechanism of the

93
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:05,980
nutritional quality additional trading

94
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,220
fresh sweet corn kernels in order to

95
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:11,069
achieve that we're trying to identify

96
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:14,190
correlated genes and favor alleles and

97
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:19,449
develop and validate marker based of the

98
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:21,670
prediction models in order just as the

99
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:24,189
birth of natural variation for this

100
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:27,550
compound we use it a penny with four

101
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:31,449
hundred inbred lines from public reading

102
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:35,650
from public breeding programs across the

103
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:38,349
u.s. we planted it two years and then we

104
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:41,679
harvest at eating stage which is about

105
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:45,189
21 days after pollination so the years

106
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,560
were then fresh frozen shelled and they

107
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:50,379
were later ground and kept in a - daily

108
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:55,319
freezer and the curtain identical

109
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:58,120
criminals were a measure using HPLC

110
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:00,879
using these phenotypes together with

111
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,209
genotypes from GBS we performed a

112
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:06,670
genome-wide Association study and then

113
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:08,500
for alpha tocopherol which is the

114
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:12,759
compound with greatest vitamin D

115
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:15,699
activity we we found a significant

116
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:19,240
association with markers in chromosome 5

117
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:22,050
which is close to this gene with BT 4

118
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:25,329
which is located encodes an enzyme

119
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:28,569
located at the end of the pathway right

120
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:31,240
before the compound and this candidate

121
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:36,040
gene was previously reported in field

122
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:40,240
corn as well also for delta 2 gamma

123
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:44,860
tocotrienols ignition key in chromosome

124
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:47,199
5 however this markers are close to VT 1

125
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:51,129
which as you can see here in encodes

126
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:56,710
enzymes they are in both branches that

127
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:59,408
goes to the compound when looking at

128
00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:01,388
genetic correlation between the

129
00:06:59,408 --> 00:07:03,848
compounds we can see that some of them

130
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:07,000
are highly correlated which is shown by

131
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:10,089
the darker orange in this case we could

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,598
use the extra information to provide

133
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:16,239
provided by the cross-strait correlation

134
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:17,968
in a multivariate G was in order to

135
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,728
increase the power to identify

136
00:07:17,968 --> 00:07:23,918
associations and also a joint analysis

137
00:07:21,728 --> 00:07:27,158
will be more consistent with the biology

138
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:31,649
when the a single variant is associated

139
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:34,658
with multiple trait so we did the same

140
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:36,698
analysis by using multivariate G was and

141
00:07:34,658 --> 00:07:38,860
instead of using the ratio of the two

142
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:42,038
compounds we are using both together and

143
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:45,669
then after controlling for Colonel type

144
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:49,149
we still get the v t-1 the same kita i

145
00:07:45,668 --> 00:07:53,038
mentioned before but we also have a new

146
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:55,778
association with with this gene that is

147
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,568
enclosed in enzyme like from the

148
00:07:55,778 --> 00:08:01,838
precursors and this was not previously

149
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:05,139
reported for toko criminals and this

150
00:08:01,838 --> 00:08:07,360
also makes sense because since if you

151
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:10,838
think like by having a favored a leo

152
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:15,310
here you can increase the substrate for

153
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:18,990
the downstream compounds so in summary

154
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:22,538
this we identify genes

155
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:24,819
candidate genes three candidate genes as

156
00:08:22,538 --> 00:08:27,810
I mentioned and being this one a new

157
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:31,449
Association these are for all four Toco

158
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:34,149
Toco criminals and we also found one

159
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:35,740
Association for carotenoids but I just

160
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:38,229
would like to mention that carotenoids

161
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:42,038
we only have one data so one year of

162
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:46,870
data so far while criminals we have the

163
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:49,569
two years already and then we we now

164
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,698
expect to identify the best variants

165
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,160
within those regions and use that to

166
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:56,740
select the best performing line lines to

167
00:08:54,159 --> 00:09:00,399
be used as a fairing

168
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:03,789
we also use genomic prediction using

169
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,699
genome-wide markers to calculate

170
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:09,759
breeding values for each of those traits

171
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:12,750
we use it a ridge regression blood and

172
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:15,970
then by doing five fold cross validation

173
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:19,509
we got accuracies as high as point six

174
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:24,610
one for this compound or provide them in

175
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:28,779
a I had accuracy 0.4 and vitamin e point

176
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:31,230
35 for example so this line the lines of

177
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:35,409
the highest breeding values for

178
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:37,810
complimentary traits such as so we chose

179
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:40,389
traits with high vitamin E and high

180
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:42,849
vitam providing a for example and then

181
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:44,769
we cross them last year and this is

182
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,560
generated from that we are going to be

183
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:49,360
planting this coming season to start

184
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,599
validating the models and to start the

185
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,419
breeding population

186
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,360
so in summary we found different sheets

187
00:09:55,419 --> 00:10:02,529
for for eat for some of the compounds

188
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,840
the in this one a new Association we

189
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:08,309
already start making the cost is last

190
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:11,470
year and then this is the first step to

191
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:14,649
to start increasing the vitamins in

192
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:18,460
sweet corn going from white with low

193
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:21,730
vitamin A for example and to dark yellow

194
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:24,990
lines with more Pro vitamin A and hope

195
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:27,909
and hopefully provide emini as well

196
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:30,100
I'd like to thank everybody they helped

197
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:33,399
with my project especially my the gore

198
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:35,560
lab thank you for your attention and I

199
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,809
will happy to answer any questions you

200
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:44,929
may have

201
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:44,929
[Applause]

202
00:10:45,869 --> 00:10:53,879
here there are different colors of

203
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:53,878
available evidence

204
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:12,549
so we have I don't I don't have a right

205
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,600
answer for that because it's pretty

206
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:19,329
subjective but I what I understand is

207
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,580
that if you start telling people that

208
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,410
that's going to be make them better like

209
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,570
it's better because that's more vitamins

210
00:11:23,409 --> 00:11:27,189
and in theory you shouldn't change

211
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,220
anything else like the taste we are

212
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:32,140
trying to still make good lines so they

213
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,970
should I think they should they would be

214
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:36,789
willing to change and even though if

215
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:39,129
they prefer like white white sweet corn

216
00:11:36,789 --> 00:11:44,860
I I believe they would change for if

217
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:51,909
it's better for their health how much

218
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:56,129
the very end of the huge things that are

219
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:59,769
changing that went over exactly

220
00:11:56,129 --> 00:12:02,259
so that was in the past for few corny

221
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:05,909
what sound like was a really high effect

222
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:08,278
and then we didn't find as high as the

223
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:11,528
so I don't think we have as many

224
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:14,320
variation as the few corn but is still

225
00:12:11,528 --> 00:12:17,198
like we have really big hits for those

226
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,278
jeans so it's they are still controlling

227
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:20,278
most of the variation

228
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:31,220
yes I was going on about how much of

229
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:31,219
your very in your button earrings

230
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:53,299
okay normal question on this doesn't go

231
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:56,540
the virtual this has been a production

232
00:12:53,299 --> 00:13:00,338
of Cornell University on the web at

233
00:12:56,539 --> 00:13:00,338
