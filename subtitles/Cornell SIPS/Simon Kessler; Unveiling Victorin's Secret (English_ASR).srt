1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,480
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,480
university

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,480
okay thank you again for the

4
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:15,519
introduction and also

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,800
thank you for the invitation to present

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,640
our results here today um like gillian

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,160
mentioned

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,560
it's close to one o'clock in the morning

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,839
here so apologies if

10
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:31,518
um i'm not mentally spry tonight

11
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:32,960
um so like gigan mentioned in the

12
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:36,179
introduction

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,520
we had the chewy lab are interested in

14
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:40,238
[Music]

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,160
biosynthesis of secondary metabolites of

16
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:45,199
filamentous fungi

17
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,599
and i came here with a bit of background

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,200
and

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:53,039
of interest in metabolic engineering

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,480
um and i figured i would do it on

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,280
um ribosomal peptides because uh

22
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,718
they're much simpler in their by

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,679
synthetic logic

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,280
than these mega enzymes that gillian

25
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,560
already mentioned

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,239
however these

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,920
ribosomal peptides are also sort of the

28
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:18,560
unloved uh stepchildren of the of the uh

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,079
natural product family and fungi so

30
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,320
they're vastly unexplored

31
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,519
so the engineering part was harder than

32
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,399
i thought

33
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,359
at the same time also got into this

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,400
project which is

35
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:33,039
elucidation of biosynthesis of a

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,840
secondary metabolic peptide and that was

37
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,400
really fruitful

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,400
so today i'm going to share with you

39
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,799
these results

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,920
of the collaboration of our lab gains

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,079
lab and

42
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,640
um peter solomon's lab at anu um

43
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,438
yeah so um as gaia mentioned it's about

44
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,759
victorian

45
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:57,519
um the peptide produced by cochlear

46
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:00,000
um on necrotrophic fungus um

47
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,920
and i'm going to go into uh the

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,078
backstory a little bit

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,280
galena's already done a good job of

50
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,719
introducing it

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,759
um so

52
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:14,479
oops okay um

53
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,000
so in the 1940s in the united states um

54
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,199
oat farmers had

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,919
um a problem with another disease called

56
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,679
crown rust of oats caused by the

57
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:27,598
biotrophic pathogen

58
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:31,519
p coronado and to combat

59
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:33,679
that disease then they introduced

60
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,039
an old cultivar that was resistant to

61
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,640
chronic oats

62
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,959
from argentina and this cultivar is

63
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,598
called

64
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,598
victoria or what's called a victoria oat

65
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:44,878
and that worked nicely it's resistant to

66
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:48,159
crown rust

67
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,759
and so it was widely adapted and widely

68
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,799
planted in the united states however

69
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,759
within

70
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,160
a couple of years a new disease emerged

71
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,518
that

72
00:02:54,159 --> 00:03:00,158
selectively selectively infected those

73
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,680
victoria oats and that disease is

74
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:06,318
victorious bladder votes

75
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,680
caused by cochlear victory and

76
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:09,359
what's really interesting about this

77
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,599
disease is that

78
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,599
the resistance to crown rust is directly

79
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:14,560
linked to the susceptibility to victoria

80
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:19,119
applied

81
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:22,479
of oats so that was in the 1940s

82
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,799
um as soon as this

83
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:27,280
disease emerged and it reached epidemic

84
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,719
proportions in the united states

85
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,280
victoria um cultural of oats was

86
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,639
quickly abandoned so that was pretty

87
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,840
much the end of the

88
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:40,559
problems with this disease so

89
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,598
why is it still of relevance today and

90
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,280
why has it been

91
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:47,280
um looked into for decades it's because

92
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,039
of this interesting link between

93
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,158
susceptibility

94
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:55,679
and resistance

95
00:03:52,158 --> 00:04:00,079
so this overlap between these

96
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:04,000
between these two pathogens there

97
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:07,599
um and and the key to this overlap

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,239
or the key to at least the

99
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:10,959
disease caused by victoria is the

100
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,360
peptide

101
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:18,399
victorian um so

102
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,280
uh from a scientific perspective um

103
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,560
there's a lot of uh good research done

104
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,439
over the years there's

105
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,839
two landmark papers i want to point out

106
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,918
in 1947

107
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,439
me and murphy when the disease first

108
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:35,599
emerged they studied it

109
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:38,800
and what they found was that when they

110
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,680
cultivated cochlear victory

111
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,720
in liquid culture and sort of filtered

112
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,079
the

113
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,960
culture liquid and

114
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,560
sterilized it so that there was no

115
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,198
living fungus left in the culture

116
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,639
filtered

117
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:58,160
and then applied it to susceptible alt

118
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,560
then they observed that these the simple

119
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,800
old

120
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,079
developed the same disease symptoms as

121
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,720
if it was

122
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,199
infected with the fungus itself so that

123
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,600
was

124
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,280
the first time it was demonstrated that

125
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,680
um

126
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:17,279
a necrotic or a fungus could secrete

127
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,560
a toxin that by itself could cause

128
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:24,478
disease symptoms identical

129
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,600
to infection by the same fungus

130
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:31,439
so that was in 1947 another

131
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,680
landmark paper was the 2007 paper

132
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,600
from thomas walbert and jennifer lauren

133
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,199
and co-workers

134
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,240
where they elucidated

135
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:46,000
how exactly that compound victorine

136
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,918
achieved this toxicity

137
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,639
and what it comes down to basically is

138
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:54,478
that victorian

139
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:58,160
sort of mimics a biotrophic effector

140
00:05:54,478 --> 00:06:00,240
and induces um

141
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,439
a hypersensitive response in the host

142
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,600
plant so

143
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,360
induces cell death and then takes

144
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,439
advantage of that cell death

145
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:14,000
to colonize the host so

146
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:17,038
how does that work in more detail so

147
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,399
that's from thomas walbert's work

148
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:22,959
what they did was study uh

149
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,239
this interaction in in arabidopsis and

150
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,279
at the center of this

151
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,280
of of this interaction is a thyroidoxin

152
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:32,478
called trxh5

153
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,879
and this thyrodoxin is central to

154
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:36,560
regulating plant immune responses so

155
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:40,000
that makes the target

156
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,038
for um biotrophic effectors

157
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,160
so when a biotrophic effector binds

158
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:50,079
and inhibits jxh5

159
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:53,280
and plant immune responses that

160
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:55,519
in the old um zigzag model of

161
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,119
host pathogen interaction leads to

162
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,120
what's called effect that triggered

163
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,280
susceptibility

164
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,199
and then in the evolutionary

165
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,839
evolutionary arms race between

166
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,598
host and pathogen then some hosts

167
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:11,279
develop resistance to that

168
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:15,038
by employing um a guard protein

169
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:18,239
and that guard protein monitors

170
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:20,719
the tier xh5 and

171
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,360
if it detects binding of the biotrophic

172
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,560
effector

173
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,800
and suppression of the txh5 it induces

174
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,598
the hypersensitive response or the cell

175
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,280
death

176
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:35,680
which halts an infection by a biotroph

177
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:38,399
so it's localized cell death and then

178
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,439
the the affection by the biotroph

179
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,198
stops at that point however what

180
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,639
victorian then does

181
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:51,598
is mimic that biotrophic effector

182
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:54,639
so by having the same

183
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,478
inhibitory activity on txh5

184
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,598
as that biotrophic effect that's been

185
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:02,800
defeated by the plant already

186
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:05,199
it sort of wants to be called by

187
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,960
the god protein which is lv1 in

188
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,160
arabidopsis

189
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:12,959
that then induces cell death but

190
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,319
because cochlea cochlear victoria is a

191
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,959
necrotrophic

192
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,439
fungus it actually profits off cell

193
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,000
death

194
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,360
and that leads to colonization and

195
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,160
what's interesting is that

196
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,319
victorian has the same inhibitory

197
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,479
effects on th5

198
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,520
but without the god protein that

199
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:34,639
inhibition of the plant immune response

200
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:36,799
um is still not enough for cochlear to

201
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:39,120
actually colonize the plant

202
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,478
so that's why it's called the whole

203
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,440
selective toxin as

204
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,720
you mentioned earlier um it's

205
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,560
selectively

206
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,680
only um is successful in infecting

207
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,119
plants that have that

208
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:56,159
gut protein and that resistance to um

209
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,600
that biotroph and that also explains

210
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:03,120
how disease susceptibility

211
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,399
um to calculus victoria and disease

212
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,560
resistance

213
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:13,200
to p coronado are linked

214
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:17,679
so um that's an interesting mechanism

215
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:22,560
um but what actually

216
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:27,278
is victorian so victoria is a set of

217
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,278
small psychic peptides

218
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,879
if you look at it so this is victorian c

219
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,440
that i

220
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,480
have here on the slide victorian c is

221
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,360
the

222
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,240
major constituent but it's a mixture of

223
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,000
six

224
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,600
similar compounds directly motor

225
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,120
victorian c

226
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,800
and if you look at the structure um it's

227
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,000
kind of difficult to figure out what it

228
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:52,958
actually is um

229
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,600
it's not a true cyclic peptide it's not

230
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:58,639
cyclized head to tail it doesn't have

231
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,440
only peptide bonds it's not a depth c

232
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,240
peptide

233
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,600
it doesn't have an ester bond and the

234
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,839
unusual amino acids

235
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,800
suggest and non-ribosomal origin

236
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,160
so gilligan's lab did a lot of work on

237
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,278
this

238
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:18,879
previously and they sequenced

239
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:23,200
the cochlear victory genome

240
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:26,879
in 2011 and they knocked out all the

241
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,000
nrps gene clusters in cochlear is

242
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,439
victoria

243
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,919
but found that the mutants would still

244
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,279
produce victorian

245
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:37,838
so um the big reveal here and i guess

246
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:39,838
it's

247
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,160
not a big reveal anymore at this point

248
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:46,000
because it's been published

249
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:49,199
is that victorian is what's called a rip

250
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,240
so what is a rip

251
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,200
stands for ribosomally synthesized and

252
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,720
post insulation modified peptide

253
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,000
and ribs have been known in bacteria and

254
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,040
plants for quite some

255
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,159
time but their discovery

256
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:09,759
in filamentous fungi is fairly recent

257
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:12,480
only over maybe a decade or more

258
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,360
and although very few of them have

259
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,639
actually been

260
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,759
characterized um

261
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:21,759
an abundance of hypothetical

262
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,319
rip gene clusters have been found in the

263
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:26,799
genomes of filamentous fungi

264
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,000
and their biosynthetic logic as i

265
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,838
mentioned earlier is

266
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,480
it's quite simple so um

267
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,079
the rib is encoded directly in the

268
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,480
genome in

269
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,120
uh what's called a precursor peptide or

270
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,240
as it's

271
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,360
named here pro protein so

272
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,399
the precursor peptide contains

273
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,200
one or in filamentous fungi

274
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,399
multiple copies of the core peptide and

275
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,800
the core peptide

276
00:11:52,399 --> 00:12:00,159
is the amino acid sequence that makes up

277
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,479
the backbone of the mature product so

278
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,600
during rib biosynthesis these core

279
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,120
peptides

280
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,920
are cleaved out of the precursor peptide

281
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,000
and then endowed with post insulation

282
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,799
modifications

283
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,320
um not necessarily in that order and the

284
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:19,919
final product

285
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,320
usually um is cyclized so in all

286
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,679
categorized fungal ribs still all

287
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,200
cyclized at this point

288
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,559
and what's also important to note is

289
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,079
that

290
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:34,239
usually these enzymes that

291
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:35,838
bestow those post insulation

292
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,278
modifications

293
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,360
are encoded in uh genes

294
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:42,480
that are in the close vicinity of the

295
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,839
gene

296
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,879
of the precursor peptide

297
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,680
and that is um very similar to

298
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:54,480
other filamentous fungi secondary

299
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,479
metabolites

300
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:04,879
so here just showing the structure of

301
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:07,759
three characterized fungal rips

302
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,879
and what these three have in common is

303
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,360
that they're

304
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,078
all cleaved by certain peptidase called

305
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,959
calcium

306
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:16,078
uh protease and the hallmark of this

307
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:20,159
cacson protease

308
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:23,278
is the conserved cut side which is um

309
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:28,399
two amino acids um either kk

310
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:31,679
or kr or uh southerly rr

311
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:35,278
um and the other thing these three

312
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:38,638
fungal rips have in common is

313
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:41,759
this ether bond and and that's

314
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,879
extremely uncommon in and fungal uh

315
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,360
natural products but uh

316
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,039
if you remember from earlier that's also

317
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,600
what victorian has

318
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:52,559
and that would that's what gave us the

319
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,519
idea that

320
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,000
victoria might actually be a rep and by

321
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,120
us

322
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,240
i mean uh my supervisor hang

323
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,560
um from there we did

324
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,320
what heng likes to call a ritual by

325
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,879
synthetic analysis

326
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,600
um which is borrowed from organic

327
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:11,439
chemistry

328
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,199
so basically you you look at the final

329
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,240
product and try to figure out

330
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:19,278
um what the precursors or

331
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,799
the building blocks are to to get to

332
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:22,799
that final product

333
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,319
and in this case we looked at the

334
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,278
structure and

335
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,399
deduced a hypothetical amino acid

336
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:32,000
sequence

337
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,759
that would be the backbone of victorian

338
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,120
if victorian was a rip and then we used

339
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:38,559
that sequence which was

340
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:42,078
gl key glk laf

341
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:45,039
to uh query the

342
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:47,198
genome assembly that gain a group had

343
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:51,039
previously created

344
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:54,958
and what we found was a single gene on

345
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:57,838
um a short read only about

346
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,719
1kb long and at the end of that read

347
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,680
there was a gene

348
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,199
that contained two copies of that

349
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,638
sequence

350
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:09,759
flanked by the familiar kex and carcine

351
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:13,440
so that was a good sign however

352
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:16,480
this gene had no stop codon and

353
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,839
also only two core peptide repeats

354
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:23,440
which is very little very uncommon

355
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,480
and fungal ribs like um just deluxe

356
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,240
internationally ahead

357
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,639
for example has 16 corporate that

358
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,079
repeats so that gave us idiots probably

359
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,680
this gene is incomplete

360
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:33,198
also because it was at the end of the

361
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,479
read so what we tried

362
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:38,078
was reassemble the raw reads from that

363
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,159
sequencing

364
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:45,198
uh try to extend this contact but um

365
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,879
didn't manage didn't lead anywhere so

366
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:50,639
then what we decided was to

367
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:53,039
resequence the genome um

368
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,919
which the majority of the work was done

369
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,278
by

370
00:15:53,919 --> 00:16:00,799
megan mcdonald from anu

371
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,679
and what we decided was to nanopore long

372
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,879
weed sequencing

373
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,599
so um as opposed to illumina sequencing

374
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:07,360
which

375
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,040
what is what gillian's group did

376
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,278
previously long

377
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:14,559
nanopore has long reads but lower

378
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:18,078
fidelity as illumina sequence sequencing

379
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:21,518
and so we use those long reads um

380
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:24,638
polish them with the illumina reads from

381
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:28,000
gillian's previous sequencing effort

382
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,879
and that led to the assembly of 22

383
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,879
supercontext

384
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,198
and and this genome assembly then we

385
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,319
query it again with

386
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:40,159
the sequence of the core peptide and

387
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,639
what we found was actually

388
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:45,439
not one but three copies of the

389
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:49,600
precursor peptide gene which is

390
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,880
so far unprecedented in in fungal ribs

391
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,600
and the other thing that was highly

392
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:57,120
unusual was that um

393
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,839
around those three p precursor peptide

394
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,759
genes

395
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:04,160
there wasn't a clear gene cluster as

396
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,599
you usually have in fungal rips or even

397
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,120
fungal secondary metabolites as i

398
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,399
mentioned earlier

399
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:13,359
but only a sort of a diffuse clustering

400
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,199
big distances between genes a lot of

401
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:19,678
repeat regions and

402
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:23,199
a lot of transposons so we did

403
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:26,319
a little bit of a analysis of the genome

404
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,679
um so what you can see here is just

405
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,399
a heat map that maps the three prime and

406
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,080
five prime

407
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,080
endogenic regions

408
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:41,200
of the entire genome and then we mapped

409
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,720
those candidate genes i'll talk about

410
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,960
that in a second

411
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,640
the genes that we potentially think

412
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,600
might be involved in victorian

413
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,320
um onto this heat map and what you can

414
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,599
see is that

415
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,000
uh the antigenic distances are sort of

416
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:55,918
above

417
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,038
average compared to the rest of the

418
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,679
genome

419
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,480
um i actually saw that uh sophine camun

420
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,798
gave

421
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,480
a talk uh he recently used on the

422
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:07,359
youtube playlist

423
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,839
and i think he and his his uh lab came

424
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,839
up

425
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,119
with the concept of of the two-speed

426
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:15,119
genome

427
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:18,639
where um

428
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:22,000
uh basically says that um filamentous

429
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,320
planned pathogens uh have this

430
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,200
sometimes have this genomic architecture

431
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:29,678
where

432
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:33,038
um the effect are in genomic regions

433
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:35,440
that evolve at an

434
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:37,119
accelerated speed compared to the rest

435
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,160
of the genome which

436
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:41,918
gives the pathogen the advantage of a

437
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,798
sort of a fast evolution in

438
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,919
the arms race between um pathogen and

439
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:47,759
host

440
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,120
but at the same time keeps like the

441
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,319
housekeeping and the

442
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,359
the important um genes shielded from

443
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,639
that

444
00:18:53,359 --> 00:19:00,079
uh faster evolution so

445
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,360
that was uh one thing that we thought

446
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,119
might be going on here might be the

447
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,759
reason for this um

448
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:07,038
sort of unusual architecture um yeah

449
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:11,279
what i forgot to mention is that

450
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:12,720
um what the hallmarks of this two-speed

451
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:16,079
genome of these

452
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:19,360
regions of accelerated speed are

453
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:21,439
gene sparsity and a lot of

454
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:24,639
transposons in those regions and that's

455
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:28,320
exactly what we observed here

456
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,759
um yeah so just for comparison this is

457
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,798
the ustiloxin cluster um which is one of

458
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:36,079
the

459
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:40,160
three um reps that i showed you earlier

460
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:42,639
as you can see a much more uh

461
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,360
clean cluster uh small intergenic

462
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,160
distances

463
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:49,759
everything is close together so that's

464
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:52,080
just comparison to what we found

465
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:52,879
so that made it a little more difficult

466
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,720
because

467
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:59,760
um when we elucidate um by synthesis

468
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,960
of of compounds from the

469
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:05,759
from the genome side we usually rely on

470
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,880
clustering at least to help us to

471
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,158
identify

472
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:13,360
um potential genes um

473
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:15,120
that might be involved in

474
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,479
assembling the final product so say if

475
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:20,879
we look at an

476
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,319
rps then um we know where the mps

477
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,120
gene is but we also look at the

478
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:27,359
surrounds and then

479
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:28,239
have sort of the surrounding genes as

480
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,479
candidates

481
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,440
for also being involved and and the

482
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,558
biosynthesis

483
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,320
of that non-ribosome peptide here though

484
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,558
that was a little more difficult because

485
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:42,000
the the distances were bigger i was

486
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:45,038
not as clear-cut so one way to

487
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,079
sort of circumvent that is to

488
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:49,119
look for homologous clusters in other

489
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:50,558
genomes

490
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:52,399
in the hope that there's a better

491
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,480
cluster in there also to compare which

492
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,280
genes are conserved between the clusters

493
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,599
and which ones aren't so what we did was

494
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,918
look for homologs of

495
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,759
the precursor peptide which here is

496
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,880
shown in red

497
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:09,359
and what we found was two

498
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,919
homologues in the genomes of two

499
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:15,678
distantly related fungi

500
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:18,880
um apiaspora multani

501
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:22,480
it the trichomery mclean

502
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,120
and as you can see the surroundings of

503
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,599
those two

504
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:28,959
look much nicer like much more of a

505
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:28,959
cluster so that was helpful

506
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,199
and so from that we sort of made a list

507
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,240
of

508
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,400
um canada genes that we suspected

509
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,000
might be involved in victorian

510
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,679
biosynthesis

511
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,798
and um for that we

512
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,880
we basically relied on three things

513
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:50,639
one sort of the the proximity to the

514
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,400
precursor peptide gene

515
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,679
um although that wasn't as clear cut as

516
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,919
i mentioned um

517
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,640
then the homologous clusters on which

518
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:01,600
genes are conserved

519
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,799
sort of in the vicinity of the precursor

520
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,959
peptide genes

521
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:06,000
and then thirdly also what do you

522
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,679
usually find

523
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,720
in fungal rib clusters and at this point

524
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:15,360
i should mention that

525
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:17,200
the yellow genes here are df-33 trade

526
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:19,519
protein genes

527
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,519
and df stands for domain of unknown

528
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:24,158
function

529
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:25,119
and these genes are still a bit of a

530
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,559
mystery and

531
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:30,479
fungal rip biosynthesis and and two

532
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:31,279
characterized fungal rips they've been

533
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,519
shown to be

534
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:38,639
involved in cyclization of fungal rips

535
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:42,960
but um there's often a whole

536
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:45,919
bunch of them in fungal rib clusters

537
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,400
many more than is needed for cyclization

538
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,000
so

539
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,759
it stands to reason that they're

540
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,279
probably also involved in other

541
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:53,038
biosynthetic functions that have not

542
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:56,319
been elucidated yet and

543
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:58,079
in our case there's quite a bunch um

544
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:01,599
in the vicinity of these of the

545
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:04,720
precursor peptide gene copies

546
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:09,439
so the genes that we decided

547
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,679
on for knockout was firstly obviously

548
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,400
the precursor peptide gene for

549
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,400
confirmation

550
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:20,839
then we picked one of the df-3328

551
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,120
protein genes

552
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:26,558
um we also

553
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:29,918
knocked out the uh and dph

554
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:33,200
oxidase although that was a dud

555
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:37,200
and we also knocked out the

556
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:40,558
copper mean oxidase and brown here

557
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,919
so i'll just go through these mutants

558
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:43,678
that we created

559
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,360
one by one and talk you through the

560
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,440
results

561
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,558
um oh yeah another thing i should

562
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,038
mention is that

563
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:54,720
in the collective trichome cluster

564
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,720
there's a cytochrome p450

565
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:59,038
pretty clearly clustered with the

566
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:02,319
precursor peptide

567
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:06,319
and then we found a homolog to that

568
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:10,079
400 kb from the precursor peptide gene

569
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:13,200
so um we also include that

570
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:17,278
in our potential list of potential

571
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,278
victorian biosynthesis genes

572
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:24,798
okay so um yeah uh

573
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,640
shanghui from uh glen's lab was um

574
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,319
did the heavy lifting and creating all

575
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,240
these knockout strains

576
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:35,599
um so the first one that we did was

577
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:39,599
the precursor peptide knockout mutant so

578
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:43,519
that is delta v a and

579
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:46,639
looking at the lcms

580
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:48,960
data that we received from um

581
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,278
that knockout stream was that we

582
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,519
couldn't detect victorian sea anymore

583
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:54,880
and as i said before victorian sea is

584
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:56,720
the major consideration that's

585
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,400
by far the most abundant of the

586
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,079
victorian species

587
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,679
and that was somewhat surprising because

588
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:05,439
for this strain um

589
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:08,640
only one copy of the precursor peptide

590
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:12,000
gene genes was missing so we thought

591
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,759
uh we didn't expect to be like that

592
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,440
victorian biosynthesis would be fully

593
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:19,278
abolished so

594
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:23,120
um another essay we did was

595
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:23,919
um similar to what meehan and murphy did

596
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,678
in

597
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:31,440
47 basically is take the culture

598
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:34,480
filtrate of those mutants and just

599
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:38,240
use susceptible old

600
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,919
leaves and just check for disease

601
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,200
symptoms basically building and

602
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,880
this test is known to be uh highly

603
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,080
sensitive

604
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,559
so um what we have is as opposed to

605
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,960
control

606
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:51,839
the wild type so we should see welding

607
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,240
syndromes and

608
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,678
and all the biological replicates we

609
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,079
have a negative control there's

610
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,519
uh a strain that's uh victor and

611
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,759
negative so those are these

612
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,038
shouldn't be any voting and then for

613
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,599
delta v a

614
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:06,480
um what we saw was that in some

615
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:08,319
replicates

616
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,599
we saw the voting syndrome and in others

617
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:12,879
we didn't so we

618
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:14,639
interpreted that as um

619
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,960
sort of the victorian production being

620
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,400
so that at the detectable threshold so

621
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,759
it was

622
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:26,159
reduced but not fully abolished which

623
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:29,519
uh sort of made sense to us um

624
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,880
then the next strain um or the next

625
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:34,558
newton strainer where you look at

626
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:38,000
um is the delta uh y b strain so

627
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:41,200
that is one of those d f three three

628
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,440
two eight protein genes and again we

629
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,120
couldn't detect vitamin c

630
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:50,720
and in the toxicity assays um

631
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:53,759
we never observed building syndrome uh

632
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,120
symptoms so um the way we interpreted

633
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:58,158
that is that

634
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:59,678
probably this gf gene is also involved

635
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:03,120
in zechalization

636
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:06,320
of victorian so it creates that

637
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:08,959
12-minute macro cycle and

638
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:12,079
what that cycle does is protect the

639
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:15,278
compound from degradation by

640
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:18,158
native enzymes so without

641
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:18,159
the zecharization

642
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:21,439
the product would quickly degrade within

643
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,639
plan and wouldn't

644
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,759
wouldn't accumulate so that's why we

645
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,559
think we didn't see

646
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:30,558
any production of any victorian species

647
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:32,879
in this

648
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:33,599
as i mentioned before we also knocked

649
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,120
out this

650
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:40,398
dph oxidase gene

651
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:41,599
which showed undiminished victorian

652
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:44,158
production afterwards

653
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:45,918
so that's not involved in victorian

654
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,919
production what's nice about it is that

655
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,919
that gene is also not in need of the

656
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,278
homologous clusters so that's

657
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,960
a little bit of a validation for our

658
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:54,960
approach to look at these homologous

659
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,278
clusters

660
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,960
and then lastly the most interesting

661
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:02,480
mutant was

662
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:05,919
the knockout of the copper amine oxidase

663
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:09,919
the k so we saw there is that

664
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:14,080
again no production of victorian c

665
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,080
we didn't see any toxicity

666
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:19,678
signs but

667
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,360
um as i mentioned before um victorian is

668
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:25,038
actually a mixture of

669
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:28,240
six very similar peptides one of them is

670
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:31,519
hv toxin m and the difference between

671
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:35,200
hv toxin m in victorian c is just

672
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:38,798
um the n terminus so h3 toxin m has

673
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,679
um an unmodified uh amino group at the

674
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:42,398
end terminus

675
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,080
so the glycine here is unmodified

676
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:47,119
whereas victorian c

677
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:49,119
has two hydroxyl group at a position so

678
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:51,759
you can basically look at

679
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:53,439
the hv toxin m as being the precursor to

680
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:59,519
a victorian c

681
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:01,759
and what we then observed was that um

682
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,200
the delta v k mutant could still produce

683
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:06,319
hv toxin m

684
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,399
but none of the uh other six

685
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:09,759
or none of the other five are victorian

686
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:12,239
species

687
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,278
and all these other five current species

688
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,558
all have that

689
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:19,599
double hydroxy group at the end so

690
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:21,038
then we hypothesize that protein the

691
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:27,439
copper amino oxidase the k

692
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:29,519
is responsible for um the conversion of

693
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,480
this this amino group at the end

694
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:36,398
terminus into the double hydroxy group

695
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:39,759
which is of significance because

696
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:42,398
it's been shown that this

697
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:43,440
double hydroxyl group is what gives

698
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:47,119
victorian

699
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:50,720
um a big boost in its toxicity

700
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:54,319
so hv toxin in is uh vastly less

701
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,640
toxic or has less bioactivity compared

702
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:57,599
to

703
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,480
victorancy or some of the other

704
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:04,879
victorians here

705
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:07,360
um yeah so

706
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,399
at the bottom here is sort of our

707
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:12,000
proposed reaction

708
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:15,918
done by a reaction done by catalyzed by

709
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:21,278
vic k and then we hypothesized

710
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:23,759
that if knocking out vacay

711
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:25,679
resulted in hv toxin m not being

712
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,759
converted to victorian c

713
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,840
then it will also result in the

714
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:34,158
precursors of victorian d

715
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:37,599
b and e which all have um

716
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:40,320
this double hydroxy group at the end um

717
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:41,918
not being produced and would result in

718
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,558
the precursor of those

719
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,520
accumulating in the culture filtrate of

720
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:48,639
the delta vk

721
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:51,440
mutant so we did

722
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,960
tandem mass spectrometry on that and

723
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,240
that's exactly what we found

724
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,200
we we found do those uh precursors to

725
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,038
those

726
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:04,080
victorian species um a quick note on

727
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:06,558
um the tender mass spec data here

728
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:07,759
um because it might not look that

729
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:10,158
convincing

730
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:10,960
to some like this forest of fragment

731
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,278
masses

732
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,200
the reason why we opt not to go for nmr

733
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:18,398
is because nmr needs

734
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,120
um a huge amount of compound in a pure

735
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:21,839
form

736
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:24,158
and that was really difficult to obtain

737
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:27,278
from the case train because it wasn't

738
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,799
a very strong producer however

739
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:32,240
it wasn't really necessary either

740
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:35,359
because we didn't want to do

741
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,480
the novel structural elucidation all we

742
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:40,398
wanted to do was

743
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:43,440
compare very similar compounds

744
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:46,558
so basically um all we need

745
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:50,399
to to confirm here was that

746
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:51,359
um if we compare um one of the victorian

747
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:54,959
species

748
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:57,759
to its um precursor then

749
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,558
we should see mass shifts only in the

750
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:00,480
fragments

751
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:01,918
that contain the n-terminus so that

752
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,200
would be d

753
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:08,559
and e while the fragments

754
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:11,840
that don't contain the n-terminus

755
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:13,440
should have unchanged masses so that was

756
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:17,199
the case

757
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:20,320
um and and i guess that's where

758
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,480
tandem ms really shines is just

759
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:23,759
comparing comparing similar structures

760
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,599
and comparing those

761
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:30,720
those fragment masses so um

762
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:30,719
that worked nicely for us

763
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:37,120
um so then as a final test of um

764
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,319
the case activity sort of as a positive

765
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:40,639
confirmation

766
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:41,439
um we did an in vitro essay of the

767
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,038
conversion of

768
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:48,080
hv toxin m into a victorian c

769
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:50,079
um what you can see here is basically uh

770
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:51,519
four different samples so each each line

771
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:56,079
is a sample and then

772
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:59,440
each column is

773
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:02,480
and an extracted acromatogram um

774
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,240
so the left one 798 uh

775
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,599
corresponds to the mass of h3dox and m

776
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,399
the right one 815

777
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:09,359
to victorian c so the first line is just

778
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:12,479
the victorian c

779
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:14,398
standard for comparison second line is

780
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,839
the substrate that we use for for the

781
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:20,239
assay uh

782
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:22,720
entry toxin m um as you can see um

783
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,640
the substrate has h2xm doesn't have

784
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,679
victorian c uh yeah what i should

785
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,159
mention is that

786
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,600
we tried to do um we tried to head over

787
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,480
those express

788
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:33,599
the k in e coli that didn't work so we

789
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,759
used an asset that we

790
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:36,839
use in this lab sometimes is where we

791
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,278
had a logically

792
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:40,240
expressed the k in asperger's

793
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:43,119
netherlands

794
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,440
and instead of purifying the protein we

795
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:47,918
just

796
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:51,919
like the cells and use cell free lysate

797
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,799
for our essay so that's what we did here

798
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,919
okay so

799
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:59,599
um the third line then is

800
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:04,960
the actual essay so um that's

801
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:04,959
self-reliant from the k producing

802
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:11,599
aspergillus mycelium um

803
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,559
plus hv toxins substrate after 14 hours

804
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,240
you can see

805
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:16,078
that the hbitoxin m has almost

806
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:19,279
disappeared and

807
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,240
victorian c uh has appeared in nice

808
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,560
quantities

809
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,519
and there's a negative control it's just

810
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:25,759
empty vector

811
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:27,039
transformed as which is netherlands um

812
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,919
self-reliant

813
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:31,039
plus the substrate after 14 hours and

814
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:33,838
what you can see

815
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,519
is that no victorian c has been produced

816
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:37,918
however also

817
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,679
h3 talks in m has almost this uh almost

818
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,199
completely disappeared which was

819
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,240
a little bit baffling in the beginning

820
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:47,598
so we did a follow-up test

821
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:51,358
and basically just used the empty vector

822
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:54,000
control self-realize it in a boiled or

823
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:54,719
unbalanced state and incubated it which

824
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,119
with either

825
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:59,598
hv toxin m or victorian c and what we

826
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:03,920
could observe was that

827
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:07,039
um over time hv toxin m got consumed

828
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,079
whereas victorian c uh remained

829
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:11,440
relatively stable

830
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,800
so um i guess the disappearance of

831
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,000
etoxin m here then

832
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:19,280
is explained by selective consumption

833
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,920
um of hv toxin m

834
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,480
um by native aspergillus netherlands

835
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,480
enzymes

836
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,359
yeah so um that was nice nice

837
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:31,358
confirmation

838
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:33,039
also worth mentioning that um copper

839
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:37,119
amino oxidases

840
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:39,199
are not known in rip uh biosynthesis

841
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,200
so that's a novel one and as i mentioned

842
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:44,239
earlier it's also really important

843
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:48,159
for turning the victorian

844
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:48,159
into its most toxic form

845
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,920
yeah and those are the results from the

846
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:54,239
paper um

847
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,960
we continue working on the project and

848
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:58,000
there's

849
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:03,039
still many many um unsolved

850
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,239
questions for example

851
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:06,639
what would be really interesting is

852
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:08,000
finding out what's responsible for the

853
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:09,679
chlorination

854
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
especially since the chlorination takes

855
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:12,719
place on unactivated carbon centers so

856
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,960
there's a

857
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:18,639
special kind of um chlorination

858
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,039
also interesting would be what what

859
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:24,719
enzyme does the contraction of the

860
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:26,800
um fennel ring um

861
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:28,319
here to the five-member ring so that

862
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,240
will also be interesting

863
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,599
um we would like to know what all these

864
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:35,199
df

865
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:37,359
um genes do um and that would be

866
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:38,480
really interesting for for fungal grip

867
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:41,519
by synthesis

868
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,559
in general also from

869
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:45,440
a genomic architecture standpoint was to

870
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:49,039
deal with

871
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,679
um the scattering of the vic genes and

872
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:54,079
where they clustered originally and also

873
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:57,118
evolutionary what is the origin of the

874
00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:01,200
thick biosynthetic by synthetic genes

875
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:05,039
because there's no homologues in

876
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:09,118
its close cousins and cochlear

877
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:12,079
um yeah that just leads me to

878
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,358
thank a couple people here obviously um

879
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,480
without gillian or

880
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:17,920
this wouldn't have worked not only like

881
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,240
in our collaboration but also

882
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,838
all the work she did before uh as i

883
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:24,799
mentioned shanghai did

884
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:26,480
um a lot of uh work and creating

885
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,440
knockout strengths and all that

886
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,960
um megan did the heavy lifting on all

887
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:36,159
the sequences and all that from

888
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,039
peter solomon's lab um cmca did the

889
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:40,078
orbiter

890
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:41,519
data collection from our lab that's cam

891
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:45,359
who's also involved

892
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:47,358
that's hang and also thomas wilbert

893
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:49,519
was really nice in providing us the

894
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:51,838
victorian c standard

895
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:53,440
yeah that's it thank you all for tuning

896
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:55,920
in and i'll be taking

897
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,920
questions

898
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:04,079
thank you simon can i be

899
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:07,920
heard yeah i'm here yeah oh

900
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:11,680
great that's a blessing yeah

901
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:14,880
um any questions

902
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:14,879
for simon

903
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,400
i don't see any in the chat

904
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,719
my first question was going to be

905
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,039
what's what is responsible for the

906
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,280
chlorination

907
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:34,880
step yeah i mean

908
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,240
if if we knew that that would probably

909
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:41,280
be another publication um

910
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:46,159
i mean there's out of the genes we have

911
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:49,440
identified as as candidates um

912
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:52,960
there's there's no really obvious uh

913
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,639
candidate here so maybe actually one of

914
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,559
those uf genes

915
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:58,078
might be involved there um because

916
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:58,559
there's so many and they got to do

917
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,720
something

918
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:06,078
at least some of them so that would be

919
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:09,838
a possibility um but

920
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:13,280
really there's there's no obvious

921
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:16,639
smoking gun here yeah

922
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:22,160
yeah i see

923
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:22,159
a question in the chat from athena

924
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:29,599
miss the connection in the

925
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:33,039
introduction why victorin was

926
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:35,920
originally thought to be in nrps

927
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:37,599
what made people start to think about

928
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:42,159
the possibility of

929
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:47,119
rip yeah so um

930
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:49,440
nlps uh just by the unusual amino acids

931
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,240
that are um in the structure of

932
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,079
victorian

933
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:54,559
so um in an ampere's biosynthesis

934
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,519
there's

935
00:39:54,559 --> 00:40:00,000
potential for modification of or the

936
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:03,199
incorporation of unusual amino acids

937
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,358
um so so that's why people

938
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:07,519
first jump to the conclusion that this

939
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:11,598
might be non-ribosomally

940
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:14,719
produced um and

941
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,440
the other question was how did we get

942
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:19,279
the idea that

943
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,280
might be a rip so um

944
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,560
like i said one of the really rare

945
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,838
features

946
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:28,719
and and from the rips is this uh ether

947
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:31,440
bone here

948
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:32,799
so that's really unusual in uh fungal

949
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,920
secondary metabolites

950
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,039
and i remember in 2017 there was a big

951
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,400
review

952
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:41,920
on fungal cyclic peptides and they

953
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,680
classified all of the

954
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:50,079
peptides by their chemical makeup

955
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:50,078
and then they classified basically

956
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,400
cyclic peptides that had an ether bond

957
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,720
and all of them

958
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,240
were from the rips except for victorian

959
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:59,598
which i said was in nlps

960
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:01,598
so that's when i started sweating a

961
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,838
little bit it was like um this

962
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,440
baby gives other people the idea too

963
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:06,000
because at that point we had started our

964
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,318
collaboration

965
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,318
already

966
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:12,239
yeah i did

967
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:20,719
um thank you um i see

968
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:23,920
maria harrison with her hand up

969
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:27,279
yeah um thanks a really interesting talk

970
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:30,480
and you mentioned a far away um

971
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,079
p450 that was it was the orange jean in

972
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,719
a cluster somewhere and it was far away

973
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:38,000
did that one turn out to be part of the

974
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:42,318
um production of victory

975
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,920
um we haven't said that one yet so um

976
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:47,039
that would be really interesting to see

977
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:50,159
because one of the um

978
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:52,639
more unusual candidates here um

979
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:54,239
but we have we haven't gotten around to

980
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:56,480
knocking that one out yet

981
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:57,358
and i'm also trying to do to

982
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,719
heterologically

983
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:02,400
reconstruct um the victron pathway which

984
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,959
has turned out to be really difficult as

985
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,039
well

986
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,358
but yeah we're certainly interested in

987
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:10,639
that and we're working on it

988
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:14,078
and um it is

989
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:16,000
sort of uh conspicuous that it is on the

990
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,599
same context as

991
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:24,159
at least part of the victorian genes

992
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:25,920
i search for homologs on

993
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:27,679
in the victorian genome and in other

994
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,519
genomes and it's

995
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:33,759
actually not it's a rare find so

996
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:34,559
if it actually just by accident happened

997
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,410
to be

998
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:38,559
uh next to the

999
00:42:36,409 --> 00:42:40,399
[Music]

1000
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:42,318
college trichome cluster as well as on

1001
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,079
the same context as

1002
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:49,920
the victorian genes that will be um yeah

1003
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:53,039
bad luck basically for us yeah

1004
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:56,639
um claire castile has a

1005
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:57,358
question in the chat um are any known

1006
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,799
plant

1007
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:03,440
rips also involved in plant

1008
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,440
defense

1009
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:12,079
i'm not sure i'm not an expert on plant

1010
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:14,000
rips

1011
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:18,000
i know i can't answer that question i

1012
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:22,239
don't know i don't know fungal rips

1013
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:25,920
yeah um i think it's fair to say

1014
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:26,479
that we know very little about function

1015
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,920
of

1016
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:33,679
any of these rip clusters

1017
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:36,800
they're not now that we have

1018
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:40,519
genome sequence we can pick

1019
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:44,000
easily pick out nrps's and

1020
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:48,000
polyketides synthases etc

1021
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:51,679
but it's very difficult unless you

1022
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:55,440
start with a molecule

1023
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:58,879
as was done for victorin

1024
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:02,318
to actually screen

1025
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:05,920
genomes for these molecules

1026
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:08,400
much less test function

1027
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,000
and as i understand i think in plants

1028
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,160
also you don't have these

1029
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,519
um convenient gene clusters so it's even

1030
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:16,559
more difficult there

1031
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:19,440
to do the reverse sort of search

1032
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:21,119
from from the molecule to producing

1033
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,400
cluster

1034
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:27,838
yes any other

1035
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,838
