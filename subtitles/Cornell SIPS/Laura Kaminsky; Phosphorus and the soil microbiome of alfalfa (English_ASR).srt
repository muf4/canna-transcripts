1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,310
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:05,309
University

3
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:13,048
alright next we have Laura Kaminsky

4
00:00:09,798 --> 00:00:15,239
Laura's from Rochester New York her

5
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:18,239
scientific winters are treble Brent

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,118
Thompson attorney Tom Mison her post

7
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:23,609
graduation plan she's going to be doing

8
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,800
a six month long apprenticeship at seven

9
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:33,238
point form in Connecticut and then we'll

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:35,640
be programming under the title of Lord

11
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:39,199
talk today is phosphorous and soil

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,200
microbiome of alfalfa

13
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:45,250
hi everyone my name is Laura and today

14
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,650
I'll be talking about my senior honors

15
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:50,500
thesis which I did in the keratin lab

16
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:53,859
and we used a variety of soil ecology

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,238
techniques to study microbial and micro

18
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:57,238
biome is just the collection of all

19
00:00:55,238 --> 00:00:58,719
bacteria and fungi in the soil

20
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:03,250
interacting with each other and

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:05,289
interacting plant and these the

22
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,209
composition and activity is those micro

23
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:09,719
bonds cannot really profound impact on

24
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:11,829
plant phenotypes and platform ins so

25
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,049
specifically my study I look at how

26
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:18,879
phosphorus fertilization impacts that

27
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:21,099
interaction and platforms so in this

28
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,170
talk I'll first go over the backgrounds

29
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:25,839
that led me to develop this study i'll

30
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,849
then discuss the methods I used I'll go

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,810
over just a couple of my results and the

32
00:01:27,849 --> 00:01:34,780
conclusions that we can case so to start

33
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:37,478
off a brief overview of the phosphorus

34
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,849
cycle so place required phosphorus in

35
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:42,189
this form the phosphate ion and they

36
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:45,459
take it up through their roots from the

37
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:47,739
soil solution however most phosphorus in

38
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:50,079
the soil exists in some other form at

39
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:52,390
the inaccessible place so this includes

40
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,060
large organic molecules that have

41
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:57,460
phosphorus in them the pocket I can

42
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:00,070
become bound to soil minerals and it can

43
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:02,009
also precipitate out of solution in

44
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:04,750
these insoluble complexes

45
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,519
fortunately microbes are really good at

46
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,469
turning those inaccessible forms of

47
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:10,000
phosphorus back into the phosphate ions

48
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:12,189
which plants can then use and

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,829
furthermore microbes are also really

50
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:16,659
important in helping twice Gaza's

51
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:18,549
phosphate ions once they are available

52
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:20,979
so the or muscular mycorrhizae fungi

53
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:23,560
form in symbiosis with plant roots and

54
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:25,328
simultaneously colonize a larger volume

55
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,390
of the soil and plants could reach on

56
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:30,610
their own so also microbes are very

57
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:33,819
important for making a spa a time

58
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:39,670
available and helping plants acquire it

59
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:41,349
1/6 however we as humans just bypass

60
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:43,719
this whole cycle in our agricultural

61
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:46,389
systems by directly applying inorganic

62
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:48,519
fertilizers to our soils the problem

63
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:50,168
with this is that that phosphate ion

64
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,980
applied for the soil can really quickly

65
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:55,019
turn back into those inaccessible forms

66
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:56,969
such that only 10 to 30 percent of

67
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,980
what's applied is actually taken up by

68
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:01,680
the plants and the rest remains in soil

69
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:03,750
you can imagine that over the years this

70
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,840
can cause washers to build to really

71
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,459
really high levels in soil and this is a

72
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,549
well-documented issue from water quality

73
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,680
because if that soil runoff into water

74
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:16,080
that employ nutrients can cause algal

75
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,840
blooms fish kills and host of other

76
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,709
problems they will be resistant

77
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,200
something that is a little bit less

78
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:24,420
researches once all of that excess

79
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:26,459
phosphorus doing to the soil microbes

80
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,828
that are so important for phosphorous

81
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,509
cycling especially and this is an

82
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:33,000
important question for sustainable

83
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:34,739
agriculture specifically transitioning

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,560
to more sustainable forms of nutrient

85
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,079
management because we're going to have

86
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,079
to increasingly rely on these microbes

87
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:44,700
as opposed to these fertilizers which

88
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:47,939
come from a non-renewable sources

89
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:50,669
require a lot of energy to make so we're

90
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:52,709
interested in how the previous

91
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:54,598
fertilization management techniques may

92
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:57,569
have been affecting microbes which we're

93
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:59,268
going to meet in future so is the phase

94
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:02,578
for this study

95
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:03,030
so I addressed this question for good

96
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:05,969
reasons

97
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,669
the first was just field soil from one

98
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:10,979
of Cornell farms mixed with a little bit

99
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:13,439
of peat moss to lighten it up and then

100
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:15,539
to that base soil mix I had three

101
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,839
phosphorus addition treatments the first

102
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:20,759
was a composition to add an organic form

103
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,918
of phosphorus one of the day accessible

104
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:26,060
forms and that was just acquired from

105
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:28,620
oil harm sources and then I had two

106
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,538
inorganic phosphorus treatments and a

107
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,519
triple super phosphate which is just a

108
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:35,848
very concentrated form of that phosphate

109
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:37,829
ion the first was a relatively moderate

110
00:04:35,848 --> 00:04:39,360
rate of triple super phosphate and the

111
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:42,060
other was designed to just be completely

112
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,370
ridiculous and overload the soil with

113
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,550
more process than plants could possibly

114
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:50,910
use so those are my four soil treatments

115
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:53,460
and to those for soil treatments I

116
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:57,110
applied a multi generation conditioning

117
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:59,879
of a common starting with microbiome so

118
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:02,699
what this meant was I had twenty

119
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:04,379
replicate pots of each treatment and in

120
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,449
the my group alpha which is just

121
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:08,279
important for each crop

122
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:10,860
oh please the cover crops because the

123
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:13,500
legumes and it fixes nitrogen so it's

124
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,840
important in the Northeast so I have 20

125
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,759
pounds of alfalfa for each treatment

126
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,819
I grew those for 3 weeks and when I

127
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,709
harvest into place and I drive them down

128
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:25,740
and I collected the above-ground biomass

129
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:28,079
and I identified the four tops with the

130
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,769
highest biomass plants and some of those

131
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,109
tops

132
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:34,049
I took the soil I took the microbiome

133
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:37,350
and I've transplanted that into a steam

134
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:39,990
sterilized soil of the same treatment so

135
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:42,379
I chose to create micro vials that were

136
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,160
associated with the highest plant growth

137
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:48,029
for each of the four treatments

138
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,460
separately so this method has been used

139
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:52,079
recently to show that you can actually

140
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:55,529
alter plant traits in this way without

141
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:57,060
changing point genomics at all as an end

142
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:58,979
up happening in this case that is I

143
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,769
didn't end up improving violence by

144
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:05,090
selecting my crimes in this way but that

145
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:08,250
was the basic idea behind this method

146
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:10,769
okay so the end of four generations of

147
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,689
conditioning I ended up with four

148
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:15,359
distinct microbiome and disease I

149
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:17,759
performed a reciprocal transplant so

150
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,860
that just means that I put each of the

151
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,300
four different microbiome into each of

152
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,009
the four different soil that's for a

153
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:27,509
total of 16 crops so why did I do this

154
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:30,149
well I was really interested in the

155
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:31,980
effects of having a micro biomes with

156
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:33,989
different compositions and seeing if

157
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,270
those different micro biomes had

158
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,879
different effects on plant growth the

159
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:40,799
problem with my setup was that the

160
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,100
different soil treatments also had

161
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,139
different abiotic properties and those

162
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,730
separately affected by growth so for

163
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,279
example the plants grow the compost

164
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:52,650
would grow differently the plants grown

165
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:55,199
just in the base soil mix just on their

166
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:57,659
own at the same time that how both is

167
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,639
also altering soil properties in such a

168
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,770
way that the microbiome is responding

169
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,099
and altering as well and that altered

170
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:06,269
microbiome is having a secondary effect

171
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,340
altering plant growth so is that a

172
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:10,189
second effect that I'm interested in but

173
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:14,279
it's very difficult to tease it apart

174
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:15,810
just as my experimental setup so we

175
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:18,329
current this with their typical

176
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,629
transplant by putting four different

177
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:22,089
micro biomes in

178
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:24,790
- the same a bionic soil treatments and

179
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:27,250
then if you see at the same time

180
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:29,350
differences in plant growth you can be

181
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,060
reasonably sure that the effect is

182
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,610
because of the microbiome and not

183
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:36,569
because of the soil types so that was

184
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:39,580
spaces behind the receptacle transplant

185
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:41,889
my hypotheses for this experiment where

186
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:43,959
the at the end of my four generations of

187
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:46,269
selections of conditioning microbiomes I

188
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:48,639
was indeed have four distinct micro

189
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:50,109
biomes they would have different

190
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,930
compositions and different enzyme

191
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:54,730
activities that sort of thing I was

192
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,699
exhausted this distinct community

193
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:59,650
fingerprint which maintains inner circle

194
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:01,269
transplants even when they think micro

195
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:03,370
biomes are put into new soils they

196
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:06,430
maintain some of their characteristic

197
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:08,949
properties I also thought that for any

198
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,750
given soil in the reciprocal transplant

199
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:12,370
the plants that would perform the best

200
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,709
would be the one that is grown with

201
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,379
microbiome that's already adapted to

202
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:19,509
that soil but so for example in the

203
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:21,189
compost soil I thought that plants would

204
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:22,990
grow best when they're grown micro

205
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:24,939
bottoms already adapted to the compost

206
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:27,069
soil as opposed to microphones that were

207
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:31,360
adapted to one of the inorganic

208
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:33,279
phosphorus treatments for examples so I

209
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,529
wasn't hell off data I don't have time

210
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,779
to talk about it all today but I checked

211
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:41,468
I was in micro biome in two ways first

212
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:43,659
I've sequence the 16s RNA gene which

213
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:45,790
just give me a stash out of all the

214
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:47,889
bacterial diversity that's present in

215
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:49,629
the soil I also measured an

216
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:52,120
extracellular enzyme activity just to

217
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:54,189
get a sense of nutrient balance and

218
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:58,330
nutrient needs of that microbial

219
00:08:54,190 --> 00:09:00,730
ecosystem for plant for the alfalfa I

220
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,370
measured biomass and for the simple

221
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,710
transplant only I also measured

222
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:09,929
nodulation of those observers and I

223
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:13,450
measured plant mineral concentrations of

224
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:15,309
carbon nitrogen and phosphorus but today

225
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,320
are really just talking about sequencing

226
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:21,429
data and the biomass data from their

227
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:23,470
simple transplants but very quickly my

228
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:25,299
first hypothesis was confirmed at the

229
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,950
end of my four generations of

230
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:28,719
conditioning I had four distinct

231
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:31,420
microphones and they were distinct both

232
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,830
in bacterial community composition and

233
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:37,329
in enzymes

234
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:39,370
activity and this is the sequencing data

235
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:42,009
for their circle transplant relating to

236
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:45,399
my second hypothesis so what this is is

237
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:47,500
a principle coordinate analysis graph

238
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:50,679
and basically what it does is it

239
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,809
condenses that enormous amount of data

240
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:54,549
that I have on bacterial species that

241
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:57,009
are present in the soil for each sample

242
00:09:54,549 --> 00:10:01,539
it condenses that huge multivariate data

243
00:09:57,009 --> 00:10:03,279
set into two items and so when two

244
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:05,110
points that are closer together on this

245
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,669
graph that means that their community

246
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,840
composition is more similar and when

247
00:10:06,669 --> 00:10:09,959
they're further apart means their

248
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,149
community composition is more different

249
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:16,150
so points are colored on this graph by

250
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:17,799
their microbial history what soil were

251
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:20,500
they present to for generation of

252
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:22,120
selection and then points are shaped by

253
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,480
which soil they are currently in

254
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,519
prettier culture so the first thing you

255
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,350
notice is that points cluster most

256
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,289
closely with other points that are the

257
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:34,570
same color and the same shape so there's

258
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:37,539
most similar to other microbiome sharing

259
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:39,879
the same cross with inner circle

260
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:42,250
transplants more broadly points

261
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:45,669
clustered by their current soil types so

262
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,409
for example all the microbiomes that are

263
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:48,309
currently in a control soil cluster

264
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:51,009
together here

265
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:52,750
no matter the microbiome history the

266
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:55,269
same is true the compost amend the soil

267
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:58,269
and it seems true the low in organic

268
00:10:55,269 --> 00:11:01,059
phosphorus well the exception to this

269
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:03,519
pattern may notice far as the microbes

270
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:06,399
that are from historically highly

271
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:09,399
fertilized soil say touring this broader

272
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,829
cluster with every microbiome that is

273
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:14,769
currently or have in the past

274
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:17,139
bins that really highly fertilized soils

275
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:19,029
in other words they maintain their

276
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:22,120
stations so in relation to my second

277
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:23,829
hypothesis it was only those higher and

278
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,629
Vanek phosphorus micro biomes that

279
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:28,000
maintain their distinction and the rest

280
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:30,460
of them converged pretty rapidly in tune

281
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,019
decomposition of when put into image

282
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:37,930
file types so how does this relate to

283
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:39,939
the biomass inch plug performance so

284
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:42,099
this is a picture of all my replicate

285
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:44,300
fives from serviceable transplants a

286
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:47,129
random subset of my pops

287
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:51,028
representing each of the 16 process so

288
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:53,310
popular arranged in rows by their soil

289
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:55,198
treatments and in columns by the

290
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:58,169
microbiome that was transplanted into

291
00:11:55,198 --> 00:12:00,328
that pop so the first thing is you'll

292
00:11:58,169 --> 00:12:02,729
notice and here I'll be flashing my

293
00:12:00,328 --> 00:12:04,289
biomass data panels up to the right and

294
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,449
I'll show you that data again in the

295
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:09,360
next slide that sleazy orient those

296
00:12:06,448 --> 00:12:11,159
those panels to this picture so the

297
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,659
first thing you'll notice is that the

298
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:14,370
place in the back row that we're growing

299
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:16,588
the couple of cemented soil

300
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,419
overall just do the best there's they're

301
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:20,850
tall they're green they look really nice

302
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:24,049
and that's true across the board no

303
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:26,639
matter which my file was transplanted it

304
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:28,049
on the opposite end of the spectrum you

305
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,879
have the slicing in front row which were

306
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:31,979
growing into really highly fertilized

307
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:33,810
soil and you can see that they're small

308
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,778
and they're stunted and they look yellow

309
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:38,729
and there are some website and that's

310
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:41,730
suppose the tree pretty much across the

311
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:44,490
board and then the two so a little the

312
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:47,220
controller will we realized soil our

313
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:49,500
intermediate between that but what's

314
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:53,160
really interesting here are these these

315
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,990
pops in this rightmost column which were

316
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:57,419
passed where the hives fertilized

317
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:59,759
microbiome strand sighted it and you can

318
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:02,250
see in comparison to other tops and sing

319
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,409
grow those plants are yellow and

320
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:07,169
expression and we're listing you so they

321
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:09,990
look massive great so that's quite

322
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:13,289
interesting so we see this reflected in

323
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:15,329
the biomass data as well so these three

324
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:17,549
columns correspond to the tree pasta I

325
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:19,739
had circles and you can see in

326
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:22,889
comparison to other bars in the same

327
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:27,120
panel so two other pops that was on the

328
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:30,028
same soil type these have significantly

329
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,938
lower by mass than the other plants

330
00:13:30,028 --> 00:13:34,698
within the same soil treatment so that's

331
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:37,948
quite an interesting build

332
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:40,620
so there's raffles altogether I found

333
00:13:37,948 --> 00:13:43,679
that at the end of generation board I

334
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,568
had four distinct micro biomes plus one

335
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:48,448
of those were typically translations we

336
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:48,929
soils only the highly fertilized micro

337
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:51,000
biomes

338
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:54,388
maintains one of their community

339
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,448
footprint correspondingly plants grown

340
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:58,169
with that microbiome had a lower

341
00:13:57,448 --> 00:14:01,828
violence

342
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:03,208
periodicals lower percent nation and

343
00:14:01,828 --> 00:14:04,739
they were yellow and stunted in

344
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,388
comparison to other questions that were

345
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,940
grown in the same soil just with other

346
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:11,579
microphones so what we can conclude from

347
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,260
this is that really excessive or

348
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:15,388
repeated inorganic phosphorus

349
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:17,819
fertilization may be changing the

350
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:19,579
microbiome in such a way that it was

351
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:23,399
able to support plant growth

352
00:14:19,578 --> 00:14:25,620
particularly alcohol occur so some quite

353
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:27,690
important in transition to sustainable

354
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,940
agriculture because it suggests that we

355
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,649
will have to do some reclamation work on

356
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,930
our microbiomes before they're back to

357
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:36,299
the sort of nutrient cycling that we

358
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:40,679
will need them to be at in order to

359
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:42,838
function so with that a lot of people

360
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:45,208
thank you my three mentors Jay Arneson

361
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,800
Terry Bell and grant Thompson thanks

362
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:48,479
also to everyone on the plant science

363
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,819
honours committee thanks everyone

364
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,649
my lab who helped me out with various

365
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,800
pieces of the work to Q's accounting

366
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:58,019
model took a very long time thanks to

367
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:59,639
Qin armed services for providing this

368
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:02,399
well in the compost to get certainly

369
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,379
thanks to several people who helped me

370
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,589
design a semi and interpret my

371
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:10,009
statistics and finally to undergraduate

372
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:13,010
grants which help support this work

373
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:13,009
please

374
00:15:16,818 --> 00:15:25,238
this has been a production of Cornell
