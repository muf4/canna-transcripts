00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:19,528
over a period of seven years we've been

3
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:22,199
observing terrific growth of these to

4
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:25,320
London plane trees growing in structural

5
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,820
soil Cu structural soil in Ithaca for as

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,859
long as we've been studying structural

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,410
soil we've been very interested in how

8
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,579
roots grow through this new medium we

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,219
have an opportunity here to actually

10
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,200
excavate the entire root system so we

11
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,729
can transplant this tree safely we

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,600
wanted to do this because the trees were

13
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:45,569
planted under wires this installation

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,700
has about a thirty inch depth of

15
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,280
structural soil overlaid with a

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:55,829
geotextile and then a sand setting bed

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:58,740
where pervious pavers are laid on top we

18
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:03,780
use an air excavation tool to safely

19
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:06,090
unearth the root system here you can see

20
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,629
the roots you know quite a strong growth

21
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:12,978
pattern annually moving around and

22
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:12,978
through the structural soil

23
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:21,699
the roots start at the surface but very

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:24,939
quickly move down and the profile going

25
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,659
down to at least 24 inches into the tree

26
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:29,909
pit area

27
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:29,909
[Music]

28
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:35,569
we're seeing both massive roots that

29
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:39,289
tend to go down we might call those

30
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:42,639
sinka roots as well as large buttress

31
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,640
roots near the surface

32
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:54,429
after we unearth most of the root system

33
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:57,850
we took it out of the ground and we

34
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:01,180
actually transplanted it into a park the

35
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:02,649
tree here is about six inch caliper tree

36
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,380
it had been planted about one and a half

37
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:10,539
inches seven years earlier it's been

38
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:12,849
grown very very well some of those roots

39
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:14,859
were so deep we actually had to break

40
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:21,938
them to get the tree out of the ground

41
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:21,939
[Music]

42
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:29,658
the root mass that we took out of the

43
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:32,658
ground was about 13 feet long and about

44
00:02:29,658 --> 00:02:33,709
8 feet wide so quite an extensive root

45
00:02:32,658 --> 00:02:38,298
system

46
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:38,299
[Music]

47
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,110
we saw some massive roots some really

48
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:46,520
strongly growing roots in the profile as

49
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:48,390
well as quite a bit of fine root growth

50
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,010
[Music]

51
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:54,479
we saw some very interesting features of

52
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:57,939
how the roots move through the stone

53
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,590
interestingly we saw some gravel that

54
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:01,659
was actually embedded in the roots we've

55
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,560
actually grown around and captial ating

56
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:04,560
the stone

57
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,520
[Music]

58
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:11,340
here again you can see some of the

59
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,090
gravel wedged in between the roots roots

60
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,969
growing right around those

61
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:19,069
[Music]

62
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:21,650
and here's a really good example of a

63
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:24,799
stone being encapsulated actually

64
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:28,300
growing around the stone and it was

65
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,300
wedged in there quite tightly

66
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,378
as roots grow through structural soil

67
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,890
they often get flattened and then

68
00:03:35,378 --> 00:03:40,840
proceed to grow normally again this

69
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:46,238
doesn't have any negative effect on root

70
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:48,848
function so we saw deformation we saw

71
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,860
encapsulation we saw a lot of deep root

72
00:03:48,848 --> 00:03:54,669
growth as well as roots that were up at

73
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:56,440
the top six inches below the surface we

74
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:58,208
have lots of evidence now that lutes can

75
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:00,519
grow very very well in structural soil

76
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:03,129
and the hope is that as roots grow

77
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:06,599
deeper there'd be less potential for

78
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:06,598
sidewalk heaving in the future

79
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:10,609
