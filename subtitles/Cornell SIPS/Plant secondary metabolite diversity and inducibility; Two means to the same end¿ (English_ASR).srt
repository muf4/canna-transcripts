1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,480
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,480
university

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:14,000
thank you very much for the introduction

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,759
and thank you for having me i always i'm

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,039
always very nervous when i speak at

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,480
cornell this is i think it's called

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,320
imposter syndrome

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,160
this is when the others find out that

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,599
you're not worth it

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,320
and and um or you feel at least it's

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,000
that way

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,399
so i hope i can show you something i'm

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,640
actually wanna take a little bit of a

14
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,439
risky torque some of you may have seen

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,200
at least

16
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,439
parts of the first part that i'm talking

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,480
about today

18
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,320
but i want you to take part in a

19
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,799
process that i went through while

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,159
thinking about plant responses

21
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:51,119
to any kinds of environmental stresses

22
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:53,919
and i emphasize plant responses here not

23
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,519
right away start with plant resistance

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,239
which is what we are actually studying

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,239
in my lab so induced responses that are

26
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:03,759
functioning as resistance

27
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:05,920
eventually against insect herbivores

28
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,879
but i would rather take that much more

29
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,760
neutral step in viewing all

30
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,399
plant responses as neutral to begin with

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,320
and

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,240
you will see why i'm sort of emphasizing

33
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:20,000
that in the beginning already

34
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:21,679
and before i actually start i want to

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,359
show you the people that are involved in

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,600
most of what we are doing

37
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,719
what i'm talking about today and and

38
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,519
these are

39
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,118
um two postdocs in my lab who both left

40
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,039
this summer was really bad stuart

41
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,359
campbell and reicholichke

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,880
um oh no that's the third poster who

43
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,799
left who's also involved in the work

44
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,640
that i'm showing today akanesuki

45
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,200
and so there's some places open now in

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,359
the lab and then there are the

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,880
a grad student kim morel and an

48
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,078
undergrad student amy erickson

49
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:51,679
who i will show data today

50
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:53,359
and in fact the undergrad students here

51
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,600
in the picture so there's

52
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,438
two of them only and one was back here

53
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,879
in the building they all

54
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:03,758
just last year wrote each one a paper

55
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:05,280
on their honors thesis that was um are

56
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,879
now in review so it was really

57
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,080
impressive to have this group of

58
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:12,079
undergrad students in the lab so when i

59
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,640
talk about induced plant responses

60
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,760
then i'm talking about metabolic changes

61
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,559
of the plant and

62
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,359
in the most basic sense you can envision

63
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,640
so the

64
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,560
so we not only talk about changes in

65
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,079
secondary metabolite production but also

66
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,039
bob turgeon unfortunately is not here he

67
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,480
wrote me

68
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,639
an email this morning that he wanted to

69
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,159
come but he knows very well that also

70
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,919
primary metabolism is changing

71
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,439
dramatically in response to any kinds of

72
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,039
environmental stresses more or less

73
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,199
depending on the plant species

74
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,560
more or less depending on plant genotype

75
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,359
we will see some of that

76
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,680
that later so what happens when an

77
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,959
insect is actually feeding

78
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,400
very strongly depends on the

79
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,479
environmental condition in which the

80
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,480
plant is growing on the plant species

81
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,919
that you're looking at and on the insect

82
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,878
herbivore and this is probably the most

83
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,199
important

84
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,199
or if you want the attacker in general

85
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,318
right and i'm saying insect turbo

86
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,039
because it can be as

87
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:03,359
fine-tuned as in this particular case

88
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,878
this

89
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,720
is a crisis mallet beetle or larvae of a

90
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,479
chrysler mallet beetle called triropta

91
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:14,000
vergato is feeding on goldenrods who are

92
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,919
now nicely flowering outside

93
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,439
and they feed on on these golden rods

94
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,079
and golden rats

95
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,759
you can based on in golden ruts you can

96
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,280
based on the secondary metabolite

97
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,439
production

98
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,479
tell two different chrysomelet beetle

99
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,799
species apart

100
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,719
on the plant and it's very consistent

101
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,480
across different genotypes so that means

102
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,519
even though

103
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:39,119
there may be large genotypic differences

104
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,400
in the resistance of those plants to

105
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,719
the different species the response that

106
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,080
the plants have

107
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,639
after they are attacked by these

108
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,599
herbivores go all in the same direction

109
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:53,119
does that make sense i tell you that in

110
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,479
the beginning i'll come back to that a

111
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,878
little bit later

112
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,598
so now people have speculated about

113
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,079
induced

114
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,238
or the function of induced responses a

115
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,599
lot and as i told you induced resistance

116
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,438
was the one thing that came up and

117
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,839
everybody is talking about

118
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,680
plants become more resistant after they

119
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,959
are attacked and change their metabolism

120
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,280
and this is true

121
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,360
in many cases but by far not in all

122
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,720
cases so we also have cases of induced

123
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,919
susceptibility

124
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,479
so the metabolism changes to the benefit

125
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,319
of the herbivore attacking the plant

126
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,560
and there may be no changes at all which

127
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,478
you know people who work here on

128
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,160
pathogens and herbivores

129
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,918
may be familiar with there's a lot of

130
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,720
experiments that seem not to work right

131
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:34,478
but they

132
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,320
are simply nothing happens to the plant

133
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,719
seemingly nothing happens

134
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,719
and one thing that induced responses of

135
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,880
plants also mediate is something and i

136
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,080
also want to kind of take

137
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:48,959
a more neutral stem to that is called

138
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,959
indirect resistance traits and in this

139
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,758
particular case it's the

140
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,399
um the metabolic change in the plants

141
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,600
provide

142
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,439
some sort of information that allow

143
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,960
another organisms for example an

144
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,240
organism of the third trophic level a

145
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,120
predator

146
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,600
to use that information and find that

147
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,399
their prey in this case it's a

148
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,439
merit bug that is the herbivore in this

149
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,758
case

150
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:16,000
and and kill that so in this particular

151
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,439
example it's about tobacco plant

152
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,038
and that i was working on with ian

153
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,719
baldwin already at max plunge and we

154
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,439
continued here a little bit

155
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,759
um in this case the damage by the

156
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,680
herbivores is inducing a very specific

157
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,199
volatile emission i mean species for

158
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,160
herbivore species specific volatile

159
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,080
emission

160
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,160
those volatiles can be detected by those

161
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,240
predacious bugs they come in kill the

162
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,680
herbivore and save the plant in this

163
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,720
particular case

164
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,840
um it's actually very efficient so they

165
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,919
can reduce

166
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,679
or the plant's ability so we did that

167
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:50,000
with genetically modified plants that

168
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,478
were not able to emit volatiles

169
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,399
and or not able to respond to damage per

170
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,199
se actually both both of these things we

171
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,120
tried

172
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,560
but in all of those cases a plant that

173
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,879
is not

174
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,199
responding to the damage and therefore

175
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,120
is not providing information to the

176
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,919
environment

177
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,600
um and in this particular case not

178
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,079
emitting volatiles

179
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,840
has a 90 percent higher damage rate than

180
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,000
a plant that can do that

181
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,239
right so it's a traumatic effect of

182
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,800
dramatic indirect effect through

183
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,240
the third trophic level interactions so

184
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,439
people came up with

185
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,000
a lot of theories of why plants change

186
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,918
their

187
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,680
metabolic phenotype in response to

188
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:30,879
damage right so why do you have this

189
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,519
kind of

190
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,000
stress response and in the beginning in

191
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,799
fact it

192
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,160
was totally focused on induced

193
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,639
resistance

194
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,720
right because people found that if you

195
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,639
put an insect herbivore on the plant

196
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,680
that has been damaged already

197
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,519
they usually perform worse

198
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,879
on these plants in comparison to a plant

199
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:54,079
that was not damaged before

200
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,598
right and so the first ones were for

201
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,839
example rhodes here

202
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:59,918
who wrote about an evolutionary

203
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,519
hypothesis for why plants do that and he

204
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,719
came up with the idea

205
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:06,000
well it's simply a part of what we call

206
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,120
the optimal defense

207
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,959
theory so optimal defense theory

208
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,879
says that plants should allocate their

209
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:16,399
resources

210
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:18,959
so that they affect the benefit they

211
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:22,159
gain from investing into defense

212
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,279
does not compromise their reproductive

213
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,479
success

214
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:28,879
right and so what that means is

215
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,000
when an insect when a plant is

216
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,519
responding to an insect

217
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,120
or a pathogen or whatever is changing

218
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:36,560
its phenotype

219
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,720
it is based on this hypothesis

220
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,000
investing in investing in the into

221
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,560
costly defenses

222
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,160
only when it's needed in the case of an

223
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,918
actual herbivore attack

224
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,680
right and otherwise if there's no

225
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:48,959
herbivore or no pathogen they wouldn't

226
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,639
invest into those defenses this is

227
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,918
optimal defense theory

228
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,840
and induced resistance was seen

229
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,318
in the early days as a cost-saving

230
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:00,719
strategy

231
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,919
that is functioning on the plant

232
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,840
phenotypes within a

233
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,719
lifetime of a plant right so the plant

234
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,399
can allocate resources as needed

235
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,479
you can read about that in in the carbon

236
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,638
involvement book and also there's a nice

237
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:13,519
review and quarterly review of biology

238
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,439
when nancy stem

239
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,758
very recently that sort of summarizes

240
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:21,038
all the defense hypotheses

241
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,639
so this is overall um induced inducible

242
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,560
resistance as a cost saving strategy

243
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,960
there were two very nice

244
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,360
papers one that derived actually from

245
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,598
work that ian baldwin still did as an

246
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,360
as a graduate student here at cornell

247
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,278
and one that now our own

248
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,479
anarch agrawal did and they published it

249
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,679
in the same year both in

250
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,879
one in science one in nature um

251
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,879
where they compared

252
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,919
plants that are constitutively investing

253
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,000
into those resources so they

254
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,120
treated plants so that it would always

255
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,879
be induced

256
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,120
compared to plants that were never

257
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,200
induced compared to plants that only had

258
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,600
induced resistance when needed

259
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,640
and they found that there is a high cost

260
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,800
when you

261
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,399
have the plant constitutively induced

262
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,958
right

263
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,440
this was great this drove an entire

264
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,518
field

265
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,200
but there is a problem with that right

266
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,440
so you're comparing

267
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,200
two things two metabolic states of the

268
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,080
plant that involve both as i mentioned

269
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,160
in the beginning

270
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,278
primary and secondary metabolism it is

271
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:23,679
not that metabolic change is not in fact

272
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:24,799
only the upregulation of costly defense

273
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:26,399
metabolites

274
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,399
there's a lot compounds that are

275
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,759
downregulated in response to damage

276
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,600
for those of you who do some hplc or

277
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,519
gcms whatever they're

278
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,600
in many cases almost as many compounds

279
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,278
down regulated as upregulated

280
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,278
right so you cannot make that cost

281
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,679
argument at all cases

282
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,519
and secondly it's not that clear how

283
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,359
costly these compounds really are

284
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,759
and people have tried to analyze that

285
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,080
and to calculate it through and whatever

286
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:52,958
but it seems to be all within the

287
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,720
tolerance

288
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,799
range that the plant has available and

289
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,759
resources and to allocate into some

290
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:59,838
defenses right

291
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,360
so plants for plants it's not that

292
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,480
costly to produce these compounds

293
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,879
presumably

294
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,480
right and so there were other hypotheses

295
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,559
that people came up with then

296
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,000
so the other one was the distribution of

297
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,719
damage within the plant

298
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,480
so when you have a modular pump most

299
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,079
plans are actually modular

300
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,159
and you have one branch here and one

301
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:20,319
branch here if there's damage on this

302
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,919
branch is inducing resistance forces the

303
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,480
herbivore to move over

304
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,039
the idea behind that is if you have one

305
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,560
branch

306
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:28,319
and all leaves of that branch are

307
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,958
stripped down

308
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,720
the seed production on this branch will

309
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,319
be much lower

310
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,160
than if you had that same amount of

311
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,720
damage distributed across the entire

312
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,039
plant

313
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,720
because then the damage on each branch

314
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,000
may be within the tolerance range that

315
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,680
the plant has

316
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,078
to compensate for the amount of damage

317
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,319
that it receives there was a very very

318
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,078
good one but there's only very few

319
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,519
studies done on that

320
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:55,519
um and the this one actually

321
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,639
that was the original one was a model

322
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,600
study so it's a

323
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,000
just a mathematical model and this one

324
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,839
is the

325
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
only one that actually thoroughly tests

326
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,000
it

327
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,759
then the third one i already talked

328
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,278
about um

329
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,200
the attraction of predators and

330
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:12,559
parasitoids to the plant requires a

331
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,079
metabolic change because otherwise

332
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,719
there's no information

333
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:19,519
right so if the the herbivores are

334
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,079
presumably under selection to be

335
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,959
stealth feeders so not being seen by

336
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,958
anyone by any predator by any parasitoid

337
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,319
so you will see a lot of adaptations in

338
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,239
insect herbivores

339
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,399
if they are not themselves very toxic

340
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,959
right in which case they're aposomatic

341
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,958
they will smell exactly like the plant

342
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:39,119
or they will look exactly like the plant

343
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,799
or they will be underneath the leaf

344
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,639
or you know these kinds of things they

345
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,000
will be not seen

346
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,679
and therefore there's a benefit from the

347
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,839
plant's perspective to

348
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,519
attract predators in through a larger

349
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,959
signal potentially

350
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,039
and this could be induced of a volatile

351
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:55,359
emission but that only works

352
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,799
if the metabolism of the plant changes

353
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,480
with herbivory because otherwise there's

354
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,319
no information right

355
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,399
in that so if a plant for example would

356
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,920
constitutively emit volatiles

357
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,519
the predators would soon figure out

358
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,479
there is no prey associated with that

359
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,959
particular

360
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,000
queue that's coming off the plant and

361
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:13,359
then there is one

362
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,399
almost forgotten so-called moving target

363
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,759
hypothesis that

364
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,399
was brought up by um recarbon on his

365
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,838
then

366
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:24,159
um postdoc and um

367
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,079
this comes from military right military

368
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:29,199
strategy kind of thing so if you

369
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:31,439
move around a lot you are a much worse

370
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,920
target than if you are standing in place

371
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,279
right and the military people use that

372
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,879
and his argument was

373
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,919
this is exactly what plants do so

374
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:41,759
there's not a per safe fitness benefit

375
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,879
of producing the compounds only when

376
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,879
needed it's simply the metabolic change

377
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,480
that is adaptive so it's not the

378
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,240
increased production of defensive

379
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,759
metabolites or resistance mediating

380
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,000
metabolites

381
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:56,000
it is simply the metabolic change so the

382
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,879
plant becomes something different for an

383
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,278
insect

384
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,159
and it makes sense to a certain extent

385
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,120
because

386
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:05,120
all insects in particular those that

387
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,679
feed on larval stages on plants have

388
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,679
this initial feeding bouts

389
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,199
and so they have their first feedings

390
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,638
very little and then they wait for a

391
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,160
relatively long period of time before

392
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,440
they continue to feed

393
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,360
and this is when they ready their

394
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,120
detoxification enzymes and stuff like

395
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,278
that they optimize

396
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,799
their digestion to that exact plant

397
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:26,879
genotype

398
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:29,359
right and if the plant is in that time

399
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,480
frame changing its metabolism it becomes

400
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,079
something different

401
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,320
so it becomes that moving target that

402
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,000
the insects have a hard time to follow

403
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,160
in which case the simple change in

404
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,759
metabolism over time

405
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,759
is adapted from the plants perspective

406
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,519
because it will reduce the fitness of

407
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,439
the herbivore on the plant

408
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,440
now we wanted to study all of this and i

409
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,519
kind of as i mentioned

410
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,440
um we'll give you some information that

411
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,078
some of you may have seen already

412
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,440
from our work on wild tomatoes in peru

413
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,319
because we

414
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,360
wanted to study these kinds of effects

415
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,680
on wild species

416
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,639
and that started an entirely new kind of

417
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,278
thinking

418
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,720
and i wanted to have you be part in that

419
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,480
kind of thinking

420
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,399
so we went to peru this is how it looks

421
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,399
like

422
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:18,559
and most of the tomatoes so what is it

423
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,600
12 of the 14 so far described tomato

424
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,879
species

425
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,440
grow on the pacific slope of the andes

426
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,879
and this is in general a habitat that

427
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,839
looks like this so it's a

428
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,519
relatively dry habitat all the wild

429
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,680
tomatoes

430
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,159
in comparison to other plant species are

431
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:38,799
extremely trout resistant

432
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,719
and they are usually the plants that are

433
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:43,519
green and flowering when everything else

434
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,040
is yellow like in this picture

435
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,799
and they continuously flower throughout

436
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,480
the entire year and i have green leaves

437
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:51,039
throughout the entire year

438
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,399
um the plant species that i want to

439
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:54,399
focus on

440
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,159
in this talk is one that is one of the

441
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,720
most widely distributed wild tomato

442
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:01,039
species called solano perovianum

443
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,639
um and just to mention there's you know

444
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:03,519
some studies that we want to initiate on

445
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,600
this one

446
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,440
this plant grows in the valley where we

447
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,120
are working um

448
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,079
from 500 meters above sea level up to

449
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,120
3800 meters above sea level

450
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:16,799
continuous population of course

451
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,198
everything changes along that gradient

452
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:19,599
right

453
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:21,439
um we are worried that actually the

454
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,000
plant species may change too but

455
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,000
this is not yet figured out um but this

456
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,919
plant is attacked by a large number or

457
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,240
relatively large and for a surprisingly

458
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:33,360
large diversity of insect herbivores

459
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,440
and originally the idea was to study in

460
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,120
very detail and this was physiological

461
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,320
detail

462
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,839
the plant's specific responses to those

463
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,920
different herbivores

464
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:48,320
and it turned out interestingly that

465
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,639
the wild tomatoes that we study are not

466
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,879
specific at all

467
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,480
so in other words it doesn't quite

468
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,240
matter which herbivore is feeding on the

469
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,519
plant the plant will generally do the

470
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,120
same thing to an extent

471
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,799
in this case that we now wonder

472
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,720
whether or not this is adaptive in this

473
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,240
particular case for a particular reason

474
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,480
so we don't know that as this one one

475
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,000
future study that we want to do

476
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,240
the other things that we had figured out

477
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,240
we see a couple of

478
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,240
induced metabolic changes that include

479
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,320
secondary metabolite production

480
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,839
um anti-digestive protein production

481
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,879
like protein as inhibitors and stuff

482
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,480
like that

483
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,838
and we see an induced resistance to

484
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,120
herbivores

485
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,519
normally not to all what's important

486
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,519
though from my talk is that

487
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,159
the diversity of herbivores feeding on

488
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,919
the plant is only matched by the

489
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:40,159
on the leaves is only matched by the

490
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,198
diversity of organisms that feed on the

491
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,399
flowers

492
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:45,758
um and so we have a also surprisingly

493
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,159
high diversity of

494
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,879
bees feeding on those plants and the

495
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:54,639
special thing is here um

496
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:57,120
you may know that actually all solanum

497
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,000
flowers have these undercones where

498
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,159
um the pollen sacs actually open to the

499
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,078
inside and so

500
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:05,838
the bees or the pollinators have to be

501
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:06,639
specialized to get any pollen out of

502
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:08,639
those plants

503
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,679
what they do they hook onto the plant

504
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:16,160
vibrate their wings and it comes out

505
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:18,160
so this is vipre tile or bus pollination

506
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,839
and it needs some behavioral

507
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,120
specialization on the side of the beast

508
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,438
that's why it's surprising that we had

509
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:26,558
such a high diversity of bees doing that

510
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,880
and we in fact established in this study

511
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:31,200
um the first encounter of elected bees

512
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,360
which are very small bees

513
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,480
to bus pollinate flowers so they were

514
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,038
not known to bust

515
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,038
at all the entire group of electives and

516
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:40,798
they do it here

517
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:43,919
now the thing was that when we started

518
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:45,759
the work with the wild tomatoes

519
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,679
what we figured out very quickly was we

520
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,038
have absolutely no idea about the

521
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,640
ecology of wild tomatoes

522
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:53,519
so nothing was known other than where

523
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,960
the plants grow and even that was

524
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,279
um old data charlie rick's data pretty

525
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,400
much

526
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:02,558
from his collections in in peru

527
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,360
and a lot of those sites that he cited

528
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:09,038
on on that are still cited on the on the

529
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:10,399
website um are now paved over

530
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:11,839
so you can't find the plants there

531
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,600
anymore so we had it took us quite a

532
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,119
while to actually find the plants

533
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,879
but then there was in the literature was

534
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,399
nothing known about ecology

535
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,760
not nothing about the herbivores that

536
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,519
are naturally associated with those

537
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:24,400
plants nothing about the pollinators

538
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:26,480
and so we had to do some very general

539
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,919
ecological service and among them was

540
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,079
one survey

541
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,320
where we compared the proportion of

542
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,199
leaves damage as a very crude measure of

543
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,119
damage

544
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,319
so this could be even in that category

545
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:39,359
here you could have

546
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:40,558
only 10 percent leaf tissue removal but

547
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,199
every single leaf

548
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,759
received a little hole right so every

549
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,960
damage

550
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,759
on a leaf was counted as a yes on that

551
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,880
leaf

552
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,679
and so you get a percentage of leaves

553
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,559
damaged

554
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,240
as a crude measure of damage and on the

555
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:57,440
other hand i just told you about the

556
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,279
pollination marks

557
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,798
we use the proportion of flowers with

558
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,480
pollination marks

559
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:07,679
as a measure for pollinator traction

560
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,919
right and so those pollination marks are

561
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,160
these brown marks which are a result of

562
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,200
a polyphenol oxidase reaction

563
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,600
when the bees hold onto when they bust

564
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,480
pollinate right they have these claws

565
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:22,159
and they hook

566
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,679
onto those anthrocones and then very

567
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,000
tightly hold on and then vibrate their

568
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,160
wings

569
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,839
so that this entire thing is vibrating

570
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,038
and the pollen shoots out on the bottom

571
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,038
and then they collect the pollen from

572
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:33,038
their belly right

573
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:34,798
and this actually this mark is species

574
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,640
specific if you if you train your eye

575
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,319
you actually know which bee species has

576
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,160
done that and it occurs

577
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,000
within five minutes after a pollination

578
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,000
event happened right

579
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,759
and it is in fact the pollination event

580
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,119
we don't know how successful is it may

581
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,960
still be different between the different

582
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,119
bee species but it's definitely

583
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,640
a pollination event because it's

584
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,279
normally the bee's ballet that's a

585
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,400
that's a

586
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:59,440
touching um the stigma down here

587
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,159
and then pollen is deposited

588
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,919
so this was our measure and we saw this

589
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,440
very interesting pattern so the more

590
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,480
damage you have on the plant

591
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,480
from herbivores on leaves right

592
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,599
the fewer flowers in those

593
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,480
inflorescences

594
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,439
have pollination marks suggesting that

595
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,599
there is

596
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,279
lower attraction of pollinators right

597
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,038
but this is just a correlation so those

598
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:23,599
two things may not be causally linked

599
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:25,279
and that's why we started a small study

600
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,639
that generated everything i'm telling

601
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:30,319
you today

602
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,000
um so we did an experiment where we

603
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,158
manipulated herbivory so we had plants

604
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,640
that were not damaged and then had a set

605
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,039
of

606
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,320
damaged and undamaged plants in this

607
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:39,599
particular case they were damaged by

608
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:41,439
flea beetles simply because they're

609
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:42,480
easier to collect and to control on the

610
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,798
plants

611
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,720
um and when you have a certain number of

612
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:48,240
beetles feeding on the plant and this is

613
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,720
actually less than 10

614
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,400
leaf tissue removed i emphasize that if

615
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,200
it becomes important later

616
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,720
you get a significant reduction up to 25

617
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,880
reduction

618
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,839
in this particular case in proportion of

619
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,280
flowers

620
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:05,359
um with pollination marks so

621
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,359
fewer pollinators are coming to the

622
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,519
flowers when they're damaged

623
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,839
you can simulate that when you apply

624
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:14,079
methyl gestamate so methyljasminate

625
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:16,000
is methyl easter of gismonic acid which

626
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:17,759
is a phytohormone that has been shown to

627
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,079
be crucial

628
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:22,400
um for the endogenous signaling

629
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,319
associated with mechanical damage

630
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,080
so if you silence for example we have

631
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,519
done that in other plant species

632
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:29,519
if you silence yoursmonic acid

633
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,759
production in a plant inducible gismonic

634
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,079
acid production plants are

635
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,119
not able to see a herbivore feeding

636
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:36,879
there will be no

637
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,479
induced change in response to that

638
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,039
damage

639
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,960
and this is where we were feeding so you

640
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:45,119
will still see a response to a pathogen

641
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,440
though right it's important

642
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,439
um so if you apply just simply methyl

643
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,320
gestimate meaning without any damage

644
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,320
this is just making the blood believe

645
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:56,960
that i don't like i'd like to say that

646
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:59,200
so you you simulate damage by just

647
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,200
providing the endogenous signal that

648
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,759
signals damage in the plant right

649
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,679
without any damage available and you get

650
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:07,519
the same a similar reduction

651
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,919
in pollinator attraction and that

652
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,359
translates in a traumatic reduction in

653
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,880
seed set

654
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:14,558
and as i said a twenty-five percent

655
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,520
reduction in z-tech so it has a fitness

656
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:17,599
effect

657
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:19,759
and this is actually in fact the largest

658
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:20,480
fitness effect we have ever seen coming

659
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,359
from an

660
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,000
herbivore and in this particular case is

661
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:28,639
simply mediated through the attraction

662
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,159
or non-attraction of a pollinator now

663
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,280
you could still argue

664
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,919
well maybe this reduction is simply due

665
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:37,279
to

666
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:39,038
the fact that leaf tissue is removed

667
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,960
and therefore there are less resources

668
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:42,879
available to put into seeds

669
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,480
right so it's maybe not has nothing to

670
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,440
do with pollinated attraction maybe in

671
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,880
the plants would still

672
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,720
even though we have fewer pollinators

673
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,320
coming they would still produce the same

674
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,679
number of seeds so it's not necessarily

675
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:53,119
the pollinators that cause this

676
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,679
reduction in seed set

677
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:57,359
it could be simply the amount of damage

678
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,120
but as i told you in the experiment we

679
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,639
used less than 10 percent damage

680
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,879
actually overall

681
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,720
but we wanted to make sure that this is

682
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,720
true so what we did we only used

683
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,880
methyljasminate

684
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,240
and then had open and hand pollination

685
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,159
so with methyl jasmine we already

686
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,759
exclude any damage

687
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,440
but yet methyl jasmine it was or

688
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,359
gismonic acid per se

689
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,120
was first identified as a growth

690
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:20,079
inhibitor right so we have to see that

691
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:23,038
so they may

692
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:24,319
just the signaling itself may reduce um

693
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:26,558
seed production

694
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:29,279
and here when you have open pollination

695
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:31,279
we get the same picture as we had before

696
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:34,000
right and this is now the number of

697
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:36,399
fruit seeds per fruit produced

698
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,679
but if you hand pollinate them and cover

699
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,200
them up

700
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,519
then you get even a slightly higher

701
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:46,240
production when you have adjustment here

702
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:46,240
so that shows that it's not due to

703
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:52,640
limited resource availability herbivore

704
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,360
damage it's 2-2 limitation

705
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,278
by pollinators and because that i call

706
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:59,839
that

707
00:23:56,278 --> 00:24:03,519
herbivore-induced pollinator limitation

708
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:05,199
which is what that is now

709
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:07,119
we wanted to figure out why that is and

710
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,558
now mechanistically why why do the bees

711
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:09,439
actually avoid and so we look for

712
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:12,319
signals

713
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,720
of course there's two obvious ones one

714
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,960
is

715
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,278
maybe an optical hue that's changing if

716
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,798
you look at the flowers on the uv

717
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:23,200
um tomato flowers usually the

718
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,079
the petals well i should supposed to do

719
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,440
it here

720
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:27,759
but here's actually the picture is not

721
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,120
so so clear the petals are actually

722
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:30,640
reflecting uv

723
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:32,719
while the anthracone is strongly

724
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,240
absorbing a v so under uv this is all

725
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,480
shiny light and this is

726
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,599
black dark even though it's all yellow

727
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,200
to us

728
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:41,599
right so there could have been a change

729
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,480
in that that visual cue in response to

730
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:45,439
damage

731
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,880
especially when i tell you metabolism

732
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,200
changes dramatically

733
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,640
but it could be also the volatiles

734
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,558
coming out of this

735
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,480
right and this is how we trap volatiles

736
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,000
in the field so we develop this very low

737
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,519
cost system

738
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,200
on this end at least on the trapping

739
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:00,158
side is low cost and when you run it on

740
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,278
a gc it becomes

741
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,880
more costly um because we have far more

742
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:08,159
samples to run right so

743
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,799
this this method allows you to do up to

744
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,240
16 samples per pump so the more pumps we

745
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:13,839
can carry to more

746
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,240
car batteries we can carry into the

747
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:18,079
field the more samples we can take and

748
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,679
we are now we have some experiments they

749
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:24,720
go up to 120 samples per

750
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,640
experiment and what we do is we pull

751
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,759
ambient air through that chamber over

752
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,200
the plant

753
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,839
and this particular case obedient

754
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,360
fluorescence and onto

755
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,278
absorbent tubes and they could be in

756
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:36,959
this particular case it's charcoal

757
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:38,640
that's absorbing the organic compounds

758
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,798
and then you elude them down with

759
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,000
dichloromethane or hexane

760
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:45,440
and analyze them in a gcms

761
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,440
this is how that looks like in the field

762
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,159
this is right or my long-term postdoc in

763
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,759
lab

764
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,278
and it's pretty dangerous in some cases

765
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:55,440
because the plants

766
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:58,400
tend to grow on these landslides

767
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,159
yeah it could be dangerous never mind so

768
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,080
what do we find

769
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,840
blur your eyes and concentrate first on

770
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:06,079
the first two so these are

771
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,599
plants that were not damaged this is

772
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:10,158
just a normal

773
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,918
volatile emission from leaves not from

774
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,559
flowers this is from leaves

775
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,320
and this is a plant damaged by manduka

776
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:18,079
caterpillars so this is the tomato

777
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:18,798
tobacco hornworm actually used to be

778
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:21,918
called until

779
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:23,759
1964 this was the tomato hornworm

780
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,038
and then another species became a tomato

781
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:26,558
hormone and this became the tobacco

782
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:29,359
hornborn

783
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:31,440
um i just highlight here there's a

784
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:32,959
number of monoterpenes and a number of

785
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,919
sesquiterpenes that are dramatically

786
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,960
upregulated right

787
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,320
you just look here dramatically up in

788
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,558
response to damage and this is what you

789
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:42,720
see normally in tomatoes tomatoes very

790
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:45,038
smell very different when you damage

791
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,278
them within herbivore

792
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:49,679
now the interesting part was that now we

793
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:52,400
go down here if you compare

794
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,159
um leave a mission with flower emission

795
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,919
there are a number of compounds that are

796
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,360
only produced in the leaves

797
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,679
you may say it is not a surprise it was

798
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:02,319
a surprise to me because if i

799
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,840
put my nose on a tomato flower i don't

800
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:04,480
smell the difference between the flower

801
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,240
and the leaves

802
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,480
and it's probably because the leaves

803
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,640
already smell so terpenoid

804
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,599
that it blocks up everything that we can

805
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,120
taste but

806
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:14,399
but this is actually so there are a

807
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:15,759
number of compounds that are only

808
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,440
produced in the flowers but the biggest

809
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:20,319
surprise was that

810
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,840
there are a number of compounds that are

811
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:24,158
only produced in the flowers

812
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,918
and only in response to herbivore damage

813
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,640
on the leaves

814
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,399
so you get a specific metabolic change

815
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,399
in the floral metabolism

816
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:34,719
in response to herbivore damage which

817
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:36,558
provides a potential signal for the bees

818
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,798
to differentiate at least between

819
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,240
damaged and uh flowers on damaged and

820
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:41,839
undamaged plants

821
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,319
and so for that we had to and i have to

822
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:46,000
speed up a little bit um

823
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:47,678
we had to come up with an experiment and

824
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,038
i very briefly explained the experiment

825
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,640
and very quickly go into the result

826
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:54,640
because i want you to see the other

827
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:57,200
more evolutionary study and what we

828
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,240
could take advantage of is that these

829
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,278
tomato plants

830
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,200
are huge so they often have three meters

831
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:05,759
in diameter in the field

832
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,038
with a lot of branches and those

833
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:09,919
branches are

834
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:11,919
independent meaning that if you damage

835
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,679
one branch you can measure induced

836
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,120
and systemic induced resistance along

837
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,038
that entire branch

838
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:18,398
but it will not affect at least not

839
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:20,798
directly affect

840
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:22,479
a neighboring branch so you could have a

841
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,398
control branch and a damaged branch on

842
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,079
the same plant as the ideal kind of

843
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:28,719
comparison so if a paired comparison

844
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:31,439
then but what you can also do is

845
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,440
you can bring the inflorescences of both

846
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,600
together

847
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,840
so that what you can create is a

848
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:40,639
chimeric inflorescence

849
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:42,158
that has either the order of a damaged

850
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,919
plant or the order of a

851
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,360
undamaged plant or the combination of

852
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,120
the two

853
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,119
and then if you want to test whether or

854
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:50,798
not a visual cue is involved as well you

855
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,558
can cover up

856
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,079
one part of it so in this particular

857
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:56,960
case what that was was

858
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:58,879
in the back was the inflorescence on a

859
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,440
damaged branch

860
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,440
and outside is the visual cue of a

861
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,360
non-damaged branch

862
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,720
so the bees would be exposed to an

863
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:11,759
undamaged flower bouquet

864
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,440
but it smells like a damaged right and

865
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:14,879
then you need a lot of controls for that

866
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,360
and we had to do this because we

867
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,520
couldn't take the bees home and do

868
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:20,719
choice experiments in the lab so we had

869
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,158
to do it in the field

870
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,839
um but it actually worked surprisingly

871
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,278
good so we did that with actual damaged

872
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:28,879
plants and also the methyl jasmine

873
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:31,359
treated plants and this is the

874
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,200
the methyljasmine treated plants and

875
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:35,038
what you see here so these in this case

876
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,519
both influorescences are open but here

877
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:40,240
is a pair this is the full control

878
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:42,000
which has um the actual test in

879
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,759
fluorescence that we're looking at

880
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,960
as well as the one that's supposed to be

881
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:46,398
treated but in the control it's not

882
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,240
treated so this is just a double

883
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:51,199
inflorescence

884
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,919
of undamaged flowers in this particular

885
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,159
case

886
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,240
only this inflorescence is on a damaged

887
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,919
branch this is on an undamaged bonds and

888
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,880
they are combined but both of them are

889
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,559
down

890
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,399
already suggesting that the volatile

891
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:05,599
emission is probably important

892
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,719
now when you cover this one up then you

893
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:08,879
can only measure

894
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,839
pollination here right you still have

895
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,559
the same effect

896
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:15,199
so there seems to be no visual cue

897
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:17,519
involved it's all all factorial

898
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,759
right and then just to make that quick

899
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:22,798
so this is pretty much equivalent

900
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:24,240
to this result this is exactly this here

901
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:26,319
so we because we were wondering where is

902
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,558
the volatile emission coming from

903
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:30,558
so here it's the flowers only in here

904
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:30,960
then we put leaves on a damaged plant in

905
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:32,960
here

906
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,720
nothing different and we also put

907
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,360
methyljasmite only with the flowers

908
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,200
because we

909
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:38,798
you know methyl jasmine can be smelled

910
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,080
by by bees so it

911
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:42,319
could be detected by piece of methyl

912
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:45,599
jasmine could actually here be a problem

913
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:49,439
but it's not but it means that

914
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:53,278
the bees orient towards or away from

915
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:56,480
the specifically flower specific

916
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:57,119
and herbivore damage specific odors that

917
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,038
are

918
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,038
in those flowers here okay

919
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:06,240
now this entire thing started an entire

920
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,558
new large project in my lab

921
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,519
that was asking more evolutionary

922
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:12,000
questions

923
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,679
so if the chemistry the floral chemistry

924
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,960
is so strongly linked to the overall

925
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,360
plant metabolism

926
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,399
that is also changing in response to

927
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:20,479
herbivory

928
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:22,079
then there should be a very strong

929
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,440
interaction both ecologically and

930
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:26,000
evolutionary

931
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,000
between the selection by herbivores and

932
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,880
by pollinators on chemical traits of the

933
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,839
plant

934
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,360
right and it seems like we have this

935
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:34,879
negative selection

936
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:36,558
uh sorry they have this neck a very

937
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,600
negative effect

938
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,480
of um on pollination by herbivores that

939
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,278
this is

940
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,240
um kind of an antagonistic interaction

941
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:48,319
evolutionary

942
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:50,319
we would expect right so to

943
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:52,319
bring that together so i'm just um

944
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:53,599
concluding what what i just said

945
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:55,839
so here we're going to use changes in

946
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:57,199
plant metabolism include vegetative and

947
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:58,639
floral volatile emission

948
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,278
the pollinators use the volatile

949
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,320
emission to avoid flowers on damaged

950
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:04,079
plants

951
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:06,480
that comes with a fitness cost for the

952
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:07,918
plant and we don't know how long that

953
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,798
fitness cost goes we can discuss that

954
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,120
later

955
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:13,038
so because those are perennial plants

956
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:14,479
and we obviously have only a snapshot so

957
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:15,759
there's there's a little bit more to

958
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,599
that story but it could have that

959
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:18,879
negative effect

960
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:20,798
and i didn't talk about the

961
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,440
morphological changes in general the

962
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:26,398
flowers do not morphologically change

963
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,000
especially to the relatively small

964
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:28,959
amounts of damage that we have on the

965
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,200
plants

966
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,558
but what changes very consistently is

967
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,240
the length

968
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:38,240
of the pistol and so in tomatoes and

969
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,960
this nice work by steve tangslay in this

970
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,240
building

971
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,720
or in the other building was the other

972
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,200
building when he was still here

973
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,200
and they found that the pistol

974
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,720
elongation is something that happens at

975
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,759
anthesis and is pretty much

976
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,399
only the expansion of cells

977
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:57,599
right at that stage and this expansion

978
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:59,359
of the cells is seemingly inhibited

979
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:02,158
when you have damage on the plant which

980
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:03,678
results in the pistol being pulled back

981
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,240
or stays back actually i don't want to

982
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,240
say pulled back it's not pushed out

983
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,759
um the out of the under cone so it stays

984
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,399
in the other cone but this is another

985
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:13,759
kind of question and this is um the

986
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:15,439
hypotheses that they derive from that

987
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:16,480
they correlate correlated evolutionary

988
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,399
process between defensive and

989
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,079
reproductive strategy

990
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:22,839
and potentially habitat specific

991
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:25,599
outcomes of this process

992
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:27,918
now

993
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:29,759
at first it felt really difficult to

994
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,519
approach that from an evolutionary stage

995
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:33,200
but then there are grad students that

996
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,200
are over ambitious

997
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,798
and advisors like me that allow that

998
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,480
over ambition

999
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:40,720
so stuart campbell was in my lab and

1000
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,839
what he did was

1001
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,960
he took a total of 56

1002
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:50,398
species of solanaceous plants

1003
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,919
that were in groups of self-compatible

1004
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:55,278
and self-incompatible so they were

1005
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:58,320
different in their mating strategy

1006
00:33:55,278 --> 00:34:01,679
right self-compatible self-incompatible

1007
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:04,000
and then he tested all of them for their

1008
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,200
induced responses to herbivory

1009
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,880
so that you have a measure for

1010
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,559
constitutive resistance when you compare

1011
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,639
the self-compatible self-income battle

1012
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:13,199
within each group

1013
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,679
and uh and also the induced resistance

1014
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,838
of those

1015
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,918
so the idea of that grouping is that we

1016
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,480
have phylogenetically independent

1017
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,319
replicates

1018
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,159
or independent comparisons between a

1019
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,200
self-compatible and a self-incompatible

1020
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,519
species

1021
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,439
and that actually includes in this

1022
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:33,039
particular case

1023
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:36,240
19 independent replicates

1024
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:38,159
of the shift from self-incompatible to

1025
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,398
self-compatible which we commonly have

1026
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,960
in plants

1027
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:44,000
but in solanaceous plants it is even

1028
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,838
more pronounced

1029
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,679
so in all the phylogenys that you see

1030
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:49,199
from solanaceae plants there is no

1031
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,599
suggestion

1032
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,799
of a reversal of that thing so it always

1033
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,800
goes phylogenetically from

1034
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,000
self-incompatible to self-compatible and

1035
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,720
not reverse

1036
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,639
right meaning self-compatible is the

1037
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:03,439
derived state

1038
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:05,039
but that's important for later on so

1039
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,760
what he did to these plans as i said

1040
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:10,639
within each species with replication

1041
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,320
he had a control that was undamaged a

1042
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:15,279
planet was mechanically damaged and the

1043
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,880
planet was damaged with manduka

1044
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,640
he did all the chemistry for all of

1045
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,800
those plants and then also

1046
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:21,679
fed the plants back to manduka neonate

1047
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,240
larvae

1048
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:26,078
to measure resistance directly and this

1049
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:27,598
is actually the novel part in this so we

1050
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,720
standardize

1051
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,680
all the resistance to the resistance to

1052
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:32,959
manduka

1053
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:34,399
right you can discuss whether or not

1054
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,199
this is good because there may be other

1055
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,760
species and

1056
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:38,480
things like that but if you standardize

1057
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,920
it

1058
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,000
to the most resistant plant you can

1059
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,960
pretty much

1060
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,920
compare resistance across the entire

1061
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,199
phylogeny

1062
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,159
right and the reason why we did these

1063
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:53,838
two

1064
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:55,759
treatments was that you then have a

1065
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:58,000
measure by comparing these two

1066
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,599
of the specificity of the induced

1067
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,440
resistance right is it specific to

1068
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,000
manduka or is it just general

1069
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,400
okay now how does that look like if you

1070
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,239
just look at constitutive production

1071
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,480
sorry of constitutive resistance and

1072
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:14,000
meaning you only compare the controls

1073
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,519
within each group and

1074
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,039
and here there's uh so the

1075
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:18,480
self-incompatible or in green and

1076
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:20,159
self-compatible are in blue

1077
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,920
and if you blur your eyes you'd actually

1078
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:23,039
see that there is no pattern seemingly

1079
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,680
no pattern

1080
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,239
um and it turns out that there is though

1081
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:28,559
a slight

1082
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:29,919
increase if you can control for

1083
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:33,199
phylogeny

1084
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,720
so self-incompatible species in average

1085
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:36,559
have a higher resistance than

1086
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:38,480
self-compatible

1087
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:40,078
this is something people had expected

1088
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,639
but nobody has really had really looked

1089
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,480
into it

1090
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:44,319
so self-incompatible and average have

1091
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,679
higher

1092
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,200
constitutive resistance than

1093
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:47,838
self-compatible this was kind of

1094
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:50,879
expected

1095
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:52,880
not necessarily that strong but it was

1096
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,280
now if you blur your eyes here you see

1097
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,680
that very strong shift

1098
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,359
of the blue ones to the right and this

1099
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:00,559
is reflecting that if you look at

1100
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:02,880
inducibility

1101
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:04,639
inducibility which is the magnitude of

1102
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,280
change in resistance

1103
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:09,199
after the plant was attacked by a

1104
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,119
herbivore right after

1105
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:13,279
resistance is induced then

1106
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,400
self-compatible species have a

1107
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,960
much stronger induction than

1108
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,880
self-incompatible

1109
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,720
and this was a big surprise i had never

1110
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:25,358
expected that

1111
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:27,039
so let that sink in a little bit

1112
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:30,719
self-compatible species so

1113
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:33,519
those who sometimes inbreed

1114
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:34,799
right may or may not but sometimes in

1115
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:37,039
breed

1116
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,000
are stronger inducible than those that

1117
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:40,000
never inbreed

1118
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:49,119
now if you just look at the resistance

1119
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:50,799
at the induced state right so you just

1120
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,800
compare resistance

1121
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,039
of damaged plants with each other

1122
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,839
there's no difference

1123
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:58,960
so that means that self-compatible

1124
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:01,039
plants

1125
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,400
compensate for their disadvantage in

1126
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:05,599
constitutive resistance

1127
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,280
by changing their metabolism in a in a

1128
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,599
stronger way and now i got

1129
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,560
already gave you a hint the metabolism

1130
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,240
in fact is changing in a stronger way

1131
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:15,679
right so it's only resistance in this

1132
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:17,279
picture but the metabolism has changed

1133
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:20,078
so we were asking

1134
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,760
is there some pattern that we can see in

1135
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,640
the metabolic secondary metabolite

1136
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,839
production

1137
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:28,239
that could explain that pattern and

1138
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:29,199
sure we do and this was a big surprise

1139
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,199
to me too

1140
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:33,279
if you just look at this so these are

1141
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:35,439
pairings that are actually in

1142
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,480
in those comparisons so four independent

1143
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,159
pairings

1144
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,760
in the petunia genus and the cestron

1145
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:41,199
genos and two in solano but there are

1146
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,720
two different

1147
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:46,719
clades within solanum independent clades

1148
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:48,159
here the self-incompatible ones and here

1149
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:49,439
the self-compatible ones what is the

1150
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,078
difference

1151
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,079
what do you think

1152
00:38:55,039 --> 00:39:00,400
do you see a difference in general just

1153
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,480
blur your eyes a little bit

1154
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,720
exactly so they have far more compounds

1155
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,480
over here so there's no per se

1156
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:08,639
difference in the amounts of compounds

1157
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,880
if you just sum up all the compounds

1158
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,598
there's no difference but if you look at

1159
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,358
the diversity of compounds produced

1160
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:15,760
self-incompatible species have always

1161
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:17,598
almost

1162
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,599
always more compounds than

1163
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:23,200
self-compatible species

1164
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,400
right now interestingly so this is the

1165
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:26,559
picture actually

1166
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,480
control for phylogeny it's highly highly

1167
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:29,679
significant so this is only for phenolic

1168
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,880
compounds but you can do that for

1169
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:34,159
terpenoids too

1170
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,838
and you see pretty much the same picture

1171
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:39,118
so diversity of compound production is

1172
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,639
higher in self-incompatible species

1173
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,920
we think that heterozygosity is

1174
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:43,039
affecting diversity of compound

1175
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,039
production

1176
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:47,599
so within each plant but also the

1177
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:49,599
compounds available within populations

1178
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,519
and that led to a hypothesis and that's

1179
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,680
why i'm speeding up a little bit

1180
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:55,679
that inducibility is generating diverse

1181
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:57,838
phenotypes in time so what does that

1182
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:57,838
mean

1183
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,599
high diversity high compound diversity

1184
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:04,800
is very strongly correlated

1185
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,280
with resistance i will show you a

1186
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,960
picture in a second it's and

1187
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,400
in fact after we found that we went

1188
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,079
through all of our data

1189
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,599
diversity of compound production seems

1190
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:15,200
to be the strongest correlated with

1191
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,960
resistance

1192
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:18,239
in comparison in particular to just

1193
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,838
individual compounds

1194
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:21,199
if you just come you know correlate

1195
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:22,639
individual compounds with the resistance

1196
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:26,078
you never get a strong correlation

1197
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:26,639
as the diversity of compounds that may

1198
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,720
give

1199
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:30,719
self-incompatible species that advantage

1200
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:32,959
so this is the outcrossing advantage

1201
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,358
they have potentially

1202
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,519
and that potentially leads to a

1203
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:39,279
increased natural selection

1204
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:41,119
and this is now our hypothesis we didn't

1205
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,800
show that here um

1206
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,480
increased natural selection on

1207
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,839
self-compatible species

1208
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:50,079
for stronger inducibility because the

1209
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:52,318
stronger inducibility allows the plant

1210
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:55,760
to change its phenotype and time

1211
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:58,239
to diversify its phenotype in time

1212
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,680
and that gives them the same advantage

1213
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:00,639
as the high diversity compound

1214
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:02,559
production

1215
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:04,559
that the other species have the

1216
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:06,318
self-incommerce species have

1217
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:08,400
another thing that's that's correlated

1218
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:11,119
with this is the specificity

1219
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,880
remember i had the mechanical damage and

1220
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:16,240
the caterpillar damage

1221
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:20,160
if you plot the

1222
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:21,039
resistance effect on caterpillar damaged

1223
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:23,039
against those

1224
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:24,800
of mechanical damage plants if you have

1225
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:25,759
a strong correlation there which we have

1226
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,440
here in the green line the

1227
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,280
self-incompatible ones

1228
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:34,159
then you have low um specificity

1229
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,280
right so it's the same response if that

1230
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:37,838
switches and becomes

1231
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,160
not significant and you have a higher

1232
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:42,559
specificity in the response and this is

1233
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:43,838
true in the self-compatible species so

1234
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:46,838
the self-competitive ones

1235
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:48,400
induce stronger and induce more

1236
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:50,960
specifically

1237
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,400
right and then there is this nice

1238
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,240
conservative induced

1239
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,639
resistance that was always hypothesized

1240
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:58,078
that there is a trade-off in fact so

1241
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,199
people hypothesize there must be a

1242
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,800
trade-off

1243
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:03,039
between the expression of conservative

1244
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,960
resistance and inducibility

1245
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:07,279
that's true it looks like it right so

1246
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,639
it's a negative correlation

1247
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,119
and our data actually support that

1248
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:14,400
hypothesis in that way but my argument

1249
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:17,599
is that trade-off is not necessarily a

1250
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,519
fitness type trade-off it is in fact

1251
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,720
a reflection of two alternative

1252
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,559
strategies

1253
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:24,318
either having a high diversity of

1254
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:28,159
compounds produced

1255
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:31,759
and not having to induce resistance

1256
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:34,318
or having a very low

1257
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,000
because of the mating system they are in

1258
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:37,759
having a low

1259
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,440
compound diversity and therefore being

1260
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,200
on the strong selection to induce very

1261
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,639
strongly to diversify the phenotype in

1262
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:44,159
time so this is the hypothesis that we

1263
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:47,039
are now following up

1264
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:47,920
um and do a lot of work on now and i

1265
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:50,559
think i have to

1266
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,240
to stop here simply um only five more

1267
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:55,599
slides but i want to stop here to

1268
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:57,279
allow for some more discussion um but in

1269
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,920
conclusion what that means

1270
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,280
first we have a very strong correlation

1271
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,720
between the reproductive and the

1272
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,800
defensive strategy so this was the

1273
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:08,318
important point of this study

1274
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,240
and this is a macroevolutionary

1275
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:12,639
correlation in this particular case we

1276
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:16,639
also have with work on

1277
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:17,598
um native solan solanum karlinems we

1278
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:19,519
showed that

1279
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,680
there is in fact within a species a

1280
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:23,920
similar correlation happening

1281
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:25,598
um and so there is something to that

1282
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,880
mating system and resistance

1283
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:31,599
are strongly correlated and associated

1284
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,318
but what this here is actually providing

1285
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,559
is

1286
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:36,480
in fact a new hypothesis for why

1287
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,960
inducibility can be important

1288
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,880
which is independent of the costs of

1289
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,679
compound production entirely independent

1290
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,400
right

1291
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:45,919
it provides an alternative strategy for

1292
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,559
a plant that has to live

1293
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,599
or for plant populations that have to

1294
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:53,119
live

1295
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:55,119
with low compound diversity right

1296
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,559
and with that i end here and hope we can

1297
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:09,838
have some time for questions thank you

1298
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:09,838
very much

1299
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,200
have you been able to follow up with

1300
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:26,560
other boards

1301
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:27,679
no we haven't only within species and so

1302
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:30,559
the solanum karli

1303
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:33,279
nens example there we had different

1304
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:36,639
herbivore species and it is in fact

1305
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,280
um differently expressed in different

1306
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:38,719
species

1307
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,960
right so with different species if you

1308
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:44,159
will so if you take and this is

1309
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:46,000
purely because um

1310
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:48,000
the response to certain herbivores is

1311
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,880
stronger than to others to begin with

1312
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,519
but also certain herbivores respond more

1313
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,119
or less

1314
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:56,960
to the changes and this is an important

1315
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,800
ecological problem actually not a

1316
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,838
problem for us actually an ecological

1317
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,839
explanation problem kind of um because

1318
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:06,000
what that means is

1319
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:07,358
you would have to know what is in order

1320
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,358
to argue there

1321
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:10,559
may be natural selection on those traits

1322
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:13,119
and on those

1323
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:14,639
in this particular case on inducibility

1324
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,800
right you have to know what the

1325
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:19,279
dominating herbivore in the system is

1326
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:23,280
that might actually

1327
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:25,440
inflict um fitness costs that are high

1328
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,599
enough to drive natural selection

1329
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,079
to begin with and then that herbivore

1330
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,519
has to do something to the plant that is

1331
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,760
or the plant has to respond to that

1332
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:35,599
herbivore in that particular way

1333
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,200
we have a number of of different which i

1334
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,440
don't didn't talk about today we have a

1335
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:42,078
large project on goldenrods here too

1336
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,000
and goldenrod has one of the most

1337
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,519
diverse alphabet communities directly

1338
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,318
associated with them that i know so

1339
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:48,719
there's

1340
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:50,800
in this area about 120 herbivore species

1341
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:53,838
directly associated with goldenrod 80

1342
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,760
of them are specialists and in those

1343
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:58,400
cases you find everything so you find

1344
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,960
induced susceptibility to one herbivore

1345
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,039
um that for example that herbivore is

1346
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,318
inducing susceptibility to itself so

1347
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:05,519
they do better on the plants that they

1348
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:08,400
themselves damaged

1349
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:09,119
but induce resistance to everybody else

1350
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,559
right

1351
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,559
which suggests there might be some

1352
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,400
manipulation of the inducibility so it

1353
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:17,279
could be a cost of induction

1354
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,119
um and then there is um herbivores that

1355
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,040
induce resistance to themselves so

1356
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,318
strongly that they have to move away

1357
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:24,159
and things like that so there's any

1358
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:26,079
variation of the theme so they

1359
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:28,159
in the end it becomes the question which

1360
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,599
one of those herbivores is driving the

1361
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:31,358
evolution

1362
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,800
right or is it all of them together

1363
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:35,440
which is still a big question

1364
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:43,839
in that field anyway um but it's a very

1365
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:43,838
good question from edward spring

1366
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:57,838
um

1367
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:06,799
that's a wonderful question that's a

1368
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,079
wonderful question so we did

1369
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,599
um a number of studies with um ian

1370
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:15,519
kaplan who is

1371
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:18,960
now a duke um who

1372
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:22,960
for his phd studies actually with us um

1373
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,639
analyzed in in tobacco whether or not

1374
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,159
induction through the roots and

1375
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:28,000
induction through the leaves

1376
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:29,279
it changed some effects above and below

1377
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,519
ground so they seem and

1378
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:35,440
there was a um a

1379
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:38,559
meta-analysis associated with one of

1380
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:41,200
those papers where we looked into

1381
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:42,640
are below ground insects affect above

1382
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:43,358
ground insects more than the other way

1383
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:45,039
around

1384
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:46,558
and it is actually that way so if you

1385
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:48,400
have below ground herbivory there seem

1386
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,119
to be stronger metabolic effects above

1387
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,559
ground

1388
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,960
and therefore stronger ecological

1389
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,760
effects but the other way around is not

1390
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,280
as strong

1391
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,920
now the question is and this is still

1392
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,599
kind of a weird thing in the field

1393
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,119
is that simply because we have a harder

1394
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,960
time measuring below ground

1395
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:05,119
things that go on below ground or is it

1396
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,720
a true

1397
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:12,000
a true thing right and so

1398
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,000
at this point i think

1399
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,160
a number of people think that there is

1400
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,039
something fundamentally different

1401
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:23,039
between above and below ground

1402
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:25,358
i actually don't think so um but

1403
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,800
we are actually not yet there to say

1404
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:28,000
something about it to make that

1405
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,280
comparison

1406
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,639
truly happen um and there is another

1407
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,920
good example is goldenrod

1408
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:38,159
um when we relieve golden rats from

1409
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,000
natural selection by herbivores

1410
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:41,440
the low ground chemistry goes up through

1411
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,519
the roof

1412
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,519
and in this particular case it's

1413
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,280
supposedly an allelopathic compound that

1414
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:48,960
we see go up

1415
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,359
but that compound is not only

1416
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:54,159
allelopathic it is actually a highly

1417
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:55,679
cell toxic compound and a japanese group

1418
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:57,358
looked at it and they kind of wanted to

1419
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:59,118
do an kind of

1420
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:01,279
how do you call it an ethno-botany kind

1421
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:04,240
of approach to goldenrod

1422
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,920
and they tested it on mammal cell tissue

1423
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:08,318
cultures on

1424
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,358
nematodes on bacteria and it kills

1425
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:12,318
everything

1426
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:13,039
right and uh and so the question is you

1427
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:15,039
know

1428
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:16,800
is there simply resources freedom this

1429
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:18,318
is this is an evolutionary process so

1430
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,000
it's natural selection but

1431
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:21,599
it's different genotypes that do that in

1432
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,318
those populations when you

1433
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:26,000
we so what we did was we repeated that

1434
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:27,920
experiment that dick rooted a very

1435
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,400
famous experiment where he

1436
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,280
had goldenrod populations right out here

1437
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,800
um and

1438
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,559
had plots that he sprayed with

1439
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,359
insecticide for a number of years

1440
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,480
and left the other open to ambient

1441
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:40,400
herbivory

1442
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,679
and it found huge effects on the

1443
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,920
community so they were studying the

1444
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:45,919
community interaction so they saw that

1445
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,519
the diversity is dramatically dropping

1446
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,318
when you take the herbivores out because

1447
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,239
you

1448
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:52,639
benefit the dominating plant species in

1449
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:55,598
there which is solidartissima

1450
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:55,920
so what we did was out of those plots we

1451
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:58,640
took

1452
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,838
samples and clonally reproduced them so

1453
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:01,759
that we had

1454
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:03,199
independent replicates of those and when

1455
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,960
you compare them you see

1456
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:06,558
they're completely different genotypes

1457
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,079
right and that

1458
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:09,839
are phenotypes too right so different

1459
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,200
phenotypes that are there so they have

1460
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:12,480
lower resistance when they're in the

1461
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:14,239
spray plots

1462
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,079
and even when you have them several

1463
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:17,118
years now out of the out of the plots

1464
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,760
already

1465
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:21,599
and and they have this very interesting

1466
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:24,000
dramatic dramatic increase in

1467
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,920
illegopathic hormone production

1468
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,239
and so there is definitely both

1469
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,880
evolutionary and on an ecological

1470
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:32,399
level a very strong interaction that we

1471
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,440
and i agree with that

1472
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:38,000
totally underestimate um

1473
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,760
but it's not time to say whether or not

1474
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,199
the mechanisms that mediate those

1475
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:55,359
interactions are different below and

1476
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:58,159
above ground

1477
00:50:55,358 --> 00:50:58,799
