1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,650
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:07,330
University good morning everybody it's

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,040
great to be here and to lead off these

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,769
lightning talks and I'm really gonna try

5
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:15,009
to do this without going through the

6
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:16,810
whole thing so I want to just share I've

7
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:19,810
been working on reducing systems for

8
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:22,000
vegetables for several years and focus

9
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:24,399
in on both conventional and organic

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,099
systems that are suitable for vegetable

11
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,719
crops and margins mom and so when we

12
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:31,088
look at these systems and evaluate them

13
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,799
we are including many of the goals that

14
00:00:31,088 --> 00:00:35,079
we've already heard about other people's

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,030
presentations I just want to highlight a

16
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,980
couple of them that are important to us

17
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,719
climate resilience of course is

18
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:42,519
important our vegetable crops aren't as

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,620
rigorous necessarily in the early part

20
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,149
of the season as some of our agronomic

21
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:48,579
crops so we have to have really suitable

22
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:50,410
seed bed so creating systems that allow

23
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:52,179
for deeper rooting of crops so that they

24
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:54,250
can acquire soil and nutrients from

25
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:56,768
deeper in the soil is one of our driving

26
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,570
factors for these reduced systems as

27
00:00:56,768 --> 00:01:00,759
well as to improve infiltration of water

28
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:04,599
so we can capture retain that water a

29
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:06,728
year like this it's a reminder another

30
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,199
area so from the environmental side

31
00:01:06,728 --> 00:01:11,019
there's many ways that we try to look at

32
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,430
these systems and again all of those in

33
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:14,379
line with the soil health goals that

34
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,350
we've talked about already in terms of

35
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:19,629
the crop productivity we want our

36
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:22,269
vegetable crops have to be meeting

37
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:24,429
timely harvest dates and so creating an

38
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:27,250
environment for rapid crop establishment

39
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:29,290
and growth are really critical but an

40
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,750
area that we focus in on quite a bit is

41
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:34,329
on of the improvement in not just soil

42
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,709
health the farmer quality of life and we

43
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:38,169
think about labor use and labor

44
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:40,209
efficiency in that how quickly can some

45
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,909
of those early season tasks be completed

46
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:44,828
to allow that producer or manager to

47
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:47,290
actually get to other really important

48
00:01:44,828 --> 00:01:50,228
tasks to be timely in the estelle tree

49
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:51,909
crops and then another major challenge

50
00:01:50,228 --> 00:01:53,769
that we face with reducing tillage and

51
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:56,950
vegetable crops is weed management so

52
00:01:53,769 --> 00:01:59,828
that comes to be a focus of our work but

53
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:02,439
we review reduced tillage in a systems

54
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:04,538
context and what we know is that when we

55
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:06,429
can stack these different practices and

56
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:08,710
layer them different soil health

57
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:11,379
practices that there's an additive

58
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:13,580
benefit and so reducing tillage or cover

59
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:16,129
cropping by themselves will help

60
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,410
when we layer that and integrate those

61
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:20,509
together and add some rotations and

62
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:22,430
think about other kinds of amendments we

63
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:25,819
will achieve our cell health goals more

64
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,740
quickly so how do we do that and therein

65
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:30,049
lies the rub with vegetable crops

66
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,939
because given their sensitivity to

67
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,760
establishment conditions and soil

68
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:36,979
conditions trying to optimize power crop

69
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:40,370
growth in a lot of residue on the soil

70
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:42,319
surface is indirect sort of competition

71
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:45,080
and contradiction to the conditions we

72
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,539
tend to prefer for vegetables so our

73
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,920
growers very often arm growing cover

74
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:51,530
crops protecting the soil over the

75
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:53,539
winter but killing them early and so we

76
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,729
don't get the benefit of the biomass the

77
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:57,919
carbon additions to soil so what are

78
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:59,840
novel systems what are new approaches

79
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:03,049
new equipment that can help us manage

80
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,670
that residue more effectively or improve

81
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,890
the way that we establish our crops in

82
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:08,899
that kind of residue what are the weed

83
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:10,429
control strategies or chemical and

84
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,459
non-chemical through cultivation that

85
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,170
can help us achieve that we also know

86
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:17,030
that you have to be mindful in the case

87
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:19,009
of vegetables particularly from the

88
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,409
diversity of scale and the diversity of

89
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:22,789
crop products and so leave worked on

90
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:25,060
systems that use equipment based

91
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:28,009
approaches that are large scale using

92
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:30,890
example like the zoom tool unit here the

93
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:32,599
zone builder unit um and if we can test

94
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:35,208
that but then we also have to think

95
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:36,919
about for smaller farms those that can't

96
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:38,060
invest in that type of equipment that

97
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,859
don't necessarily have that kind of

98
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,840
horsepower to pull that equipment on

99
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:44,510
their partner what's a suitable approach

100
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,489
and so we use a reduced tillage strategy

101
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:48,889
that looks at multiple approaches and

102
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,810
one example in some of our work with

103
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:53,689
organic farming that we've been doing

104
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:56,060
recently is really trying to optimize a

105
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:57,439
mill tale system very small-scale and we

106
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,800
found that using these types of

107
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,569
impermeable tarps that we can actually

108
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,550
prepare a soil bed in the fall and then

109
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:06,379
use cover cropping or other sorts of

110
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,209
soil mulches and then tarp them in the

111
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:10,789
spring and it creates a beautiful

112
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:12,920
condition it deals it warms the soil and

113
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:14,750
allows us to actually have a no-till

114
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:17,358
system that can be continued over

115
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,250
multiple years so how do we innovate and

116
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:23,538
continuously try to integrate practices

117
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:26,060
over time we've demonstrated that we can

118
00:04:23,538 --> 00:04:27,329
grow vegetables in a reduced Hill system

119
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,449
for numerous crops

120
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:32,490
are a real objective is how do we then

121
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:34,889
help growers overcome their concerns

122
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,530
about risk of these systems and adapt

123
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:39,689
them and so I'd like to be able to just

124
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:41,878
leave you with a few ideas to sort of

125
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:43,500
foster some thinking as we go forward in

126
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:46,229
this day and thinking about this roadmap

127
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,120
I think that we need we need to really

128
00:04:46,228 --> 00:04:49,408
be continuing in vegetable crops of

129
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,718
things about the ways that we do this

130
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:53,759
stacking integrating and maximizing the

131
00:04:51,718 --> 00:04:56,009
biomass and the benefits of cover crops

132
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,509
in a reduced tilt system then making

133
00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:00,900
sure there's a suitable to large and

134
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:03,389
small farms using regional type of soil

135
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:07,918
health experiments or having even on

136
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:10,530
farms long-term soil health plantings or

137
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,478
fields allows us to create spaces of

138
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:13,439
innovation and help growers think

139
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,620
together about how do we innovate

140
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:19,019
innovate these systems creating

141
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,990
incentives for access to some of the

142
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:23,728
specialized equipment as well as coops

143
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,550
to allow smaller scale operators

144
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:27,899
actually sharing equipment together how

145
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,259
what are the ways that we can do that

146
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:33,359
make that work um and we still need

147
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:36,330
other ways to actually include and

148
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,240
remember and create opportunities for

149
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:40,889
smaller scale growers to really be able

150
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,778
to look at these systems and integrate

151
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:44,668
them because we know we can save a lot

152
00:05:42,778 --> 00:05:47,939
of labor and honey and help improve

153
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:49,649
profitability on those farms finally I

154
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:52,918
think that's interesting in New York is

155
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:54,209
we have a really interesting we have

156
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:55,769
these incentives through something like

157
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:58,109
the New Yorker and the certified that

158
00:05:55,769 --> 00:06:00,538
includes a EMT or to type assessments

159
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,788
how do we elevate within that the soil

160
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:04,348
health practice is there and make them

161
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:06,568
more visible because right now they're

162
00:06:04,348 --> 00:06:08,218
actually buried within the various parts

163
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:09,750
of the tiers and in some of the

164
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:12,180
worksheets but create a more

165
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,278
comprehensive vision statement around

166
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,310
that in talking about our New York grown

167
00:06:14,278 --> 00:06:19,680
certified and similarly I think as

168
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,509
mentioned earlier by Pat you know we
