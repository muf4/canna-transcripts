1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,800
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:10,279
University um but before I get started I

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:12,518
wanted to just Orient you to what I'm

4
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:14,480
going to be talking about today and so I

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:17,719
will be talking about the WVU organic

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,839
farm 15 years of research and education

7
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:22,479
and that's because the organic farm has

8
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,480
only been there for about 15 years so

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,920
and I actually was there when the

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,320
organic farm got its start um these

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,960
pictures that you see on this first

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,200
slide will Orient you to where I am in

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,079
my presentation so when I talk about

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,120
biodegradable pots uh this will show up

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,799
in the corner of the slide so you know

16
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:43,718
kind of where I'm at so what I'm going

17
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:46,519
to do is I'm going to talk a little bit

18
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:49,039
about the marker garden section of the

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,160
organic farm I'm going to next talk a

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,399
little bit about biodegradable pots and

21
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:55,599
then a little bit about mulches organic

22
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,000
mulches and then finish up uh talking a

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,000
little bit about

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,799
education but before we get started um I

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,159
would like to kind of introduce myself

26
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:06,000
to you because I am not necessarily a

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,400
big name in horiculture despite that

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,239
wonderful introduction um so but I am a

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,439
Belgian native which is kind of

30
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:17,719
interesting um by itself I just became a

31
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:20,438
US citizen about 3 months ago so I'm

32
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:21,920
really excited and proud about that uh I

33
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:24,639
had a very classical horiculture

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,478
training in Europe in Belgium and so I

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,200
went to Vocational Technical High School

36
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:31,840
studying horiculture so I have a very

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,280
practical hand hands on uh background

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,920
but when I finished up my um

39
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,879
undergraduate degree at Michigan State

40
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,759
University it was time for me to go to

41
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:41,959
graduate school and I found myself in a

42
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,118
molecular biology lab which was Randy

43
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:47,879
Woodson's uh lab and that's where I

44
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:49,640
studied flower inessence um and at when

45
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:51,560
I first started at West Virginia

46
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,239
University I continued doing some of

47
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,399
that work on flower inessence and

48
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:57,519
there's several uh papers that can be

49
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:59,478
found with my name on it that is

50
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,679
actually molecular biology work

51
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:05,078
including ining uh this one in a journal

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,759
of experimental botany however when I

53
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:11,120
first came to uh Wu there was the idea

54
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,199
of starting up an organic farm because

55
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,959
we did not have a lot of horiculture

56
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,518
Faculty it was only natural for me to

57
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,239
get involved in this project and so I

58
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:22,280
started actually doing work on the

59
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,039
organic farm specifically in vegetable

60
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,239
production and I had that strong kind of

61
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,519
background that allowed me to kind of go

62
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,080
between these very very different uh

63
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:33,360
fields

64
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,519
so a little bit more about me I do a lot

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,280
of teaching um I teach anywhere from uh

66
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:41,800
Greenhouse management to an introductory

67
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,800
plants and people course Garden Center

68
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,120
management storage and handling of

69
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,080
horiculture crops herbaceous plant

70
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,719
materials and I guide about 3 to 10

71
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,000
independent study students every

72
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,840
semester so uh they can be doing uh

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,560
number of different types of projects

74
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,280
but so I do a lot of

75
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:05,560
teaching so let's get started on organic

76
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,919
the W organic farm so why study organic

77
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,759
or sustainability well first of all one

78
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:13,598
major reason for that is there's

79
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:15,439
consumer demand and I have to apologize

80
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,839
a little bit for this slide because the

81
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:20,280
the white lettering doesn't show up as

82
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,039
nice on this picture as I maybe wanted

83
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,959
it to but consumer demand is one of the

84
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,158
main reasons to study organic um we can

85
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,438
argue back and forth about what are the

86
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,759
benefits of organic and if it can feed

87
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:36,318
the world or not but what we cannot

88
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:39,039
argue with is that organic has seen an

89
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:42,079
increase in production and consumption

90
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:45,438
every year for the last um so many years

91
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,640
since the final rule came out in 2002 so

92
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:49,799
on a personal note why do I study

93
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:53,279
organic farming and how do I see that

94
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:56,760
relate to uh flower inessence even well

95
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,919
for me studying organic is kind of like

96
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:02,318
um being tied with your hands behind

97
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:05,399
your back and trying to figure out how

98
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:09,238
to get something done and that to me is

99
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,959
what organic is and so I see it as a so

100
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,759
I see it as a real challenge uh to

101
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:18,160
actually produce something organically

102
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:21,879
and because we don't have the easy and

103
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,040
ready way or readymade ways to deal with

104
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:26,918
problems so we have to work within a

105
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,840
system and so why do we want to have an

106
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:32,599
organic farm well the WV organic farm is

107
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:35,319
unique not maybe not completely unique

108
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,360
but it the whole Farm is organic and it

109
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:39,120
is because we wanted a holistic approach

110
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,360
to organic so the farm actually

111
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,360
incorporates animals chickens and sheep

112
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,360
agronomic crops and vegetable Crop

113
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,600
Production so it is a very holistic

114
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:54,080
approach to farming uh it's supposed to

115
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,879
mimic a very Diversified small farm in

116
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:59,279
Appalachia that's the idea behind it so

117
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:02,159
a very holistic approach so what are the

118
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:04,319
goals of the organic farm it is not to

119
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,280
compare conventional with Organic we are

120
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,038
going to just assume that we want to

121
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:11,559
grow organic that we want to give people

122
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,519
that want to grow organic information so

123
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,199
we are not doing any comparison between

124
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,359
conventional and organic production what

125
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,400
we are interested in is best management

126
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,639
practices in organic and we are also

127
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:26,279
interested in long-term sustainability

128
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,400
so one of the studies that I'm going to

129
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:31,239
talk about today is to kind of highlight

130
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:33,038
the idea of doing long-term work and

131
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,680
what kind of influence or what kind of

132
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:37,680
impact that can have and then the lastly

133
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,918
is to educate undergraduate students and

134
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,680
graduate students at this facility so

135
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:45,279
what you're seeing here is the actual

136
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,000
marker Garden outline or the actual

137
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:50,119
organic farm outlined in red and in

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,639
white is the market garden section of

139
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,199
the farm um so to continue uh talking a

140
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,840
little bit more about Organics so what

141
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,160
I'm going to talk about today is the

142
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,918
marker Garden so I'm not going to talk

143
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,639
about agronomic crops I'm not going to

144
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,758
talk about the sheep or the chickens I'm

145
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,120
just going to focus in on vegetable

146
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:10,720
production after I talk a little bit

147
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,439
about the longterm studies that we've

148
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,680
got going on in Market Garden I'm going

149
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:17,360
to talk about plastic Alternatives I'm

150
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,800
going to talk about biodegradable

151
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,720
containers and mulches and you will see

152
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,680
that there are some connections between

153
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,800
the marker garden and these alternatives

154
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,000
to to Plastics and I I'll try to

155
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,439
highlight those for you to kind of make

156
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,959
sure that you see that there's some

157
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:37,000
continuity in in my talk um so the

158
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,279
marker Garden like I said before the

159
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,199
organic farm was started in

160
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:45,318
1999 um and this kind of coincides with

161
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:48,160
the final rule that came out in 2002 so

162
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:50,759
the F was actually transitioning while

163
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,240
the USDA was actually uh putting out the

164
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:57,240
final rule in 2002 and so we were trans

165
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,759
fully transitioned in 2003 and that's

166
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,319
important because I'm going to show you

167
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:04,800
a couple of data points from right after

168
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,560
uh the transition phase and more

169
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,319
currently about two years ago and I'm

170
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,000
going to try to make some comparisons

171
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:14,598
between those two years so the original

172
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,759
objective was information on

173
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:18,598
transitioning we actually wanted to look

174
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:20,240
at what is one of the best ways to

175
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:22,759
transition I'm not going to talk about

176
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,840
that today the current objective is to

177
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:29,520
look at the impact of long-term manure

178
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:31,079
applications on organic systems and you

179
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,639
you will see there's some benefits and

180
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:35,478
some drawbacks to long-term manure

181
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:37,800
applications and then the future

182
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:39,959
objectives starting next year is going

183
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,120
to be the effect of tillage on soil

184
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:46,359
quality so we have been building soils

185
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,840
for 15 years and so now we want to kind

186
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,759
of know what it what effect tillage will

187
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:54,239
have on these soils and then the last

188
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,038
thing of course is education and

189
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,560
education is key to what we do at the wp

190
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,959
organic form so this is the marker

191
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:06,360
Garden it's a completely randomized

192
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:08,519
design with 32 plots um 16 those plots

193
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,479
are low input plots and 16 of those

194
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:14,240
plots are high input plots the low input

195
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:16,240
plots only get green manur the high

196
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,560
input plots get green manures and a

197
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,360
manure application so that's the big key

198
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,839
to this uh particular Slide the other

199
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,840
thing is that we have a 4-year crop

200
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:30,079
rotation and the crop R rotation goes

201
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:33,718
between legum Sol and AC

202
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:36,038
hurb and composi uh families of of

203
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:40,479
plants and so we have 4year rotation

204
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:42,879
that means each crop has four low input

205
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,560
plots four high input plots and if you

206
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:48,399
keep on adding that up you come up with

207
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:51,518
32 plots 16 and 16 and within those 16

208
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,799
there's four that are Solon four curbit

209
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:58,440
and so on and so that's the way this uh

210
00:08:53,799 --> 00:09:01,519
a whole system is set up so what we grow

211
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,839
uh for the um the legumes we grow

212
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,600
provider beans uh in a succession

213
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,800
planting we grow uh Coastal Romain

214
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:13,920
lettuce in the uh leafy crop or Brassica

215
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:17,240
which is not I know it's not a so um uh

216
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:20,039
so in the Brasa we actually have um and

217
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,120
I'm meant to say leafy crops uh have

218
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:24,799
Coastal Roma lettuce and then for the

219
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,759
cucurbits we have dunga zucchini and for

220
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,719
the soleni we have both tomato and

221
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:31,519
peppers in those plots

222
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,278
this is the way that the actual

223
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,600
experiment is structured so you have

224
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:39,120
high input you have compost or which is

225
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,720
basically aged manure the manure that we

226
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,759
use has gone through an aging process

227
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,320
but is not organically certified compost

228
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:49,200
so when we apply this material we treat

229
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,320
it as if it is actual manure and I'll

230
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,759
show you some uh more information on

231
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,399
that uh to show you what kind of the

232
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,919
properties and characteristics are of

233
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,958
this manure but you we apply about 10

234
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:02,078
tons per acre of this manure

235
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:04,838
in the high input plots nothing in the

236
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:08,159
low input plots in Winter we have

237
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:11,480
established a RI vet cover crop in both

238
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:14,199
uh systems in the summer if the uh if

239
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:18,360
we're done with a crop we either put in

240
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:20,759
buckwheat or sometimes also um some

241
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,879
other cover crops just to hold over uh

242
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:26,879
those plots and one thing that's really

243
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:29,519
important here is that every other year

244
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:32,799
when we grow Sol and AC when we grow

245
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,159
cbits we apply a hay mulch to those

246
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:38,000
plots and that hay mulch actually gets

247
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:41,000
incorporated into the soil so the low

248
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,679
input plots get G they get cover crops

249
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,958
but they can Al They also get every

250
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:48,199
other year they get a a a mulch that is

251
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:49,838
tilled in so that becomes part of the

252
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,879
nutrients that actually make it into

253
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,720
those uh plots the other one the high

254
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:59,439
input gets an extra 10 tons per acre of

255
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:02,639
um manure now 10 tons per acre um is

256
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,360
very very small amount uh to apply it's

257
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,680
basically just a little dusting or

258
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,440
coating it is a very small amount the

259
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:10,638
reason I mention that is because you

260
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,519
will see some of the big impacts over a

261
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:19,039
period of uh 15 years so this is the

262
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:20,720
actual uh compost or AG manure analysis

263
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:23,838
and what I want to draw your attention

264
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,320
to is that it's got a fairly high ph and

265
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,880
that's because it actually comes from um

266
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,959
a a dairy um and there's some calcium

267
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:34,519
that actually made it into this uh

268
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:37,638
compost or this aged manure and I also

269
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:41,320
want you to note The Fairly high levels

270
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:43,560
of um phosphorus and so those are also

271
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,480
key to what I'm going to show you next

272
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:49,799
so what I'm showing you here

273
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:53,560
is 2004 immediately after transition and

274
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm also showing you to 2014 which is uh

275
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:59,559
the last year that I have uh analyzed

276
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,360
data for um what I want you to note is

277
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:04,518
um right here the phosphorus levels in

278
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:08,399
the low input plot have remained about

279
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:10,799
the same and the key to that is we

280
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,679
basically we've been removing vegetable

281
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:16,439
matter but we've been reapplying the hay

282
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,879
so some of that is completely basically

283
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:23,560
balance things out when it comes to

284
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:25,519
phosphorus when we're looking at uh 2014

285
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:28,638
uh one thing that I want you to note is

286
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,799
the huge difference in phosphorus levels

287
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,399
between

288
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:33,958
2004 and

289
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:36,000
2014 uh we get huge increases in

290
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,599
phosphorus and that is only logical

291
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,320
because we've been applying manure for

292
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,519
the last 15 years now you may say why

293
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,360
are you keep on plying manure over and

294
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:47,519
over and over again even though you have

295
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,320
plenty of phosphorus well we were doing

296
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,278
this experiment in conjunction with

297
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,199
another long-term experiment that

298
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,799
actually had a 7-year rotation in

299
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:58,078
agronomic crops and we wanted to go get

300
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:00,799
through at least two of those rotations

301
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,838
before we switched up this experiment

302
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,719
and so that's why we get to these very

303
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,160
very high levels of phosphorus that

304
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,879
really you don't need or you probably

305
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,639
don't even want in uh these systems but

306
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:14,278
it was just basically part of the

307
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:18,360
experimental design the other thing that

308
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:21,480
I want you to note is oops sorry the

309
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,600
other sorry um the other thing I want

310
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,120
you to note is the very high levels of

311
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,199
calcium and that's because that that

312
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,959
aged manure came in with quite a bit of

313
00:13:27,198 --> 00:13:33,439
calcium we also occas Al limed the plots

314
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:35,159
uh especially the low input plots uh to

315
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,920
make sure that the pH was about the same

316
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:41,159
as the high input

317
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,799
plots so um this is a little bit more

318
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:46,439
information on the actual yields that we

319
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:49,278
received off of those plots so uh what

320
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,240
this is showing is we have the low input

321
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:53,439
we have pounds per acre and the high

322
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:57,039
input pounds per acre for

323
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,880
20144 we did the same thing for 2004 but

324
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:02,559
what we noticed is that when you combine

325
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,360
multiple years together uh we can't

326
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:06,439
really see very many difference between

327
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,759
low and high input plots so what we did

328
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:12,959
is we normalize the data to percent of

329
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:15,360
an average yield for that year and that

330
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:19,119
allowed us then to combine the two years

331
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,440
the 2004 and the 2014 together and do

332
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,519
statistical analysis on those combined

333
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,440
years now there's plenty of other data

334
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,879
but I'm just showing you for these two

335
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:33,240
years and so the result of all of this

336
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:36,559
is is basically that for the high input

337
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,480
plots you can get about 20 to 25% higher

338
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,958
yields when you apply 10 tons per acre

339
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,720
of uh this this uh aged

340
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:46,638
manure that that's just uh what we came

341
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,278
up with and you see that kind of

342
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,600
consistently except maybe for tomatoes

343
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:54,320
uh where we didn't see those same

344
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,440
differences but what that does is if you

345
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,800
take that amount of yield and you turn

346
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,839
it into a monetary value and basically

347
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:07,198
what we did is we can get let's say $2

348
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:11,360
for green beans if we have a yield that

349
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:14,439
is about 5,000 um some uh pounds more

350
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,959
per acre you multiply that by the amount

351
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:20,320
that you can get for the beans let's say

352
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:23,159
$2 per pound you come up with a number

353
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,560
that indicates what that compost is

354
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:28,000
actually worth to you so you can

355
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:31,838
actually see that this compost this 10

356
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,399
tons of of Dairy manure is worth or is

357
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,000
of a lot of value especially to a marker

358
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,958
Garden type of setting where you're

359
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,720
going to do uh retail uh selling and so

360
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:46,439
this basically shows you that getting

361
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,319
compost off Farm um you can actually get

362
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:53,680
that at very high cost and still come

363
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:53,679
out ahead uh when you're applying this

364
00:15:53,839 --> 00:16:00,959
compost um now the main thing that I

365
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:04,159
want you to remember of all of this is

366
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:06,518
that we can still get good yields in the

367
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:10,159
low input plots so if we just use cover

368
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:13,679
crops and hay mulches we get good yields

369
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:17,439
we add in manure we get about 20% higher

370
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:20,719
uh yield what that means is that 20 that

371
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,360
20% higher yield you can actually make a

372
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,959
lot of money and you can actually afford

373
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,879
to apply more manure however there are

374
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:31,799
some drawbacks to applying manure over

375
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,559
over and over and over again and so one

376
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:35,799
of

377
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:38,479
the one of those drawbacks is those High

378
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:41,240
phosphor stocks but there are also some

379
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,319
key benefits to applying that manure

380
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:47,120
over 15 years and one of the things that

381
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:50,439
you will see here is that in the high

382
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,959
input plots after about five years of

383
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:56,440
applying four years of applying uh this

384
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:59,879
da manure we actually increased um the

385
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:03,639
level of soil organic matter to 6. 4%

386
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:07,000
which is pretty high we also saw that if

387
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:09,318
you keep on doing this after about 15

388
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,400
years of application of this uh aged

389
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:15,279
manure we saw that you can actually

390
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,959
increase the uh organic matter content

391
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:20,399
of the soil to about 8.7% which is

392
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:23,000
really high and actually we can see

393
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,079
differences just by looking at the soil

394
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,919
when it's rain so you can actually see

395
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:30,759
differences in in U darkness of these

396
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:35,880
soils and that's by applying basically

397
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:37,720
150 tons over 15 years of uh manures now

398
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,720
that sounds like a lot but if you only

399
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,919
do that every single year very small

400
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,038
amounts that is a very very small amount

401
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:47,880
to apply every year the other benefit we

402
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:52,480
saw besides increased in soil organic

403
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:55,960
matter is we also saw that um the bulk

404
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,880
density of the soil decreased and so

405
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,798
that's what you see right here the bulk

406
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,320
density is basically inversely related

407
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:06,038
to the soil organic matter um as you

408
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:08,798
have more organic matter the soil become

409
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:10,640
is ways less per volume and so that's

410
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:13,480
what you see here but what I want to

411
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,960
draw your attention to is that those

412
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,919
differences if you see those ER bars

413
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,840
these those differences did not show up

414
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,000
until about 10 years after we started

415
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,918
the experiment and that's because we

416
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,400
just have a lot of variability in those

417
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,919
plots so my suggestion here is that this

418
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,159
is related or is important when we're

419
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,320
talking about long-term studies this is

420
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:35,880
something that you would have never seen

421
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,319
if you would have stopped this study

422
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,320
after about five or six years and so

423
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:41,879
these are some of the reasons that I

424
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,639
think that we should actually have

425
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,919
long-term studies because some of these

426
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,679
differences don't show up until much

427
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:52,559
later so to recap this section of my

428
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:55,038
talk green mans together with ay milch

429
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:58,000
and Corporation can maintain yields

430
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:59,279
about 80% of those when you actually

431
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,720
apply

432
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,399
uh the manure so that's

433
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,480
important despite improvements in yield

434
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,200
soil organic matter and bulk density

435
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,759
continuous application of relatively low

436
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,960
levels of manure can lead to excessive

437
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,599
levels of potassium and phosphorus and

438
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,200
of course that's a bad thing so it's a

439
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:21,879
mixed bag so basically what we want to

440
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,279
do next with these plots is we want to

441
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,520
reverse the treatments so we want to

442
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:29,038
take the high input plots and start

443
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:31,359
treating them as low input plots trying

444
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:33,359
to draw down the phosphorus and

445
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,719
potassium levels and we want to take

446
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:40,319
blow input plots and start

447
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:43,480
applying composted or aged manure but

448
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:45,639
then stop at an a normal level of

449
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,319
potassium phosphorus and try to manage

450
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:51,640
those particular plots only with green

451
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:53,599
mans and an occasional addition of uh

452
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,880
regular um

453
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,599
manures so next I'm going to talk a

454
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,039
little bit about alternatives to

455
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:03,918
Plastics and um I want you to remember

456
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:05,480
that I talked about hay and hay mulches

457
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,159
and that will come up here in a little

458
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,200
bit again and so I just want to make

459
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:11,159
sure that you you're on board with me on

460
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,319
this one so we're going to talk about

461
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:16,760
alternative containers so we I was part

462
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:19,839
of a specialty crops research initiative

463
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:21,679
project uh where we studied 10 different

464
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,918
biodegradable containers that were

465
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,400
either on the market or were poised to

466
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,960
be on the market in the United States

467
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,360
and so we actually tested these test 10

468
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,919
different um containers regular control

469
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:40,279
plastic a bioplastic choire um this is

470
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:42,679
the Comm uh our compost pot this is a a

471
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:44,960
wood pulp this is what's called a bio

472
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:47,600
sleeve it's made out of uh also a

473
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:51,279
biodegradable plastic this is a rice

474
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:53,319
hole both slotted and solid rice Hole uh

475
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:55,599
this is made with rice holes and

476
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:58,439
basically a wax and it's pressed

477
00:20:55,599 --> 00:21:00,759
together we have a straw pot that's made

478
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,200
with with rice straw and then we also

479
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:07,400
have a Peete pot and so those are the

480
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,400
different pots that were used in this

481
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,600
study so uh one thing that I want to

482
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,880
show you is that there were actual

483
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:17,278
differences in growth when we grew

484
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,919
plants in these biopods or these

485
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:22,359
alternative containers uh one big

486
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,759
difference that we saw is right here

487
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:27,959
that the control actually had slightly

488
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:31,400
lower levels of growth than some of

489
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:34,038
these bi pots and I'll I'll get in a

490
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,640
minute here about why that could be but

491
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:39,038
uh really what I want you to note is

492
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:42,320
that the straw pot and the sleeve had

493
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:46,000
some of the highest um biomass

494
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:48,000
production uh in these different pots um

495
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,839
one of the things that people sometimes

496
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,359
say well that could be because these

497
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:54,240
pots had different volumes you have

498
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:55,759
different volumes of media and so that's

499
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,759
why you might get different levels of

500
00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:00,038
growth well when we first started this

501
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:02,519
experiment we actually measured the

502
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:04,038
amount of media we put in each pot so

503
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:07,639
all of the plants were growing in the

504
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:09,440
same volume of media so even if the pot

505
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:14,360
was a little bit taller you had the same

506
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:16,919
amount of of actual um media in it um

507
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:20,278
what we think is going on here is this

508
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:21,799
straw pot and this sleeve this sleeve

509
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:24,919
does not have a

510
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:27,879
bottom and what I think is going on here

511
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:30,080
is additional ariation so these drain

512
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:33,080
better the the same thing with the straw

513
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:35,678
pot it is very very open to the air and

514
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:37,278
so the media dries out much more quickly

515
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,400
and I think this warrants some more

516
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:41,880
investigation because even for plastic

517
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,519
pots if that's the case maybe there

518
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,200
should be more holes in a plastic pot

519
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:48,720
I'm not saying if that's true or not but

520
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,360
if that's the case you could actually

521
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,720
minimize the amount of plastic you

522
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:55,558
actually put in a pot and still get good

523
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,400
or better production and so that's

524
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:59,359
something that I think came out of this

525
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,360
research is that there's the possibility

526
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:04,918
that maybe Iration is really key to

527
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:07,319
increased biomass by the way the crop we

528
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:10,080
grew right here is new guine impatients

529
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:11,879
so this is a a floriculture crop and

530
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:13,918
this was all done in the

531
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,600
greenhouse the next thing that I want to

532
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,520
show you is uh we check for pH

533
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:20,879
differences Within These different uh

534
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:24,038
pots and media we use the pour through

535
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,400
method and the result of that was that

536
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:29,679
the dairy manure which you would expect

537
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,320
to have a higher pH actually a higher pH

538
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,600
throughout the study so these are

539
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:35,918
averages over the whole study so these

540
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:38,399
are pH averages over the whole study and

541
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:42,480
we notice that the dairy manure actually

542
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,640
had higher pH now you could expect that

543
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,360
because if you use the PO through method

544
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,520
you're actually going to leech some of

545
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:50,719
that composted Dairy manure that makes

546
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:53,400
up that pot into your leech aate so

547
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,278
that's probably why we have a slightly

548
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,559
higher pH in those spots but it's also

549
00:23:56,278 --> 00:24:02,038
probably why we have a slightly lower

550
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:03,879
ph&amp; PE pots again you rinse it you leech

551
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:06,400
it through the pot it's going to make a

552
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,360
difference so if this really makes an

553
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,159
difference or an impact on the actual

554
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:13,719
growth we doubt that it's probably more

555
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:15,679
an artifact of actually how we measured

556
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,640
um ECM

557
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:21,240
pH the next thing that I want you to

558
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,679
know is that these pots have different

559
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:27,120
ability to hold up during production and

560
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:28,759
so what we did is we took containers

561
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,158
after we were done with production ction

562
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:33,359
we emptied them and we actually measured

563
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:36,360
how much force it will take to penetrate

564
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:38,439
the side of the pot to see how well they

565
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:39,439
disintegrate or how well they hold up

566
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,840
during

567
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:46,720
production the the the result of this

568
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:49,639
not not surprising is that plastic pots

569
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:53,480
hold up better than most other

570
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:56,679
alternative pots um and what we also see

571
00:24:53,480 --> 00:25:00,200
is that the dairy manure the cow pot and

572
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:02,919
this Jiffy pot or the PE pot they

573
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,640
disintegrate the most after about 6

574
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:07,720
weeks of production um when you try to

575
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,559
lift up these pots they basically fall

576
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,720
apart uh most of these studies were done

577
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:14,879
in shuttle trays and so these pots were

578
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,278
held together pretty well during

579
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:21,039
production but after production if you

580
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:21,038
try to lift them up they do tear

581
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:29,639
apart next thing again uh we're looking

582
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:32,119
at the the cow poot and and the uh Jiffy

583
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,880
pot which by the way are brand names but

584
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:39,038
this is compost of De manure and again a

585
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:42,480
Pete pot what we noticed is that we got

586
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:44,798
more alil growth on those pots than any

587
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,839
of the other pots in the study now the

588
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:50,839
only one uh the only other one is the

589
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:53,959
wood fiber pot and I want to draw your

590
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:56,439
attention to some things first of all I

591
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:59,278
want you to notice the idea that this

592
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:01,320
straw pot has more areation because it's

593
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:05,240
cross length straw and it's got lots of

594
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:08,158
openings the slot rice hole has slots so

595
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:10,038
it has more areation better drainage and

596
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,278
this biodegradable pot has better

597
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:15,519
drainage uh because it does not have a

598
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:17,599
bottom I also want you to focus in on

599
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:20,879
the idea that these two parts now have

600
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:23,038
come up twice with some cautionary notes

601
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:27,440
and that will get into how I actually

602
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:29,398
want to um try to wrap this this up so

603
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,159
the other thing that we did is we looked

604
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:35,359
at how easily can these pots actually be

605
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:37,120
Den nested how easily can they be used

606
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,599
in a production line where you actually

607
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:42,359
are trying to take the pots apart and

608
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:45,639
what we noticed is that some of these

609
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:48,759
pots the uh rice hle pots right down

610
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:51,159
here they are a lot easier to remove um

611
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:55,599
out of a stack than for

612
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:59,000
example uh this Jiffy pot and even the

613
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:02,038
control um plastic pot

614
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,079
so really what what I want to focus in

615
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:08,359
on is that these two pots actually are

616
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:10,359
very easily very easily handled the

617
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:13,519
other thing I want you to think about is

618
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:15,879
that this surface is very rough and that

619
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:17,599
makes these pots stick together and so

620
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,159
it makes it much more difficult to

621
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:21,918
actually handle these pots in production

622
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,278
uh

623
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:27,679
settings let's switch gears um we're

624
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:29,480
going to switch gears now we have had

625
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,720
the information about the biopods and

626
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:35,240
Greenhouse production now I'm going to

627
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:39,519
move on how do these pots behave when

628
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:41,599
they're planted in the actual field so

629
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:45,679
two pots that we didn't plant directly

630
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:48,439
in the field are this bioplastic one and

631
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,720
this uh rice hole pot because they are

632
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,240
actually supposed to be removed they are

633
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,120
compo compostable but they are not

634
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,558
supposed to be plantable so in this

635
00:27:55,119 --> 00:28:01,158
study we only use plants that can be

636
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:03,558
planted in the landscape and so that's

637
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:06,679
why there's a cross over these two that

638
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:09,398
are basically not part of the study the

639
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:12,798
big thing that I want you to see here is

640
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:15,000
really there's nothing to see um that

641
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:18,038
that's basically the result of all of

642
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,319
this um basically all of these plants if

643
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:23,960
you plant them together with their pot

644
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:26,439
into the field and you compare it to a

645
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,399
pot a plastic pot that has been removed

646
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,600
and the plant planted in the field you

647
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:33,278
get the same biomass production over a

648
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:35,278
season so really once they go in the

649
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:37,919
ground they grow just as well doesn't

650
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:41,480
matter which kind of pot you're talking

651
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:43,038
about um this is pot de composition at

652
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,278
the end of the season so at the end of

653
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:49,158
the season I had my graduate student dig

654
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:51,839
up all these pots take all the little

655
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:54,720
pieces of biopot she could still find

656
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:57,038
and feed it through a leaf area meter

657
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,720
and so she looked at how much of that

658
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:03,319
pot was still there

659
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:05,399
in in in the actual field or opposite

660
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:08,918
how much was still left over and you'll

661
00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:12,719
notice that the manure pot and even um

662
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:16,519
less so the the PE pot but the rice hole

663
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,759
pot um they have very little

664
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:21,558
decomposition so the rice hole has very

665
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:23,359
little decomposition the manure pod has

666
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:25,918
a lot of decomposition and again that's

667
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:27,558
related to the greenhouse study where I

668
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,519
actually talked about the idea that

669
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:31,319
these pot they fall apart after about 6

670
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:34,880
to 8 weeks of

671
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:36,319
production so to recap all of this and I

672
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,120
know I'm going to run out of time and

673
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:41,558
I'm going to try to uh run through this

674
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:44,678
a little bit more quickly to kind of

675
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:47,240
really um emphasize the main points of

676
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:49,919
all of this is that all of these parts

677
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:53,200
have pros and cons associated with them

678
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:56,480
so which one should you use well it all

679
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,840
depends on what you want so it all

680
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,720
depends on what you're ultimately

681
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:03,079
looking looking for if you're looking

682
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:05,278
for a pot that holds up well during um

683
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:07,480
mechanized production you would

684
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:09,640
gravitate towards a plastic or even a

685
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,200
rice hole pot because that can easily be

686
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,679
Den nested if you are looking for a

687
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,120
retail setting you may want to stay away

688
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,919
from a jiffy or a Pete or the Pete or

689
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:21,158
the dairy manure pot because it has a

690
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:23,440
lot of algae growing on it and it's

691
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:25,840
unsightly so it all depends on

692
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,640
ultimately what you want to do uh with

693
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:28,839
these pots where you want to go with

694
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,320
these

695
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:33,240
pots the other thing that I think is

696
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:35,119
important just the same we have

697
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,319
controlled release fertilizers that are

698
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:39,038
used in horiculture I think we should

699
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:43,038
have something that is akin to

700
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:45,079
controlled release uh pots and basically

701
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:47,480
we should basically Market these pots

702
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:50,558
based on how long they hold up in the

703
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,679
greenhouse and so I can Envision a pot

704
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:54,960
that would be a sixe pot versus a three

705
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:56,639
Monon pot pot and they would be

706
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,960
different materials and structured

707
00:30:56,638 --> 00:31:01,240
differently so that you know what you're

708
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,079
growing and you know how long that pot

709
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:07,440
is supposed to hold up and plastic still

710
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:09,798
rules for the main reason that is just

711
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,798
easy to use it's got a lot of attributes

712
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:14,679
that really work well for it the next

713
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:17,918
thing I want to talk about is

714
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:20,000
mulches um we did some studies um and

715
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,559
what this picture is showing is a wool

716
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,839
mulch so I told you before that we have

717
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:28,240
a holistic approach to our organic farm

718
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:31,480
so we're trying to use on Farm resour

719
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,038
sources um as mulches and so in this

720
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,200
study where we looked at different

721
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:38,000
mulches we thought what does the farm

722
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,639
have to offer that we can use as mulches

723
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,480
well we're grow we we are raising sheep

724
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:46,599
so we have to Shear these sheep every

725
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,798
Every Spring that wool does not make M

726
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:51,879
much money that there's just not a lot

727
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:54,038
of money in Wool so we actually thought

728
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:57,000
we could use it as a mulch the same

729
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:59,558
thing with hay the farm generates hay

730
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,240
for the Sheep in the wintertime so what

731
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:05,119
did we do we started using hay Mulch and

732
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,120
then the last one is leaf litter we have

733
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:09,798
wood lots that are part of our organic

734
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:13,239
farm and so we collected Leaf

735
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:16,000
litter um we set up an experiment um

736
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:19,519
again it's a a randomized design uh we

737
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,798
had seven different treatments two were

738
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:26,038
plastic basically plastic mulch uh we

739
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:28,599
had that in two areas a 10x 20 and a 20x

740
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:31,919
20 area the main reason for that is we

741
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:33,759
wanted to know if um in the middle of

742
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,399
those plots if we still got enough

743
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:38,679
moisture to actually grow a pepper and

744
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:42,079
so that's why we had these two different

745
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:44,080
sizes of plastic mulch we also used hay

746
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:46,720
waste wool Leaf litter and then hand

747
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:50,439
weeding and no weeding at

748
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:54,720
all really the result of all of this is

749
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:57,120
marketable yields in plastic are high

750
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,519
but we can get comparable yields with

751
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:00,199
hay mulch

752
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:02,599
so that's what this is showing is

753
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:06,960
basically that hay mulch gives you

754
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:06,959
comparable uh yields to plastic

755
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:12,119
mulches the interesting thing about this

756
00:33:09,638 --> 00:33:15,798
is that this by the way I want you to

757
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:17,558
note that the it's 67 to 76 uh degrees

758
00:33:15,798 --> 00:33:19,879
on on this axis just to show the

759
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:21,798
differences a little bit more clearly

760
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,639
but clearly plastic is going to have

761
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:27,240
higher temperatures um whereas hay had

762
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:29,519
much lower temperatures and that is just

763
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,240
the result of inherent result of of

764
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,319
those materials and then the last thing

765
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:36,440
that I want to show you is that the

766
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:39,278
moisture content under plastic was much

767
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,360
lower than under hay and even wool and

768
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:44,000
this wool is something that we've seen

769
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:46,479
over and over again is that we see much

770
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,880
higher soil moisture under wool than we

771
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,440
see in any other Mulch and this is not

772
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,480
just in this study we've done some

773
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,759
others work that we show the same thing

774
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,120
now there are some problems with wool

775
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:01,000
but really basically what I want want to

776
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:02,558
say is that on Farm resources can

777
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,720
substitute for plastic mulches

778
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:06,398
specifically

779
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,240
hay and hay has the additional benefit

780
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:11,199
remember back to when I first started

781
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:13,439
the talk you can use it as a mulch but

782
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,638
you can also use it for fertility so you

783
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,398
have a double kind of thing that you can

784
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:18,878
get out of hay you can use it as

785
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:21,159
something that is actually Incorporated

786
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:23,838
in the soil you can also use it as as a

787
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:26,320
mulch and wool has a potential as a

788
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:28,679
perennial mulch because one of the

789
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,879
things it does not do is degrade very

790
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:33,559
easily at the end of the season you have

791
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:35,319
as almost as much wool left as you do in

792
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:37,960
the beginning of the season and it's

793
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:40,440
really really thick and so I think it

794
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,000
has potential for actually a perennial

795
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,119
mulch uh because it just doesn't degrade

796
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,599
very rapidly it takes many many years

797
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,559
and we actually have to clear it off the

798
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:53,280
plots before we till it because it's it

799
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:56,119
gets bound up in the tiller um again

800
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,320
Plastics come out ahead mostly because

801
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:02,559
of the price if you think think about

802
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,240
hay applying about 5 tons of hay per

803
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:06,279
acre of vegetable production we're

804
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:09,319
talking about a lot of hay hey that can

805
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:11,599
be sold or used as animal feed um so

806
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,838
we're talking about a very high cost

807
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,280
again there's some drawbacks associated

808
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:18,880
with some of these uh

809
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:22,119
Alternatives some other work that I've

810
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:25,000
done um at the organic farm includes

811
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:27,800
some work with uh green beans and

812
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,800
control of Mexican bean beet with a bio

813
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:34,440
ological called um pedius fulus I've

814
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,320
done some work on solarization in West

815
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,599
Virginia which actually works which is

816
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,800
kind of neat we've done some work with

817
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:43,800
water inclusion in season extension and

818
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,960
we've also done some work on transplant

819
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,599
production uh specifically transplant

820
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,039
production for organic production all

821
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:53,559
right

822
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:55,679
this um I'll TR I'm sorry if I'm going

823
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:58,358
over a little bit I'll I'll try

824
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:59,799
to okay all right I I'm just want to

825
00:35:58,358 --> 00:36:03,400
make sure that if people have to leave

826
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:05,760
that I'm done so um so the other thing

827
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,318
is the organic farm and

828
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,160
education and over the years we've had

829
00:36:08,318 --> 00:36:13,719
about uh 40 interns that have interned

830
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:16,679
at the farm and learned about organic

831
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:20,078
production techniques we just recently

832
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:23,519
got a a a retired Professor retired

833
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:26,119
faculty member donate $25,000 a year for

834
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:28,440
a an internship program and so we now

835
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:29,920
have about six or seven interns every

836
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,119
year that can help us out with the

837
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,159
research a lot of the research that I've

838
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:36,358
shown you was done on kind of a Sho

839
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:39,078
string budget and a lot of it was done

840
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:42,440
with undergraduate researchers um and

841
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:44,280
that's one of the I guess U there's a

842
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,599
benefit to that to the student but for

843
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,319
me it's sometimes difficult to find the

844
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:52,640
consistency in data collection and so

845
00:36:49,318 --> 00:36:54,719
forth but uh we have two majors that

846
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:57,598
link up with the organic farm very

847
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:59,598
closely horiculture and agroecology and

848
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,519
so we do have these two

849
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:05,000
majors um we do have the organic farm

850
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:07,519
internship program and we run a winter

851
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,358
CSA and a summer CSA and it's a pretty

852
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:13,719
small CSA but it still generates about

853
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:17,440
$88,000 for the farm uh the winter CSA

854
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:20,358
and the summer CSA or 20we csas um we we

855
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,200
ask for about 20 $25 a week so we

856
00:37:20,358 --> 00:37:26,239
generate about 8 to

857
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:29,000
$10,000 um we also started looking into

858
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:31,519
um wholesale production

859
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,119
um because we've so far we've really the

860
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:37,639
farm has focused very much on local

861
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:40,440
production local markets CSA and so

862
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:41,759
forth uh we wanted to venture out into

863
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,599
something that is a little bit more

864
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:48,200
wholesale and so we've contracted with a

865
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:51,039
company in Virginia Appalachian Harvest

866
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:53,159
uh to take uh any butternut squash that

867
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:55,759
we produce on the farm that meets their

868
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:57,719
standards and as part of that effort we

869
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,359
actually had to get Gap certification

870
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:02,000
and we're going actually go through the

871
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:03,598
process of Gap certification now and the

872
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,920
really neat thing about that is is

873
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,200
students actually can be involved in The

874
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,400
Organic certification process but now

875
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:11,799
also in the Gap certification process

876
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,480
which is really important if you're

877
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,240
going to do any production that you're

878
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:19,079
trying to sell wholesale because most

879
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:22,118
suppliers most um aggregators will

880
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:25,519
actually require that your Gap

881
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:27,720
certified um future directions for the

882
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:29,759
work at WVU

883
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:33,159
uh first of all

884
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,760
tillage uh really what I want to look at

885
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:39,759
is um no till or low till vegetable

886
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,960
production and I want to compare that to

887
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,920
Conventional tillage and see how these

888
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:46,358
soils that we've built up over the years

889
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,800
with this High soil organic matter this

890
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:51,318
low bulk density how are those soils

891
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,880
going to behave under different tillage

892
00:38:51,318 --> 00:38:54,400
systems so that's where we're going to

893
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,079
go with that work so it's going to

894
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,680
continue that long-term uh work the

895
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:00,880
other thing thing that I want to look at

896
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:03,318
is mulches a little bit more

897
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,838
specifically these on Farm resources and

898
00:39:03,318 --> 00:39:07,960
how we can best use them and we

899
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,719
definitely want to expand the CSA and

900
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:12,119
Entrepreneurship options and the

901
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:14,879
university is really keen on the idea to

902
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:19,800
get students exposed to entrepreneurship

903
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:22,200
so one of the um key pillars of WVU is

904
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,280
prosperity and so the university is

905
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:26,919
really pushing the idea of creating

906
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:29,640
entrepreneurs on campus that can that go

907
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:32,920
back to communities and actually start

908
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:36,078
businesses and so uh we will definitely

909
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:38,639
emphasize this um and then the last

910
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:41,400
thing that I think we don't do enough is

911
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:44,039
actually measure the educ the impact of

912
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,920
educational methods so what does what is

913
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:49,960
the impact of these csas of these

914
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:54,240
student clubs on uh the learning and

915
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:56,318
teaching at a university so keys to

916
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:58,879
undergraduate education at

917
00:39:56,318 --> 00:40:01,000
Wu goes anywhere from undergraduate

918
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,800
research which by the way stretches

919
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,519
limited funding so I can often times

920
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,440
find students that get in interested and

921
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:10,318
excited about a project and I can get

922
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,440
them for credit to help me out with my

923
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:15,440
research so that's one way that I

924
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:17,159
stretch my very very limited funding

925
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,039
plus the students gets exposure to

926
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:21,078
research and oftentimes they go on to

927
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:25,318
graduate school either at w or somewhere

928
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:27,680
else independent studies all not all of

929
00:40:25,318 --> 00:40:30,318
the projects students do are research

930
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:32,759
projects I try to encourage projects

931
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:35,039
Beyond just research projects more

932
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,079
demonstration or just to teach them

933
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:39,838
certain techniques and that's something

934
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:43,079
that we do independent studies we grow 7

935
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:45,400
or 800 point sias every fall we grow a

936
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:47,599
bunch of hanging baskets in the spring

937
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:50,599
and students actually get exposure to

938
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:54,160
some of those um uh some of those uh

939
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:57,838
things that way and then clubs uh clubs

940
00:40:54,159 --> 00:41:00,598
can be a key to education it's a great

941
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:02,759
way to um instill a sense of

942
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:04,480
Entrepreneurship because clubs are often

943
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,839
times in fundraising mode if they want

944
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,960
to travel somewhere and so it's a great

945
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:12,078
way to kind of combine these two

946
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,599
together last one is internships U

947
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,599
internships both on the farm the WV

948
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:18,838
organic farm but also outside of the

949
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:21,599
farm are key to a really good

950
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:21,599
undergraduate

951
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,400
education um I have a couple more

952
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,200
minutes uh what I want to do is I want

953
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,358
to introduce a few of my colleagues so

954
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:33,838
if there is any interest beyond what

955
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:36,239
I've talked about in the audience I just

956
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:39,799
want to focus you in on what some of the

957
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:43,000
other people are doing at WVU so Kang

958
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,599
moku right up here he's a new faculty me

959
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,599
member he's an assistant professor he's

960
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:48,838
been with us for about a year he's

961
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:51,838
working on glucosinolates mostly

962
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:53,960
broccoli um but also some other uh

963
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:56,480
plants and looking at

964
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,559
neutraceuticals Michael Genson right

965
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,440
here he's also o new has been hired

966
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:03,759
within the last year and a half he uh is

967
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,599
very interested in plan biochemistry

968
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,200
specifically turpino

969
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,559
biosynthesis uh we have Nicole Waterland

970
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:12,919
who's interested in Greenhouse

971
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:15,078
production does work with LEDs um also

972
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,720
has switched over some of our ornamental

973
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:21,680
work into vegetable production in Green

974
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:23,759
Houses uh David Davis uh Comes To Us by

975
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:28,558
way of uh Virginia Tech and he does

976
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:31,440
mostly teaching Lewis jet uh down here

977
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:34,240
he is uh hi tunnels and he does a lot of

978
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:38,519
work with hi tunnels in West Virginia

979
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:41,239
Jim cooton uh right here he uh actually

980
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:43,639
takes care of the sheep and the economic

981
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:46,598
crops on the organic farm and there's of

982
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:50,078
course many many others that have other

983
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:53,440
additional roles at at the organic farm

984
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:55,318
so to finish up um the take-home

985
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,519
messages the things that I really would

986
00:42:55,318 --> 00:43:01,119
like you to go home with today are

987
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:03,800
manure applications have clear benefits

988
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,800
and this is not rocket science um this

989
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,920
is something that you could have

990
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,880
probably guessed even without doing this

991
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,599
research but what I would would like to

992
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:17,760
note is that building soils can also

993
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:21,160
lead to excessive nutrients and so the

994
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,599
idea is that you really have to combine

995
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:25,279
these manure and compost applications

996
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,920
together with cover crops to really come

997
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,800
up with a good mix uh for vegetable

998
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,240
production Plastics are popular for a

999
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,039
reason and the Alternatives have very

1000
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:39,558
high standards to match if nothing else

1001
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:42,039
cost it is just very very cheap to lay

1002
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:46,359
down a layer of plastic and it is just

1003
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:48,800
much more expensive to use other um

1004
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:50,920
Alternatives so the other thing that I'd

1005
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,519
like you to remember is that some of

1006
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:56,000
these changes that we see not just in

1007
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:58,559
soil organic matter but also in bulk

1008
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,400
density are very very slow to

1009
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:05,079
materialize and so long-term studies are

1010
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,200
very very important uh to what we do in

1011
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:08,880
horiculture

1012
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:11,318
and like I said before more is not

1013
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,240
better when building soils and often

1014
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:17,279
times we still have Growers that will

1015
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:20,159
not necessarily test their soil and so

1016
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,680
this is again basically saying soil

1017
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:25,838
tests are key to good fertility

1018
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:28,558
management um and then Plastics in many

1019
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:29,799
cases still re rule for good reason and

1020
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:32,359
then the last thing that I want to

1021
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:36,119
mention is these outer class experiences

1022
00:44:32,358 --> 00:44:38,639
outer class experiences are to me key to

1023
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:40,400
a good education and I think a lot of

1024
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:42,719
Education happens outside of the

1025
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:46,280
classroom not necessarily inside of the

1026
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:49,078
classroom and so internships clubs um

1027
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:51,640
any kind of independent study even

1028
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:54,839
though that could be considered a class

1029
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:58,159
is additional exposure to creativity

1030
00:44:54,838 --> 00:45:00,279
that I think is very important to Foster

1031
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:04,480
so with that I'm going to stop right

1032
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:08,319
here um that's my talk um I'll I'll

1033
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,318
entertain questions if you have

1034
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:18,199
any is there a threshold for the p&amp; K in

1035
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:21,358
the soil that creates an adverse um

1036
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:24,239
effect on yield not not we we were not

1037
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:27,318
reaching the high enough salt levels to

1038
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:29,399
affect yield but what we are doing is

1039
00:45:27,318 --> 00:45:32,199
basically those very high the potassium

1040
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:35,358
is not as big of an issue but phosphorus

1041
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:37,399
gentically become a pollutant and um so

1042
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:40,639
you know it could be a point source of

1043
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:43,720
pollution and so those levels that I

1044
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:46,118
showed you after 15 years are three

1045
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:48,799
times as high as what what would

1046
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:52,960
normally be good for production so

1047
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,960
they're way way higher than

1048
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:58,920
than oh um so I think part of developing

1049
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,480
a holistic organic farm is also

1050
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,559
selecting plant idiotypes that are

1051
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,960
suited to the system so I'm curious if

1052
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:07,359
the organic farm does any um ratty

1053
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:11,400
evaluations or any direct breeding for

1054
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:13,960
organic systems repeat question um so if

1055
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:18,760
there's any um breeding efforts at the

1056
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:20,358
farm um no we we we do not we we have

1057
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,240
one graduate student who's doing a

1058
00:46:20,358 --> 00:46:24,880
little bit of breeding work with quinoa

1059
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:27,879
uh but that's about the extent of any

1060
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,318
kind of breeding that we do and um I I I

1061
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,640
definitely have to say that that is

1062
00:46:29,318 --> 00:46:34,519
really important um the idea that you

1063
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:37,879
want to use varieties that are basically

1064
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:40,480
developed with Organic systems in mind

1065
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:42,559
uh we just started using certain of

1066
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,400
these varieties and just for consistency

1067
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:47,400
sake have stuck to a lot of these

1068
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:50,000
varieties but for example we do use a

1069
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,720
local variety West Virginia 63 that was

1070
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,119
developed at University that has some

1071
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:58,358
late blight and early blight resistance

1072
00:46:55,119 --> 00:47:01,200
um so we do try we just have not made

1073
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:03,440
any kind of major um inroads into any

1074
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:03,439
kind of

1075
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,920
reading you using irrigation on any of

1076
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
these

1077
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:14,400
plots um no and so uh the question was

1078
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,760
the question was um do we use any

1079
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:20,920
irrigation on these plots uh so for the

1080
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:23,280
long-term study uh we we do not

1081
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:25,800
consistently use irrigation and that's

1082
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:29,200
my best way of describing it uh some

1083
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:31,440
years we do a better job uh than other

1084
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:33,960
use and it all depends um again because

1085
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,400
we have undergraduate students uh that

1086
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:39,760
help us out and some years we can just

1087
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:43,559
do a better job of of that than I would

1088
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,559
assume you could control some

1089
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:52,039
that um the potassium for sure uh the

1090
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:54,679
phosphorus is probably bound um so that

1091
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:58,558
probably can not necessarily be leeched

1092
00:47:54,679 --> 00:48:00,838
as easily as the potassium um and there

1093
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:03,040
could be an argument be made for that

1094
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:04,838
very high level of phosphorus if you tie

1095
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:08,838
that together with organic matter that

1096
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:12,920
it is not as much of a pollutant as if

1097
00:48:08,838 --> 00:48:15,679
it was just in a a more mineral soil um

1098
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:17,639
anyway I'm I'm not going to necessarily

1099
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:22,480
make that case

1100
00:48:17,639 --> 00:48:22,480
but yeah U maybe maybe one more and

1101
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,639
then go ahead then we'll go to J so I

1102
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,960
was just wondering if you can talk a

1103
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:30,920
little bit more about the organic farm

1104
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,760
the structure the management is it a

1105
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:35,240
teaching Farm or research Farm or a

1106
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,800
student farm and then also does the The

1107
00:48:35,239 --> 00:48:39,279
Organic Farm help you recruit more

1108
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,400
students are you attracting new students

1109
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:44,760
that wouldn't normally be interested in

1110
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:48,079
agriculture so the farm is teaching and

1111
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:50,319
education but a lot

1112
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:54,318
of so is there a

1113
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:57,480
manager no it's me

1114
00:48:54,318 --> 00:49:00,400
okay no we do not we have a Farm worker

1115
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:04,798
that does the Mowing and all the other

1116
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:07,798
stuff is run by me and Dr Co and we

1117
00:49:04,798 --> 00:49:10,920
manage the interns uh we manage

1118
00:49:07,798 --> 00:49:13,119
everything that happens at that farm uh

1119
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:16,039
it really we we Tred to generate some

1120
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:18,680
funds to go back into that internship uh

1121
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:21,519
so we do run that CSA we do sell a

1122
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:23,279
little bit to farmers markets we've been

1123
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:27,000
really reluctant to sell to farmers

1124
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:29,839
markets because um we we often times s

1125
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,719
get complaints that we um compete with

1126
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:35,358
local producers and that's something

1127
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:37,239
that I haven't heard here um as I've

1128
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:39,519
been talking to people but we do get

1129
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:43,358
that that's a little bit of an issue for

1130
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:45,039
us so what was the other so does are

1131
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:47,078
students are you attracting students

1132
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:49,480
because of the organic farm and and does

1133
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:51,480
it do you use it as a recruitment tool

1134
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:54,280
yes we we do use it as a recruitment

1135
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:56,400
tool and agroecology that's the major

1136
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,640
that this is closely tied to even though

1137
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,240
we a lot of the students that intern are

1138
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:04,199
also verticulture students uh when we

1139
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:06,159
bring students on campus uh this is

1140
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:09,159
something that is definitely highlighted

1141
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:10,879
as something that we have on hand for so

1142
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:14,399
yes it's definitely used in recruiting

1143
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:17,960
efforts mostly tied to Agri ecology and

1144
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,960
that Greenhouse is more used to um to

1145
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,760
recruit horiculture

1146
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:25,240
students so before we quickly go to

1147
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:28,599
Geneva I do have been leaving that there

1148
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:31,199
is a lunch uh for Gra students um

1149
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:34,359
starting very soon on the third floor in

1150
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:36,798
the conference room 336 so you know any

1151
00:50:34,358 --> 00:50:38,639
graduate students are welcome anything

1152
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:42,880
quickly from

1153
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:46,838
Geneva oh IIs Thomas

1154
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:48,519
ra figes so I wonder if you could speak

1155
00:50:46,838 --> 00:50:50,159
a little bit to the nitrogen budget

1156
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:52,440
going forward are you looking at

1157
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:55,159
producing more of the nitrogen in the

1158
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:57,760
plts themselves or elsewhere on the farm

1159
00:50:55,159 --> 00:51:00,399
to try to balance out that

1160
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:03,599
yeah yes so the the big thing is going

1161
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:06,880
to be we need to get a better handle on

1162
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,359
how much nitrogen is in that hay and

1163
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,559
that would be our

1164
00:51:08,358 --> 00:51:14,239
first that would be the way we we would

1165
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:17,720
grow the CLE crops the green

1166
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:21,959
maners measure how much uh nitrogen

1167
00:51:17,719 --> 00:51:25,838
we're fixing there and then fill in with

1168
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:28,920
um mostly the the hay as an additional

1169
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:31,480
level of of nitrogen and then only as a

1170
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:34,559
last resort if we need basically

1171
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:36,798
phosphorus I go to the mans so that that

1172
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:39,680
would be kind of the level and we would

1173
00:51:36,798 --> 00:51:42,719
try to meet what are basically kind of

1174
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:45,639
standard uh you know levels of nitrogen

1175
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:48,078
that you would want to apply to uh

1176
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:49,558
vegetables now the problem that we

1177
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,318
sometimes have is how much of that

1178
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:55,760
nitrogen is actually available to that

1179
00:51:51,318 --> 00:51:57,798
crop versus how much is held over and

1180
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:01,200
that that's a whole research question

1181
00:51:57,798 --> 00:52:04,400
but I I think we would try to uh manage

1182
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:06,639
most of most of it by uh cover crops by

1183
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:09,960
uh

1184
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:13,879
leges great wellan thank you very much

1185
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,880
and if we could all give him a

1186
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:21,440
round this has been a production of

1187
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:24,440
Cornell University on the web at

1188
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,440
