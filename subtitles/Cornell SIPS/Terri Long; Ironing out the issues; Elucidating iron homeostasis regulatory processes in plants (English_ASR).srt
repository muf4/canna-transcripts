1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:10,259
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:12,150
University so thank you for that nice

3
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:13,439
introduction Atlanta and thank you and

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,059
even for inviting me and thank you all

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,278
for talking with me today I've had a

6
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,480
great time talking with faculty and I'm

7
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,899
looking forward to talking to students

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,880
soon so as Elena says my study iron

9
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:25,890
homeostasis in plants and the reason why

10
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:27,570
I study it is because I under p2c

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,149
induced anemia is the most prevalent

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,109
nutritional disorder in the world

13
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:33,179
approximately 30 percent of a global

14
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,309
population suffers from anemia due to

15
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:37,170
iron deficiency and most people obtain

16
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:39,299
their iron from plants due to

17
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,070
socio-economic and religious reasons and

18
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:42,689
so plants can suffer from iron

19
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,340
deficiency but what we want to try to do

20
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:46,409
is figure out why they sell for how they

21
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,629
suffer and how can we manipulate those

22
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:50,459
responses to produce plants that contain

23
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:52,769
more iron or tolerate low iron

24
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,420
conditions and so in response to iron

25
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,850
deficiency they in Diego intervene or

26
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,739
chlorosis and in my favorite plant

27
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,929
rabbit obsessed Aliannah you can see in

28
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:04,048
addition to that dramatic changes in

29
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:06,478
root growth and development as well iron

30
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,640
is in and it's doing this because it is

31
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:09,810
essential for many processes including

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,900
both photosynthesis and respiration

33
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,868
where iron is involved in in complexes

34
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,920
and iron super complexes for for these

35
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:22,200
processes and so in response to iron

36
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,250
deficiency plants depending upon what

37
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,109
type of play we're talking about they

38
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,569
can and you go to different mechanism

39
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:28,140
strategy one response in a strategy to

40
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:30,569
response

41
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,659
dicots like a rabid abscess will undergo

42
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:35,039
the strategy one response in deficiency

43
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,530
so the first thing they do is that they

44
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,280
pump protons into the rhizosphere using

45
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,560
this AHA - or related proteins on this

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,899
then lowers the pH and then making a net

47
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,149
mix on become more soluble so ferric

48
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,409
iron is actually the it actually is the

49
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,099
most prevalent is the fourth most

50
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,049
prevalent

51
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:54,239
a mineral in the Earth's crust and so

52
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,399
plants have to figure out a way to to

53
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:59,429
solubilize it very good and then reduce

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,379
very gyein to ferrous iron right so no

55
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,600
rabbit Oxus then this ferrous iron it is

56
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:05,310
is then transported into the epidermal

57
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,890
cells by the membrane localized

58
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,759
transporter IRT one and then it travels

59
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,330
from the epidermis into the best feature

60
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:19,120
eliminates moves from

61
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:21,160
I shooted Asylum one thing that we don't

62
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,450
really recognize Allah or that we that

63
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:24,549
we're just now starting to understand is

64
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:26,519
what's happening inside of specific cell

65
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:29,680
types for example we know that they are

66
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,450
our aid updates that are prevalent there

67
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,909
are prevalent insight in specific cell

68
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:35,439
types for example we know that fruit 3

69
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:37,479
is involved in reducing iron in the

70
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,969
mitochondria the Koshien amine is

71
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:41,409
involved in producing a type of molecule

72
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:43,180
called eco she an amine that will bind

73
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:45,430
to iron in the floor so we'll say this

74
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,890
movement as if one for example is

75
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,980
another important protein involved in

76
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:52,419
facilitating the movement of the cushion

77
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:54,189
so there's a lot that's going on not

78
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:57,969
only at the epidermis but also in more

79
00:02:54,189 --> 00:02:59,620
internal cell types so when I started

80
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:02,650
working on this project when I was a

81
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,390
postdoc we knew for example that fit was

82
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,060
a key ba Chile's transcription factor

83
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:09,219
that controlled activity of those three

84
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,370
genes that I told you about at the very

85
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:14,560
beginning so AHA - ro - ir t1 are all

86
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,640
controlled by FID and so what I was

87
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,199
interested in is trying to figure out

88
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:18,849
what's what are some of the other key

89
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,929
players in regulating the iron

90
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:25,030
deficiency response so to try to address

91
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,129
this question and we did a lot of

92
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,439
microarray analysis so micro analysis

93
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:31,680
was the hot thing to do back when I was

94
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,909
opposed to act now it's hard AC in

95
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,739
proteomics and but this is the this is

96
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:38,739
the tool that we use in the lab and so

97
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:40,150
we developed a time course of the iron

98
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:42,730
deficiency response we're looking at

99
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:45,459
whole roots between 0 and 72 hours of

100
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:46,959
exposure time deficiency and then we saw

101
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:49,719
that it was a major shift happening at

102
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,280
the 24 hour time point so then we slice

103
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:54,219
the root up into specific developmental

104
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,430
zones and then check the mid microarray

105
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:58,900
analysis and then we looked at specific

106
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,390
cell types so we use fluorescence

107
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,099
activated that yeah so we use

108
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:04,929
fluorescence activated cell sorting

109
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:07,569
which allowed us to isolate specific

110
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,969
cell types that had been exposed to iron

111
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:12,069
deficient conditions so that what we

112
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:15,250
could come up with is one is the highest

113
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:17,560
resolution transcriptional profile of a

114
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,959
plant root in response to iron

115
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,339
deficiency stress and from that my next

116
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,079
goal was to identify putative

117
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:24,519
transcription factors and use the

118
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:26,349
reverse genetics approach to try to

119
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:27,099
figure out do they play a key role in

120
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,140
mistress

121
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,200
and from that approach we identified two

122
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:36,310
genes which I'll which is kind of from

123
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:38,500
the basis of my lab to this day one of

124
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:41,680
them we identified and we named Popeye

125
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,990
so Papa mutants showed decrease on

126
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,329
reductase activity and decreased ability

127
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,730
to acidify the rhizosphere so this is

128
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:50,609
called a bromo Chris all purple sa so

129
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:53,439
basically as I said before roots will

130
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,990
protons into the rhizosphere and we can

131
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,899
image that the pumping of the protons

132
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,750
that change in pH on this pH indicator

133
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:03,039
media alright so in contrast a wild-type

134
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,810
I hope we can see it

135
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,870
Popeye maybe show decreased surprises

136
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:11,500
for your certification when we go a

137
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:13,269
papaya mutant on th526 that's pretty

138
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,120
good but when we grow it on elevated pH

139
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:18,310
in which iron is for these fully

140
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,509
biologically available we see that the

141
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,850
plants will germinate but they won't

142
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:23,409
work for beyond donation so this is

143
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,870
another example of the iron deficiency

144
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,560
response decreased tolerance the iron

145
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,980
deficiency

146
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,459
however surprisingly I pop on mutants

147
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,379
Ellen

148
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:35,169
Exhibit D create an increasing the

149
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:37,480
amount of iron both in the root end in

150
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:39,670
the chute so this suggests that there is

151
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,500
a disconnect between the actual ability

152
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:43,990
to uptake iron and the ability to sense

153
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,939
and utilize it so Popeye is playing some

154
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:50,439
sort of role in disrupting the ability

155
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:52,120
to sense an ability to utilize iron so

156
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:53,709
to try to gain insight into how it might

157
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,470
be doing it in the molecular mechanisms

158
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:59,139
of how Popeye functions well recently

159
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:01,570
we've looked at the looked at the

160
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:03,399
dynamics at Popeye's activity so I'm a

161
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:05,920
very talented student a graduate student

162
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:09,969
DeRusha wire mohamed teamed up with ross

163
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,960
suits ani to look at the dynamics so we

164
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,760
know that pop I will make a

165
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,859
transcriptional fusion it's expressed

166
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:16,480
predominantly in the vasculature you're

167
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,610
pretty much seen in vasculature that's

168
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,990
it when we look at a translational

169
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,340
fusion where we can look at the protein

170
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,069
we can actually see that the protein

171
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:25,359
seems to be localized in all cell types

172
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:27,339
alright so this suggests that the

173
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,410
protein moves from the best future to

174
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:31,259
all of the cell types so we teamed up

175
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,400
with rod sassani to do scanning

176
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:36,189
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy

177
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,599
coupled with pair coalition function so

178
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:39,250
basically this is a technique in which

179
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,540
we can take high resolution confocal

180
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,480
images

181
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:45,100
all right and then we can correlate the

182
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,610
signal that fluorescence intensity

183
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:51,010
across both time and space this provides

184
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,139
you with a carpet that allows you to see

185
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:56,050
if the protein is moving in between

186
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:58,629
cells so as is the case for this freely

187
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:01,270
diffusive GFP or not moving in between

188
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:04,300
cells as is the case for another mobile

189
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:07,629
protein that we call t mo v so as we can

190
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:09,280
see that Popeye is similar to free GFP

191
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:10,810
moves in between the cell types and

192
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:14,949
specifically it moves indeed from the

193
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:16,780
past future to the epidermis so knowing

194
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:17,829
that now the protein actually moves we

195
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:19,389
were interested in trying to figure out

196
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:22,120
what that movement meant for the

197
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:25,029
activity of Poppa so she cloned the

198
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,939
Popeye protein in front of vascular

199
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:30,279
specific or behinds a specific promoter

200
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:32,439
and any normal specific promoter and an

201
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:33,939
epidermal specific promoter and then we

202
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:35,740
identified lines and mister protein

203
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:37,689
stayed in those individual cell types

204
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,340
and then we also identified lines in

205
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:41,230
which the protein moved from say for

206
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:45,969
example the vasculature to the

207
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:48,340
endodermis or from the vasculature to

208
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:50,710
the cortex or from the epidermis to the

209
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:53,789
cortex and so then we wanted to see if

210
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:56,199
we actually express these proteins ones

211
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:58,439
especially proteins in a papaya mutant

212
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:00,849
background pretty compliment to function

213
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:02,800
and so so I'll walk you through this

214
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:06,010
really quickly so here is wall type

215
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,990
plants showing the and this is under on

216
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:10,060
deficient conditions so in the classic

217
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,829
risers for your certification all right

218
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,879
here's our papaya mutant show decrease

219
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:15,009
during a decrease rhizosphere

220
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,649
certification and poor growth under iron

221
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:20,379
deficient media and we can complement

222
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:22,479
those functions with the fully under its

223
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:24,579
native promoter but when we actually

224
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,740
look at some of the lines in which

225
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:28,779
proper moves from the vasculature to the

226
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,569
endodermis or stays in the vasculature

227
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:34,179
or stains in in the dermis the the

228
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:40,059
actual Popeye will continue to grow

229
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:41,500
poorly under however when we express it

230
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:44,199
we look at the lines in which papaya

231
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,539
either stays in the cortex and in the

232
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,430
dermis or is or stays in the epidermis

233
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:50,259
and roots of the cortex common thing

234
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:53,229
here is that the plants grow better

235
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:56,710
prepare to use so

236
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:58,720
suggests us that two things the growth

237
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:01,150
or a localization of Popeye within the

238
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,170
basket sir or any internal cells it's

239
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:03,850
harmful to the plant

240
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:05,679
whereas when we have it in the cortex

241
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,960
and the epidermis particularly the

242
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,549
epidermis the plant seems to grow better

243
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,690
so localization in the cortex is

244
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:14,799
essential for the function of the

245
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:17,020
protein hmm so to try to gain insight to

246
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:19,379
that we did this very well this looks

247
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:23,679
like a very complicated Venn diagram

248
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:25,629
after we did my RAC analysis of some of

249
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,699
our lines so we specifically were

250
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:28,960
interested in ones where prop I moved

251
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,330
from their baskets in the endodermis

252
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,250
from the cortex and amatuer vasculature

253
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,450
to the epidermis into the cortex we're

254
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,830
interested in trying to figure out what

255
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,810
is the transcriptional profile is it

256
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:40,509
different between the different lines

257
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:42,909
and we were actually able to identify a

258
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:46,179
significant number of genes that

259
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:49,299
exhibited a state change movie went from

260
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:51,309
off to on on off in lines for example in

261
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:53,289
which the protein move from vasculature

262
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:55,659
to the integers so this provides us with

263
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:57,610
a really exciting set of candidates that

264
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:59,469
might explain how Popeye does what it

265
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,490
does in specific cells how it's actually

266
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,440
able to do two different things

267
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,210
depending upon whether you have it in

268
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,880
the vasculature and endodermis or

269
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:08,889
whatever you have it in the cortex and

270
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:11,019
so that work is in preparation we're

271
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:15,370
writing that up now and hopefully we'll

272
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:16,629
get some reviews see so so that's well

273
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,759
that's the story that we're working on

274
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:19,960
in terms of Popeyes dynamics but study

275
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:22,000
that may lead you to the question of

276
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,220
okay it's moving between serotypes or

277
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,539
what is it to it so it's a beach at

278
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,490
least transcription factor based upon

279
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:29,019
homology so one of the first things we

280
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,340
did was look to see what are some of

281
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:33,009
this potential direct and indirect

282
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:34,750
targets using microarray analysis and we

283
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:36,549
see that many genes involved in iron

284
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:39,879
homeostasis as well as other precedents

285
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:41,620
for suzy's or just regulated Popeye

286
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:43,299
mutant background and what I want to

287
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,190
point out here is that zip through and

288
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:46,359
that some of the three three of the

289
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,740
genes that I pointed out at the very

290
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,450
beginning of the talk I actually

291
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:52,090
upregulated in a Popeye mutant

292
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:55,660
background so just pressing their

293
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:59,769
expression we then did ship shipped to C

294
00:10:55,659 --> 00:11:04,240
which is another old-school okay it's an

295
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:07,088
oldest technique that we that allows us

296
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,068
to identify the right now.we

297
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:11,079
least one hybrid analysis and other

298
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:13,240
various techniques but chip-chip allowed

299
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:14,888
us to identify the RIC targets and we

300
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,448
found that Papa seems to be directly

301
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:18,698
regulating genes involved in not only

302
00:11:16,448 --> 00:11:21,429
iron homeostasis but a variety of other

303
00:11:18,698 --> 00:11:23,438
processes including these three targets

304
00:11:21,429 --> 00:11:25,120
right here so these three targets so

305
00:11:23,438 --> 00:11:26,740
many known either my sister's genes are

306
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:32,019
upregulated and some of them are

307
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:34,180
directly targeted by pop so knowing that

308
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:36,429
Popeye's a transcription factor is a pH

309
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:40,269
LH protein we also know that most

310
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:42,128
beautiful teens for heterodimers it will

311
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:43,899
interact with other EH&amp;S proteins that

312
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:46,808
will help control its activity as a

313
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:48,669
transcription factor so we conducted a

314
00:11:46,808 --> 00:11:51,009
directed yeast two-hybrid analysis

315
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:54,308
looking at Popeye homologues that were

316
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:57,419
closely that that had close homology to

317
00:11:54,308 --> 00:12:00,789
pop so here you can see that the group

318
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:03,458
for they papa falls within the group B

319
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:05,889
category but then it actually interacts

320
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:07,268
with almost all the proteins you can't

321
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:09,579
really see 104 but it interacts with

322
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:12,938
luminol Falls also but it interacts with

323
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:16,599
several of the group for cbhe lish

324
00:12:12,938 --> 00:12:20,919
proteins including IL r 3 alright so I

325
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:25,420
let three shown here so we did biopsy

326
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:28,509
analysis to confirm that Popeye and il R

327
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:30,458
3 interact and they interact

328
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:32,470
specifically in the nucleus and we also

329
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,268
confirmed that Popeye interacts with

330
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,259
some of the other homologues that we

331
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:37,600
identified in our yeast two-hybrid

332
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:39,938
analysis so Popeye's transcription

333
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,409
factor arose many things I mean it

334
00:12:39,938 --> 00:12:45,698
interacts with Apapa homolog in the

335
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:49,169
nucleus so that leads to the question of

336
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:51,969
what is il R 3 doing so il R 3 is a

337
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:53,649
similar to Poppa as expressed so here is

338
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,928
a ghost's transcriptional fusion of il R

339
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:57,970
3 and a plus and minus sign is expressed

340
00:12:55,928 --> 00:12:59,379
specifically in the best feature but we

341
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,660
look at the protein it seems to be

342
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:04,389
localized in all cell types so similar

343
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:06,578
to Papa il R 3 is looks like it's a

344
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:09,028
mobile protein moves in a basket or to

345
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:10,729
all other cell types

346
00:13:09,028 --> 00:13:13,338
what's the phenotype

347
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:15,110
and efficiency so iíll are three mutants

348
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:17,300
showed decreased elements to iron

349
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,250
deficiency increase chlorosis and we

350
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:22,159
make a papaya three double mutant we see

351
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,328
a similar phenotype so the they do not

352
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:24,740
seem to be the mutants don't seem to be

353
00:13:23,328 --> 00:13:27,138
synergistic suggesting that they're part

354
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,089
of the same pathway we look at the

355
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,589
expression of ILR 3 and a pop I'm eating

356
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:32,930
background it seems to be elevated

357
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:35,649
suggesting that Papa might be upstream

358
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:38,120
of ILR 3 in facilitating its repression

359
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:39,679
however when we look at Co expression

360
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,629
analysis we see that Popeyes

361
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,120
co-expressed with many of them well

362
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:50,870
known on homeostasis genes including fro

363
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:52,429
3 pH 101 yeah it's 101 on ask for is if

364
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,828
when these are all well-known iron

365
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:57,379
homeostasis you pop is called regulating

366
00:13:54,828 --> 00:14:01,129
you but I Allah 3 is not co regulated

367
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:02,539
with this suggested that maybe aisle are

368
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:04,458
3 although it plays a role in ion

369
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:07,639
homeostasis it plays a role in something

370
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:12,189
else as well I mean so what is that's

371
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:15,230
something else well siobhan Grady and

372
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:17,269
Daniel even Stein had been doing a

373
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,100
really extensive yeast one high base

374
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:21,560
cream of still specific transcription

375
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,629
factors and they found that aisle are

376
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:25,129
three by instead of promoter of many

377
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:29,419
genes involved in Lucas enolate

378
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:31,159
synthesis right so over over half that a

379
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:32,990
transcription factors involved in the

380
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:35,000
synthesis of enzymes involved in good

381
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:38,870
sleep so this is are bound to a

382
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,389
controlled by il R 3 so we picked

383
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:43,039
several of the enzymes that were that

384
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:45,019
seem to be missing press both in Popeye

385
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,389
as well as il R 3 and check the

386
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:48,860
expression in the background of the

387
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:51,519
single mutants and the double mutants

388
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:54,709
and we indeed found that

389
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,000
Popeye seems to have the opposite effect

390
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:58,849
on the expression of these genes

391
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,980
compared to il R 3 so for example mam

392
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,209
one which is a key enzyme involved in

393
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,190
the first step in google assimilate

394
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:05,869
services and a pup I'm eating in a

395
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,790
Popeye mutant background if the

396
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,889
expression goes down compared to wall

397
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:12,379
fight but expression goes up and I allow

398
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:15,289
3b suggesting that Papa might be

399
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:17,059
involved in the activation of Man 1

400
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:19,578
whereas Isla 3 is involved in repression

401
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:22,518
of Man 1 so 2 seem to have opposing

402
00:15:19,578 --> 00:15:24,559
roles so then we teamed up with Daniel

403
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:27,409
Cleveland Stein who is the Google

404
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:30,588
guru and we measure google simulate

405
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:32,778
responses and the results were not as

406
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:35,209
clear but I wanted to I wanted to see

407
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:37,129
quickly up and down for a lot Korean

408
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:39,528
Papa what we did find is that there were

409
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:43,360
effects we thought that ila 3 did seem

410
00:15:39,528 --> 00:15:45,799
to grow up in both in the roots in both

411
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,970
defund it we found a Google silly did

412
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:50,299
seem to Gloria pandan Isle a three

413
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,649
mutant background in both a double use

414
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:53,359
as well as the individual movies

415
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:55,818
particularly in the group and we didn't

416
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,919
see his dramatic effect on a Papa mutant

417
00:15:55,818 --> 00:16:00,740
background we also saw that these

418
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:03,438
effects were somewhat iron-deficiency

419
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:06,049
dependent so this suggests that ILR 3

420
00:16:03,438 --> 00:16:08,629
and papa act to act in an opposing way

421
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:12,109
to modulate the synthesis of gooks and

422
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:13,819
leads under iron-deficiency to see this

423
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,490
had any biological and physiological

424
00:16:13,818 --> 00:16:18,110
relevance at all we teamed up with Eric

425
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:22,430
Davis who is a plant pathologist who

426
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:24,649
works on soybeans and so in which also

427
00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:26,539
effects of Robert OPS's plants so we

428
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:30,528
check the expression of I allow 3 with

429
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:32,389
our Gus lines in under plus and minus

430
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:34,129
iron at the same age places what we

431
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:36,079
normally used to look at measurements

432
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:38,509
look at sis infections and then we

433
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,338
infected both irons sufficient and iron

434
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:42,528
deficient plants or plants that have

435
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:45,350
been grown under these conditions to the

436
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:47,838
cyst nematode and we were able to see

437
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:49,550
that under iron sufficiency even we can

438
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,680
see an increase in the activity or an

439
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:53,688
expression of dialogue so this suggests

440
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,539
that somehow the system fiction induces

441
00:16:53,688 --> 00:16:59,269
the expression of these of this gene so

442
00:16:56,539 --> 00:17:02,299
then we measure Lee quantify the actual

443
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:03,799
infection of the cyst nematode of plants

444
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:06,980
that were exposed to both plus and minus

445
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:08,269
iron in both Papa mutant Isle are three

446
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,399
mutant and a double mutant background

447
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:14,119
and we found that indeed there was a

448
00:17:10,398 --> 00:17:15,889
decrease in the antenna in the ILR 3 and

449
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:16,969
a double mutant background suggesting

450
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,839
that the increase in the amount of

451
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,818
glucosinolates

452
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:21,828
contributes to the decreased infection

453
00:17:19,818 --> 00:17:23,688
of cyst nematode and we pick cyst

454
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:29,058
nematode because they're wounding

455
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:30,710
pathogens that because are wounding

456
00:17:29,058 --> 00:17:34,730
pathogens and glucosinolates are induced

457
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:40,400
in response to feel like i'm going

458
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:43,669
fast and go fast store down with it you

459
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:47,169
guys start at 12:20 right okay I'm used

460
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:47,169
to 12:30 in like 10 minutes

461
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:53,569
all right so so yes Popeye and I eloped

462
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,130
we seem to play this opposing role

463
00:17:53,569 --> 00:17:56,899
potentially a new facility synthesis

464
00:17:55,130 --> 00:18:00,590
perhaps in response to iron deficiency

465
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:04,490
and so the model that I published is

466
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:06,259
that Popeye controls ILR 3 and in Iowa 3

467
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:08,808
plays this role in both iron homeostasis

468
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:10,429
and in glucosinolates whereas Popeye is

469
00:18:08,808 --> 00:18:13,160
controlling other things in addition to

470
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:19,790
ILR 3 that plays an overall role in

471
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:21,980
higher on your faces so and it's kind of

472
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:23,210
illustrated here so at this point we

473
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,460
were able to add Popeye to this

474
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:28,340
regulatory network we knew that Popeyes

475
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:29,990
seems to be directly repressing genes

476
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:34,909
that play an own role in iron

477
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:37,039
homeostasis now we can add to this to

478
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:38,330
this network also that Popeye directly

479
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:43,909
interacts with several homologs

480
00:18:38,329 --> 00:18:46,159
including ILR 3 and we can also keep in

481
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,840
mind that Papa has a mobile protein that

482
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,390
plays a role in controlling iron ore

483
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:52,189
meiosis even though it's even though it

484
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:55,720
seems to disconnect the ability to sense

485
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:58,480
and utilize a tire that's inside a plant

486
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,100
and we add on

487
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,500
we layer onto the suspect that Popeye

488
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:04,000
seems to be repressing ILR 3 which plays

489
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,009
a role in replacing glucosinolate

490
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:12,490
synthesis so somehow this interplay

491
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:14,289
modulates efficiency so i've spent the

492
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:18,099
majority of this time talking about the

493
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:19,990
first thing but the second thing that we

494
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:22,209
identified during this initial screen

495
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:25,809
was a gene that we named brutus because

496
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:28,420
in contrast to Popeye Brutus mutants

497
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:30,399
grow better than wild-type under iron

498
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:33,610
deficient and Isha's so now we have

499
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,110
Brutus versus Popeye so in addition as

500
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:37,059
and as you can see here when you look at

501
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:38,799
Brice's for your certification we see a

502
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:40,720
dramatic increase in abilities to

503
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,129
acidify the rhizosphere which can help

504
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:48,460
to explain why the plants score better

505
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:52,140
and iron deficient so my graduate

506
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:55,269
student Rosalyn Samira made a Brutus

507
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:58,509
promoter Gus transcriptional Gus fusion

508
00:19:55,269 --> 00:20:00,519
and we can see that indeed the the gene

509
00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:03,879
seems to be induced in response to iron

510
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:05,650
deficiency when we look at the shoes

511
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,650
however it seems to be in our hands

512
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:10,480
consistently expressed look at floral

513
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,009
tissues and reproductive tissues we see

514
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,259
it as constitutive we see that it

515
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:15,789
specifically expressed and we also see

516
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:19,079
that the expression seems to fade out

517
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:21,039
over time as the leaves reach senescence

518
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:23,409
we were really intrigued by this

519
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,329
expression pattern and it suggested that

520
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:29,890
Buddha's might play some potential role

521
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:31,659
and loading iron into the seed and this

522
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,790
was particularly interesting because we

523
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:36,610
also know that they were embryo lethal

524
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:39,190
alleles of brutus all right so here are

525
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:41,379
some of our brutus alleles that we've

526
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:42,130
identified but some of the embryo lethal

527
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,490
alleles

528
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:46,120
suggested that perhaps this role you

529
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:48,279
know brutus

530
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:49,599
it is substantiative idea the critics

531
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:52,750
playing some sort of role in loading

532
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:54,459
iron into the sea during development so

533
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:57,549
these are lilz so arrests at two

534
00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:00,430
different stages of embryo develop and

535
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:02,619
so we went back to all these alleles and

536
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:04,299
we looked at embryo lethality and we can

537
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:06,899
see that brutus Lil's

538
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:10,659
do show an increase in the REO lethality

539
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,740
and we measure the amount of iron that

540
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,410
was associated

541
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,690
the seeds and we can see that both iron

542
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:18,759
and zinc are elevated in these Brutus

543
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,769
mutants and we can actually visualize

544
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:23,379
this when we stain using pearl staining

545
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:25,329
so this suggests that loss of Brutus

546
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,890
function leads to an increase in the

547
00:21:25,329 --> 00:21:29,250
amount of iron in the seeds and then

548
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:30,940
this leads to our then this leads to

549
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,829
Arrested Development during

550
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,509
embryogenesis

551
00:21:31,829 --> 00:21:36,399
so suggest that brutus represses iron

552
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:39,129
uptake make sure that we don't have too

553
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:43,570
much time that's transported into the

554
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:45,340
developing seed so house we're disabled

555
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:47,319
to do this what type of protein is Rinku

556
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:48,639
as I said initially we were looking for

557
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:50,649
transcription factors in our initial

558
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,720
screen and I pulled this out because it

559
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:54,970
had a seat why zinc thing your DNA

560
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,829
potential DNA binding go I was really

561
00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:00,460
excited about this and I presented at

562
00:21:56,829 --> 00:22:02,109
that meeting I was a Jose it was like

563
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:07,360
why are you focusing on this we used to

564
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:08,619
be focusing on this and this so so so I

565
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:12,269
started looking more at these are

566
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:16,719
they're interesting domains and one is

567
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:19,329
III domain so III ligases actually

568
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:23,170
facilitate the nation of target proteins

569
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:25,240
so it pairs up with e 1 e 2 and in this

570
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:28,808
III will actually cause ubiquitin

571
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,789
molecules to be transferred from d2 to

572
00:22:28,808 --> 00:22:33,279
the substrate and once it's tagged with

573
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:37,389
multiple ubiquitin change it's targeted

574
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:39,849
for degradation by the 26s protease so

575
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:42,309
then we tried in order to figure out

576
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:45,659
what Brutus might be facilitating base

577
00:22:42,308 --> 00:22:49,569
you know we conducted yeast one a

578
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:52,900
non-biased yeast to yeast two-hybrid

579
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:55,058
screen so we pulled out we made a cDNA

580
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,820
library of the root and we tried to

581
00:22:55,058 --> 00:23:00,069
identify things that Brutus might be

582
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:01,240
using this yeast screen and so we found

583
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:05,480
a Brutus interacted with several

584
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:09,329
proteins two of which for the same

585
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:11,700
family of proteins that pop I physically

586
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:12,899
interact so now I had a story where you

587
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,279
have Brutus and Popeye they actually

588
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,659
might be doing something together they

589
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:19,048
may be playing a role together in this

590
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:20,429
whole in this whole story mmm so so then

591
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:22,139
we went back and we checks to see if

592
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:23,059
Brutus and Popeye interact they do not

593
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,740
interact

594
00:23:23,058 --> 00:23:27,869
however Popeye

595
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:31,500
however Brutus does interact with Popeye

596
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:34,439
homologs so we went back and we did buy

597
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,329
a biopsy and we saw the Brutus in a

598
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,640
record for example with a lr3

599
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:40,609
the Brutus is not interact with Popeye

600
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,549
so this is just showing you biopsy in

601
00:23:40,609 --> 00:23:47,339
Oceania samples in which which were

602
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:50,099
expressing our FB fused to a nuclear tag

603
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:51,178
so if you see green signal appeared with

604
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:54,959
the red signal you know that's

605
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:56,130
interacting at the nucleus and so we

606
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,329
also confirm this with

607
00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:03,120
co-immunoprecipitation mm-hmm however

608
00:24:00,329 --> 00:24:05,399
when you remove the e3 domain you lose

609
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:07,469
the interaction between Brutus and IO r3

610
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,870
you can see that here as well as on our

611
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:11,610
Co IP this suggested Brutus's

612
00:24:09,869 --> 00:24:17,038
interaction with the pup I like proteins

613
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:19,109
requires the e3 domain so now the next

614
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,900
step was to show that Brutus is actually

615
00:24:19,109 --> 00:24:23,459
indeed enzymatic lady 3 ligase so for

616
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,840
this we use them Beecher ubiquitination

617
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,429
and the person who did this and I'm

618
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:28,470
sorry I don't have his picture here very

619
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:30,900
talented postdoc de vache still ok he

620
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:33,329
was actually a postdoc and Elena's lab

621
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,090
so I managed to you know I was grateful

622
00:24:33,329 --> 00:24:37,349
that I was able to recruit them because

623
00:24:36,089 --> 00:24:40,019
that was fantastic

624
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:41,759
so Brutus is a really tough protein to

625
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:43,650
work with so anything any data that he

626
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:45,599
brought in that was really - Brutus I

627
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:47,298
was always excited about because no one

628
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:50,548
else could had his hands to work with it

629
00:24:47,298 --> 00:24:53,490
so basically what this is an is an in

630
00:24:50,548 --> 00:24:55,379
vitro ubiquity assing and what I want

631
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,700
you to notice is that when you had you

632
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,950
know you had to eat one and you etude

633
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,048
Brutus you're looking for the formation

634
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:03,298
of

635
00:25:00,048 --> 00:25:04,950
ubiquitin ubiquitin tags right you can

636
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:06,779
actually see that when am I getting

637
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:09,179
ahead of my house a little bit getting a

638
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:10,470
little bit ahead of myself yeah right

639
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:12,000
what I want you to focus on is that you

640
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:14,850
can actually see the formation of these

641
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,429
ubiquitous here suggesting that it is

642
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:17,168
and

643
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:20,409
and I'll explain the rest of this in a

644
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:22,089
few slides for now so we saw that it

645
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:24,190
actually seems to actually form these

646
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:26,950
ubiquitin chains and when we remove the

647
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,139
III domain you see a loss of the

648
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:31,869
formation of these poly ubiquitinated

649
00:25:28,138 --> 00:25:33,819
jesting that it is an e3 ligase so when

650
00:25:31,868 --> 00:25:36,189
we do cell-free degradation assays we

651
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:38,288
can see that you can actually see the

652
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,229
accumulation aisle r3 in a previous

653
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:42,429
meeting background but not in wild-type

654
00:25:40,229 --> 00:25:50,288
alright and this all seemed to be relied

655
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:51,999
upon the degradation of IL r3 oops and

656
00:25:50,288 --> 00:25:54,700
we can also see this in vivo when we

657
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:56,379
look at the presence of IL are three

658
00:25:54,700 --> 00:26:00,219
translation futures in a brief speeding

659
00:25:56,378 --> 00:26:02,858
background so now we have evidence that

660
00:26:00,219 --> 00:26:04,749
Bruce is indeed in III lyday's what

661
00:26:02,858 --> 00:26:06,608
about these other domains so these are

662
00:26:04,749 --> 00:26:09,999
human reasoning domains in mammalian

663
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:13,079
cells had been shown to bind iron in

664
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:15,929
these by an iron in these oxygen pockets

665
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:18,788
so we had a potential iron binding motif

666
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:21,129
to try to figure out if Brutus indeed

667
00:26:18,788 --> 00:26:23,829
directly bonds iron you purify the

668
00:26:21,128 --> 00:26:26,048
protein we made a multiple binding

669
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:27,968
protein his tag variation of brutus and

670
00:26:26,048 --> 00:26:29,710
then we made another version when we

671
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:33,700
remove the him every three domains and

672
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:35,139
you can see that they expect we see a

673
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,969
dramatic decrease in the amount of iron

674
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:38,918
and zinc associated with the Hemi recent

675
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:44,499
domains suggesting that Brutus does

676
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:56,559
facilitate interaction with iron ore

677
00:26:44,499 --> 00:26:58,149
that Brutus bronze iron okay so the but

678
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:00,729
the really cool thing is that when we in

679
00:26:58,148 --> 00:27:03,338
vitro transcribed and translated the

680
00:27:00,729 --> 00:27:05,859
protein in their presence of increasing

681
00:27:03,338 --> 00:27:07,628
amounts of soluble iron we see that the

682
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:09,249
protein goes away suggesting that it's

683
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:11,588
destabilized in the presence of

684
00:27:09,249 --> 00:27:14,379
increasing amounts of iron when we

685
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:16,178
removed the him urethra in domain we

686
00:27:14,378 --> 00:27:18,189
moved this entire trunk we see that the

687
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:20,349
protein remains stable in increasing

688
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,969
amounts of cyber line this suggests that

689
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:24,598
the binding of iron facilitates the

690
00:27:21,969 --> 00:27:24,599
degradation of

691
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:29,879
and we were also gratified to see they

692
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:32,730
win that we're also gratified to see

693
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,440
that when we look at our Brutus a Murray

694
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:36,410
Thunder main we can see the protein is

695
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:40,080
much more stabilized much more prevalent

696
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:43,320
than the version which then the

697
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:44,849
full-length protein right and it's much

698
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:47,159
more prevalent than when you remove the

699
00:27:44,849 --> 00:27:49,558
e3 domain so the Hemi wreathen domain is

700
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,808
not only responsible for binding on it's

701
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:55,589
responsible for the stabilization of the

702
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:58,139
protein so now go back to this image and

703
00:27:55,589 --> 00:27:59,970
you can see in the presence of e1 and e2

704
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,309
when you remove the him everything to me

705
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:04,610
you see a much more dramatic increase in

706
00:28:02,308 --> 00:28:06,629
the amount of mana rebuking to change

707
00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:08,339
this suggests that the stabilized

708
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:12,600
version of the protein is really

709
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:14,459
strongly in III ligase and likewise when

710
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:17,730
you remove the him Aretha in domain in

711
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:21,960
Ex very much like wall type in that il

712
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:24,509
r3 is no longer present so now we can

713
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,610
add to this model the idea that Brutus

714
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:28,769
is interacting with these about

715
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:30,689
homologues and facilitating their

716
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:33,179
degradation and what I think this might

717
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:34,620
be doing is in the absence of iron you

718
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:36,990
see an increase in the amount of brutus

719
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:39,149
that's transcriptionally induced to the

720
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:40,829
protein accumulating and then once the

721
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,690
plant gets sufficient amounts of iron

722
00:28:40,829 --> 00:28:44,909
balusters brutus and it's rapidly

723
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:46,799
facilitating the segregation allowing

724
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:49,170
the tight control of iron homeostasis

725
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:53,369
responses in response to changes in iron

726
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:55,769
I don't know the rest of the field buys

727
00:28:53,369 --> 00:29:08,199
it but that's my current model for right

728
00:28:55,769 --> 00:29:10,210
now once it okay great so

729
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,519
another thing that I wanted to point out

730
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:14,079
with respect to Bruce is that these are

731
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:15,519
not the only things that Brutus seems to

732
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:18,220
interact with in that yeast two-hybrid

733
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:20,349
analysis they also interact with another

734
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,549
another transcription factor which is

735
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:24,459
not a BH in this transcription factor

736
00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:25,930
and then gene called important alpha

737
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:28,539
which encodes a protein that may be

738
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:32,070
involved in localization so we're really

739
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:35,079
intrigued by this interaction as well

740
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:37,809
and we were interested in Boz - because

741
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:39,730
vastu plays a role in abiotic stress

742
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:43,000
response such as drought stress as well

743
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:45,370
as response to pathogens and studies

744
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,160
that shown that it was degraded in an mg

745
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:49,419
one thing it was like a no-brainer as

746
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,009
that oh it must be interacting with

747
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,140
Brutus and was facilitating his

748
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:57,730
degradation all right so we wanted to

749
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:59,290
follow up on that so we went back to our

750
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,099
biopsy analysis and we showed that

751
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:04,089
indeed

752
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:07,329
Brutus seems to act with Boz - in the

753
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:10,179
nucleus in a cytosol it also interacts

754
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:12,189
with an important in the nucleus when

755
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:14,500
you remove the e3 domain we lose the

756
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:17,140
interaction with vos - but we don't lose

757
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,880
the interaction with so this is just

758
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:20,590
that Brutus interacts with proteins like

759
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,340
specifically with transcription factors

760
00:30:20,589 --> 00:30:25,539
and maybe a facility segregation but

761
00:30:24,339 --> 00:30:26,740
when it interacts with something that's

762
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:28,059
not a transcription factor like this

763
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,220
important protein

764
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:32,049
it doesn't facilitate its degradation it

765
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,430
doesn't iraq but maybe the important

766
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:38,200
protein is facilitating its movement

767
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:39,430
into the nucleus nose and so to verify

768
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,380
this we went back to our selfie

769
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:42,850
degradation assay the first thing that

770
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,150
I'll point out is that no matter what

771
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:48,429
you do with important it's always there

772
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:51,490
but when you have your when you look at

773
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:53,440
bars - you see that it's degraded in the

774
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,710
presence in an empty 1:32 dependent

775
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,600
manner

776
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:59,440
Brutus mutant not degraded when we look

777
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:02,379
at our

778
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,450
Brutus mutant which has the full leaf

779
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:05,740
protein or Abril Brutus mutant where you

780
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,990
have a protein with the Hemi riether

781
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:11,400
domain removed you don't see the protein

782
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:14,019
so the protein is facility is degraded

783
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:16,330
but it's not a graded when you remove

784
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:19,180
the e3 domain again showing that Brutus

785
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:20,919
is facilitating the degradation of vaz -

786
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,860
in a way that it was doing with the

787
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,900
protein

788
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:28,309
but it's not facilitating the great the

789
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:29,810
degradation of importance so we wanted

790
00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:31,220
to see what's the biological relevance

791
00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:33,769
maybe Brutus is doing something outside

792
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:38,019
of iron homeostasis so we went back and

793
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:42,019
we teamed of Oz to antibody from

794
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:43,970
colleagues in Yash I was a Japanese

795
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:46,039
group and he Athena being our co-author

796
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:48,410
in the paper and what we found is that

797
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:51,500
in increasing amounts of drought stress

798
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:54,140
of cold stress boss to expression of Oz

799
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:56,420
to protein goes down but when we look at

800
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:57,650
the Brutus with the deity give Pete a

801
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,170
Brutus we see that the protein

802
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:01,940
accumulates so in the presence of

803
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:03,590
increasing amounts of Brutus

804
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,269
there's decreasing amounts of Oz to

805
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:07,669
further correlation that this

806
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:10,849
interaction between two least of Oz is

807
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:13,640
degradation the final thing we did was

808
00:32:10,849 --> 00:32:17,119
check the drought stress response and

809
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:19,550
Sona Baz to mutant cities it shown that

810
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:22,189
compared to wild-type there were more

811
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:24,649
tolerant to drought sprout stress so we

812
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:26,150
suspected that avaaz to mutant would be

813
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:29,330
very similar to the overexpression of

814
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:31,100
brutus in terms of drought response and

815
00:32:29,329 --> 00:32:32,750
indeed we saw the we overexpress Brutus

816
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:34,429
we see an increase in drought tolerance

817
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:36,799
very similar to what happens when we

818
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:39,350
look at the loss of function units for

819
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,730
of Oz one advice - all right so that's

820
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:42,469
it so that's suggesting that maybe

821
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:44,539
Brutus is doing something in terms of

822
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:49,700
drought response through its interaction

823
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:53,269
with boss so now we have another layer

824
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:54,590
to this regulatory network and in

825
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:55,849
between this time that we've been

826
00:32:54,589 --> 00:32:58,730
working on this a whole lot of other

827
00:32:55,849 --> 00:33:01,669
labs have become interested in the story

828
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:03,769
and have added new players stories

829
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:06,230
getting more and more complex whole

830
00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:07,730
other set of transcription factors came

831
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:09,289
that were involved in this response so

832
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:12,470
it's a really exciting time to be

833
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:13,940
working in this in this field and so in

834
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:15,680
the last few minutes I'll finish up with

835
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:18,410
a story that we've been developing

836
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,810
that's working with engineers making

837
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:22,519
using / modeling approach and a

838
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:25,549
thematical approach to gain insights and

839
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:29,769
slow process so we went back to our time

840
00:33:25,549 --> 00:33:32,319
course analysis and I approached

841
00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:34,690
Williams and is a very talented graduate

842
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:38,049
student I'm to try to see if we could

843
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:42,640
utilize this data to try to identify new

844
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:44,409
plays and so the overarching question

845
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,000
that we were interested in asking is if

846
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:48,519
there are some known iron homeostasis

847
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,029
teens that are induced repressed within

848
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:54,819
24 48 or 72 hours can we identify things

849
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:56,139
that are upstream of it based upon the

850
00:33:54,819 --> 00:33:59,559
expression pattern of some of these

851
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:03,400
genes that are occurring earlier on in

852
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:04,809
the process and so there many different

853
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,560
ways that we can do this and this is

854
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:09,159
just a picture that from a review that

855
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:11,349
describes some of the different

856
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:13,210
algorithms or approaches that you can

857
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:15,880
take to try to identify relationships

858
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:19,750
between genes down here with genes

859
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:22,360
appear and so one of the things that you

860
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:25,090
can do is you input the iron deficiency

861
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:27,010
response genes you cluster them and then

862
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:28,950
you make identify relationships based

863
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:33,610
upon expression so that was our first

864
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:37,029
our first aim in doing this project and

865
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:40,690
so we developed an algorithm to try to

866
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:43,060
address this question so we call this

867
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:46,450
the CDA a algorithm the cluster and

868
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:48,639
differentiation alignment algorithm and

869
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:51,250
so we picked a set of well known iron

870
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,859
homeostasis genes and we use this

871
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:56,769
algorithm and identified a number of

872
00:34:53,860 --> 00:35:00,220
genes that may be regulating them that

873
00:34:56,769 --> 00:35:02,590
had no no and I know miss thesis

874
00:35:00,219 --> 00:35:04,659
response and so then we order the

875
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:06,400
mutants for all of these and then check

876
00:35:04,659 --> 00:35:10,839
the expression of their putative targets

877
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:13,240
using three forward qrt-pcr analysis so

878
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,190
then we also had a control and so we

879
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:18,459
found is that in over 60% of the cases

880
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:20,289
we were able to recapitulate that these

881
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:23,440
genes affected the expression of B's

882
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:26,710
genes right however we were not often

883
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,470
able to predict the directionality of

884
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:31,690
their expression so for example we

885
00:35:29,469 --> 00:35:33,669
predicted that ETF 9 would activate the

886
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:35,309
expression of a lot of these genes and

887
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:38,139
it turns out and actually represses

888
00:35:35,309 --> 00:35:41,440
right so to further validate this

889
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:42,809
network we sent because we had the

890
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,450
promoter for papa we said that

891
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:47,070
for papaya Siobhan Brady to do her yeast

892
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:51,449
upon hybrid analysis since she was able

893
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:53,309
to indeed on that acyl to bonds are so

894
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:59,579
decided some biological validation to

895
00:35:53,309 --> 00:36:01,349
our network so what we've been more

896
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:03,900
recently interested in is moving beyond

897
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:06,630
the static relationship to try to

898
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:08,430
understand dynamics of that relationship

899
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:10,110
how does modulating the expression of

900
00:36:08,429 --> 00:36:14,759
these genes affect the expression of

901
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:16,260
these can we developed can we develop

902
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,900
and the equation that explains these

903
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,640
relationships but to do these we

904
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:23,579
actually had to include the new players

905
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:26,789
that were being developed between 2015

906
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:28,949
and 2018 so these key players came up as

907
00:36:26,789 --> 00:36:30,809
being regulating as regulating some of

908
00:36:28,949 --> 00:36:35,309
these known I'm home ec sixties as well

909
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:37,259
so knowing this new network we decided

910
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:40,259
to create or to try and a mathematical

911
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:42,090
approach we created a version of an

912
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,700
ordinary different ordinary differential

913
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:49,320
equation o de that took into effect

914
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:51,480
things like the iron deprivation signal

915
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,010
the degradation rate of the transcripts

916
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:57,420
the idea that some things might be

917
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:59,370
considerably transcribed other unknown

918
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:01,320
iron related effects so there were its

919
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:02,730
princess took us quite a bit of time and

920
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,670
quite a bit of back and forth to try to

921
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:07,610
create an OD at a variety of different

922
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:10,470
parameters many of which we didn't know

923
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:11,820
and so what we ended up with is the

924
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:13,409
ability to be able to predict what

925
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,350
happens when we look at combinatorial

926
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:20,899
effects so for example when we look at

927
00:37:16,349 --> 00:37:20,900
the expression of say mid tin which is

928
00:37:21,019 --> 00:37:25,139
which is down here what happens when we

929
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,480
look at the effect of multiple

930
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:33,239
modulators on its activity all right so

931
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:34,740
here's nipton this is expression in wall

932
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:36,659
type plants under iron deficiency

933
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:39,569
alright and our single mutants the

934
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:41,609
expression of nipton looks like this in

935
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:44,700
a 104 mutant background this is one of

936
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:47,370
its regulators right this is another one

937
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:48,750
of its regulators and here's the W so

938
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:50,190
then we can sit we can take the

939
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:54,030
information about the expression pattern

940
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:56,369
written in the background of 104 or the

941
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:57,778
background of IL R 3 and

942
00:37:56,369 --> 00:38:00,119
we can use this mathematical model to

943
00:37:57,778 --> 00:38:03,179
predict what would happen to exist in a

944
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:04,920
double mute right and so in over 50% and

945
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:07,858
so in the majority of the cases we were

946
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:12,930
able to predict what we can it higher or

947
00:38:07,858 --> 00:38:14,130
abused so now with this these new

948
00:38:12,929 --> 00:38:15,929
approaches that we've been taking with

949
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:18,059
our engineering colleagues we're able to

950
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:20,669
further enhance this regulatory network

951
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:23,160
by adding in another layer of regulators

952
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:25,048
and some and I'm only showing Asil to

953
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:27,629
here because I know it actually directly

954
00:38:25,048 --> 00:38:32,599
regulates papaya but the network extends

955
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:37,400
to some of these new players as well and

956
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:39,390
with that but like the fake all of my

957
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:43,048
various people that have collaborated

958
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:44,578
with me in particular masa Sato who was

959
00:38:43,048 --> 00:38:47,518
our collaborator for the past to project

960
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:49,380
your Davis Daniel even stein I'm also

961
00:38:47,518 --> 00:38:50,879
have a collaboration of course Siobhan I

962
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:53,548
also have collaborations going on with

963
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,278
John Mead a local hero or you don't

964
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:57,869
didn't have time to talk about today

965
00:38:55,278 --> 00:39:00,599
create us Williams Joe the cost James

966
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:03,329
took and of course Ross suits honey and

967
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:06,180
then a variety of undergraduate graduate

968
00:39:03,329 --> 00:39:08,789
students and postdocs particularly devs

969
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:10,679
soluti Roslyn Sameera and DeRusha

970
00:39:08,789 --> 00:39:13,829
waoranis Taubman who've been he and

971
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:15,149
doing some of the talk about and I also

972
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:18,150
like the King of course the National

973
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:20,539
Science Foundation and in CSU for small

974
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:20,539
pockets

975
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:26,239
[Applause]

976
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:37,730
you tough city you save a lot of times

977
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:42,320
the arrows were wrong in the prediction

978
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:43,610
how many why it's not I think so that

979
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,990
when you look at just based upon

980
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:47,870
expression patterns you would predict

981
00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:49,699
when something goes up and if the target

982
00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:51,319
goes up and radicular will go up but

983
00:39:49,699 --> 00:39:52,939
sometimes you can have something that

984
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:55,580
goes up but it's actually having a

985
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:56,929
repressive effect and so I don't think

986
00:39:55,579 --> 00:39:59,299
we're eight we didn't really take that

987
00:39:56,929 --> 00:40:01,399
into T into account plus we were looking

988
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,810
at the effect of multiple modulators so

989
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,099
we can have something that goes up and

990
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:06,079
it's we're pressing or nothing that's

991
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:08,449
goes that goes up and activates and I

992
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,590
think that this is where we and I keep

993
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:13,250
using this theorem with our graduate

994
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:14,780
students who I think this is where we're

995
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:16,280
getting into the area where weird no no

996
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:18,080
longer looking at low-hanging fruit

997
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,550
we're really trying to figure out what

998
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,289
are all of the names that control the

999
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:24,110
expression of x y&amp;z whether it's an

1000
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:25,789
activator or a repressor so it makes it

1001
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:27,470
more difficult but it also gives us it

1002
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:29,150
gets a deeper this is deeper into

1003
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:46,849
answering any questions of what controls

1004
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:48,860
gene it's not environment nearly

1005
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:50,539
responsive if you you can see very well

1006
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:52,730
but it seems to be localized and also

1007
00:40:50,539 --> 00:40:54,110
types kind of both plus and minus so I

1008
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:56,750
don't think an iron deficiency is making

1009
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:58,579
it I do think that where it's localized

1010
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:00,139
determines what is binding partners are

1011
00:40:58,579 --> 00:41:02,900
and then that determines what it's

1012
00:41:00,139 --> 00:41:04,579
downstream targets are but in terms of

1013
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,740
iron deficiency is just making it

1014
00:41:04,579 --> 00:41:11,259
accumulate more it's not changing it's

1015
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:11,259
not causing which would have been cool

1016
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:26,360
are you going to further investigate no

1017
00:41:24,739 --> 00:41:28,189
we'd love to further investigate the

1018
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,630
thing is you just need more data so we

1019
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:32,389
need to look at kinetics we need to look

1020
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:34,340
more carefully at so so right now we're

1021
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:35,460
trying to create a similar model looking

1022
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,500
at

1023
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,298
jeans that are looking at a specific

1024
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,429
cell types so that model was predicted

1025
00:41:39,298 --> 00:41:43,018
was based upon data from whole route

1026
00:41:41,429 --> 00:41:44,489
microarray analysis right now we're

1027
00:41:43,018 --> 00:41:46,528
trying to focus we're doing the same

1028
00:41:44,489 --> 00:41:49,048
thing with an RNA seek on the epidermis

1029
00:41:46,528 --> 00:41:50,309
same time course but we're trying to use

1030
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,809
that same model we're hoping that we'll

1031
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:53,670
get a cleaner model because we don't

1032
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:55,500
take into effect you know things that

1033
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:57,809
are moving between cells or things that

1034
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,818
are you know really not a you know we're

1035
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:01,079
integer and really trying to hone in on

1036
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:04,079
what's happening in their specific cell

1037
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:07,710
and I could diluted it but yeah I'd love

1038
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,920
to work with dope deeper into the model

1039
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:12,539
I just need hands and interested

1040
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:22,230
students MacRay gnosis who's lab is

1041
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:24,510
really really keen on finger domain

1042
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:26,818
actually I don't know that's something

1043
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:28,559
that I never attested once I get started

1044
00:42:26,818 --> 00:42:31,288
by the ìiî domain and the Huey I was

1045
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:35,760
like yeah but it may very well be acting

1046
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:37,410
as or maybe binding to zinc or maybe

1047
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,660
buying it to some other other metal but

1048
00:42:37,409 --> 00:42:43,288
that's something that we've we've cloned

1049
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:56,068
those individual domains I just have it

1050
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:58,589
could be the same we didn't take that we

1051
00:42:56,068 --> 00:43:00,659
just looked at that's you know and I was

1052
00:42:58,588 --> 00:43:02,429
so focused on iron that I didn't eggsy

1053
00:43:00,659 --> 00:43:04,558
but that's something that we should we

1054
00:43:02,429 --> 00:43:08,759
should check and it could very well be

1055
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:10,528
that it's just as stable and zinc will

1056
00:43:08,759 --> 00:43:15,150
be really cool instead it wasn't exactly

1057
00:43:10,528 --> 00:43:17,659
that will be exact you did other

1058
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,660
questions
