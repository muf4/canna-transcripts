1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,360
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,360
university

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,759
yeah thanks adam for the nice

4
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:18,079
introduction and also great invitation

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,880
it is really a

6
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,919
great pleasure to visit camille and see

7
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,358
many

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,359
good friends and see greg for many years

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,760
we met when i was a

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,880
first year graduate student back in

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,640
kansas so it's really impressive visit

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,600
this morning to see many of you so today

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,200
i'm going to present some of work after

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,480
i learned my

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,679
job in

16
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,279
texas

17
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,679
so i

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,920
titled my work on the non-self

19
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,719
recognition and signaling mechanism

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,320
implant in native immunity

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,640
the fact is

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,159
although we seemingly

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,198
live in a very peaceful wonderful world

24
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:05,679
but in fact we are surrounded by all

25
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:09,200
kinds of enemies it's a dangerous world

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,720
right so bacteria from the virus is an

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,680
insect and the fact is we are housing

28
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:19,280
most of time and resistance is the rule

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,600
disease is rather uh inception this is

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,359
in large attributed

31
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:28,719
by the robust innate immune system

32
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:31,759
so at the heart of the immune system is

33
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:35,759
the individual capacity to recognize

34
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:39,359
itself versus non-self to elicit the

35
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:42,560
defense response so the key to a healthy

36
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:46,399
immune system is its ability to

37
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,680
distinguish between the body's own cells

38
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,759
and recognize lung as itself and foreign

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,520
cells as

40
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,359
non-self

41
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:59,759
so this echoes a famous saying i learned

42
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,759
one when i was a elementary school

43
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,759
student from

44
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,200
uh

45
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:11,360
famous chinese philosopher so knowing

46
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,120
your enemy and yourself you can fight

47
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,560
without defeat

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,120
so

49
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,598
compare with the animals

50
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,159
plants even more vulnerable they are

51
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:25,039
excessive when they get sick no way to

52
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:28,318
talk to doctors to get rescued right

53
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:31,199
they also don't have the adaptive immune

54
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:33,919
system as the animal system and they

55
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:37,119
also don't have the specialized

56
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:41,280
somatic immune cells and what we share

57
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,159
is this robust infinity immune system

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,519
so the inlet immune system implants has

59
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,560
been classified as a two-tiered defense

60
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,280
system

61
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,080
the perception of cells

62
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,759
surf i mean perception of microbial

63
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,480
components by cell surface receptor

64
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:04,318
triggered the first line of defense

65
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:08,079
response also terms as prr patent

66
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:10,479
triggered immunity for scientists pti

67
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,519
so those microbial components

68
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:17,439
collectively they work hard termed as

69
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,840
pamp or mams stands for pathogen or

70
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:22,400
associated molecular patterns

71
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,439
and testing infections also often

72
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,640
trigger damage to the host cell which

73
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,239
generate endogenous damage associated

74
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,958
molecular patterns

75
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,000
so collectively those things can be

76
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,799
perceived by the cell surface pattern

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,799
recognition receptors

78
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,680
so in plants what is striking is we know

79
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,239
those

80
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,040
microbial components are perceived by

81
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,759
receptive light protein on receptor like

82
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,158
kinase and implants there are up to

83
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:57,359
several hundreds of these kind of

84
00:03:54,158 --> 00:04:00,878
proteins in contrast animals for

85
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,920
instance human up to 10 tlr proteins

86
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:07,039
perceiving those microbial components

87
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,839
so this may provide sorts of

88
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,000
uh

89
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,759
for plant cell civilian system to

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,639
recognize all different kind of

91
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:18,560
microbial components to provide this

92
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:21,039
fundamental basal defense response

93
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,319
so upon perception of microbial

94
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,040
components plants trigger complicated

95
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,279
signaling pathways so those signaling

96
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,319
cascade has been classified as

97
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:36,159
two-tiered one is eti and the other one

98
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:39,120
is pti pti mainly needed by cell surface

99
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,439
receptor where eti is moving through the

100
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,639
intracellular receptors

101
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:46,959
so today i'm going to present some of

102
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,439
our work in the context of known

103
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:53,120
knowledge in pta signaling and

104
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:55,918
demonstrate uh to uh up to now

105
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,120
how we think those

106
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:02,000
pumps are perceived by the receptors how

107
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,319
the signaling were transduced after the

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,360
head counter nucleus to activate

109
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,519
immuting or defense-related gene

110
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,479
expression

111
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,719
so

112
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:15,680
the one of for

113
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,680
well-studied pump is from bacteria

114
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,079
derived flatly

115
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,879
so bacteria use this motor engine

116
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:26,478
platelet to swim around is an essential

117
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:29,680
component for bacteria its major protein

118
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:31,758
consists of flatulence and some of for

119
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,120
part of flattening protein can be

120
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,319
recognized

121
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,360
by the host for instance the 22 animal

122
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,918
acid peptide corresponding to a

123
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,439
n-terminal region of phlegm could be

124
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:44,159
recognized

125
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,918
by

126
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,439
artopsis receptor fs2 which

127
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:53,439
which encode a leucine-rich repeat

128
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,478
receptor-like kinase

129
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,199
so

130
00:05:54,478 --> 00:06:00,478
upon the flattening perception of

131
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:04,160
electron d2 perception fs2 protein

132
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:08,159
quickly almost instantaneously assumes

133
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:11,840
it with another rk similar like fs2

134
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,880
called back one from a complex so recent

135
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:17,679
structure study also demonstrates both

136
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:20,240
fs2 back one

137
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,879
kind of mediating the recognition of

138
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,280
bacterial fluidity trigger downstream

139
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:27,519
sibling events

140
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,559
so upon the bacterial flattening

141
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:33,279
recognition a series of immune response

142
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,560
can be detected

143
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:39,519
by various ways for instance the rapid

144
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,038
activation of evolutionary conserved

145
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:44,000
magnets signaling cascade by this

146
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:48,000
uh

147
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,879
markings antibody western blotting our

148
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,199
defense related immuting activation by

149
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,399
rdpcr other

150
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,520
redux

151
00:06:54,399 --> 00:07:00,478
changes for instance the reactive oxy

152
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:03,680
species production as early as a few

153
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:06,159
minutes and also later you could observe

154
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,800
a catalyst deposition which liquid

155
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,840
further liquidify the cell wall to

156
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,160
protect the cell from further infection

157
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:17,119
and also prolong the treatment of

158
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,400
flattening of the flag 22 peptide

159
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,759
incubate the adoptive seedling growth

160
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,959
likely caused by constituted activation

161
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,720
of

162
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:31,918
defense response and also pre-treatment

163
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,560
of this lightening of like 22 peptide

164
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:36,639
protect the plants from the further

165
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,399
secondary infection

166
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,000
of the burdens pathogen

167
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,279
so

168
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,079
one

169
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:49,839
perspective we examined in order to

170
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:54,878
understand how flexible trigger immunity

171
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:57,279
is transduced is looking at the uh

172
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,720
phospho-proteomic dynamics and

173
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,758
transcriptional

174
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,280
changes are conflicted to treatment

175
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,080
through these two

176
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,359
serious efforts we found one small

177
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,519
kindness

178
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,879
called originally called borderless

179
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:16,560
induced kinase big one which encodes a

180
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:19,599
result of cytoplasmic kinase

181
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,399
could be quickly phosphorylated

182
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:25,038
by upon fluctuating treatment

183
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:28,159
as shown in this western blotting the

184
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:30,318
bench kind of migration got delayed

185
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,639
later we did a serious experiment to

186
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,519
demonstrate this indeed it's a

187
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:38,958
phosphorylation event for instance

188
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:41,278
treating the sample with phosphorus cip

189
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:44,559
could block this band shift

190
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:46,799
so indicating this protein is responding

191
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,719
to flex 22 treatment

192
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,879
and this is small protein although

193
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,680
encoder cytosolic

194
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:57,679
receptor like kinase but it has a

195
00:08:53,679 --> 00:09:00,479
puritan uh mercedes motif it's target to

196
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:03,599
the plasma membrane and the alpha

197
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,560
reflecting d2 receptor fs2 and black one

198
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,360
also a plasma membrane localized protein

199
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:12,079
then we further exempt whether they tend

200
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,519
to physically associate to each other so

201
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,320
this is a co-immuno precipitation i say

202
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:22,080
you could see big one formal complex

203
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,600
with fs2 and back one without the light

204
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,160
and perception

205
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,600
suggesting the form of pre-existing

206
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:32,719
complex and interestingly a conflicting

207
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,800
rule treatment seems like the big one

208
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,959
got released from the

209
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,958
fs2 and back one complex

210
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:44,639
and big both bitcoin back one and fs2

211
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,759
encodes

212
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,879
kinases so we further ask whether there

213
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,600
are any

214
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:55,439
phosphorylation events occurs within the

215
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,200
complex here suits you actually

216
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,920
from india

217
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,440
kinase acid you could see actually back

218
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:05,919
one could strongly phosphorylate big one

219
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:10,080
and we further mapped the major

220
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:12,479
phosphorylation side if you rotate this

221
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,920
side you largely compromise the

222
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,560
phosphorylation events and also

223
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,639
we demonstrate in addition backward

224
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,799
phosphorus big one bitcoin also

225
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:26,078
transforms from the back

226
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:28,319
to back one to further enhance the

227
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,639
kinase activity of

228
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,320
back one

229
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:35,679
and so for plant our k family has been

230
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,640
classified

231
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:41,838
as serving swinging kinases

232
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:44,639
so along with our uh phosphate i mean

233
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:48,320
the identification of phosphorylation

234
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:51,919
size of big one we find actually big one

235
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,680
has multiple sides is phosphorylated and

236
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:57,039
teres inside

237
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:59,439
and then we mutate some teres inside and

238
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:02,319
find one of the terrorists inside is

239
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,040
particularly important to mediating the

240
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,480
kindness activity for both

241
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,278
syringe learning

242
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,879
activity and the tyrosine active and the

243
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:16,159
total kindness activity but some side is

244
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:18,320
specifically required for a tyrosine

245
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:21,838
activity not for serving surrounding

246
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,160
kinase activity and we further asked

247
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,959
whether those tyrosine phosphorylation

248
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:28,559
residues are required for bitcoin

249
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,759
functioning in

250
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,919
defense response you could see mutation

251
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:37,439
of those teres inside

252
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:41,519
no longer able to complement the big one

253
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,920
mutant phenotype as the y-type big one

254
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,799
in terms of baltimore's infection and

255
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:50,559
the loss of production so suggesting

256
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:52,958
those stars inside is important

257
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,119
for bitcoin function

258
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,119
and

259
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,600
along with the recent study

260
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:04,879
for back one actually from steven uh

261
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,759
steven uh groups they demonstrate

262
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:10,240
background also potentially carry auto

263
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:13,039
parasitic phosphorylation activity we

264
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,600
further find actually bitcoin

265
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:18,799
phosphorylation tyrosine site is

266
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:22,879
mediated by back one directly so

267
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:25,199
this research is suggesting rk complex

268
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:28,240
tyrosine phosphorylation maybe it's a

269
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,800
prevalent event rather than

270
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,440
previously predicted mainly needed by

271
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:36,078
surrendering kinases

272
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,079
activity

273
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,958
so

274
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:45,440
as i mentioned uh early so after flight

275
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:48,479
22 perception fs2 from a complex with

276
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,760
the back one back one originally was

277
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,879
identified as a

278
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,838
for

279
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:59,679
private and receptor associated kinase

280
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:02,480
so bipolar form complex with ryun play

281
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,759
important role in diameter growth

282
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,560
regulation

283
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:09,200
so our research demonstrates big when

284
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:11,679
the small kinase function as a direct

285
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,560
substrate of backward

286
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,759
then recent study also demonstrates

287
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:18,958
there is a

288
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:22,078
i mean extensive crosstalk between vr

289
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:25,278
signaling and fs2 signaling although the

290
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:27,679
mechanism is still not clear we know the

291
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:30,720
vr mediated

292
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:34,078
signaling activation unidirectionally

293
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,440
suppress the fs2 thickening and multiple

294
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,638
steps

295
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,440
so then we asked what kind of whether

296
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,879
our work and raw bitcoin play in their

297
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,120
military signing transaction

298
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,399
so to our surprise

299
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,759
so big one

300
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,200
in contrast

301
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:56,958
as back one play a negative role in vr

302
00:13:53,200 --> 00:14:00,959
sitting as you can see this is a typical

303
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:03,599
vr response essay

304
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:07,518
unlike her backward big one is

305
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:11,600
insensitive even hypersensitive to brg

306
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:14,320
which is a vr biosynthesis inhibitor

307
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,040
and similarly the uh

308
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,480
in terms of the response to best one

309
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:21,120
which is a

310
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,480
key trans transcription factor in vr

311
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,440
signaling once the br signaling is on

312
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,639
this

313
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,760
transcription factor is dephosphorylated

314
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,759
as shown from the migration shift from

315
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,879
the western blood

316
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:38,720
and you can see in big one mutant both

317
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:42,159
the basal level

318
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:45,120
and upon bl treatment the baseline the

319
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,240
phosphorylated form increased so this

320
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,720
also

321
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,240
i mean consistent with this brg

322
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,440
treatment result big one has

323
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,639
piqua mutant has elevated vr signaling

324
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,360
going on

325
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,879
and similarly the

326
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,440
bl suppressed gene is further suppressed

327
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:08,159
in the bitcoin mutant and we further

328
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,199
crossed the big one to the private

329
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:14,879
mutant you could see bitcoin

330
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:18,240
elevated the growth defect of private

331
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:21,120
br receptor phenotype so genetically

332
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,079
suggests indeed bitcoin clay loads and

333
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,560
function downstream of primal

334
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:28,958
and we further explored potential

335
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:33,599
mechanisms why bitcoin plays such kind

336
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:36,559
of law in vr singling and similar as fs2

337
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,040
and private also encode uh our

338
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:42,078
appropriate receptor line kinase

339
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:45,039
and sitting on the plasma membrane here

340
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:47,359
the core ip i see you you could see

341
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:49,759
because also

342
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,240
associated with brigham

343
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,959
from a pre-existing complex

344
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,600
intrinsically upon their treatment

345
00:15:54,958 --> 00:16:02,159
equine also is released from paraban

346
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:06,159
complex this is strictly similar as the

347
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:09,519
complex dynamics of big one with fs2 in

348
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:12,078
pdi sigma although big one played

349
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:15,519
different role in tdi is a positive

350
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:17,439
regulator but in a vr pathway it's a

351
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,879
negative regulator

352
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,399
and this

353
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:23,919
definition

354
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,559
further confirm the association of big

355
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:29,679
one and the brigham

356
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:32,719
and we also know ryung is a strong

357
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,879
kindness we ask whether

358
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,000
there are any trans-phosphorylation

359
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:40,799
events between prion and bitcoin as you

360
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,440
can see from the muscle kinase i say

361
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:46,319
actually private strongly phosphorylate

362
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,959
the big one even stronger than

363
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,560
phosphorylation towards the back one

364
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:55,039
this is the initial study of for private

365
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,000
and background phosphorylation mediating

366
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:00,159
the

367
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,759
vr signaling and then intensely upon bl

368
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:07,199
treatment it seems like a private

369
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:10,078
towards bitcoin is further intense

370
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,318
so suggesting up on bl treatment there

371
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:15,678
is an enhancement of

372
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:18,480
problem phosphorylation towards big one

373
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,959
then we further ask the consequence of

374
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,240
the phosphorylation between these two

375
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,558
components

376
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:28,160
as you can see here

377
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:31,038
either neither the big one pines mutant

378
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,360
are bright one kinase mutant which both

379
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:36,798
i mean both of them

380
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:39,599
lost the kindness activity you could see

381
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:42,079
let's do from complex the big one

382
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:45,038
chinese mutants still from contacts with

383
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:47,359
brigham and the same thing for private

384
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:49,919
chinese mutants with big ones

385
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:51,119
however live no longer

386
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,799
released

387
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,159
from the complex

388
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:57,038
so the

389
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,480
seems like the complex become very tight

390
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:03,279
if there is no phosphorylation events

391
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,240
suggesting the phosphorylation between

392
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:09,119
private and bitcoin maybe it's required

393
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,240
for this complex

394
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,199
i mean

395
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:16,798
required for dissociation of big one

396
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,798
from the brevan complex

397
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:24,640
so through this research we demonstrate

398
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,720
that this big one play negative role in

399
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,559
vr signaling through directory

400
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,440
phosphorylation of

401
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:34,960
private towards big one and somehow

402
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:38,080
negatively regulate br media development

403
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,360
and growth however big one directly

404
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:44,960
phosphorylated by back one meaning

405
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:49,119
positively regulating the pti response

406
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,640
so we don't know exactly how this

407
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,199
distinct

408
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,280
very likely is distinct phosphorylation

409
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,759
coming from back one from private

410
00:18:55,279 --> 00:19:00,558
dictating such kind of

411
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:03,519
different outputs we are making the

412
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:04,639
differential phosphorylation for equine

413
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:08,319
through

414
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:11,919
upstream of kinase to further address

415
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:15,839
this phenomenon and another perspective

416
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:19,280
we explore fs2 signaling is based on the

417
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:22,720
observation actually back one as i said

418
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:25,519
formal complex with fs2 also from

419
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,880
complex with bright one recent several

420
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:31,119
years we found actually that one also is

421
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,799
required for additional

422
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:38,079
other needed path immediate responses

423
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:42,639
including back one from direct complex

424
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:43,759
with efr which recognizes bacterial eftu

425
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,280
pump

426
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:49,558
and also

427
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:53,759
formal complex with damp receptor type

428
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:57,279
r112 so we are thinking so any component

429
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:59,919
associated with spectrum potentially can

430
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:03,279
serve as a convergent point to further

431
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:06,080
mediating the pti response so we look

432
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:08,000
for the background associated protein

433
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:10,319
through this line of research one

434
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,359
particular protein we focus

435
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:16,159
uh is the plant you box containing e3

436
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,959
life is called a part a particular part

437
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,080
of

438
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:23,440
the 12 and 13. you can see in the east

439
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:27,279
200 black one and top 13 directly

440
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:29,360
incorrect as so in the whole ip i see

441
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:30,558
and unlike

442
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:32,000
the

443
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,079
the

444
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,480
so the background and the power certain

445
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:40,558
interaction is constitutive without

446
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,558
lightning already from a complex

447
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,679
however the

448
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:50,000
seems like the path 13 associated with

449
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:53,280
fs2 only upon the light and perception

450
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,480
and this complex for formation occurs

451
00:20:53,279 --> 00:21:00,158
extremely fast as early as a couple of

452
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:03,200
seconds we could see by co-ip experiment

453
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,559
fs2 pub certain formal complex

454
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,360
so this

455
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:08,720
third has suggest maybe this part is

456
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,359
reliable

457
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,440
associated with back one upon light and

458
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:17,038
perception of

459
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,360
fs2 so somehow we quickly form a

460
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:23,839
complex

461
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:24,879
then the tab in closer e3 like this we

462
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:25,918
ask

463
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,880
whether

464
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,600
this is reliance does anything to do

465
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,640
with the component in the complex we

466
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:36,719
performed the virtual ubiquitination i

467
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,919
see to our surprise

468
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:44,159
the pop 13 directly ubiquitinated

469
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:46,320
the flight 22 flattening receptor fs2 as

470
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,520
you can see from this geode ladder

471
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,158
formation

472
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:52,960
however it did not you'll be putting

473
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:56,480
into the code receptor background or big

474
00:21:52,960 --> 00:22:00,079
one so this may also suggest the signal

475
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:03,839
specificity as this one is the primary

476
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:06,798
receptor for phlegm the other can look

477
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:09,839
like a non-polytrophic rule in multiple

478
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:12,639
sibling events

479
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:15,199
and we also know ubiquitination of

480
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,480
protein can need it either for protein

481
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,279
degradation or standard protein for

482
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,240
us

483
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:24,240
for cycling to activate the signaling

484
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,480
then we further ask what's the

485
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,120
consequence of this israelites needed

486
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,839
ubiquitination

487
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:33,519
here you can see with prolonged flight

488
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:37,199
22 treatment

489
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:38,639
the receptor effects to underwent the

490
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,038
degradation

491
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,360
however in the past mutant that

492
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:47,038
particularly in a double mutant such

493
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:49,918
kind of degradation is largely reduced

494
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:53,440
so suggesting genetically i mean

495
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:57,038
providing genetic evidence part 12 13

496
00:22:53,440 --> 00:23:01,279
immediate ubiquitin nation on fs2 likely

497
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:04,480
it's mediating fs2 degradation

498
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:06,158
and the genetic analysis of paper mutant

499
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,519
further suggests

500
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:12,640
our i mean support our hypothesis you

501
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:16,158
can see in the power of mutant the flat

502
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:19,280
22 induced the pilot's deportation is

503
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,640
further elevated compared with y-type

504
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:23,119
similar

505
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,679
for disease resistance the top power

506
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:28,719
mutant is small resistance

507
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:32,080
uh compared with y-type so suggesting

508
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,640
probably a negative role in a pti

509
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:38,240
response

510
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:41,520
then this power protein is called uh

511
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:45,440
modular protein so has a n-terminal and

512
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:47,759
carburized but a plant-specific domain

513
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,080
and then in the middle is the u-box

514
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,759
domain and then c-terminal has an armed

515
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:54,720
law repeats

516
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:57,759
and we further did a serious deletion

517
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,480
mutational analysis to narrow down

518
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:03,038
actually this amadino repeat is

519
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,759
mediating the specific interaction

520
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:09,359
directory interaction with back one

521
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:11,440
and also phosphorylation mainly occurs

522
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:14,399
on the angular repeat

523
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,200
by backward and then the uv proteination

524
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,840
towards the substrate fs2 mainly

525
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,798
mediated by the u-box domain

526
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:26,158
then we hypothesize whether

527
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:28,639
we by generating the armadillo repeat

528
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,919
domain alone will generate a dominant

529
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:35,038
negative version of this issue like this

530
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:38,240
will block the excess of the

531
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:40,480
substrate could generate the dominant

532
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,599
negative worth of the

533
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,720
parts

534
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:46,639
so we generate the transmittance of all

535
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,679
expression

536
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,080
alone

537
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:53,038
transgenic plants you could see these

538
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:54,639
transient plants behave similar

539
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:57,359
as the pub

540
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,320
mutant particular it reached to the

541
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:02,558
seminal level as the double mutant so

542
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:03,918
the transgenic plants become more

543
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:04,879
resistant

544
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,520
to

545
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,080
bacterial plastic infection and loss

546
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:12,639
production and also you could see from

547
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:15,278
the kinase activation the powerful

548
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,240
single mutant or the double mutant show

549
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:18,720
more

550
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,120
mechanics activation compared with wild

551
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,000
type basically the trenching plants

552
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:27,759
similar as the

553
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,759
double mutant so suggesting these power

554
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:33,119
all expression armed

555
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:36,558
alone could provide a dominant dominant

556
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:39,519
negative effect the reason we do this is

557
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:41,440
it's a challenge to study the individual

558
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:43,440
function of the part

559
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,558
because of the redundancy this is a

560
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,440
large gym family so by doing such kind

561
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:53,038
of dominating thing we wish we could

562
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,600
further elucidate additional members of

563
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:58,319
poverty and families function

564
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,759
in immunity and other

565
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,038
process

566
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:04,640
so

567
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:07,519
with this line of research it seems like

568
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:11,038
the once the defense response is

569
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:16,240
activated the cell has a mechanism by

570
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:16,240
recruiting the e3 ligase into the

571
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:23,119
receptor complex and then quickly

572
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:26,558
degrade the receptor to down regulate

573
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:29,439
the immune response when it is no longer

574
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:30,720
needed right so to keep the defense

575
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,798
response

576
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,240
uh tightly

577
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:38,558
under control so this again

578
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,159
equals a famous saying

579
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:42,639
i learned from

580
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,520
elementary school from the same person

581
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,480
so there is no instance for any country

582
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:51,599
benefiting from a constant defense

583
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,960
process right so at the right time we

584
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:54,639
should stop

585
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,759
such kind of

586
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:00,880
things to to benefit the society in the

587
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:05,400
long run so stop the war we should get

588
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,400
support from government for research

589
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:12,640
so meanwhile i also will

590
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:14,480
this line of research

591
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,759
although we and the plants look

592
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,240
definitely

593
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:21,440
i mean different my daughter at

594
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,440
my school knows or you are a fit doctor

595
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,840
although you work at a house general

596
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,640
hospital you are not a true doctor you

597
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:31,278
work with plans it's different but i'm

598
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,000
trying to tell her what i do is really

599
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:36,798
important for real doctors because you

600
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
see what i found is models similar as

601
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:39,278
what happened

602
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,839
to us

603
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:44,798
we as a human and plants we all

604
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:46,959
use

605
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:49,679
a similar type of protein those

606
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,159
receptors i mean receptor proteins sit

607
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:57,278
on the plasma membrane our boxes use

608
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:58,640
this fs2 and human use pr4 for lps tlr5

609
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:00,640
for flattening

610
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,600
and then the downstream

611
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:07,038
for activation of the signaling cascade

612
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:09,918
for human we have the iraq site of

613
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:13,679
kinase and then the similar type of

614
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:16,278
kinase big one black one transduced fs2

615
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:20,880
thickening and then we further found the

616
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:24,720
israelites monitor the defense uh

617
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:27,520
i mean latitude by israelites working on

618
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,159
this receptor part and similarly in

619
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:32,798
human we have trust three exactly same

620
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,039
looking easter bunnies or countries to

621
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:36,240
transform to monitor the defense

622
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:38,960
response

623
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,919
and in addition in human develop another

624
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,519
type of history like this and monitor

625
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,480
this iraq

626
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:49,359
kindness to finding the

627
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,759
immune response recently

628
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:54,158
we found actually there are similar type

629
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:57,839
of history like this also working at

630
00:28:54,159 --> 00:29:01,039
this level so i tell her how important

631
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,038
we are so

632
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:07,519
so this is uh

633
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:08,558
we are taking the proteomic approach to

634
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:10,798
look at

635
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:13,759
at the genome-wide level how the

636
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:18,158
impregnation potentially regulating the

637
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:21,759
pti response so what we did is to purify

638
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:25,760
the ubiquitin nation associated protein

639
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:29,440
and then to mass spec and to identify

640
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:31,200
such kind of protein to our surprise out

641
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,240
of our list

642
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,880
from the receptor to rck to the my

643
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,359
kindness level to the transcription

644
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,200
transcription factor level those known

645
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:42,719
components are

646
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,720
on

647
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,839
our list so

648
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,200
at multiple levels defense response are

649
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:54,639
tightly checked by such kind of

650
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,960
mechanism shared in human and implants

651
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,919
where in the process particularly

652
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,720
interesting for this this person you see

653
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,880
the utility nation this jail as long as

654
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,839
you can see signal indicating your

655
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,120
reputation events so you could see this

656
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:12,000
protein is

657
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:14,558
specifically induced upon like 22

658
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,798
treatment so we are in the process to

659
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:19,200
further characterizing

660
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:21,759
what's the e3 like this involved what's

661
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,440
the consequence to monitor this protein

662
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:27,278
for your detonation process

663
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,480
and

664
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:32,720
another approach we took to understand

665
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,360
the pti signaling is

666
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,278
the classical genetic approach

667
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:40,639
to looking for

668
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:41,599
additional components involving tti so

669
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,799
we

670
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:48,240
the philosophy is we use the early

671
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:51,519
pti marketing as a result so here we

672
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:54,000
choose ifrk1 so-called which in code of

673
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:56,079
lightning induced the receptor highness

674
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,960
one so this gene

675
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:00,480
can be induced by flanking shoe very

676
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,440
rapidly within

677
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,759
30 minutes so we clone the promoter who

678
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,000
covered with luxuries and transferring

679
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:10,558
other transgenic plants so basically

680
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,319
these transient plants if you treat the

681
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:15,038
plants with

682
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:17,439
flattening or non-pathogenic or non-host

683
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:20,158
bacterial displans like that

684
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,240
and then we musicianize these plants and

685
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,960
then looking for mutants either

686
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:28,240
hypersensitive or no response

687
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,480
and looking for mutants we name those

688
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,359
mutant as arthous's gene governing

689
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,480
immunity expression as aggie you know we

690
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:37,278
are

691
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,839
our logo is eggy so this i attract a lot

692
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:43,278
of undergraduate students and kind of

693
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:47,278
free labor to do the initial screens

694
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:49,759
but tensor is a fun project and

695
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:51,440
so the first the sixth mutant right now

696
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:53,679
we are characterizing

697
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,360
and are coming from one are you

698
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,759
undergraduate student

699
00:31:55,359 --> 00:32:00,798
it's really fruitful

700
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:03,679
screen so one mutant i share with you

701
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:05,918
sort of we kind of understand how this

702
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:10,480
mutation causes such kind of phenotype

703
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:13,519
is anyone you could see anyone uh

704
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,159
actually we have two alleles later we

705
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:19,120
find with my based clone both of them

706
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,559
and finally are the i mean mutated at

707
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:23,359
the same gene

708
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:24,398
and so here i showed both of you i mean

709
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:26,319
both

710
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:29,319
together you could see the id 1-1

711
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,319
id-1-1-2

712
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,120
the boosters are much higher than

713
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:36,158
wild-type

714
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:39,918
and also this mutant

715
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:43,440
in respond not only to flag 2 but also

716
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:46,799
other pumps for instance here or faking

717
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,960
all non-pathogenic on the host president

718
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:51,599
suggesting the mutant

719
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,159
the mutation not only i mean very likely

720
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:56,158
is not affecting the receptors it's

721
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,720
something happening more downstream

722
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,760
because we know different plants likely

723
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,399
perceived by different receptors we also

724
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:08,398
performed the rna-seq

725
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:10,879
analysis and things like the id1 mutant

726
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:14,000
has further enhanced the flight 22

727
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:17,440
induced region transcription changes

728
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,599
and this mutant also shows enhanced

729
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,519
disease resistance to

730
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:24,319
avoidance bacteria

731
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:28,079
and also strictly this mutant is

732
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:30,079
extremely resistance to potential

733
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,000
fungi uh

734
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:35,599
fungal pathogen

735
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,240
however these mutants show an altered

736
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:39,519
my flex 22 needed immediate mechanics

737
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,319
activation

738
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:45,440
the loss production also seems like as

739
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:49,678
similar as white type so suggesting the

740
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:52,798
mutation occurs either downstream uh are

741
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:56,000
independent of kindness activation or

742
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:59,200
loss burst process

743
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,720
so we further performed my base cloning

744
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,840
and

745
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:07,839
and cloned this gene actually i given

746
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:12,398
encodes cpr3 which is a putative

747
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:17,679
ctd phosphor test like protein 3.

748
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:17,679
so what is the ctd ctd is the

749
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:22,960
iron polymers 2 c carboxy terminal

750
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,240
domain

751
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:29,838
it's a rna partners 2 c terminal domain

752
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:32,398
so we know ra partners 2 is an essential

753
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:34,398
component regulating all the gene

754
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:37,039
transcription process right

755
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:38,638
then this report ii the c terminal

756
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:42,320
domain consists

757
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:44,000
of various repeats of conjured hepta

758
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,879
apartheid

759
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,280
so in different organisms this can this

760
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:51,440
repeats number varies in our blood

761
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,879
system 32

762
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,480
or 30 34 depends on how you classify

763
00:34:54,878 --> 00:35:00,078
these repeats

764
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,800
in terms of conservation and in human uh

765
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:06,000
things like with small complicated

766
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:09,440
organism the repeats number increase but

767
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,159
each individual repeats consists this

768
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,519
very conserved uh

769
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:18,480
seven animal acid pipe type and among

770
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:21,440
these seven five of lung could be

771
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,159
phosphorylated consisting serine and

772
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,039
tyrosine and throwing residue

773
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:28,719
so

774
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:31,759
through many elegant research in east

775
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:34,639
we know the wave of phosphorylation the

776
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:37,359
dynamic phosphorylation process on this

777
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:41,039
individual residue on these multiple

778
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:44,239
repeats how to treat the transcription

779
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:47,199
process through the initiation

780
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:48,559
elimination and termination process

781
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:52,000
so our

782
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:55,440
mutant encodes our phosphortes

783
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,559
in east the corresponding homology east

784
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,119
has been shown to de-phosphorylate

785
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:02,719
certain residues of these habitat

786
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,559
repeats

787
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:05,679
so then we've

788
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:08,159
asked

789
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:10,799
are we examined whether there are any

790
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:13,759
response for ra par2

791
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,480
in turn upon flecting two treatment so

792
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,839
we cloned the c terminal domain of part

793
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,719
two and put in the cell you could see

794
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:25,199
strikingly upconflicted to treatment as

795
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:27,598
early as two minutes

796
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:31,279
and this ctd our power to see

797
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:33,039
terminology show rapid mobility shift

798
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,079
later we did more

799
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:38,800
work demonstrate this mobility shift is

800
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:42,000
a phosphorylation event

801
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:46,640
and here this geo is using the phosphor

802
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,960
serving circular 5 7 antibody to detect

803
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:52,000
the endogenous i call two

804
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,800
phosphorylation status you could see a

805
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,838
conflict 22 treatment

806
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,880
this various residue responding to

807
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:04,480
fluctuating treatment got

808
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:07,039
active phosphorylated

809
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,639
then we further asked what kind of

810
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:11,440
kindness

811
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:15,118
acting upstream to activate the

812
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,960
phosphorylation of partial cte domain

813
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,280
so it is

814
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,240
we know the second independent protein

815
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:24,640
kinase can mediate the phosphorylation

816
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:26,719
activation of the cte

817
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:28,838
in particular for

818
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:32,719
the cdkc

819
00:37:28,838 --> 00:37:35,759
cdkc8 family and then we're looking for

820
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:38,480
the corresponding homologue in our blood

821
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,359
and so which is the closest the members

822
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,119
in cdkc one and two

823
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:45,838
and again

824
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:49,200
to our surprise for cdk's particular for

825
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:50,880
cdkc one upconflict neutral treatment

826
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:52,799
itself is

827
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,000
a soul migration

828
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,920
shifter again later we did more work and

829
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,838
demonstrated this again is a

830
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,280
phosphorylation event

831
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:04,639
so indicating the cdkc

832
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,400
one

833
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:11,118
is responding to select 22 is activated

834
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,160
upon flex and 2 treatment

835
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,680
and

836
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:17,118
we further asked what's the upstream of

837
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:21,598
kinase

838
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:24,800
regulating the ctc activation we know

839
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,000
in the pdi signaling the up

840
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,119
i mean right

841
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,519
below the prr complex is the my

842
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,079
conversion my pioneers cast page we

843
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:38,000
explore weather mechanics play important

844
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:41,119
role in activating of the cdkc package

845
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,800
and we use the chinese specific

846
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:47,280
inhibitor or the magpines phosphates you

847
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,320
could see this inhibitor of the

848
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,200
phosphotix largely reduced

849
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:56,480
activation of the cdkc

850
00:38:53,199 --> 00:39:01,118
so suggesting maybe a magpies cascade

851
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:04,079
working upstream of ctc activation

852
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:08,559
and we know that in our block ccp the

853
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:11,519
pti signaling magpies 3 6 4 and even 11

854
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:14,320
play impossible in ppi

855
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:17,838
pathway and we further test which

856
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:20,559
specific kindness activated cdkc

857
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:22,960
here from this immunocomplex kinase i

858
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:23,759
say you could see my chemistry

859
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,519
could

860
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,200
directly activate ckc and meanwhile we

861
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:33,838
also see

862
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:36,159
mypennis3 also acting with cdkc2

863
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:38,480
and we further performed

864
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:41,920
my spec analysis identified the

865
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,280
phosphorylation side of kc and you could

866
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,079
see mutate

867
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:50,960
this phosphorylation site you wipe out

868
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:54,079
the magnesium activation towards ctc

869
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:57,039
and as i said the mutant were isolated

870
00:39:54,079 --> 00:40:00,079
in cause of phosphotase and it's a

871
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:03,440
putative phosphate so only yeast it has

872
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:06,480
been so this is a functional phosphate

873
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,760
then we further demonstrate actually the

874
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,240
one

875
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,119
in the adoption genome also indeed

876
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:14,879
period phosphodies activity

877
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:18,240
and here suits you

878
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,320
when you have the catholic motif of the

879
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:22,239
phosphates you could wipe out the

880
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:27,119
phosphorylation of

881
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:29,199
ctd activated by cdkc upstream

882
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,240
kindness

883
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:32,879
so

884
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:35,039
taking this together we demonstrate

885
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,320
through the genetic

886
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:39,519
approach

887
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:42,720
we find actually downstream kinase there

888
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:46,400
is a cdkc complex could be directly

889
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:49,838
phosphorylated by the magpies uh cascade

890
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:53,358
and then this cdkc directly phosphory

891
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:56,960
the importance 2 c terminal domain to

892
00:40:53,358 --> 00:41:00,719
activate the power 2 transcription

893
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,000
arches treating the immune related gene

894
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:05,439
expression

895
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,639
well this phosphor case we isolated from

896
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,838
the genetic

897
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:10,480
screen

898
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:13,279
could be phosphorylate the partial

899
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:16,480
c-terminal domain to enter

900
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:19,040
anthropo uh counter-regulate the

901
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,039
part-two activation on the immune gene

902
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:22,559
activation

903
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:24,000
so this

904
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:26,480
so

905
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,719
i spent a few minutes to

906
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,719
explain a little bit from my domestic

907
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:34,159
project on partner after i moved on to

908
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:36,399
texas which is a largest april growth

909
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:38,799
for cotton so

910
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,760
cotton why you why don't race i mean

911
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,280
initially i checked cotton as a crop is

912
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,640
really

913
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:49,760
cool crop all smiling faced with cotton

914
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:52,639
fiber everybody love cotton well if you

915
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,920
use cotton research to a similar type of

916
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:59,118
work search you come up with these

917
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,838
two things everybody said because

918
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,480
it's a very difficult and complex system

919
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:06,960
and with the extremely longboard cycle

920
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,358
and difficult for transformation only a

921
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,599
few pathways

922
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:14,400
is able to be transformed

923
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,359
so but meanwhile it's important so i

924
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,680
thought

925
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,519
we should do something with cotton

926
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:21,838
particularly with local potential

927
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,559
funding supply etc

928
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:25,199
so

929
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:27,838
the way we tackle capital cotton

930
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:31,439
is to develop a transient

931
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:33,440
isis because so far for cutting most of

932
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,480
research focusing on

933
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,880
genome evolution perspective of fiber

934
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,119
development process there is no any

935
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,079
normal arginine has been isolated from

936
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,318
cotton

937
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:48,079
and my base cloning is a pain of neck

938
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:50,559
the genome is 2.5 kb it's a alloy tetra

939
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:54,000
employee it's very difficult

940
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:57,519
so the the 29 sigma device one is loss

941
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,920
of function uh by aggravated weak sizing

942
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:02,079
another one is a game of function as a

943
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,559
through proclass-based transient

944
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:08,800
transfection so i can escape the

945
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:11,759
mechanism for weeks but importantly

946
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,680
we found the tre based

947
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,640
virus vector works

948
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:18,799
perfectly in cotton you could do the

949
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:21,440
agromedia infiltration 10 day old

950
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,079
seedling and observe very efficient

951
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:27,200
silencing at the two weeks post

952
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:30,640
inoculation so

953
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:33,039
importantly this week's works are on all

954
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:35,440
different kind of cultural categories so

955
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:36,239
far we tested the commercial one

956
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,480
and

957
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:41,358
everything grow in the land

958
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:44,079
so this really gave us the power to

959
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:46,400
potentially explore the argent

960
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:50,079
uh things

961
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:52,400
so what we uh to explore the knowledge

962
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:55,760
in culture what we did is we built the

963
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,599
vertices library and then try to perform

964
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,359
similar kind of screen like

965
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,318
a lot of people did in tomato and

966
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:04,239
tobacco so

967
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:07,039
inaudible i grow bacteria with the

968
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:09,919
individual seedling and then swim for

969
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:13,358
different phenotypes and then we can go

970
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:16,079
back to sequence the aggro we used to

971
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:17,279
resolve which gene caused such kind of

972
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,640
phenotype

973
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,400
if this work this is going to really

974
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:25,679
revolutionize the cotton my base

975
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:28,400
clothing process is a long person and so

976
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:29,199
far there is no any succeed in cartoon

977
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,280
yet

978
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:34,000
and so as a

979
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,000
i mean molecular biologists also we are

980
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,159
not satisfied with only see the

981
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,559
phenotype we want to understand why this

982
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:42,879
happened right so it is very important

983
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:45,440
to have a system allow you to

984
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:48,960
put the gym back to the system to look

985
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:52,400
at what happened so i adopt uh i mean

986
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:55,280
modify the procedure for proplus system

987
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,680
so this is really allow you to put the

988
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,839
gene back in two days and then you can

989
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:02,960
do all sorts of molecular biology to

990
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:04,799
look at what the protein behavior and to

991
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,838
study the

992
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,480
biochemistry part of the gym function

993
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:11,519
and the center on these two platforms we

994
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,559
developed

995
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:16,960
we focusing on cd world which is one of

996
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:20,239
the devastating diseases in the field

997
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,960
worldwide and particularly with the v1

998
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:26,879
and back one they are prr type of like a

999
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:29,119
festival type of receptor like kinase

1000
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:32,240
examining the signal transduction in

1001
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,760
this cascade and more recently we are

1002
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:36,399
also

1003
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,319
doing collaboration work with adam for

1004
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,599
bacterial blight looking for tail

1005
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:41,440
targets

1006
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,240
mediating either resistance or

1007
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,800
susceptibility and another perspective

1008
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:49,919
is root rot root rot is very badly in

1009
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,720
texas and so we're developing the

1010
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,880
relations in a good part so allow us to

1011
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:57,759
silence the gene the root to examine the

1012
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:00,318
requirement mediating root rot another

1013
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,880
thing is the drug tolerance the reason i

1014
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:05,358
think the drug is initially charged is

1015
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,838
one of the easiest treated to do we just

1016
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:09,920
do inoculation and stop water

1017
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:10,799
and then go back

1018
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,519
so

1019
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:16,240
although i mean the waste kind of

1020
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:18,639
successful in terms of isolating two

1021
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:20,879
components although they are in the

1022
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:23,358
non-ada pathway but there is no

1023
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,640
molecular link seems like we are

1024
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:27,199
building some

1025
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:29,598
something quite interesting

1026
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:32,399
one of my kind is serving as director

1027
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:35,519
substitute of synergy kindness and

1028
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:38,639
smurkiness also kind of directly false

1029
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:41,039
foreign kindness which is something

1030
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:43,039
we don't know in the previous knowledge

1031
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:45,759
and these two pathways work

1032
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:49,039
independently in the downstream of

1033
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:51,599
dehydration pathway so we are trying to

1034
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:53,759
figure out the exact mechanism why we

1035
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:56,800
thought they are connected

1036
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,119
genetically also independent so

1037
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,760
share a little bit the

1038
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:04,318
preliminary result we did together with

1039
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:07,280
adam it's a really fun project

1040
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:09,599
and so the tau in fact

1041
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,359
actually for cotton bacterial variety is

1042
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:12,559
a sibling disease

1043
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:16,559
so

1044
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:19,519
through many years of research we know

1045
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:22,400
the causal agent sentiments

1046
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:25,679
the main pathogenicity factor is

1047
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:28,240
mediated by type three factors and among

1048
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:31,199
those types three factors a larger group

1049
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:33,919
are telling factors and we know the tail

1050
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:35,919
effector function like a transcription

1051
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,559
factor it carries the nuclear

1052
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,519
localization activation domain and also

1053
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:44,799
has a unique dna binding specificity

1054
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:48,000
repeats those repeat dictating the

1055
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,599
recognition specificity of the host

1056
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,480
target sequence

1057
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:54,880
so through adam's research we know that

1058
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,679
we can potentially predict

1059
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,280
the

1060
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:01,358
recognition side of the individual

1061
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,640
tail effectors

1062
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:07,920
so then we choose two typical uh

1063
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:08,719
subscribe hotel in factor one is avr b6

1064
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,400
which

1065
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:13,279
when uh from important is one of the

1066
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,200
wealth

1067
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:18,160
characterized in terms of the

1068
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:20,639
corresponding resistance low side

1069
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:23,838
and another one is pth and it's the

1070
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:26,719
major burdens determined in sense motors

1071
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:29,358
so we clone those individual effectors

1072
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:32,000
espresso in the cotton

1073
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:35,279
proplant cell and then perform the

1074
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:38,318
transcriptome analysis of

1075
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:40,160
upper regulated or downregulated genes

1076
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:42,719
by these two tests

1077
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:45,519
and then working together with atoms to

1078
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:48,799
predict the potential

1079
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:50,639
target gene among those elderly

1080
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,359
expression transcript

1081
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:55,279
and then we further confirm those

1082
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:57,679
transcription changes

1083
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,200
and then perform a serious experiment in

1084
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:00,279
terms of

1085
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:03,759
the

1086
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:06,800
transactivation essay and also

1087
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:09,920
next step is to perform last skill can

1088
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:12,400
look for radius as they are detailed as

1089
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:15,440
to examine the requirement of

1090
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:18,480
those candidate gene mediating

1091
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:21,519
six-minute hr resistance and pth

1092
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,880
immediate susceptibility so hopefully

1093
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:24,239
through this

1094
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,720
we can

1095
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:28,879
i mean provide the information what kind

1096
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:32,558
of host target

1097
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:35,200
mediated by these avr or pth

1098
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:38,079
factors from sensor owners

1099
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:41,439
so with that i would like to thank folks

1100
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,440
that work in the lab

1101
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:48,800
and also wonderful collaborators a lot

1102
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:52,078
of bio informatics work together with

1103
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,680
john jim clay here at the bti and adam

1104
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:56,400
of course and

1105
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:59,519
several other peoples in various

1106
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:02,480
institutions those are funding agencies

1107
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:04,960
i'm sorry to give such long talks and

1108
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,760
supposed to stop five minutes early so

1109
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:11,079
now i'm happy to take any questions with

1110
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,079
your help

1111
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:21,960
this has been a production of cornell

1112
