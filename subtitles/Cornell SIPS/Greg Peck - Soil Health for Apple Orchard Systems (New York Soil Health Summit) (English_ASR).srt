this is a production of Cornell

University

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,910
okay good morning I'm Greg Peck and I

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,888
love monologist meaning I work with food

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,500
crops and particularly with orchard

6
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:16,109
systems and very specifically with apple

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,899
orchard systems and so we've been

8
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:21,210
thinking a lot about soil health for

9
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:23,879
orchard systems for a long time many

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,310
decades and it's been a big part of my

11
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:29,849
graduate research and in my professional

12
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:31,519
research since then but some of the

13
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,740
things that are quite different about

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:38,130
apple orchards and vegetable systems or

15
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:40,859
about row crop systems and agronomic

16
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:43,290
crops is that we only get into the soil

17
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:45,269
about once every 20 to 30 years to do

18
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:47,789
tillage practices that's our opportunity

19
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,530
to cover crops we do pre planned cover

20
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,719
cropping we might add some compost we

21
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,429
adjust pH then we plant the trees and

22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,409
then the perennial system so those trees

23
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:57,210
are there for a very long time for

24
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:59,729
decades so then the question becomes

25
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,910
well from a soil health perspective what

26
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:07,979
can we do to increase the soil health of

27
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:11,489
the system orchards have very different

28
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:13,859
root structures than annual systems but

29
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:16,709
also we've seen a change in our orchard

30
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:18,659
systems over the past thirty years and

31
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:21,059
so that top picture shows what a

32
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,929
traditional orchard looked like thirty

33
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,140
years ago

34
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:28,890
widely spaced trees on a 25 by 25 foot

35
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,930
grid now we plant trees three feet apart

36
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,420
some girls are now even planting trees a

37
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,120
foot and a half apart and twelve feet

38
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,060
between rows so very intensive systems

39
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,040
they require a lot more precision in

40
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,909
terms of our nutrient use in terms of

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,280
our water use and potentially we have an

42
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,630
opportunity here to do things to the

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,460
soil to make those trees more productive

44
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:55,829
so the bottom picture there is showing

45
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:58,619
myself and former graduate student who's

46
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:00,539
no professor out at Oregon State with

47
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,030
some dwarfing rootstocks so we're using

48
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,760
these new genotypes that produce very

49
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:10,229
small trees and with that very small

50
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:13,170
root systems so one of the ways that

51
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,599
we've been looking at to increase soil

52
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:16,629
health and orchard systems is through

53
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:18,909
the use of mulch

54
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:20,740
and so whereas we can't use cover crops

55
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:23,439
since her defrosting a compost on an

56
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:26,820
annual basis we can mulch on and what

57
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:30,069
we're finding is is that while sometimes

58
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:31,959
tree growth and yield is is not always

59
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:34,629
improved although I'd have to say look

60
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,969
back at three of the last studies that

61
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:39,219
we did and we always found a increase in

62
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:41,199
tree growth particularly for our young

63
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:42,210
plantings by using mulch and where I

64
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,489
think we're seeing that more

65
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,870
particularly in years like two years ago

66
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:50,890
and again this year when we have it a

67
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,780
very dry June after planting but we're

68
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:54,489
seeing all these other benefits for soil

69
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,409
health that have been talked about

70
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,150
already this morning and many of you are

71
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:00,129
familiar with increasing soil organic

72
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,680
matter increasing the water holding

73
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:05,530
capacity increasing biological activity

74
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,080
making nutrients and minerals available

75
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:12,189
for the plants we see some suppressive

76
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:15,130
effects for diseases erosion control on

77
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:16,719
hillsides which is really important for

78
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:21,669
our Hudson River Valley growers that

79
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:24,009
grow on more slopes and on the picture

80
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:25,959
here this is actually a organically

81
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:29,019
managed orchard and we're finding that

82
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,330
we are able to control weeds effectively

83
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,860
with mulch with an overlay of a second

84
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:36,100
practice so if we do mulch with an

85
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:38,410
herbicide we with an organic herbicide

86
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:40,449
we can have a weed free strip that is

87
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:41,919
very similar to what the conventional

88
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:43,209
growers are getting with with Street

89
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,859
herbicide so this has always been the

90
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:47,439
barrier for organic it's always we

91
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:50,440
control true in in any cropping system

92
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,900
and it's true in an orchard systems so

93
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:54,759
it's really exciting we're finding tons

94
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,709
of benefits reduced leaching of

95
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:59,799
nutrients and pesticides into the soil

96
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:03,520
so mulch is really where it's at

97
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:06,459
other positive effects what this chart

98
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:09,070
is showing you is that under mulch which

99
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:11,050
for the bars the four bars on the left

100
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:12,250
side are the mulch treatments and the

101
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,200
bars on the right hand side are

102
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,209
different no mulch treatments with

103
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:20,459
without compost with without calcium

104
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:22,569
nitrate that mulching is increasing

105
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,310
mycorrhizae in the soil so these are

106
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:26,439
microorganisms that are helping getting

107
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,240
water and phosphorus into the plant and

108
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:30,370
we're finding great benefits from that

109
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,500
so things that growers me

110
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,769
realize are happening or happening below

111
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:39,069
the ground so with the soil health

112
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:41,560
project we really want our metrics we

113
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:43,240
want ways of trying to understand how do

114
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,160
we measure soil health for orchard

115
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,350
systems we may not always be able to

116
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,930
show it in short-term dollars and cents

117
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,699
but we can show it in long-term benefits

118
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,560
the soil long term benefits to the

119
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:55,449
environment and I think that's really

120
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,790
important for us as we think about soil

121
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:59,319
health is that we expand the crops that

122
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,790
we're looking at we're looking at

123
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:02,349
agronomic crops we're looking at

124
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:06,699
vegetable system and that we're also

125
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:08,949
looking at cranial fruit systems this is

126
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:11,280
another picture of just a trial looking

127
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:14,830
at integrating practices compost and

128
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,509
nutrients and other ways of thinking

129
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:18,459
about this creatively Ann Arbor is are

130
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:20,168
very interested in this I was just

131
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:22,719
invited on Thursday to talk to soil

132
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:24,668
health - about finding 50 commercial

133
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,229
apple growers along Lake Ontario so they

134
00:05:24,668 --> 00:05:29,049
are asking these questions and these are

135
00:05:26,228 --> 00:05:32,288
not organic just organic growers these

136
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:34,270
are our largest conventional mainstream

137
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:38,279
growers in the state are very interested

138
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:38,279
so thanks
