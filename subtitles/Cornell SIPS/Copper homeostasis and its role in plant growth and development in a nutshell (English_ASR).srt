00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,310
hi I'm Meg and I Milenka we are Cornell

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,990
University students from the mineral

3
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:08,669
nutrition course and we're here to tell

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,160
you about copper nutrition and people

5
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:13,320
and plants copper is a transition metal

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,048
and one of the elements in the periodic

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,960
table all life on Earth needs copper to

8
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:21,059
survive including us humans we use

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,429
copper as a cofactor and many proteins

10
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:25,528
called Cooper enzymes or copper atoms

11
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:27,358
sub polypeptide chains of amino acids

12
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:29,879
reactive for other metals in our bodies

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,170
like iron copper and it's proteins have

14
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:33,030
important roles throughout our bodies

15
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,760
including brain function immune function

16
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,710
and red blood cell production his copper

17
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,299
is such an important nutrient there are

18
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,350
severe health effects if we are

19
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:42,628
deficient in it

20
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,700
children born without sufficient copper

21
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:46,920
during their mother's pregnancies have

22
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,559
issues with bone formation and with

23
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,629
their cardiovascular systems they also

24
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:53,519
can have abnormalities with brain and

25
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:55,859
immune system function for the rest of

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,660
their lives adults with copper

27
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:59,640
deficiency meanwhile have cardiovascular

28
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:01,769
problems including those concerning

29
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,600
cholesterol blood sugar and regular

30
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,760
heartbeats and they can have

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,640
neurological and behavioral problems as

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,430
well that doesn't mean we can't have too

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,170
much copper however the metal is toxic

34
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,600
at high levels because it can make

35
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,460
reactive oxygen species from oxygen

36
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,039
molecules that can tear apart cells

37
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:22,829
especially the mitochondria the

38
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,450
powerhouses of the cell luckily most

39
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:26,158
people's bodies do a good job of

40
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,109
controlling them out of copper in

41
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,900
ourselves so this is not usually an

42
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:33,599
issue but our bodies can't control is

43
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,430
how much copper we have access to like

44
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:39,319
all essential nutrients we have to each

45
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,240
regular supply of copper to stay alive

46
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,519
one of the main sources from which

47
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:45,489
humans acquire nutrients is plants who

48
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:48,079
in turn take up nutrients from the soil

49
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:49,939
planets like all other living things be

50
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,939
copper and it's important for the growth

51
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:54,439
development and fertility of plants it

52
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:56,899
plays an important role in

53
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:59,569
photosynthesis reactive oxygen species

54
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:02,150
detoxification hormone perception and

55
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:03,679
cell wall formation while humans are

56
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,260
free to make changes in their diet

57
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,090
plants are restricted by the environment

58
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:11,330
that growing and the availability of

59
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:13,520
nutrients in the soil almost 30% of

60
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,040
farmland across the globe is made of

61
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,950
neutral or basic pH soils that are

62
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:20,209
considered to be copper deficient signs

63
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:23,329
and a plant has copper deficiency

64
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:25,759
include a slow growth rate the yellowing

65
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:28,630
of young leaves and inability to form

66
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:31,399
wood a lack of flowers and few seeds

67
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:33,219
meaning plans like wheat and rice might

68
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,620
not produce enough grains for farmers

69
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:38,599
however just like in humans copper can

70
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:41,450
also be toxic if it is accumulated in

71
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:43,789
excess symptoms of toxicity are

72
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:45,319
yellowing of mature leaves slow root

73
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:48,439
growth in the production of reactive

74
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:50,329
oxygen species in order to keep the

75
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:53,090
copper levels at the range that are best

76
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:55,250
for them plants tightly regulate all the

77
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,950
processes that take up and redistribute

78
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:01,129
copper uptake of copper into plants is

79
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:03,589
done by copper transporter proteins some

80
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:05,569
of these are in the CDR Copts family and

81
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:08,390
are important for taking up copper from

82
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:10,099
the soil into the roots since pre copper

83
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:12,379
is not a safe form to keep in living

84
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:15,769
cells it has to be bound to molecules

85
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:17,629
called ligands or chaperones once in the

86
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:19,670
plant copper needs to be taken from the

87
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:21,530
root cells to the xylem where it can be

88
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:23,509
carried throughout the plant loading

89
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,180
copper into the xylem cells requires a

90
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:28,609
transporter protein from the HMA family

91
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,580
after moving through the xylem copper it

92
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:35,600
slivered 2 leaves flowers and fruit by

93
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:37,250
the YSL and CTR compt transporters all

94
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,889
these proteins are regulated by

95
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,780
different proteins called transcription

96
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:43,969
factors determine which other genes in

97
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,330
the plant's DNA can be transcribed and

98
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:46,759
translated

99
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:48,830
letters into proteins the main

100
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:52,759
transcription factors that control

101
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:54,680
copper levels are SPL 7 and C igf-1 they

102
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:56,810
regulate all of the transporters we

103
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,569
describe to make sure enough copper is

104
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:01,670
taken up however the amounts of copper

105
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:04,400
in soil are not high enough another

106
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:06,919
strategy can be activated it is called

107
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,930
copper economy mode and at Redis tribute

108
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:11,149
copper from left needed areas and

109
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,540
processes towards the most important

110
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:15,379
ones such as photosynthesis in the lead

111
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:17,089
there is a lot that goes into

112
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:19,189
controlling copper in plants whether

113
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:21,259
taking it up in soil or carrying it from

114
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:22,910
one part of the plant to another but we

115
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:24,709
hope you have convinced you why it is

116
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:27,230
important unless you're a big fan of

117
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:28,759
eating liver bones are you most of your

118
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,220
copper comes from plants like wheat or

119
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:33,170
corn and that copper is critical for so

120
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,570
many parts of your own body healthy

121
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:38,290
plans to feed healthy people we hope you
