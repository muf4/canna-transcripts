1
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,719
um well hello everyone uh my name is

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,160
Carrie Martin I'm the environmental

3
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:21,879
sustainability planner at the New Jersey

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,518
Institute of Technology technical

5
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:27,599
assistance to Brownfield communities

6
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:31,479
program also known as NJIT

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:34,759
tab so just as a prim of what I do um

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,640
NJIT tab serves as a free independent

9
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:39,479
resource to State territory Regional

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,399

11
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:45,279
entities as well as nonprofits to learn

12
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,679
about identify assess clean up and

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,640
redevelop brownfields we currently serve

14
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,960
EPA regions two and four to being New

Tennessee and

20
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,519
Kentucky to make sure we're on the same

21
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:09,719
page um let's refer to the EP EPA

22
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,519
definition of a

23
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:15,679
Brownfield so a Brownfield is defined as

24
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,798
real property the expansion

25
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,360
Redevelopment or reuse of which may be

26
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:22,840
Complicated by the presence or potential

27
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:25,239
presence of hazardous substances

28
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,280
pollutants contaminants Controlled

29
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:31,919
Substances petroleum petroleum products

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,920
as well as mines guard land

31
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:37,158
so it's important to point out that not

32
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:40,040
all contaminated properties are brown

33
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,759
fields and not all brown fields are

34
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,479
contaminated so for instance an active

35
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:48,718
gas station that experiences a leaking

36
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:50,200
underground storage tank is contaminated

37
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:52,718
however it's not a brown field because

38
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,960
it's an active property on the other

39
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:58,359
hand a property that contains a closed

40
00:01:55,959 --> 00:02:00,839
auto repair facility would be considered

41
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:02,680
a Brownfield um because it's a vacant

42
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,039
facility that previously handled

43
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:08,280
petroleum and chemicals if testing

44
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:10,439
determines that the site actually

45
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,120
doesn't contain any contamination it

46
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:14,598
would still be considered a Brownfield

47
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,519
by the EPA because the stigma or

48
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:21,479
perception of potential contamination is

49
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:24,439
there brownfields are legacies of our

50
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:27,639
industrial past um Brownfield sites can

51
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:30,680
include things such as former factories

52
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:33,000
warehouses leaes tanneries

53
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,519
chemical processing plants manufactured

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,239
gas plants rails and Freight yards

55
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,920
textile mills mines foundaries as well

56
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,719
as dumps and

57
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,639
landfills that said there are

58
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:47,639
non-industrial Brownfield sites and more

59
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:50,359
modern land uses um such as closed gas

60
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,598
stations auto repair shops former

61
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,080
pharmaceutical or medical facilities

62
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:58,199
metal scrapping uh vacant retail

63
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,440
shopping centers dry cleaners these are

64
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:03,238
smaller businesses that use and handle

65
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:04,919
chemicals and buildings themselves may

66
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,120
be considered Brown Fields due to the

67
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,639
materials used to create them such as

68
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,680
Asbestos and L

69
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:14,639
pain so Legacy pollutants such as those

70
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,280
listed in this table were used in a

71
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,958
variety of past land uses um and can

72
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,959
remain in the environment long after

73
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,000
they were

74
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,400
introduced um there are some sources

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,360
listed here but typically we see lead

76
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,400
from lead based paints or leaded

77
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:34,239
gasoline um besus in insulation and

78
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,640
Roofing uh petroleum from fuel tanks and

79
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,000
heating tanks uh volatile organic

80
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,878
compounds from dry cleaning solvents

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,799
petroleum products pesticides and others

82
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:46,438
um identifying these contaminants

83
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,080
happens during the site assessment phase

84
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:51,519
um and then they're cleaned up during

85
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,239
the site remediation phase to acceptable

86
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,360
standards there are a number of negative

87
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,840
impacts of Brownfield sites um outside

88
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,680
of the potential presence of

89
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,719
contamination environmental exposure to

90
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,599
contamination can degrade soil water and

91
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,840
air quality and human exposure can cause

92
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,798
public health issues but brownfields

93
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,959
also contribute to Neighborhood

94
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,760
deterioration and negative perceptions

95
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,720
of a neighborhood they can attract

96
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,199
vandals open dumping and other unwanted

97
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,479
criminal

98
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:25,560
activity

99
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:27,599
um they can lower property values reduce

100
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,280
employment opportunities and can lead to

101
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:34,960
loss tax revenue and limited economic

102
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:37,159
growth it's important to note that this

103
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,359
isn't only something that's

104
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,080
felt this is something that's felt

105
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,280
across communities so according to data

106
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:48,560
from fiscal year 20 population data um

107
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,839
in the acre system which the EPA uses to

108
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,199
track brownfields Redevelopment in their

109
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:55,000
programs um for those populations within

110
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,960
a half mile to a mile of a Brownfield

111
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,160
site they're more likely to be lwi

112
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,918
income communities as well as having

113
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,199
less than High school education than the

114
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:07,159
United States as a whole um which puts

115
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:10,919
them at a disadvantage for um Economic

116
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:15,720
Opportunity on top of um the negative

117
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:18,079
environmental effects of the Brownfield

118
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,280
properties that said that there are some

119
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,439
advantages of having Brownfield sites

120
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:25,679
many are located along waterways as well

121
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:28,038
as as well as Rail lines um are located

122
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,160
within Central Downtown areas making

123
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:32,759
their location locations

124
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,960
advantageous for redevelopment many have

125
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,319
existing infrastructure such as utility

126
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:40,239
and Sewer lines on site um which also

127
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:43,160
and they also can hold historical as

128
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,160
well as architectural

129
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,479
significance these aspects also make

130
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,879
former brownfields advantageous

131
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:52,639
locations for energy generation as well

132
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:55,279
as storage uh citing energy generation

133
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,120
and storage on potentially contaminated

134
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,879
lands can mean that the land was already

135
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,840
previously developed and as a result you

136
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:04,959
can leverage existing infrastructure on

137
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:07,758
and servicing the site so further it's

138
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:10,038
um protects open space by not citing

139
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,800
these facilities on um previously

140
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:14,879
undeveloped lands so on the left hand

141
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,000
side of your screen you can see the

142
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,598
financial center for the American Public

143
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,160
University system which is the second

144
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:24,120
largest online higher education provider

145
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,319
in the United States the site was

146
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,879
formerly used for warehousing and

147
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,080
parking and is now home to a lead silver

148
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,959
certified office and meeting space for

149
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:36,758
over 400 employees the parking lot has

150
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:39,038
1,600 solar panels which makes it the

151
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:41,439
largest solar array in the state of West

152
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,639
Virginia and it also has 14 vehicle

153
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,918
charging

154
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,639
sites this array provides half the

155
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:48,879
energy that's needed for the financial

156
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,918
center it's located in the commercial

157
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:52,959
Corridor along the line between Ranson

158
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:55,399
and Charlestown West Virginia near the

159
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,519
Ranson Civic Center meaning that

160
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:59,598
residents and employees of Bol towns can

161
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:02,318
take advantage of the vehicle charging

162
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,079
stations at a convenient location uh the

163
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,879
site also demonstrates how a state's

164
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,918
largest array need not be located on on

165
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:12,080
open space but it can be located in a

166
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:14,000
vibrant downtown area citing energy

167
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,439
facilities on brownfields may also have

168
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,839
economic benefits it can provide

169
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:21,478
economic activity on sites that lack

170
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,279
other reuse options so the image on the

171
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:26,439
right is from the former Goodyear

172
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:28,318
industrial campus in Windsor Vermont um

173
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:30,360
limited long-term planning options were

174
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,000
available for this site because the

175
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,199
designated because it was inside of a

176
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,800
designated flood plane um as a result

177
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,478
the site was cleaned up electrical

178
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,960
connections were raised above the flood

179
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:45,399
plane and it's now home to a solar array

180
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:51,000
um this 500 kilowatt solar array system

181
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:51,000
um is all uh used

182
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,360
locally so as you can see from these

183
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,720
examples a Brownfield holds the

184
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,960
potential for being transformed into a

185
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,879
Community Asset remed ation and

186
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:04,038
Redevelopment of brownfields presents us

187
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,479
with an opportunity for renewal in our

188
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:08,000
community as well as our energy sources

189
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:09,758
let's discuss an example of how

190
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,959
remediated Brownfield sites have been

191
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,158
used for energy generation and their

192
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:16,560
Associated co-

193
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:18,439
benefits according to topology which is

194
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,560
a community planning firm in Newark New

195
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:23,719
Jersey the Elm Street Logistics Center

196
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,959
used to be 90 Acres of contaminated land

197
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,919
it's now been transformed into 1 million

198
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:30,560
square foot warehouse and distribution

199
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:32,478
center for Home Depot this Redevelopment

200
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,599
created jobs and it added taxable

201
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,879
improved property where there was none

202
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,200
before the positive environmental

203
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:44,639
impacts of this Redevelopment um include

204
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,240
first that it's a remediated site um and

205
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,879
it simply improves the environment by

206
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,680
removing contaminant from the property

207
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:54,080
second um we also have uh energy

208
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:56,519
generation power through solar panels

209
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,240
and third uh we have some uh green

210
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,799
infrastructure that has been integrated

211
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,879
into this property so there's bio

212
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,879
retention basins as well as porest

213
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,439
pavement and Rain Gardens to handle

214
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,759
storm water surrounding the site uh one

215
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,920
thing I want to mention

216
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:15,759
is when we're seeing increasing storm

217
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:19,399
events occurring

218
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,919
um when you have increased precipitation

219
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:22,919
you want to make sure on Brownfield

220
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:25,838
sites that you're not mobilizing any

221
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:28,759
potential contamination on site and so

222
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,839
it's really important to integrate uh

223
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:33,480
storm water management surrounding the

224
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:36,640
site so that when those major rain

225
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:40,399
events do occur um

226
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:44,319
the water is handled offsite and it

227
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:47,159
reduces the possibility of um mobilizing

228
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,160
contamination bya

229
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,919
floodwaters brownfields Redevelopment

230
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:55,278
also has a lot of social Community co-

231
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:57,278
benefits so this logistic Center is

232
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:00,120
found a block away from Perth Ino

233
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:02,679
downtown and associated Jersey Transit

234
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,120
train station uh which makes it easy for

235
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:07,679
everybody to access um further this

236
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,560
Redevelopment included a public walkway

237
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,519
a public Amphitheater park for outdoor

238
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:14,319
performances as well as a building to

239
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,120
house the city's office of recreation so

240
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,360
what was once a source of potential

241
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,039
health and safety hazards um and a

242
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,759
community eyesore is now an opportunity

243
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:26,559
for active Transportation Recreation and

244
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,559
arts and culture

245
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:31,120
events I'll briefly go over the brown

246
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:34,078
field field Redevelopment process this

247
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,639
is not linear but in general um you can

248
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:38,958
see that a base of good planning informs

249
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,200
the process site assessments are

250
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,359
completed which inform the remediation

251
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,040
strategy and then once the site is

252
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,839
cleaned up it's ready for

253
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,199
redevelopment um Rocky Mountain

254
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:52,240
Institute will definitely go into this

255
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:54,600
in Greater detail um but one of the

256
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,079
sources of information on energy

257
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,040

co- benefits um that come with things

324
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:05,600
like uh solar arrays and energy

325
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:08,278
Generation Um using solar arrays and

326
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,079

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:49,000
organization dedicated to accelerating

341
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:52,120
prosperous clean energy future for all

342
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,120
we were founded in 1982 and we combine

343
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,519
research whole systems thinking and

344
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,600
unconventional Partnerships to help

345
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,120
communities advanc sustainable energy

346
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,720
system

347
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:06,320
this is our office in basal Colorado

348
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:09,120
although we are now a global

349
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,560
organization RMI is a partner to the

350
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,679
technical assistance to brownfields

351
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:16,439
program um the map on the right is all

352
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:19,000
the different technical assistance to

353
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:22,079
brownfields program including

354
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,039
NJIT as Carrie just went over um they

355
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:27,919
provide a whole range of services and we

356
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:30,120
are a partner that provides services

357
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:34,479
specifically related to clean energy

358
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:37,560
reuse right now we partner with KSU and

359
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,720
C CLE so we provide communities in EPA

360
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:43,078
regions 5 through 10 with free technical

361
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,560
assistance for clean energy

362
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:47,439
reuse we support communities and site

363
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:49,278
owners interested in responsibly

364
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,959
planning for and deploying clean energy

365
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:54,919
on brownfields and closed landfills and

366
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:57,359
addressing brownfields related reuse and

367
00:15:54,919 --> 00:16:00,078
revitalization

368
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,159
challenges arei helps communities Across

369
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:05,000
America Advance transformational

370
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:07,198
brightfield projects our goals are to

371
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,600
educate communities and site owners

372
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:12,479
about brightfield reuse options that

373
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,519
include clean energy to provide

374
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,839
pre-development site evaluation and

375
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:19,480
Analysis to communities considering

376
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:21,319
bright fields and to provide other

377
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,000
technical assistance and tools to help

378
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:26,879
with reuse planning funding financing

379
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,759
and clean energy

380
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,919
procurement today I'm going to talk

381
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:33,639
about about uh what bright fields are um

382
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,439
the large potential Market that they

383
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:38,440
offer Community benefits and challenges

384
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,880
and how to get started with our

385
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,360
technical assistance if you're

386
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:46,439
interested so to start things off what

387
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,480
are bright Fields right Fields repurpose

388
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,920
Brown Fields with renewable energy to

389
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,600
support a more local and Equitable

390
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:57,360
energy transition as Carrie just went

391
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,759
over a brown field is a property where

392
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,039
the expansion Redevelopment or reuse may

393
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,600
be Complicated by the presence or

394
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:05,318
potential presence of a hazardous

395
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,480
substance pollutant or

396
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:08,558
contaminant and we did just talk about

397
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,558
the other all the examples of

398
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:12,798
brownfields so I won't get into that but

399
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:16,519
a bright Fields is when the

400
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:18,199
Redevelopment is uh clean energy and

401
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:21,240
it's the clean energy is built on a

402
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:23,759
former Brownfield or superf fund site

403
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,759
and this is not an official term this is

404
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,640
what we call it and I've seen it

405
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,440
elsewhere um but it's a nice way to use

406
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,200
that

407
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,320
solar pun there and call it a bright

408
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:39,200
field bright Fields come in all shapes

409
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:42,079
and sizes um so here we have two solar

410
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,160
projects on the left and on the top and

411
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:46,119
then there's a wind project on a brown

412
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,880
fields in the bottom

413
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:52,359
picture landfill solar in particular um

414
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,400
Can adapt to site specific needs with

415
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:57,759
purposeful design all brightfields can

416
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,360
adapt to site specific needs um but here

417
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,200
are some examples of of landfill solar

418
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:04,959
so first we have these ballasted

419
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,640
structures that go on top of the

420
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:11,679
landfill so that the solar structures do

421
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:14,038
not penetrate the cap and then there are

422
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:17,600
all the wiring will be above ground as

423
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:20,440
well so that again the cap is not

424
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:23,719
penetrated solar can also be built

425
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,440
around any monitoring infrastructure so

426
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,798
here this is a methane

427
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,798
monitoring um system that the solar is

428
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:35,000
getting built around and then the solar

429
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:37,839
is also built around this access road so

430
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
really solar can be adapted to fit the

431
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:44,399
needs of the site in this case a

432
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,240
landfill um but any type

433
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,280
of uh solar can be adapted for really

434
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,400
any type of Brownfield

435
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:55,200
project most existing bright Fields use

436
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,679
solar power but they can include other

437
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,600
renewable

438
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:02,798
Technologies um so this is a breakdown

439
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:05,359
of the number of projects that are uh

440
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:07,798
solar versus wind there's many more

441
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:10,439
solar projects that are installed in the

442
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:13,720
United States compared to wind however

443
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:18,360
when we look at the capacity um which

444
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:22,159
means the amount of uh Power that is

445
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:24,479
installed the wind takes up a a larger

446
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:27,480
proportion so really just 25 projects

447
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,240
that are wind projects are taking up uh

448
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,919
about a third of the project s when we

449
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,558
look at capacity and this is just

450
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:37,840
because wind projects create generate

451
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:39,879
much more electricity than solar

452
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:43,079
projects um compared

453
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:45,720
to the amount of land that they take

454
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:49,240
up brightfields are becoming part of the

455
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,759
clean energy transition Across America

456
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,720
here are a couple of examples of

457
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:55,119
different brightfields projects in the

458
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,880
country in Phoenix Arizona there's a 10

459
00:19:55,119 --> 00:20:00,199
megawatt project on 118 Acres of a City

460
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,760
of Phoenix

461
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:06,159
landfill and in Pittsburgh there's a 2

462
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:08,480
megawatt 2 megawatts of solar installed

463
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:12,760
on an old steel

464
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:15,240
mill in Martin County Kentucky we have

465
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:20,000
200 megawatts of solar planted on a

466
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:22,319
shuttered martiki Min land and finally

467
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,519
in Franklin County Ohio there's five

468
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:28,759
megawatts sorry 50 megawatts of solar

469
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:31,798
planned on a closed landfill the these

470
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:34,720
are just four of the over 600 different

471
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:36,720
projects that are um already installed

472
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,120
across the

473
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:43,960
US landfill solar has been and can be

474
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:46,399
built safely and

475
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,720
responsibly it certainly has been done

476
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,440
before there are at least 338 clean

477
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,679
energy projects built on closed

478
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,640
landfills according to the EPA and on

479
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,919
the right this is a breakdown of all the

480
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,038
different types of projects um all the

481
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,640
different types of brightfields

482
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:07,960
projects is it safe to build on a closed

483
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,320
landfill it is energy developer an

484
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,278
energy developer should be required to

485
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:16,079
take precautions to not damage the

486
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:18,720
existing landfill cap and other

487
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:21,240
infrastructure and procurement processes

488
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,798
can specifically request qualified

489
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,919
developers who understand the challenges

490
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:29,200
of building solar on a closed landfill

491
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:32,240
I'll just add one more point to this

492
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,120
that developers can be asked

493
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,400
specifically to really make sure any of

494
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:40,678
the requirements are met um for example

495
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,960
we're working with a community right now

496
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:46,240
who's concerned about the regular um

497
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,120
monitoring requirements for their closed

498
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,919
landfill and they're just going to

499
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:52,199
communicate that to the developer and

500
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,840
the developer will ensure that there's

501
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,080
still the ability for the landfill

502
00:21:54,839 --> 00:22:00,599
manager to go in and do their regular

503
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:03,399
monitoring once the has been

504
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:05,240
installed and developers there are

505
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,200
several developers across the country

506
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:11,440
that have experienced building on

507
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,558
landfills and uh Bren

508
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,200
Fields now we're going to talk about the

509
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:19,240
large potential Market that brightfields

510
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:22,319
offer this is a large but mostly

511
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:25,120
untapped potential market so on the left

512
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:28,200
this is a map of the brightfields

513
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:30,678
projects that are installed today you

514
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,278
see a lot of those solar projects across

515
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:37,080
the country in yellow with some of those

516
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:40,359
wind projects um popping

517
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:43,119
up this map is the completed projects

518
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:46,399
but there's actually over

519
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:48,599
190,000 potential Brownfield sites that

520
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,919
would be viable for clean energy

521
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:53,959
deployment and this is from that EPA

522
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:55,720
repowering site that um Carrie referred

523
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,720
to

524
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,759
before if we just looked at the landfill

525
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,360
potential so this is just the closed

526
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:08,400
landfills in the country this could

527
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:10,599
yield approximately 63 gaw of power and

528
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,759
just to put that into

529
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:15,000
perspective

530
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:17,798
um actually don't know the facted off

531
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,960
the top of my head but one household

532
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:23,359
uses something like a couple hundred

533
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,960
kilowatts unless someone else's on the

534
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:27,798
line can say otherwise um so this is

535
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,038
quite a large scale that we're working

536
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:31,158
with 60 3 gaws if we were just looking

537
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:34,798
at

538
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:37,880
landfills um and there's only that 624

539
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:39,400
completed bright fields which is 2.5 gws

540
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,799
of power

541
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:45,759
today just 1% of potential bright Fields

542
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:49,720
could support about six gwatt of clean

543
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:52,558
energy and 60,000 local jobs so really

544
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,480
quite a big potential Market that we are

545
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:57,480
looking

546
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:59,960
at there are also federal tax credits

547
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,038
and incentives that can increase the

548
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:05,278
attractiveness for clean energy reuse

549
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:07,278
and I have an asteris here because as we

550
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:12,079
know these federal tax credits are

551
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:13,798
uncertain in the next um couple years um

552
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,639
but I will go over them just so everyone

553
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:18,679
on the call knows uh tax credits are

554
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,440
available for renewable energy these are

555
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:23,679
site agnostic and on the right this is

556
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,720
what those clean energy tax credits look

557
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:30,759
like there's a 30% base tax credit for

558
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,798
any sold wind project and then there's

559
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:36,720
additional adders if the project uses uh

560
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:39,798
domestic content so man uh materials

561
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,000
made in the United States um if energy

562
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:44,558
communities uh if if the site is

563
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,440
installed in an energy community and if

564
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:49,798
the the project benefits lowincome

565
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,399
households or if the project is located

566
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:55,000
in the low-income household and there

567
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:56,519
these new incentives are available to

568
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,640
support specifically brightfield

569
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:01,079
development so that energy community

570
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:05,559
bonus right here that I have circled um

571
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:08,480
that's reserved for um right field

572
00:25:05,558 --> 00:25:10,879
projects and for other projects that are

573
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,599
located in areas that have been affected

574
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,000
by fossil fuel plants

575
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:18,278
closing um so right now these federal

576
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,440
tax credits still exist we hope they

577
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:23,880
will still exist um we just don't know

578
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,558
but for now there's a really big uh

579
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:29,120
incentive for installing clean

580
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:31,158
energy so just to summarize the

581
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,079
opportunity exists to repurpose

582
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:34,919
thousands of sites and transform

583
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:37,319
communities there are hundreds of

584
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:39,240
thousands of brown Fields available the

585
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:41,278
technical potential of brightfields is

586
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,480
significant and finally the new and

587
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:45,798
enhanced Federal incentives are there to

588
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,599
advance

589
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:50,639
brightfields now we're going to move on

590
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:52,918
to community benefits and

591
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,360
challenges communities can leverage

592
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:56,600
brightfields to deliver a wide range of

593
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:58,879
local

594
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:59,959
benefits first of all they restore

595
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,520
blighted

596
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:07,399
lands they attract local investment

597
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:11,000
create local jobs enhance environmental

598
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:15,079
justice support public health and

599
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,798
generate positive press for the

600
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:20,798
community brightfields help address past

601
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:23,599
and present environmental

602
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:25,679
Injustice many brownfields are in or

603
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:28,359
adjacent to historically neglected and

604
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:31,038
majority non-white populations

605
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:32,119
developing brightfields can be part of

606
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:34,679
the

607
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:38,319
solution here's an example in Washington

608
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:41,679
DC the oxrun solar farm is a

609
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:44,839
2.65 megawatt array constructed with

610
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:47,480
local contractors on a site contaminated

611
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:50,398
by years of gas station

612
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:54,880
residue the project provides lowcost

613
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:58,000
power to about 780 qualifying residents

614
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,880
where 86% of the households are black

615
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,679
and 20% are below the poverty

616
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,360
line the project lowers electricity

617
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,919
bills 50% on average for

618
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:11,278
subscribers

619
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,759
subscribers estimated at about $500 per

620
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:16,159
year and the project restored native

621
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:18,960
ecology including pollinator habitats

622
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,960
and Native Plant

623
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:24,759
Landscaping closed landfills are

624
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,879
particularly promising sites for hosting

625
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:29,000
solar

626
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:32,120
energy um they are condu have conducive

627
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,599
site conditions as landfills typically

628
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:36,678
have good sun exposure and other

629
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:37,719
characteristics that support solar

630
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:40,798
energy

631
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:43,960
installation there are limited reuse opt

632
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:46,639
options so closed landfills don't really

633
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,880
have competing Redevelopment options um

634
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,840
so it avoids land use

635
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,640
conflicts environmental justice landfill

636
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:57,759
solar offers a sustainable non-hazardous

637
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,919
reuse of sites that were often prior

638
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:03,200
area of environmental Injustice and

639
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:04,519
there's a potential for scale as there

640
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,798
are tens of thousands of active

641
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:10,159
landfills in the US and many thousands

642
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:12,398
more that are already closed and

643
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:15,320
inactive brightfields can also create

644
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:18,119
local jobs here's an example in Houston

645
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:20,599
Texas the world's largest landfill solar

646
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:22,639
farm is planned for and permitted in a

647
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:25,319
lowincome historically marginalized

648
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:29,720
Sunnyside neighborhood this is the 52

649
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:32,599
megawatt project on 208 on a 280 acre

650
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:35,440
closed landfill it's expected to power

651
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:38,359
about 12,000 homes and the project

652
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:42,880
includes a solar training program aimed

653
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:45,319
at bolstering a local and Regional

654
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,399
Workforce brightfields are certainly not

655
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:49,720
without their

656
00:28:47,398 --> 00:28:53,158
complications there's the assessment and

657
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,278
cleanup costs associated with creating a

658
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:57,840
brightfield there's federal state and

659
00:28:55,278 --> 00:29:01,359
local regulations the permanent zoning

660
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:04,839
land use and environmental reviews add

661
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:07,278
complexity there's the site remediation

662
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:09,639
timeline um there's remediation that

663
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:11,640
needs to be completed before a project

664
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,679
construction there's the liability

665
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,240
concerns between stakeholders it's

666
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,399
important to have Clarity on the

667
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,240
liability before you go into procurement

668
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:22,079
to find a

669
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:25,399
developer and finally gritting inner

670
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:27,398
connection costs and timelines can vary

671
00:29:25,398 --> 00:29:29,678
substantially between projects due to

672
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:33,319
the existing infrastructure and this has

673
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:36,440
the potential to seriously drive up

674
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:38,639
costs landfill solar May face various

675
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,558
additional challenges and complications

676
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,960
there's the cap consideration caps need

677
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:45,839
to be closed um and you need to make

678
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:49,720
sure the technology does not penetrate

679
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:51,398
the cap there's settlement concerns um

680
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,440
so you need to make sure there's not

681
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:54,879
high rates of settlement um before

682
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,399
installing

683
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,679
solar existing infrastructure and

684
00:29:57,398 --> 00:30:02,038
operations you'll need the solar panels

685
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,038
to accommodate any on-site

686
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:08,079
infrastructure there's really not much

687
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:10,440
electricity demand for uh landfills and

688
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:13,278
so there may be some more utility

689
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,840
coordination required to find someone to

690
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:18,798
buy the power and then there could be

691
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,398
Community concerns um projects need to

692
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:23,519
consider potential long-standing

693
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:25,918
environmental justice and site reuse

694
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:28,399
concerns and interde departmental

695
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,440
coordination landfills stuff that

696
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:31,759
happens on landfills and solar is not

697
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,640
going to fit nicely into one

698
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:36,158
Department's

699
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:39,200
perview finally I'll go quickly through

700
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:42,519
our technical assistance as I said we

701
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,919
are a uh partner with the tab uh Network

702
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:47,720
for EPA regions 5 through 10 and this

703
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,200
technical assistance is free for

704
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:53,240
communities in those

705
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,440
areas um the technical assistance that's

706
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,159
available we help with identifying your

707
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,240
most promising bright Fields opportunity

708
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:03,320
funding and financing

709
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,359
guidance um and accelerating brightfield

710
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:07,158
procurement we offer insights from the

711
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:09,439
brightfield market to support the

712
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:11,519
procurement

713
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,679
process um and finally if you're

714
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,359
interested in learning more or receiving

715
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,080
technical assistance for a brightfield

716
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:21,038
project here's my contact information

717
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:23,278
and um our website and I'll just add one

718
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:26,200
one last thing I mentioned we we provide

719
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:29,119
the TA for communities in regions 5

720
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:33,159
through 10 although we are are beginning

721
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:37,000
to um work um we're accepting

722
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:40,000
applications for environmental justice

723
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,880
specific uh projects that are located

724
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,720
across the country so if anyone who's

725
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,080
not located in regions 5 through 10 is

726
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:51,558
interested in um getting some technical

727
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:54,558
assistance for revitalizing a site for

728
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:56,720
clean energy reuse and it specifically

729
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,480
supports environmental justice we have a

730
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,600
new um

731
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,319
technical assistance program for that so

732
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:06,319
please email me if that's the

733
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:09,240
case all right and with that I'll stop

734
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:12,720
sharing my screen and pass it back to

735
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:15,120
Jennifer or maybe vinent tany can you

736
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:20,159
just tell us quickly geographically what

737
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:22,518
are regions 5 through 10 uh sure it

738
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:25,278
is um let me

739
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:29,759
just get back this

740
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:33,119
map um oops

741
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:37,158
so 5 through 10 is going to be the

742
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:38,278
Midwest and uh and over just looking at

743
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:41,519
this map

744
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:45,759
here and just before you leave it right

745
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,720
um so Carrie you are doing regions two

746
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:51,319
and

747
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:55,519
three oh and four yeah sorry

748
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:58,918
um that was a older graphic yeah it's

749
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,839
all good um okay so but all we're

750
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:03,360
missing is the Northeast and the

751
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:05,480
southeast correct regions one is New

752
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:07,558
England and Region Three is the

753
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:11,120
Mid-Atlantic uh so New England is

754
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:13,879
covered by Yukon and the Mid-Atlantic is

755
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:17,678
three which is covered by West Virginia

756
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:20,720
University um New England states Maine

757
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,798
Vermont Rhode Island

758
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,798
Massachusetts uh

759
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:29,558
Connecticut um Vermont New Hampshire and

760
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:32,558
then Mid-Atlantic being uh delw Delaware

761
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:34,839
Maryland Virginia West Virginia and

762
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:40,000
Pennsylvania but you're covering region

763
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:43,278
four Carrie I am yes oh okay

764
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,519
great how come I mean just okay we it's

765
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:48,880
not important

766
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,880
um all right but we have most so most

767
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,240
everybody who will be on this call

768
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,720
should be in one of your two regions and

769
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,839
if not you could help them find the

770
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:02,639
person in their appropriate region

771
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:04,918
correct correct yeah okay so and just

772
00:34:02,638 --> 00:34:08,159
one more quick question before we leave

773
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:12,000
the brightfields component of this talk

774
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:14,878
sure of the zillion locations that you

775
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,918
identified tany forgive me for not rec

776
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:19,960
remembering was 190,000 brown right in

777
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:24,000
the

778
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:26,878
country are there regions where there

779
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,199
have we has someone mapped the spots

780
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:34,279
that are most most productive for solar

781
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:36,239
and what regions are those so that in

782
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,839
other words if our audience is in New

783
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:41,319
Hampshire and there's like zero relevant

784
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:43,358
sites then this is not so appropriate

785
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:46,559
for them but are there some states that

786
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:50,039
have huge opportunity just because they

787
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:53,320
happen to have an unfortunate number of

788
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:56,000
brownfields good question I'll send the

789
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:59,119
link in the chat there's repower EPA

790
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,159
does um has a map that Maps out all the

791
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,960
sites that I was just referring to

792
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:06,039
and I mean you can see which areas are a

793
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,880
little bit more

794
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:12,199
dense looks like uh Minnesota and

795
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:15,000
Wisconsin have quite a few but they're

796
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:17,679
all over the country so I would say

797
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,880
every state should

798
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:23,799
be uh interested in the brightfields

799
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,320
opportunity and we work with communities

800
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,760
in the northern part of the country that

801
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,640
maybe they're not going to have

802
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,880
you know solar isn't going to be quite

803
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:37,358
as productive there as maybe it will in

804
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:39,440
Southern California but um States like

805
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:42,159
Michigan and Washington and

806
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,760
Massachusetts are all really invested in

807
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:47,279
solar and um they're going to be

808
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,520
deploying solar at the the same rate

809
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,519
that other states will

810
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:59,039
be so I'm going to Pivot us a little bit

811
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:02,199
we've been talking about how we deal

812
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:04,559
with formerly productive areas and make

813
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:08,358
productive use of them what we can do to

814
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:12,199
take advantage of things and

815
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:14,078
um I would be uh remiss if I didn't say

816
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:17,439
that these are really important programs

817
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:20,640
right but when it comes down to trying

818
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,519
to find customers or off-takers for this

819
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:24,480
you can have significant challenges

820
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:28,039
right so if you've got large solar

821
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,800
capacity and you've got utility that

822
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:32,119
don't want to or don't have to buy it uh

823
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,680
because they have their own existing

824
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:37,400
resources or you don't have a framework

825
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:39,879
to meet with customers and see what they

826
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,519
need and how that can meet their demands

827
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,960
it can become a kind of frustrating

828
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:46,000
experience so I'm going to talk to you

829
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:50,720
guys a little bit about solar for all

830
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:53,318
which is uh another EPA program that uh

831
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:56,239
has avoided well had a little hiccup and

832
00:36:53,318 --> 00:36:59,119
has avoided most of the let's call it

833
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:01,318
uncertainty that EX existed funds seem

834
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,318
to be flowing uh everybody who I've

835
00:37:01,318 --> 00:37:06,358
talked to on these programs in different

836
00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:08,719
states um has been able to draw down

837
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:11,440
their uh formerly

838
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:13,279
unresponsive uh EPA Representatives have

839
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,960
started responding to emails and setting

840
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:19,560
up meetings again so it seems like we

841
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:23,960
are on a a productive and hopefully

842
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:23,960
sustainable path with regards to Sol for

843
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,039
all there we go um just a quick note

844
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,680
about

845
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:31,480
where I work I work for the North

846
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:33,078
Carolina clean energy Technology Center

847
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:36,679
we are a public service center that was

848
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:38,599
chartered by the UNCC system in the 80s

849
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:43,480
originally as the North Carolina solar

850
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:47,359
center we do mostly sustainable energy

851
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:51,119
economy uh analysis we provide objective

852
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:53,480
uh simulations data our claim to fame is

853
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,000
desire USA it's the database of State

854
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:58,599
incentives for Renewables and uh Energy

855
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,358
Efficiency we don't really advocate for

856
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:03,800
anything other than just kind of broadly

857
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:05,960
sustainable energy and uh we host an

858
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,560
energy conference and have Partnerships

859
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,358
with the smart electric uh Power

860
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:11,799
Association and the solar energy

861
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:13,480
Industries Association Along with

862
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:17,560
several

863
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:20,679
others um there we go so when we talk

864
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:24,480
about solar for all in Most states uh

865
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:27,000
there were coalitions some were kind of

866
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,440
let's called monoliths but energize NC

867
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,079
which is what the North Carolina solar

868
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,039
for all uh program is called is a

869
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:34,359
partnership between my Center the clean

870
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:38,239
energy fund which is North Carolina's

871
00:38:34,358 --> 00:38:41,598
Green Bank Advanced Energy which is a um

872
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:43,000
kind of utilities services and uh

873
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,400
consulting company that does mostly

874
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,079
nonprofit work and the North Carolina

875
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,880
Department of Environmental Quality the

876
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:51,760
DQ is our Prime on this so they are the

877
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:55,640
applicant and we are

878
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:58,280
Partners um solar for all requires us to

879
00:38:55,639 --> 00:39:00,440
touch rural communities it requires us

880
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:04,839
to touch disadvantaged communities so

881
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:07,318
these communities um have been

882
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:10,078
underserved chronically for decades

883
00:39:07,318 --> 00:39:11,719
perhaps even generations and so the goal

884
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,680
of the program is to deliver them a 20%

885
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:16,000
savings on their electric bill uh we've

886
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:18,239
got to come over we've got to kind of

887
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,199
get over a lot of hurdles when it comes

888
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:21,719
to this right we've got to find the

889
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:24,519
people we've got to talk with the people

890
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:26,279
we've got to get the people's trust and

891
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:28,159
then actually provide them something for

892
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,880
a meaningful amount of time right so

893
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:32,078
we've seen I don't know how many of you

894
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,440
have been in the industry for long

895
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:37,240
periods of time but in the early 2000s

896
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,679
there was kind of a bubble around solar

897
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:41,838
thermal Technologies and solar thermal

898
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:43,879
Technologies uh got really heavily

899
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:47,920
incentivized and that ended up with a

900
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:50,680
lot of Fly by Night operations so um

901
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,838
this is a find the people protect the

902
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:56,919
people provide people's Services kind of

903
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:58,480
thing um so I've got really long program

904
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,920
objectives but these are the important

905
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,800
parts right so we're delivering

906
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,960
benefits to communities low-income

907
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,880
communities and disadvantage prioritized

908
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,960
and all of the funds are enabling them

909
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,280
to benefit from some type of zero

910
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,240
emissions technology right so if we can

911
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:19,560
if we had a situation like uh like New

912
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:22,078
Jersey right where they have adders

913
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:23,679
where you can uh add uh you get

914
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,640
additional incentives for developing on

915
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:30,358
ground Fields right whether it be um mon

916
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:32,239
incentives some localities do uh

917
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:33,759
expedited permitting that kind of stuff

918
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:35,559
it actually makes it cheaper to offer

919
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,079
these right so we're looking within the

920
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:39,559
confines of North Carolina because this

921
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:41,400
is North Carolina's solar for all uh we

922
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:44,519
don't have that kind of benefit right so

923
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,440
we're we're looking at some brown field

924
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:47,800
development some green field development

925
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,119
but that's kind of we're in the planning

926
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,440
year right now a lot of rooftop solar

927
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:55,160
some Community

928
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:57,358
solar um and then we look at our goals

929
00:40:55,159 --> 00:41:00,960
again lots of words the important words

930
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:02,559
are getting input oh I'm sorry wiinston

931
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:08,480
can you tell people briefly what

932
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:11,199
community solar is oh sure so um imagine

933
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,318
that you were in an apartment or a house

934
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:15,799
with beautiful uh well shaded trees or

935
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:19,119
or something like that or you were a

936
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:23,280
renter didn't have access to uh a roof

937
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:26,519
on which to put a 4K W 6kw array right

938
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,880
so instead of getting solar on your roof

939
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:30,039
because you don't own or because you

940
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:33,079
don't want to cut down your trees you

941
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:35,318
would find either your local utility or

942
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:37,039
perhaps even a uh a subscriber

943
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:40,119
organization of some description it

944
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:43,119
works in different flavors in different

945
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:46,838
uh States and regions so you could then

946
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,680
subscribe to uh solar output that would

947
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:51,880
be credited against your bill as though

948
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:54,879
those panels were on your roof so we

949
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:57,760
have um several cooperatives in North

950
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,920
Carolina that offer this um you

951
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,160
basically buy a per panel subscription

952
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:06,720
you pay a fee per month and you get

953
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:09,239
credited that amount of uh of generation

954
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:13,759
on your electric bill

955
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:15,799
um sometimes it is a cost premium

956
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,640
program where a subscription costs more

957
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:22,200
than the savings it delivers um and in

958
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:24,358
in other cases it's a break even or or

959
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:27,318
benefit within the context of solar for

960
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:29,558
all because we have to deliver a benefit

961
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:32,279
we are looking at Community solar

962
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:34,880
programs again kind of limited to North

963
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:37,559
Carolina that uh either are cost

964
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,358
beneficial or we will buy down that

965
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:42,079
subscription cost to deliver those

966
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:45,679
benefits uh I will say that the center

967
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:49,318
RIT large has worked on community solar

968
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:51,519
for uh a little over a decade in various

969
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:54,400
capacities um we've worked on community

970
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:57,599
solar in the Southeast in several

971
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:00,280
different ways um working with

972
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,039
industrial tenants uh or industrial

973
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,240
sites to provide what's called an anchor

974
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:05,920
tenant right so they would develop

975
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:08,039
Community solar they would develop a

976
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:11,079
solar array take some of that energy and

977
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:13,440
offer uh lowcost subscriptions to to

978
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:16,359
folks who live nearby uh that's always

979
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,318
an interesting model

980
00:43:16,358 --> 00:43:21,239
um but mostly it is just a way of

981
00:43:19,318 --> 00:43:24,079
getting access to Solar without having

982
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:25,519
to have it on your property or not

983
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,960
having to own the

984
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:32,679
property so we're big proponents of it

985
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:34,760
where it's where it's uh ractical so um

986
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:37,118
within the confines of energize and c

987
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,680
and also our previous Community solar uh

988
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:42,240
discussions right we're trying to get

989
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:44,039
input from the folks who would use this

990
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:45,719
right so we want to get community input

991
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:47,679
we want to get residents input we want

992
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:50,399
to be representative in who we're

993
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:52,440
getting right so we have we have some

994
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,800
communities that are really really like

995
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:57,318
philanthropically enabled and they are

996
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,200
kind of activated right so they're very

997
00:43:57,318 --> 00:44:00,960
quick to respond and they're very uh

998
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:02,279
robust Partners but we want to make sure

999
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,358
the folks that have not historically

1000
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,960
been uh uh selected or have not self-

1001
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:09,519
selected actually get some input on this

1002
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,199
so trying to go through our tribal

1003
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:15,280
communities our state recognized our

1004
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:17,239
federally recognized tribes uh for all

1005
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,280
of the regions there are 100 counties in

1006
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:22,279
North Carolina who are trying to touch

1007
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:25,000
the vast majority of them that are not

1008
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:27,640
uh almost exclusively above the federal

1009
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,239
poverty um so it's all about Community

1010
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:33,480
engagement we do this uh in a lot of

1011
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:37,838
ways in the center

1012
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:40,679
um backwards now we go forwards okay um

1013
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:44,960
so I'm actually G to go out of order so

1014
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:48,159
we started off in uh mid 2023 starting

1015
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,760
to reach out to communities um and then

1016
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:52,639
we had a a market development Workshop

1017
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,319
what is market development well it means

1018
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:56,679
that well we don't have a rooftop solar

1019
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:58,318
industry that's very robust in North

1020
00:44:56,679 --> 00:44:59,598
Carolina we don't have a community solar

1021
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:01,639
industry that's very robust in North

1022
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,559
Carolina because the incentives just

1023
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:05,639
aren't there we looked at it and we had

1024
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:07,920
folks from South Carolina Virginia from

1025
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:09,799
from Tennessee come and like consult on

1026
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,000
us and and tell us what they're doing

1027
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,400
what they're doing differently we had

1028
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,199
some really interesting conversations

1029
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,639
with folks from Georgia and we reached

1030
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:16,879
out to utilities and said all right

1031
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:18,358
what's your problem with this or what do

1032
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,000
you like about this what's what's going

1033
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:23,759
on and so just our goal was engagement

1034
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,679
at all levels right so we've got state

1035
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,640
government we've got local governments

1036
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:31,078
we've got Utilities in this we've got

1037
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:32,639
program listening sessions we've got

1038
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:34,599
strategy sessions and then we're doing

1039
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:38,759
Outreach and coordination based on

1040
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:42,119
topics so our overall program launch

1041
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:44,240
timeline is late 2025 we will launch our

1042
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:46,480
full solar forall program right so we've

1043
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:50,199
had a almost a full year of planning

1044
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:52,039
period at this point and we are shaping

1045
00:45:50,199 --> 00:45:55,519
what the single family incentives will

1046
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:58,920
be what the uh what if there will be

1047
00:45:55,519 --> 00:46:03,199
market rate uh loans available and what

1048
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:06,200
community solar will be um so it

1049
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:08,039
is screaming up at us quick fast in a

1050
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:10,799
hurry so I'm going to talk a little bit

1051
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:14,079
about the Outreach that we did uh

1052
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:17,920
hopefully to uh provide some lessons

1053
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:20,960
learned um I'm not going to be too uh

1054
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:24,720
long over this but uh we start again

1055
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:27,119
with kind of the biggest players in the

1056
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:29,558
bulk power sector so we start with the i

1057
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,039
use Duke and we have two flavors of Duke

1058
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:34,880
Energy in North Carolina Duke Energy

1059
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:37,119
Carol and Duke Energy Progress they have

1060
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,358
slightly different approaches slightly

1061
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:42,599
different tariffs slightly different

1062
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:45,719
rate structures so we engaged them on

1063
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:47,039
both fronts and uh also Dominion Energy

1064
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:49,639
operates a little bit in northeastern

1065
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:51,440
North Carolina that is our only Market

1066
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:53,598
access so we get a little bit of access

1067
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,800
to pjm if we develop projects in

1068
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,720
northeastern North Carolina we also

1069
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,200
worked with electric operatives for

1070
00:46:57,719 --> 00:47:02,598
those of you who are not familiar with

1071
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:04,078
the way utilities kind of break down um

1072
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:06,318
investor owned utilities are just that

1073
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,359
they're owned by investors they're large

1074
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:10,759
publicly traded companies uh electric

1075
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:12,239
cooperatives are member owned

1076
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,359
organizations that were enabled by the

1077
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:18,078
rural electrification act so they have

1078
00:47:14,358 --> 00:47:20,318
member owners and uh tend to be smaller

1079
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,119
in North Carolina they are largely

1080
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:25,000
distribution utilities meaning they

1081
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:26,400
don't own a lot of their own Generation

1082
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,719
Um and in some cases are actually

1083
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,599
prohibit or Limited in the amount of

1084
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:32,118
self-generation and Energy Efficiency

1085
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:33,440
they can deploy and then we have

1086
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:36,000
Municipal Power authorities that's when

1087
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,519
a city owns uh a deployment

1088
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,079
infrastructure and a power plant I

1089
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:41,519
should say and or a power plant because

1090
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,960
of the

1091
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:46,440
hund some odd 104 maybe Municipal Power

1092
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,000
authorities we have in North Carolina

1093
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,720
only half a dozen or so have any

1094
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,519
significant form of generation over over

1095
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:55,558
a megawatt um so we talked with all of

1096
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:56,960
these folks and we're we're currently in

1097
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:58,440
conversations with all of these folks as

1098
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,240
you can imagine these conversations take

1099
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,760
a while when there are 26 cooperatives

1100
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:07,519
100 uh 100 power authorities and two

1101
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:09,319
utilities uh so uh just a lot of a lot

1102
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:11,159
of talking about where are your

1103
00:48:09,318 --> 00:48:13,838
underserved customers where are your

1104
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:16,199
reliability issues what else could could

1105
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:19,639
we deliver non-monetary benefits to

1106
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:23,039
people so we start to shape right we

1107
00:48:19,639 --> 00:48:25,318
look at the geography that um is

1108
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:28,279
informed by income then we talk with the

1109
00:48:25,318 --> 00:48:30,358
utilities that serve those GE Ries to

1110
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,160
kind of further hone down where we're

1111
00:48:30,358 --> 00:48:34,920
going then we engage with local

1112
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:36,039
governments and local governments are

1113
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,599
wonderful places but they are

1114
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:39,800
chronically understaffed um some of you

1115
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:42,160
have probably worked with local

1116
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:44,640
governments and there's like five people

1117
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:47,838
doing the work of two dozen and they do

1118
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:49,519
amazing work so we actually leaned on uh

1119
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:51,039
councils of government so in North

1120
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:52,960
Carolina there are several councils of

1121
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:55,599
government in South Carolina as well

1122
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:58,240
that kind of aggregate some uh

1123
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:00,798
multicounty services and provide us with

1124
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:03,798
contacts and provide us with uh you know

1125
00:49:00,798 --> 00:49:05,798
kind of facilitate interactions um so

1126
00:49:03,798 --> 00:49:08,039
beyond going to just the county just the

1127
00:49:05,798 --> 00:49:10,480
locality just the just the specific

1128
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:12,599
Community or city or town right we would

1129
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,719
talk with the uh Council of government

1130
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:14,798
we would talk with the County

1131
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:17,318
Commissioners we would talk with the

1132
00:49:14,798 --> 00:49:18,280
league municipalities to say okay well

1133
00:49:17,318 --> 00:49:20,079
great these people don't have the

1134
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,680
bandwidth for it but they really need it

1135
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:24,119
can you provide some of this information

1136
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:26,239
on on their behalf can you give us some

1137
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:27,720
folks that are into this on their behalf

1138
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:30,558
we also talk talk with Housing Finance

1139
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:32,480
because multif family is a big challenge

1140
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,960
in the Solar space right I mean

1141
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,798
Community solar is its own beast and you

1142
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:40,199
can provide a lot of solar access to

1143
00:49:37,798 --> 00:49:42,599
multif family dwellings by assigning

1144
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:44,960
individual subscriptions but what would

1145
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:48,119
it look like if a multi if an apartment

1146
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,358
complex right had a South had a parking

1147
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:51,559
had a parking lot with a Southern

1148
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:54,558
Exposure that you could then put

1149
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:57,280
panels um then we talked with very

1150
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,720
heavily with Community organizations um

1151
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,920
the community organizations are the

1152
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:02,759
folks that are in the communities on a

1153
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:05,920
day-to-day basis right some of these are

1154
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,720
folks that um have been there for

1155
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:11,680
weatherization assistance programs have

1156
00:50:07,719 --> 00:50:15,519
been there for food drives and and new

1157
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:19,960
uh various Civic needs right so these we

1158
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:21,559
kind of locked in on as our real

1159
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:24,679
Advantage right because if you come in

1160
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:27,359
and say hey I am from you know your

1161
00:50:24,679 --> 00:50:30,598
state capital and you are you know hours

1162
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:32,598
away um in a in a locality that has

1163
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:34,440
chronically been underserved you have no

1164
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:36,039
credit right you have no they have no

1165
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,639
reason to trust you you can provide them

1166
00:50:36,039 --> 00:50:39,599
with all of the beautiful presentations

1167
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:42,199
that you want and I can talk as fast as

1168
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:44,680
I need to but they still won't trust me

1169
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:46,960
right but when we make this case to

1170
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:49,039
Interfaith Power and Light sadly the

1171
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,760
national uh Interfaith Power and Light

1172
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:53,318
seems to have have uh folded but North

1173
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,760
Carolina's interface power and light is

1174
00:50:53,318 --> 00:50:56,440
still is still active the Council of

1175
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,839
churches the leue of conservation voters

1176
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:00,240
right we've talked with these people and

1177
00:50:58,838 --> 00:51:02,679
they're connecting us directly with the

1178
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:06,078
communities that need the most support

1179
00:51:02,679 --> 00:51:07,639
and so uh trying to work with folks that

1180
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,720
we have existing relationships with

1181
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:12,239
former relationships with and make new

1182
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:15,598
connections where we're needed um is

1183
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:17,279
really the key so it's it's you know

1184
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:20,720
narrowing down where you want to focus

1185
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:25,119
and then trying to get to the people

1186
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:27,318
um so uh I'm I'm going to I'm going to

1187
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:31,960
cut this now

1188
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:33,798
and just say uh thank you and uh this is

1189
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:38,000
really exciting trying to figure out how

1190
00:51:33,798 --> 00:51:39,798
to provide services to uh chronically

1191
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,239
underserved communities and trying to

1192
00:51:39,798 --> 00:51:45,239
put to

1193
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:49,118
useful uh uh or productive use formerly

1194
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:51,039
used uh lands um tany I'm going to ask

1195
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:55,318
you a little bit of an unfair question

1196
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:57,798
at just a moment uh so I worked on solar

1197
00:51:55,318 --> 00:51:59,119
decommissioning with uh some of my my

1198
00:51:57,798 --> 00:52:00,639
colleagues we produce a solar

1199
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,400
decommissioning report and that led us

1200
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:05,798
to the energy and mineral law foundation

1201
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:08,240
and they have a huge how can we put

1202
00:52:05,798 --> 00:52:10,239
solar on reclaimed mind lants and I

1203
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:13,919
don't know if that I don't know if you

1204
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:16,519
RMI has ever worked with those or emlf

1205
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,400
but if not I think that's worth uh

1206
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:19,759
discussing otherwise I say thank you

1207
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,440
very

1208
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,119
much yeah we we do some work with

1209
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,720
reclaim mind lands we haven't worked

1210
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:30,318
directly with any communities that that

1211
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:32,519
want to do that quite yet but we have

1212
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:35,440
some in the works that might happen soon

1213
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:37,719
and we had our intern doing research on

1214
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:40,079
that specifically last summer so we

1215
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:42,519
should chat for a couple reasons I think

1216
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:46,318
we said

1217
00:52:42,519 --> 00:52:49,880
yeah David do you have

1218
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:53,358
questions I can I always have questions

1219
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:56,640
um so here here uh you know I think

1220
00:52:53,358 --> 00:53:00,318
these uh by the way I work on a lot on

1221
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:02,759
different aspects of the solar sighting

1222
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:04,599
questions and so my question comes a

1223
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:06,079
little bit out of that which is and I

1224
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:08,760
work more on large

1225
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:12,760
scale um and I'm in New

1226
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:14,359
York um so you know one of the things

1227
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:17,359
that I just wonder if you each have

1228
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:20,480
perspectives on

1229
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:27,279
uh PL you know to decarbonize we're

1230
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:30,599
trying to uh locate a lot of uh new

1231
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:32,960
distributed in large scale uh

1232
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:34,599
electricity on places so do when you

1233
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,480
kind of think about this do you think

1234
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:37,838
about this I'm going to put it in in one

1235
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,519
way do you think about it more from kind

1236
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:42,960
of a Community Development

1237
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:45,119
perspective when you're interacting with

1238
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,760
the land owners and the people or do you

1239
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:49,760
think about it more from the perspective

1240
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,720
uh and that would be like on bright

1241
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:55,160
fields and brownfields like hey this is

1242
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:56,838
a this is a problem in the community and

1243
00:53:55,159 --> 00:53:58,759
we need to solve the problem problem

1244
00:53:56,838 --> 00:54:01,838
that's there or do you think it more

1245
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:04,720
from a perspective of we're in the

1246
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:07,440
middle of an energy transition that

1247
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:09,679
where we need as much sort of clean

1248
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,559
energy as we can get and this is an

1249
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:13,318
opportunity that or is it really an

1250
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:15,798
equal mix of both of those or something

1251
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:18,679
else that you're

1252
00:54:15,798 --> 00:54:20,239
doing Terry do you want to take a first

1253
00:54:18,679 --> 00:54:22,759
stab and I

1254
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:25,798
King yeah what I tried to model in my

1255
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:28,200
presentation and something I really um

1256
00:54:25,798 --> 00:54:31,119
strongly believe is that things like

1257
00:54:28,199 --> 00:54:34,159
solar energy in particular have um a lot

1258
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:38,960
of co- benefits to them

1259
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:43,000
um um as I you know explained you can

1260
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:47,720
have solar arrays on you know warehouses

1261
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:50,880
you can have Community solar um you can

1262
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:54,439
integrate like solar into these large

1263
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:57,440
warehouse and distribution facilities um

1264
00:54:54,440 --> 00:55:00,000
and as well I come from more of a hazard

1265
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:03,440
mitigation background um and so I'd like

1266
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,000
to stress the fact that um a lot of f

1267
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:08,838
places have above ground

1268
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,920
utilities and during um natural

1269
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:15,279
disasters those can get um damage and I

1270
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:17,318
like experienced Sandy here and

1271
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,280
Hurricane Sandy here in uh New Jersey

1272
00:55:17,318 --> 00:55:22,079
and we were out of power for many many

1273
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:25,519
days and some folks have generators some

1274
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:28,240
don't and you know distributed energy

1275
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:33,280
through things like micro grids is a way

1276
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:36,279
to add redundancy to the grid um and to

1277
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:41,839
make it so

1278
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:45,240
um and to to mitigate the amount of time

1279
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:51,038
that uh Power is down during those

1280
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:53,719
disaster events um there are ways to

1281
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:55,760
discuss the ample

1282
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:58,838
benefits environmentally and

1283
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:02,079
economically resilience wise of solar

1284
00:55:58,838 --> 00:56:04,038
that need not even touch on

1285
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:07,640
decarbonization yeah I will say that

1286
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:11,119
we're involved in a a doe raser project

1287
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:14,519
looking at uh Community microgrids right

1288
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:16,960
so what would so solar storage even

1289
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:18,559
diesel backup for to meet to meet

1290
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:21,358
Community needs kind of maximizing

1291
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,359
existing Community

1292
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:28,000
Access thank you can I can I ask a

1293
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:30,199
follow-up question which has to do with

1294
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:36,000
storage we didn't talk so much about

1295
00:56:30,199 --> 00:56:37,919
storage today but um since these sites

1296
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,679
at least the Brownfield sites but I

1297
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:44,280
suppose also when we're thinking about

1298
00:56:40,679 --> 00:56:46,838
um homeowners and rooftop solar right

1299
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:49,640
these ways in which we can start

1300
00:56:46,838 --> 00:56:53,400
integrating in our Solar or renewable

1301
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:55,879
energy project storage so that we're

1302
00:56:53,400 --> 00:57:00,280
enhancing the strength of the grid and

1303
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:02,519
we're not not dumping any of the any of

1304
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:04,798
the Surplus energy that's happening at a

1305
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:08,440
moment that isn't being able to be used

1306
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:10,798
so could any of you speak to your

1307
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:13,920
complementary like storage with

1308
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:16,798
renewable energy capture a

1309
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:19,599
agendas yeah I I'll just say we always

1310
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:23,920
look for opportunities for storage if it

1311
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:27,039
can be collocated with solar or or wind

1312
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:29,000
um it certainly makes the

1313
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:34,640
project uh well depending on the

1314
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:37,280
community if there is a um a grid you

1315
00:57:34,639 --> 00:57:40,440
know the grid is already maxed out and

1316
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:42,359
they need a battery so that they can

1317
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,920
still build the Solar without losing the

1318
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:46,239
power that they generate that might be a

1319
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,318
really good example of when a battery is

1320
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:51,479
a good idea we worked with a community

1321
00:57:48,318 --> 00:57:55,798
in uh Wyoming who wanted to hook up to

1322
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:58,159
an existing substation that was uh

1323
00:57:55,798 --> 00:58:00,358
already connected to wind and they

1324
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:03,000
wanted to connect solar there so you

1325
00:58:00,358 --> 00:58:04,759
would have a hybrid connection but so

1326
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,798
that you don't lose the power from the

1327
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:08,160
solar while the wind is blowing you know

1328
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:10,280
the wind is blowing and the sun is

1329
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:12,679
shining at the same time that was a

1330
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:14,599
really good time to install a battery

1331
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:17,279
the the big thing is that it it drives

1332
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:20,400
up costs quite a bit batteries are

1333
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:23,359
expensive um but if you can afford it

1334
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,039
it's a great idea yeah especially from

1335
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:26,960
the the household perspective right we

1336
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:29,680
see um

1337
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:31,559
a lot of smaller utilities uh throughout

1338
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:34,879
the throughout the southeast and some

1339
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:37,480
even like a various cooperatives have

1340
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:40,318
non-export or zero export tariffs right

1341
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:42,280
so you cannot export to the Grid at all

1342
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:44,199
so the only way to feasibly site solar

1343
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:46,079
would be to either severely undersize

1344
00:58:44,199 --> 00:58:48,318
your array so that you're only meeting

1345
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:49,960
that kind of peak load or you can size

1346
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:54,558
it to meet household consumption

1347
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:56,920
approximately and then have uh a uh a

1348
00:58:54,559 --> 00:59:00,039
battery to kind of provide opportunities

1349
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,039
to actually use that power

1350
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:05,559
meaningfully Just as a side note we're

1351
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:08,240
up at time but if anybody has

1352
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:10,920
suggestions on speakers on different

1353
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:14,558
kinds of storage and the benefits and

1354
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:16,358
the issues with installing uh different

1355
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:18,798
kinds of storage systems right I mean

1356
00:59:16,358 --> 00:59:21,920
there are risks associated with them as

1357
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:24,759
well um please send them back Channel

1358
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:28,200
there's one last question from Kristoff

1359
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:30,640
I'm in West Michigan our utility uh

1360
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:33,399
creates many interconnection barriers

1361
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:36,078
that make Community owned Community

1362
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:38,200
solar impossible they're looking for

1363
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:40,480
ways around this while still providing

1364
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:42,960
options for the community to own the

1365
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:45,719
array yeah Kristoff I think there's lots

1366
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:48,358
of problems like that uh any comments

1367
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:51,399
from this panel before we close up for

1368
00:59:48,358 --> 00:59:53,719
today just before we hopped on Vincent

1369
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:56,079
and I were talking about Community solar

1370
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:58,078
issues and we're working in Michigan

1371
00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:01,880
quite heavily with the state and with

1372
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:03,280
communities there and so Kristoff if you

1373
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,599
if we can if it's not brightfield

1374
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,039
related we can point you in the right

1375
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:08,119
direction and if it is brightfield

1376
01:00:06,039 --> 01:00:09,760
related um we should definitely talk

1377
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:14,160
about your work in

1378
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:17,160
Michigan uh I will say that um there

1379
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:19,838
there is a direct workaround that is

1380
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:23,480
financial rather than energy right so if

1381
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:25,639
you have a u perpa compliant a

1382
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:27,079
qualifying facility in consumer

1383
01:00:25,639 --> 01:00:29,078
territory that they have to offer a

1384
01:00:27,079 --> 01:00:30,960
standard offer to and you have a

1385
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:33,680
community that owns that they can then

1386
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:36,760
distribute all revenue from that energy

1387
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:40,000
injection back to its owners so that's

1388
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:43,000
typically called a community benefits

1389
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
LLC

1390
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:50,160
construct great a community benefits LLC

1391
01:00:47,159 --> 01:00:51,639
maybe we should have a webinar on that

1392
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:53,798
there are a lot of Novel strategies to

1393
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:56,519
get over and around interconnection

1394
01:00:53,798 --> 01:00:59,239
concerns so

1395
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:02,239
all right well this has been a fantastic

1396
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:04,118
panel thank you so much for uh sharing

1397
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:09,279
your wisdom and your

1398
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:13,240
experience um and please look if you're

1399
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:14,680
interested on our YouTube channel uh for

1400
01:01:13,239 --> 01:01:17,399
this and other

1401
01:01:14,679 --> 01:01:21,000
recordings and our next webinar I

p.m. Eastern Standard Time and it will

1404
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:28,480
be on 1 uh 1 Earth Earth and climate

1405
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,119
topics thinking

1406
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:35,440
holistically about all kinds of things

1407
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:38,838
from microbes to animal agriculture to

1408
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:41,358
human health as as as a way of looking

1409
01:01:38,838 --> 01:01:43,199
forward on climate thanks again to all

1410
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:45,798
of our speakers and to all of our
