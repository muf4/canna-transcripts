1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,719
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:10,919
University okay well then uh I'd like to

3
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:13,798
just take a moment here to to to thank

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:15,320
Dr Taylor uh as well here that I've had

5
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:17,118
the pleasure of working with him on

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,640
number as he mentioned a number of

7
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:21,559
presentations he' done for us and uh I

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,760
know whenever he does make it to a why

9
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:25,479
it's uh usually a great opportunity to

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,320
to go to lunch or something and and

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,519
discuss uh things that have changed in

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,320
the industry you know the different

13
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:34,039
Trends and he's uh always uh a wealth of

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,878
information on some of the you know the

15
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:37,878
more specialized SE treatment

16
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:39,759
applications and some of his research

17
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:41,119
and uh I can show them a little bit on

18
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,280
what we see on the equipment and so

19
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,640
forth so uh today it's uh kind of a

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,879
pleasure to be able to uh to share some

21
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,280
of it without having to get on an

22
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,519
airplane and fly someplace uh so there

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,600
are you know some mixed advantages I

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,239
guess in the uh situation where

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,640
everything seems to be on Zoom these

26
00:00:55,238 --> 00:01:00,358
days but um also I am I am trying out a

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,799
few pieces of Technology as is we're

28
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,478
we're we're debating what to do with our

29
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:06,280
workshops for this next year and uh so

30
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,879
uh we want to be able to do some but

31
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,960
virtually if we need to and um I'm

32
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:14,319
testing part of that in technology here

33
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:16,319
today uh so uh we'll uh is is they like

34
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,319
to say you know technolog is great is

35
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,679
all when it works properly so we'll see

36
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,199
where it goes again uh so I can switch

37
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,118
back and forth we'll try to take a break

38
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,359
a couple times during this presentation

39
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:28,400
at least maybe follow up on the chat and

40
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:30,118
some other things with it likewise I

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,680
apologize if I'm jerking back back and

42
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:34,959
forth a little bit like this because I

43
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,600
am running uh four monitors here so uh

44
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,000
it uh it's tough to always look at it

45
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,478
and still see it without getting further

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
back away so with that uh like to go

47
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,399
ahead and uh we'll get started as he

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,319
mentioned about an hour and a half of

49
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:49,680
stuff I like to joke with the students

50
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:51,199
that we uh do handle in for the academic

51
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,079
classes that uh humans have been

52
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,280
cleaning seed for several thousand years

53
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:56,438
and we're going to cover all of it the

54
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,478
next you know in this case an hour and a

55
00:01:56,438 --> 00:02:02,038
half uh so frequently highly caffeinated

56
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:04,879
uh presentation but uh if you can bear

57
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:06,920
with me and uh we'll take it from there

58
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,000
uh Dr Taylor has mentioned a few of the

59
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,520
things that we do this was the seed

60
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,439
science building uh early on and a floor

61
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,920
plan from it so I spend most of my time

62
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,120
in the elevated part of the building

63
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:20,000
here or uh right next to it in my office

64
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,439
and um you know there's just a view from

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,959
the north side fortunately we don't have

66
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,359
the snow today but that could happen

67
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,039
most any time and uh as you mentioned I

68
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,560
do a lot of seed conditioning workshops

69
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,878
or you know seed processing as it's

70
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,199
known elsewhere in the world but uh we

71
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:35,959
work with industry on different

72
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,878
uh topics that you would be relevant for

73
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,598
people working in the plants I do a lot

74
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:41,479
of student lab sessions for various

75
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,079
academic uh Labs where we'll do one or

76
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:44,399
two labs and a couple of lectures or

77
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,480
something to give them the content

78
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,800
that's relevant to that class we do some

79
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,318
of our own research on seed conditioning

80
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,360
and uh help work with an awful lot of

81
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,878
researchers I I joke that I see a small

82
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,159
piece of a lot of projects that where

83
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:57,719
they need to clean or sort or treat or

84
00:02:56,158 --> 00:02:59,280
this lately people have been counting

85
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,280
seed like crazy once they got done

86
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,640
shelling this this fall so a little bit

87
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,039
on the workshops um there may be a few

88
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:07,399
people on here that have been to the

89
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,840
workshops before and if so you know that

90
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,439
uh we have uh the students that work for

91
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,640
me put a poster together at the end of

92
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,120
each year and uh one of the first things

93
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,518
I see people do when they come to the

94
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,840
workshops uh is they they run in to see

95
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,760
if they got on the poster because it's

96
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,719
really a photo montage that the students

97
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,519
put together and uh so there was uh 2018

98
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:28,080
if anybody happened to be there as well

99
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,519
as 2019 and uh they're really not a

100
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,000
highly technical poster just a lot of

101
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,560
fun and uh I I joke that the students

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,840
take a lot of photos because if you fill

103
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,158
the poster with pictures you don't have

104
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,080
to write very much so uh with that today

105
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,158
what I'd like to take uh some time to do

106
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,519
is to kind of review more or less in

107
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:47,158
this order a few basic concept this is

108
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,879
kind of uh seed conditioning 101 but uh

109
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:51,399
we're going to be talking about uh uh

110
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:53,120
some of the concepts that are involved

111
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,920
here a little bit on handling a little

112
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,079
bit on drying and so forth up front

113
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:59,238
basically some of the Harvest post

114
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:01,480
Harvest operations that kind of cause

115
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,719
problems sometimes for people and then

116
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:04,479
most of what we're going to be talking

117
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,878
about is dry granular separation you

118
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,399
know that the things that we're doing to

119
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,158
clean and sort and upgrade the seed and

120
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,719
I'm going to introduce a few quality

121
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:15,798
control Concepts as we go and again the

122
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:16,959
whole business on the equipment of going

123
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,000
to show you a little bit on plan

124
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,280
operation some of the key principles

125
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,600
we're really not going to be able to get

126
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,799
intoo adjustments uh much on this time I

127
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,400
I joke sometimes that I have I spend the

128
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,759
entire summer talking about this so I

129
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,079
run out of time then so um the

130
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:32,680
likelihood of covering everything in an

131
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,560
hour and a half uh isn't real great so

132
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,079
first off you know is you're maybe

133
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,160
working on I know you're an hour ahead

134
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:39,959
of me so uh you probably on that second

135
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,759
cup of coffee instead of the first but

136
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:44,279
why are we doing this in the first place

137
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,160
uh if it really has to do with getting

138
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:47,799
this ready for Market okay if it's Seed

139
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,000
corn which we have plenty of here in

140
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,400
Iowa uh it comes in on the ear it's very

141
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,360
high moisture husks and so forth on it

142
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,279
um certainly not ready to put in the bag

143
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,000
and so a lot of things have to happen to

144
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:00,359
get that at least cleaned and sized and

145
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,360
sorted and then ultimately treated

146
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,038
uh it'sit something a bit easier uh we

147
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,720
joke here sometimes in Iowa that you

148
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:07,800
know alternative crops means corn and

149
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,919
soybeans uh realize you've got a more

150
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,400
diverse mix out there fortunately we do

151
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:13,319
work with a lot of other things in seed

152
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,079
science than just the general field

153
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:17,439
crops that we'd have here uh but

154
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:19,120
soybeans again are a bit easier uh we

155
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,038
may have to get splits and weed seeds

156
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,360
and you know moldy discolored seeds

157
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,318
other foreign material out and uh I get

158
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,199
into some food grade products as well so

159
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,160
these were uh dry beans uh the the

160
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,079
little maroon colored ones here are Uki

161
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,039
beans

162
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,680
uh typically for export to Japan but

163
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,680
this happened to be an organic seed lot

164
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,400
where um weed control got out of hand so

165
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,000
if somebody needed a bunch of rag weed

166
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,918
we did develop a process for cleaning

167
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,519
those up for seed so uh again I tend to

168
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:45,959
take a kind of a broad brush approach

169
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:47,959
here to seed conditioning and it's

170
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:49,839
basically the post Harvest operations

171
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:51,318
that we'd be involved at a plant so

172
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,758
anything from perhaps secondary

173
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,879
threshing a lot of drying um cleaning

174
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,038
things up um I do get into seed

175
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:59,478
treatment and whatnot as well however uh

176
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:01,439
that's going to be uh covered in

177
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:03,959
substantially more detail this

178
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,120
afternoon okay uh there are I understand

179
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:07,680
you have some people that are doing

180
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,918
stuff that are not just corn and sing so

181
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,720
um when I get into this was flax it's an

182
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,598
indeterminate crop where uh they're not

183
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,240
mature at the same time sometimes the

184
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:17,478
different grasses may have to be uh

185
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,960
stripped a few times uh things like

186
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:20,359
fruit or tomatoes you how do you get the

187
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,839
seed out of there you get into

188
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,360
extraction we're not going to cover that

189
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,679
today uh but I just want to bring up you

190
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,360
know many of the issues that would occur

191
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,079
um so we wind up with a range of

192
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:34,199
different workshops to try to cover you

193
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,719
know those topics um again as Dr Taylor

194
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,919
mentioned I've been hanging around this

195
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,199
business since the early 80s and uh when

196
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,000
I started on this uh a lot of my clients

197
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,160
that I worked with for plant design were

198
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,120
mom and pop type operations that

199
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,759
certainly changed over the years a few

200
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,199
of Midwestern plants here have been

201
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,199
added just to kind of show you the scale

202
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,960
of the operations that we often deal

203
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,360
with so I have the the for I'm fortunate

204
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:57,279
to be able to work with everyone from

205
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,240
small mom and pop companies to some of

206
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,638
the big

207
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,199
multinationals um

208
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,918
okay if we start just taking a walk

209
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,000
around a seed plant which sort of what

210
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:06,478
this is we're going to more or less

211
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,759
follow the flow uh the different

212
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:09,598
components would be you know things

213
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,360
related to you know receiving the

214
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,839
product uh drying and temporary storage

215
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,840
uh there's a lot of handling that goes

216
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,318
on I'm going to just briefly cover you

217
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,878
know mostly the issues that are raised

218
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:21,919
by that today and uh a little bit on

219
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:23,680
some physical separation with a lot on

220
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:26,318
that actually today and then uh again

221
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,680
just introduce the the treating um and

222
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,120
we'll finish with a couple of slides

223
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,639
just to finish our walkthrough on the

224
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,319
plan

225
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,840
um again most of what we're going to be

226
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,759
covering today is a little bit on the

227
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,359
material handling and lots on cleaning

228
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,680
and sorting okay just a couple quick

229
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,479
comments things that go wrong I I said I

230
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,918
work with post Harvest but the typical

231
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,158
complaint that I hear when I'm talking

232
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:47,959
to seed plant people is that uh the

233
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:49,800
combine operator did something wrong

234
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:51,680
okay uh either they beat the seed up or

235
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,960
they didn't clean up properly between uh

236
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,639
varietal contamination is a huge issue

237
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:57,959
and something that we can't magically

238
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,560
remove unless there's uh some difference

239
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:02,158
between the two varieties that that we

240
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,199
can use the other big thing I run across

241
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:06,158
is the need to properly dry and storage

242
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,199
you know the seed uh you know if we can

243
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:10,199
control the moisture C coming in

244
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,960
properly Air at it uh we can do a lot of

245
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,240
things to help maintain that seed and uh

246
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,478
sometimes you know drying to a safe

247
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,240
level is an important part of it um I I

248
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:21,758
see too many cases where things go wrong

249
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,280
uh moisture really does matter and uh

250
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,479
you know there's just kind of a list

251
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,839
here I'm not going to go through all of

252
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,839
them but uh things that we wind up

253
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,560
talking about on moisture and uh

254
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:32,079
sometimes when I have the luxury of

255
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,918
doing this in seed science I can bring

256
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,519
in some of our speakers uh much like Dr

257
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:38,038
Taylor talked about Cornell speakers we

258
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,519
have Iowa State speakers that'll come in

259
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:42,360
and hit some of this as well as other

260
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,120
guest instructors so uh then uh the

261
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,480
other big thing again I I work in the

262
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,120
same building is the seed Testing Lab um

263
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,399
they have a lot of uh different tests

264
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,080
that are run but at a plant uh sometimes

265
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,839
we're looking for very simple tests that

266
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,720
are often based on the same physical

267
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,800
properties that we might use in the the

268
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,200
machine so if we're checking a cleaner

269
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:01,599
we might use hand screens or something

270
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,160
something to to to see if it's doing the

271
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,079
right job uh I mentioned moisture that's

272
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,600
probably the first thing that's checked

273
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:09,120
some you may be familiar with taking

274
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,920
test weight you know how many pounds per

275
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,120
bushel perhaps you get this from your

276
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:15,838
moisture meter um we frequently are

277
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,278
looking for broken seed uh testing for

278
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,480
seed coat damage on things like soybeans

279
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:21,879
here uh we do I mentioned seed counting

280
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,240
earlier that the grad students have been

281
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:25,278
counting and counting we had seed

282
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,600
counters running literally 40 hours a

283
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:30,399
week or more uh here the last month but

284
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,360
um you know so the number of seeds per

285
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,480
pound or thousand kernel weight can be

286
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,680
important um sometimes we're grading for

287
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,560
visual defects um depending on what

288
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,199
we're looking for and uh this gets

289
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:42,719
beyond the scope today but packaged

290
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,399
units and so forth how many what's the

291
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,240
weight of the bag and meeting regulatory

292
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,078
requirements and then I'm an engineer so

293
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,759
we put numbers to about everything but

294
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:54,479
you know capacity uh percent uh discards

295
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:56,720
uh yield and whatnot um okay so again

296
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,399
whatever uh mention that there's

297
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,800
typically large volumes of stuff going

298
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,440
through that may not not be the case if

299
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,278
you're dealing with tomatoes or perhaps

300
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,399
pumpkins or something but uh many of the

301
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:06,838
fuel crops will have a lot of material

302
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:08,839
handling equipment moving things from

303
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,839
point A to point B depending on where

304
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:13,519
those points are uh could be elevator

305
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:15,320
legs going straight up uh belt conveyors

306
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,039
and inclines are horizontal some

307
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,680
technology that's borrowed from the uh

308
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,278
grain industry sometimes for filling

309
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:23,679
bins a lot of vibratory conveyors within

310
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:26,039
the towers uh and uh pneumatic conveyors

311
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:28,159
to blow more often discard but sometimes

312
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:29,719
other product whatever goes up must come

313
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,439
down so we've got some gravity spouts

314
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,278
and let Downs in here as well okay uh

315
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,040
one big problem with all this mechanical

316
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:38,720
handling can be damage okay we might

317
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:41,039
break or hurt the seed somehow um I like

318
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,120
to joke sometimes that U whatever the

319
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,439
gravity separator and the color sorder

320
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,600
or cleaner giveth the U handling system

321
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,160
can take it away so uh we want to be

322
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,920
careful about that again uh soybeans are

323
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,679
almost a poster child for mechanical

324
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,919
damage I I joke sometimes if you look at

325
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,599
them too long they might break but um

326
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,958
you see most the studies on it this was

327
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,240
an early one I was involved with uh as

328
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:04,119
an undergrad actually but uh looking at

329
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,600
uh the the effects through six different

330
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,320
plants over the course of the winter and

331
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,079
sampling everything they tried to

332
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,600
include one screw conveyor at the

333
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:14,159
beginning in augur and lost over 2%

334
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,360
damage on the average just for that in

335
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,439
germination and um there was also a

336
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,440
moisture effect dry soybeans tend to

337
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,880
break uh more easily than regular

338
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,920
moisture so again moisture matters on

339
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:29,320
that point too you can overd dry product

340
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:30,799
and have issues with that so uh probably

341
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,600
the biggest single thing without going

342
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,759
into every possible machine you might

343
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,440
have is that uh this really boils down

344
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:38,799
to uh not hitting things too fast or

345
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,920
being in the wrong place at the wrong

346
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:43,240
time so if you can reduce seed velocity

347
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:45,439
maybe we can reduce drop height we can

348
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,240
slow the machine down uh sometimes we

349
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,760
can use a larger conveyor and run it at

350
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,600
a slower speed to handle the same

351
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:53,240
capacity if you have uh maybe a screw

352
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,000
conveyor or something in here using a

353
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,720
lowest possible incline don't raise it

354
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,320
up too far and then drop it farther down

355
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,120
and uh again being in the the wrong

356
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,240
place involves you know impact or

357
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,200
abrasion or being crushed by a machine

358
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,919
somehow or being sheared off being cut

359
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,720
by a sharp edge someplace uh so we can

360
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,639
eliminate some of those pinch points

361
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,480
brand new equipment uh frequently has

362
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:15,159
nice sharp edges coming out of the

363
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,440
factory so running that in for a while

364
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:19,278
can be useful and uh trying to keep most

365
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,320
of the conveyors running full can be

366
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:24,078
important that isn't maybe so critical

367
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,120
on belts or something but again um

368
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:27,519
rubber or plastic contact surfaces if

369
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,120
you hear a lot of noise with stuff

370
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,600
crashing into steel there's usually a

371
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,839
good indicator that there's some damage

372
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,639
as well and most seed companies I work

373
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,279
with do try to modify the conveyors to

374
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,278
avoid these problems for obvious reasons

375
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:42,320
there is some evidence of soybeans being

376
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:44,159
uh uh sensitive to cold temperatures and

377
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,360
uh somewhat anecdotal but there's at

378
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,039
least split generation can be worse uh

379
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,919
those of you that happen to get into it

380
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:51,719
uh we have lots of discussions on how

381
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,159
cold that may be but we'll leave it for

382
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,040
there now okay I promised you we'd spend

383
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:57,799
most of our time on separation so when I

384
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:01,039
walk around to plant and again I I did

385
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:03,359
plant design for for years and uh I joke

386
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,679
that uh um you know you have all these

387
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,440
different parts but no two plants are

388
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,759
ever alike and you put them together in

389
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,839
different sequence depending what you're

390
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:12,958
trying to do so some of those puzzle

391
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:14,959
pieces would be things like uh you know

392
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,399
an aspirator perhaps uh we can to

393
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,198
separate things by aerodynamic

394
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,879
properties uh maybe we you know almost

395
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,919
everybody has a cleaner of some sort

396
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:24,320
that's going to work with uh size and

397
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,958
shape as well as the uh you know

398
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,800
built-in aspirations um we're frequently

399
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,679
doing a lot of sizing in the corn

400
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,399
industry for seed corn the the tower is

401
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:34,759
frequently called a sizing Tower because

402
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,399
of the how dominant those machines may

403
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:37,720
be in there if you're dealing with a

404
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,198
spherical product that's more like

405
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,040
soybeans or rape seed uh perhaps we have

406
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:44,120
spiral separators that would work on how

407
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:46,599
well it rolls to separate shrivel from

408
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,360
round uh gravity separators are very

409
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,079
important for uh removing maybe low

410
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,240
density seed that may not germinate so

411
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:55,399
well or other contaminants and uh

412
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,399
finally the the of the common machines

413
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:58,958
we get into color variation uh things

414
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,240
that you know would be discolored that

415
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,958
could be removed uh optically and this

416
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,639
is kind of an evolving software

417
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,799
technology now of wordss we're really

418
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,039
frequently talking about Optical sorting

419
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,479
uh where they're looking at shape or

420
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:12,719
other factors okay so just how do these

421
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,278
pieces go together um again I told you

422
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,399
no two plants are really the same but

423
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:19,439
this was just a flow for uh soybeans and

424
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,720
small grain so uh probably higher chance

425
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,839
that some of you are doing the cereal

426
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,399
grains there uh in which case you know

427
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:26,560
perhaps we're coming in we may have a

428
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,039
deer I don't see those in all the plants

429
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,278
but uh it's basically some secondary

430
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:31,120
threshing that goes on before the

431
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,679
cleaner the cleaner takes out most of

432
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,360
the trash depending on what we're

433
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:36,359
running there's frequently machines that

434
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,278
are somewhat uh industry specific either

435
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,480
an indent to remove uh differences in

436
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:43,320
length maybe on the serial grains or a

437
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,560
spiral um that might take out the oblong

438
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,399
seed there's various configurations you

439
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:49,758
might have on a gravity table to uh

440
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,720
separate by density if the color sorder

441
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,919
is there it could be typically ahead of

442
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,440
the treater or sometimes I see it after

443
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,078
the cleaner particularly in a seed corn

444
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,639
plant um treater when it's uh when it

445
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:03,000
exists for particular process and um you

446
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,198
know some form of packaging here uh

447
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,799
again depends on Market okay a seed corn

448
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:08,719
plant might look something more like

449
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,559
this the again the biggest difference

450
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,320
here I frequently see the color sort

451
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,599
after the cleaner technically ahead of

452
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,879
the sizers they don't have to run all

453
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,519
the individual uh sizes um numbers of

454
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:20,838
sizes and scope of these plants will

455
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:22,679
definitely vary as well but uh it look

456
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:24,440
something like this you know the biggest

457
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:26,838
difference in again that Seed corn is

458
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,720
almost always sized for us markets

459
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:31,240
anyway okay so I work with some of the

460
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,240
engineering students and I like to

461
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,480
explain that the difference here but

462
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,440
with um seed cleaning compared to other

463
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,759
forms of uh you know see manufacturing

464
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,079
that they may be working with is uh

465
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:45,399
frequently people talk about uh like 3D

466
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:46,958
printing being an additive process um

467
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:49,559
whereas something like Machining is a

468
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:54,239
subtractive process and uh basically if

469
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:55,159
we're dealing with um um seed cleaning I

470
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,198
mentioned that we have different

471
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:58,919
machines that are separating things and

472
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:01,278
we're basically removing stuff from it

473
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:02,958
so it's a subtractive process and uh

474
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,000
we're basically carving away at this

475
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,359
thing uh you by removing everything that

476
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,078
we can blow away and everything that's

477
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,440
too big and small and then maybe things

478
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:11,198
that are the wrong density or things

479
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,040
that are the wrong color until we

480
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:15,318
hopefully try to remove everything

481
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,360
that's not desirable from the seed that

482
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:18,799
we want and typically we'll have to use

483
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,600
more than one machine to get there

484
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,000
unless we're just separating I don't

485
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,040
know golf balls from seed or something

486
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,318
so what are we removing and I suspect

487
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:29,318
most people on here whoops sorry could

488
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:30,759
uh give me this list but you we're after

489
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:33,000
the you know foreign material you know

490
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:35,560
weed seeds uh other crops mechanical

491
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,318
damage we'd prefer not to break it um

492
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:40,000
varietal contamination is very difficult

493
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:41,278
to remove and uh then we get into when

494
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,360
we start talking about upgrading

495
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,600
removing lowquality seed you know why is

496
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,360
it bad is typically either uh seed

497
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,199
physiology which uh or or different

498
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,278
pathogens that we may have uh that would

499
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:57,359
affect it okay um now I I talked about

500
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:59,799
how we're carving away at things and um

501
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,318
we uh we frequently seem to get into

502
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:03,519
various histograms uh different

503
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:04,879
bell-shaped curves and this was a box I

504
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,359
actually built as an undergraduate and

505
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,559
the students found it back found two of

506
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,318
them back a while back and we used these

507
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:11,720
before we had bar graphs and computers

508
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,199
and so forth and you would basically

509
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,640
drop things through a Sitters of hand

510
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,759
screens and then uh pour each hand

511
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,439
screen content into one of these and it

512
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:21,640
generated a graph that we could use for

513
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,679
teaching and uh you can see that we get

514
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,079
this bell shaped curve on here again and

515
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,319
those of you who ever worked with screen

516
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:28,038
selection know that you're trying to

517
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,319
pick the screens to trim the Tails of

518
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:33,319
that belt shap curve as much as possible

519
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:35,639
without losing a good seed so uh you

520
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:38,319
know it's uh interesting at least to uh

521
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,840
to talk about that and uh as we start

522
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:41,279
talking about things like a gravity

523
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,038
separator you're looking at a density

524
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:45,038
curve that you're trying to trim on

525
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:47,038
color sords you're literally seeing this

526
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:48,679
type of probability information

527
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:50,798
sometimes shown graphically and that's

528
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:52,480
you know sometimes how it's set so we're

529
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,599
we're basically going through a sequence

530
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,360
of machines trimming each curve as far

531
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:58,279
as we can before you lose too much good

532
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:59,839
seed and then back off of it and then at

533
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:01,798
the the end if there's still defects we

534
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:03,079
have to decide what seed what machine

535
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:04,879
would be the best for removing that

536
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:08,079
defect and go make the appropriate

537
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,679
adjustments okay uh again uh when we're

538
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,839
talking about uh separation efficiency

539
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,640
uh any theoretical process that we might

540
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,199
have here uh you know a simple one

541
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,360
perhaps just has you know product and

542
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,159
discard good seed and they're rarely

543
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:22,479
ever 100% efficient uh so when we're

544
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:23,840
talking about it it's you know it's kind

545
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,558
of like a batting average but you know

546
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,639
what percentage of the defects did we

547
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:28,879
get uh typically we won't get all of

548
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,000
them um

549
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,799
but uh we can also deal with uh recovery

550
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,159
of good product because one way we can

551
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:35,400
get most of the defects is to throw a

552
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:37,840
whole bunch of good seed away but the

553
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,679
economics of that are not good either so

554
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,038
uh you know what's the yield and uh I

555
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,759
like to say that seed plants are

556
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,759
typically between the proverbial rock

557
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:46,919
and a hard place where quality control

558
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:49,319
wants to remove all the contaminants and

559
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:51,320
uh uh the accounting people want them to

560
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:53,439
keep every good seed and uh those are

561
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:54,678
kind of conflicting uh results plus

562
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,320
especially when you need it all done

563
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:58,519
quickly by uh schedule and within budget

564
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:00,119
uh we get into some things with

565
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:02,839
separation efficiency I'm going to stay

566
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:04,158
off most of that today just keep in mind

567
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:05,558
that getting complete contaminant

568
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:07,080
removal typically means you have to

569
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:08,599
remove at least a small amount of good

570
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:10,558
product okay here was just a

571
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:12,439
hypothetical graph this is not real data

572
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:14,038
it's just something I made do uh in a

573
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,360
hotel room at 11 o'clock at night to

574
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:19,319
explain the idea but if I'm adjusting

575
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:22,119
some machine maybe it's an aspirator and

576
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:24,399
uh removal deficiency levels are usually

577
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:26,119
given from Z to one uh the idea was that

578
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,960
if I turn up that aspirator I can throw

579
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:30,399
more and more defects away I may not get

580
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,159
all them um but you know I probably

581
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,559
don't want to run clear to the right

582
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:34,919
because if I look at my yield of good

583
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:37,720
seed I'm starting to throw good seed

584
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,200
away as I crank up that air um and so

585
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,200
again that there is a way to combine

586
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,080
that but that curve uh varies a lot

587
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,600
depending on application so if you can

588
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:46,158
keep in mind we're talking about yield

589
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:47,798
it's what percentage of the good seed we

590
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:50,000
kept and we're talking about you know

591
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:52,240
defa removal or efficiencies type thing

592
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,480
it's usually just you how much of the a

593
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,200
particular defect that we got out okay

594
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,400
seed plants usually going to try to run

595
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,759
somewhere in that range uh and a lot of

596
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,840
this is really done uh by experience for

597
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:05,558
a particular application okay I'd like

598
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,439
to talk again we're dealing with a lot

599
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:08,918
of equipment operators and so about you

600
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,679
know different tools you know why do we

601
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:12,120
have the different tools for it and I

602
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:14,080
mentioned that this is somewhat of a

603
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:15,719
subtractive process and so much like

604
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,480
wood carving you know you're you're

605
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,440
carving away it and removing things and

606
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,798
so uh you know sometimes at a state fair

607
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,080
or something you'll see this guy with a

608
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:24,639
chainsaw who's uh making stuff and he

609
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:26,720
has 10 minutes total to do it in one

610
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,200
tool but if you have more precise tools

611
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,600
you can get better details and uh you a

612
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,080
good operator that understands the

613
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:33,879
capability of those tools and how and

614
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:35,798
when to use them can provide Superior

615
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,520
results this statue happens to be just

616
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:41,918
outside seed science it's George

617
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:43,119
Washington Carver and U so uh I've got a

618
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,759
series of slides here we're going to

619
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,199
talk about different tools four of them

620
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:48,679
then I'm going to give you examples on

621
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,880
each one as we go through but uh perhaps

622
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:51,559
we can come in here and we have an

623
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,240
aspirator okay humans have probably been

624
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:55,200
blowing light product you know wheat

625
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,640
from chaff or something for longer than

626
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,558
almost anything but uh in this case uh

627
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,720
we're looking at uh you know either

628
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:05,240
usually an inclined or a vertical column

629
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,279
and U just a difference in how fast that

630
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,200
seed will fall through the Airstream

631
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:11,678
okay a cleaner combines that again with

632
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,200
some perforated screens and uh typically

633
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,278
will blow some trash away at the

634
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,159
beginning and uh then clean things to

635
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:20,400
remove you know too large and too small

636
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,559
basically to scalp and sift the product

637
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,320
and um then finish with a second

638
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:26,519
aspiration that's more precise in order

639
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:28,119
to get more of the lowquality seeds away

640
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,879
sometimes that's the only machine needed

641
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:31,879
for simple applications but other times

642
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,559
it's just the beginning of the process

643
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,159
the cleaner almost always takes the bulk

644
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:37,678
of the the contaminant out okay um

645
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,559
aspirators come in a lot of different

646
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,480
form factors I see quite a few of these

647
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:43,678
multiple P ones around the Midwest just

648
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,440
for kind of pre- cleaning uh those of

649
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,960
you may be involved in something like

650
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,400
that a dis shaped seed like tomato or

651
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,000
pepper I see these more out in

652
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,600
California so it's uh something that

653
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,440
Peter marks will have seen probably more

654
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:57,359
often but um you know there's they're

655
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,640
just different configurations of the

656
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,399
same notion depending what they're

657
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,919
trying to accomplish okay um one problem

658
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,519
with just aspirating is that you don't

659
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:07,080
get big heavy things let's say I have

660
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:08,639
sticks or corn cobs or something in here

661
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:11,439
um then I have

662
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,400
uh uh they may not blow away because

663
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,200
they're actually heavier than seed or a

664
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,679
stick May stand upright and fall down

665
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,679
through the column of air so uh one

666
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,440
simple way that uh was done to get

667
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,640
things that are grossly larger quite a

668
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,880
bit bigger than the seat itself uh was a

669
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,880
scalping reel and this basically is just

670
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,679
a uh rotating wire reel and the seeds

671
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,080
being poured through this thing from the

672
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:35,159
top while it rotates slowly and uh

673
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:37,359
conveys the large product like corn cobs

674
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:39,720
or or stocks or something off the top

675
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:42,158
it's just a rough D sticking type

676
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,720
process but uh that combination uh helps

677
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,679
substantially they used to be in all the

678
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,278
corn plants I see them a lot in soybean

679
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,640
facilities now for removing pods that

680
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:51,839
would give them trouble otherwise okay

681
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,720
um then here's an old diagram of a small

682
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,558
cleaner usually there's at least two

683
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,038
screens to remove things that are again

684
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:59,759
too small or too big and uh some small

685
00:22:58,038 --> 00:23:01,720
machines here with just different uh

686
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:05,000
examples of things that uh would be done

687
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,640
to remove some of those contaminants and

688
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,960
uh the components of it again we've

689
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,000
mentioned that there's usually an upper

690
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,558
air or some form of a preaspiration um

691
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,400
to get the light trashed there's the

692
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:17,558
scalping screens that are the oversized

693
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,679
product um different sifting or grading

694
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:20,678
screens again undersized and finishing

695
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,880
up in an

696
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:26,880
aspiration okay

697
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,039
um okay what what comes out again this

698
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,880
was uh an example here with soybeans

699
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:33,319
again those the you can see kind of the

700
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,320
the light trash that was blown away to

701
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:37,519
begin with i frequently have students

702
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:40,278
asking me why uh you know these pods

703
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:41,918
didn't blow away and uh well you up here

704
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:43,400
and uh that's basically because they're

705
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,080
seed in them they they're heavy enough

706
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,679
that they wouldn't blow away easily

707
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:48,240
we've got uh you know undersized

708
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:51,440
material which are usually splits or

709
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,120
weed seeds on on a dcot like soybeans um

710
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,558
things that we can blow away again low

711
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:57,359
quality and uh the good there's still a

712
00:23:55,558 --> 00:23:59,038
split here there's some Merit to some

713
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,519
additional equipment as we'll see here a

714
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,960
little bit later okay uh Seed corn it

715
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:04,839
would look something more like that

716
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,079
again those heavy corn cobs and stocks

717
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:09,639
and so forth or what came away on on a

718
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:11,759
scalping screen and just for fun I threw

719
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,000
some flax in here uh there happens to be

720
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:16,079
some serial grains that contaminate left

721
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
from the combine probably that we were

722
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:21,240
removing as uh just due to different

723
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,759
size differences and so forth okay a few

724
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,519
examples of some cleaners uh in in a

725
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:28,038
seed plant here in the Midwest these may

726
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:30,720
be the something resembling them in the

727
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:32,319
middle and it's maybe two stories tall

728
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,159
but uh you get into some smaller

729
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:35,678
vegetable plants uh this one happens to

730
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,360
be on the west coast and some other

731
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,880
different uh variations of what are

732
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:42,959
really lab cleaners but sometimes

733
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,760
they're the primary cleaner for a um you

734
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,960
know a small facility if you're

735
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:50,398
particularly people doing the the high

736
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,038
value seeds um okay uh when we're

737
00:24:50,398 --> 00:24:53,918
dealing with a cleaner the the we can

738
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:55,640
have basically round hole screens or

739
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,759
slotted screens and uh different

740
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,038
dimensions anlure metric as well the

741
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,158
these happen to be the English

742
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:03,319
Dimensions but uh when you deal with

743
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:04,919
something like soybeans uh split removal

744
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:07,480
is the big thing and so they'll work

745
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:10,480
with whether the slot is parallel to the

746
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,558
slope or 90 degrees perpendicular to the

747
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,079
slope is a cross slot and we have kind

748
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:15,639
of a hybrid as well you find in some

749
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,678
soybean plants called a herring bone

750
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,440
slot that's really about the the cross

751
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,480
slot removed splits more efficiently but

752
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,320
doesn't get stick so well the parallel

753
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,558
slot is there for the sticks and uh

754
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:27,960
usually you see a mix of the two any of

755
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,759
you I mention heard that there're maybe

756
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,440
some folks doing tur turf grass you get

757
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:34,519
into small seeds frequently you may see

758
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,880
a wire mesh um of either a square or a

759
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:40,319
rectangular mesh of so many wires per

760
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,039
inch and uh in the seral grains and a

761
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,678
few other things there can be triangular

762
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:46,879
hole screens using removing things like

763
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:49,120
basically triangular weed seeds but uh

764
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,000
wild buckwheat or wild Morning Glory

765
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:53,439
perhaps uh may come out on something

766
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,159
like that again we'll have a mix of

767
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,360
different types of screens depending

768
00:25:55,159 --> 00:26:00,559
what the application may be okay

769
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:02,000
uh again what we're doing when we're

770
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,918
doing hand screen selection here is

771
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,398
running it through a stack perhaps we

772
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,679
know something about one end or the

773
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:09,278
other and uh so we can uh basically

774
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,840
figure out where to trim the tail on

775
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:13,240
that bell-shaped curve uh I like to use

776
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,798
various types of mechanical screen

777
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,519
shakers this is bigger than you would

778
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:18,119
probably need it it'll handle up to 28

779
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:21,038
screens because the seed corn

780
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:22,798
applications we get into but um you know

781
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:24,960
again trying to remove as much bad and

782
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,599
and keep the good okay now we start

783
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,558
moving into things that would separate

784
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:30,918
by various dimensions perhaps more

785
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:34,639
precisely than we could with screens and

786
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:36,080
uh in this case we have U the uh things

787
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,399
that separate by length which would be

788
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,960
an indent or a disc separator basically

789
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:43,719
seed short seed fits into a pocket and

790
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,759
uh long seed doesn't and uh as it spins

791
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:50,480
around it can uh pick more of that out

792
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:52,398
um the uh again serial grains are the

793
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,120
most common applications but D sticking

794
00:26:52,398 --> 00:26:56,239
other crops can be important I've

795
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:57,918
mentioned Seed corn sizing sunflowers

796
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,839
are frequently sized with things that

797
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,679
look more like uh like this which is

798
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:03,759
again a rotating cylinder with in this

799
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,000
case contoured holes to help present

800
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:08,798
that seed to the opening and uh drop it

801
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,640
through there you know hopefully um more

802
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:13,240
consistently and uh so two different

803
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,960
machines with different applications

804
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,839
here uh the main difference on the uh uh

805
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,319
the sizing is just the the shape of the

806
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:23,959
Hole uh that came in here and um okay so

807
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:26,000
we're dealing with length again uh it's

808
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,720
a short seed and it it fits in the

809
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,240
pocket and gets lifted the long seed

810
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,000
just keeps tumbling as it works its way

811
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,558
down through the length of the machine a

812
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,119
few of you may be familiar with disc

813
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:36,678
separators I see them more often in

814
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:38,839
high-capacity wheat or rice seed plants

815
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:40,559
but in this case the idea is still the

816
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:43,558
same that we have a short seed fitting

817
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:45,480
in a pocket uh the short seed is is the

818
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:47,079
pockets are Now cast into the sides of a

819
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,360
rotating disc and there's a bunch of

820
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:51,720
these discs maybe 20 seven of them uh 25

821
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:53,839
inch in diameter or something down

822
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,679
through the machine and as they spin

823
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,639
they lift the short seed away and it

824
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,960
gets tossed out the top basically by by

825
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:02,840
centrifugal force either one of these is

826
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,600
lifting short from long uh they're very

827
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:06,278
common for any kind of elongated Seed

828
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:08,079
where length becomes important or

829
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:10,798
perhaps you you can't actually see the

830
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:12,359
difference you know the width and the

831
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,639
the thickness may be the same so a

832
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:16,519
screen can't actually separate them uh

833
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,720
length uh becomes important for those

834
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:20,000
types of applications some of you may be

835
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,440
familiar with some of the European

836
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,038
brands that use an offset uh indent in

837
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,159
this case that pocket has been kind of

838
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:27,798
deformed to one side they're basically

839
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,399
trying to mimic some of the effect that

840
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:33,759
we can get with a disc and uh in this

841
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:36,479
here's just an example of one particular

842
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:38,119
uh brand but the the same Concepts exist

843
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,679
it's just that that offset pocket kind

844
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:43,439
of helps lift uh maybe an elongated seed

845
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,120
like many of the grasses or serial

846
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,720
grains that they would be cleaning over

847
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:50,759
there um the folks that are D sticking

848
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,679
might uh worry about reversing cylinders

849
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:55,240
and other things okay here's just one

850
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:56,679
fun application um this came into one of

851
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,159
our color sorder workshops and they

852
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:00,840
wanted to get these dark seeds out of

853
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:02,440
here there were some weed seeds inside

854
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:05,959
it that needed to be removed from the

855
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,600
white lettuce uh that they had and um we

856
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,360
had a double of a time getting it sorted

857
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:11,599
by color but we wound up with something

858
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:12,839
like this and the way I did it was to

859
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,879
take the sample and run it through a

860
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:16,439
small indent and uh we got something

861
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,640
that very much resembled a color

862
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,000
separation uh one of the fun Parts here

863
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,519
is some of those weed seeds were

864
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,599
actually uh the bodies of dead insects

865
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:26,200
that were just missing their uh Wings it

866
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:27,759
it wouldn't fall down the Chute we'll

867
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,278
talk a little bit more about that on the

868
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:32,278
color order later okay just a little bit

869
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:34,200
on disc separators uh probably not a

870
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:35,720
common thing there but the pockets do

871
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,159
come in different configurations I

872
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,679
certainly wouldn't worry about all the

873
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:41,519
different designations there but uh

874
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,159
basically there's V Pockets that'll tend

875
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,319
to lift spherical things the name comes

876
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:47,440
from vetch our pockets that tend to list

877
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:52,879
in cylindrical things uh the name there

878
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:54,640
again comes from uh the U um from rice

879
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,440
and uh then the square pockets are

880
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,960
usually What's d sticking sunflowers and

881
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,200
other products here's just a quick

882
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,319
example of that you can see where

883
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,278
they're basically lifting uh the

884
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:05,038
sunflower and uh the you can see the

885
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:07,398
sunflower seeds flying through the air

886
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:09,359
here uh one advantage of an indent or a

887
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:11,079
disc separator over an indent is that it

888
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:12,879
has a lot more pockets okay and if you

889
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:14,319
have to physically lift every seed

890
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,840
you're not going to get a seed in every

891
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:17,798
pocket so the more Pockets you have the

892
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:19,359
more capacity you can get and if you're

893
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:20,960
physically lifting all the seed away

894
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:23,719
from sticks you start to see the discs

895
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,200
are very big indents the indent has a

896
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,000
better Advantage from a standpoint of um

897
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,080
adjustment okay you can change the speed

898
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,679
and change how much is being lifted so

899
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:33,519
sometimes I see a mixture of the two

900
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,559
machines for specific

901
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:37,319
applications okay then we move into

902
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:40,599
width and thickness again this is done

903
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:43,000
with a Precision Sizer either the round

904
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:46,240
holes tend to separate by width uh if

905
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,000
you think of uh how a uh a seed would be

906
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,440
presented to an opening uh if I if I had

907
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,359
a round opening and uh this is my seed

908
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,080
here um basically a round opening if you

909
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:58,000
think of a manhole falling into it it it

910
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:59,798
tends to see the width of that seed a

911
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,119
slot tends to see the thickness okay

912
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:03,679
it's going to fall down through that

913
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:05,119
slot uh neither one of these tends to do

914
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:09,480
length that's what the previous machine

915
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:11,119
was for so uh in this case we have uh

916
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,480
again seed being presented that round

917
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:16,239
opening for separating by width or to a

918
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,599
slot for separating by thickness and um

919
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,079
then we'll typically have a m multiple

920
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:22,199
machines in order to get the desired

921
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:24,000
results okay we have a small sizing

922
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,919
stack in my lab as well as a

923
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,200
two-cylinder

924
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:29,960
machine but uh this is a just a series

925
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,000
of four single cylinder machines that

926
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,519
look something more like this the sizes

927
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,480
vary because we can change them much

928
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,359
likey wood cleaner screens but in this

929
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,880
case producing four sizes and an

930
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:42,000
undersiz discard and I want to point out

931
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,880
that depending how many sizes we need if

932
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,798
it's sunflowers perhaps they're five and

933
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,440
they're all done with round or so but

934
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:49,480
we'll need multiple machines because

935
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,200
every machine is much like a a screen or

936
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,278
a cylinder it produces overs and

937
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,519
throughs so I only have two sizes if I

938
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:57,880
need more then I have to have a few more

939
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,759
machines okay the number of cylinders at

940
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,360
each point depends on capacity this

941
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:04,038
small line here uh is based on single

942
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:06,519
cylinder machines but you know you can

943
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:08,638
find machines with two four and six and

944
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:10,960
then beyond that we put more machines in

945
00:32:08,638 --> 00:32:12,519
parallel um and there's some

946
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,319
complications you get into balancing a

947
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:17,278
sizer stack um I'll just briefly

948
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:18,918
introduce it here but uh you get beyond

949
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:20,759
the scope of this presentation it can be

950
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:22,679
a couple hours in a workshop just to

951
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:24,759
talk about sizing efficiency and how to

952
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:26,320
get consistent results from that these

953
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:28,000
types of things become important

954
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,480
elsewhere in the process you know having

955
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,960
you know consistent sizing not only

956
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,159
helps planting but it makes differences

957
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,919
on your treating uh results and so forth

958
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,480
as well much like removing all the

959
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,880
foreign material becomes important so

960
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,759
right here uh I've mentioned that a

961
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,320
sizing Tower in the midwest contains an

962
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:46,000
awful lot of sizing equipment here's a

963
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:48,439
shot in one of the larger of one floor

964
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,398
in a large Seed corn facility here so uh

965
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,038
they do have a few cylinders and

966
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:53,439
selecting those cylinders beforehand

967
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:54,839
becomes important so you don't install

968
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,759
them all and then find out you're wrong

969
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,959
and you've got to start changing things

970
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:01,000
so how do we do that again it's much

971
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,278
like picking screens it can be done with

972
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,679
flat screens typically I'll see people

973
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:08,440
get a overall distribution with uh with

974
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,960
the the screens and then decide again

975
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,558
what to put in the cleaner and for the

976
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,798
undersize removal and uh then the

977
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:16,000
tougher part is picking where you're

978
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:18,960
going to split the sizes so typically

979
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,278
they'll split um the width separation

980
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,480
first perhaps and then the uh thickness

981
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:26,440
but that can be done in Reverse it's

982
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,399
possible to verify those results with a

983
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,399
laboratory a batch Sizer you know our

984
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:32,000
other methods there's some Optical

985
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:34,278
equipment that's being experimented with

986
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,200
as well this is a little bit uh less

987
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:37,880
clearcut than just the cleaner okay on

988
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,278
the cleaner we know that we're trying to

989
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,840
remove the bad and keep the good in the

990
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:43,720
case of sizing it's just a question of

991
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:45,480
how we're sizing the good okay so what

992
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,519
are we going to call large medium and

993
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,440
small uh flat and round and so there's a

994
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,599
little latitude on that sometimes that

995
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,240
varies on end use uh what how much

996
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:55,199
variability we can have for plant

997
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,278
ability I'm starting to see discussion

998
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,519
on variability for seed treatment and

999
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:01,240
sometimes it's purely marketing

1000
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:03,120
requirements but U we'll see a different

1001
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,679
number of different things again here's

1002
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:07,879
the uh batch Sizer I talked about uh we

1003
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,240
use this for some lab things and for

1004
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,358
doing small batches and so forth small

1005
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,039
lots that we might run into again overs

1006
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:15,759
and throughs so one disadvantage if I

1007
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:19,039
need to make four or five sizes I've got

1008
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,760
to run through this a few times um but

1009
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:22,279
uh it's perhaps easier than trying to

1010
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,399
fire up the whole Tower and losing the

1011
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,159
lot in there someplace okay I mentioned

1012
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:29,638
that there's issues related to balancing

1013
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:32,398
sizers and um so one of the problems we

1014
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:34,760
run into is not only that the uh the

1015
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:36,239
capacity of a round and a slot are

1016
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,720
different okay the round has more

1017
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:41,158
capacity than the slot as you can see

1018
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:44,039
here uh this uh this purple up on top is

1019
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:47,320
uh basically the uh uh round hole in

1020
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:48,878
capacities in bushels per hour but uh

1021
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,919
the other problem is it also varies

1022
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:53,559
depending on hard hard on how much falls

1023
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:56,878
through okay so the rated capacity of a

1024
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:59,000
sizer is based on 95% falling through so

1025
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:01,279
so basically that means 5% are going

1026
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,719
over the top of the cylinder and heading

1027
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,359
you know in with the other product uh

1028
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:08,399
we're basically wrong 5% of the time but

1029
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:10,679
um if I push it too fast more product

1030
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,358
carries Over the Top If I slow down I'll

1031
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:14,319
get a little higher efficiency so if you

1032
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:18,239
see here as we uh

1033
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,160
if so they're rating it at 95% and then

1034
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:22,479
saying that's the capacity that that the

1035
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:24,639
manufacturer say you can get from it uh

1036
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,880
your results May Vary in a real plant

1037
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:28,199
and it also varies on percent throughs

1038
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,440
so if you think of the difference

1039
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:32,838
between a scalping and a sifting screen

1040
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,280
uh if you have almost everything falling

1041
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:37,199
through which would be scalping um the

1042
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,280
bulk of the product goes away right away

1043
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:40,598
and there's more time for it to to work

1044
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,200
its way down through the cylinder and

1045
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:45,440
search through the remaining product for

1046
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:47,078
the undersized material but if only

1047
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,200
small percent falls through much like it

1048
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:51,680
would on a sifting screen in a cleaner

1049
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:53,039
um there's an a lot more product on that

1050
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:54,838
screen and you're going to have to slow

1051
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:57,358
down to give it time to find the

1052
00:35:54,838 --> 00:36:01,000
remaining undersized product

1053
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:02,679
um again so the the complication here

1054
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,318
has to do with keeping everything

1055
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:06,199
working uh with at a reasonable

1056
00:36:04,318 --> 00:36:07,960
efficiency if you overload one of these

1057
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:11,239
machines you know that efficiency may

1058
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:13,960
not be 95% I've seen times when students

1059
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:16,479
are running it and uh it was 60% uh

1060
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,440
which means you know 40% of the uh

1061
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,480
product that's in the overs is actually

1062
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,200
throughs and uh quality control is not

1063
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,920
happy so balancing that and getting

1064
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:27,000
getting we even do this in an Agronomy

1065
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,639
class where uh we we look at what it

1066
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
takes to predict the sizes and then what

1067
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:32,639
it takes to uh to you know to evaluate

1068
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,838
what's there and how to get those two

1069
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:38,199
numbers to match okay sometimes uh

1070
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:40,199
what's old is new again uh if you went

1071
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:41,480
back uh several decades you'd find Seed

1072
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:43,399
corn plants would have something called

1073
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,760
a rocket grater it was uh flat screens

1074
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,318
in kind of a rocking motion and

1075
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,720
contoured screens that were used for

1076
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:51,559
sizing corn and uh mostly we see the

1077
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:54,399
rotary cylinders because they were more

1078
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:56,679
efficient at uh at the sizes for these

1079
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,599
large seeds but um I do see people

1080
00:36:56,679 --> 00:37:01,199
people now adapting flat screen cleaners

1081
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:02,960
for sizing it's uh fairly popular due to

1082
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:05,039
some concerns on mechanical damage with

1083
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,880
the rotating sizers uh you do have to

1084
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:08,318
slow these down typically you start at

1085
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,160
half capacity of what it would be for a

1086
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:12,880
cleaner and then go from there in order

1087
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:14,838
to try to get acceptable efficiency um

1088
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,240
but uh you know we do see both of those

1089
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:19,719
methods being used uh pretty heavily uh

1090
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:23,078
through there okay uh I mentioned that

1091
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:25,358
soybeans uh you know are are the other

1092
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:27,039
alternative here in Iowa and uh but this

1093
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:30,199
same type of machine could be used for

1094
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:32,079
almost any spherical type uh separation

1095
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:34,039
I've actually used them for separating

1096
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,318
uh round fertilizer pallets from grass

1097
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:37,880
seed uh before and some things so if the

1098
00:37:36,318 --> 00:37:39,960
difference is if one of the two products

1099
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,079
is roughly spherical uh we may be able

1100
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,519
to get it with either a spiral or a belt

1101
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,800
the belt has a series of helical flights

1102
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:49,519
and uh the seeds being run down by

1103
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,599
gravity and uh basically much like uh

1104
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:53,039
running on on a a curve on the highway

1105
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,240
if you drive around it too fast you'll

1106
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:57,440
fly off the round seed basically tends

1107
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:59,799
to fly off the spiral separate greater

1108
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,679
flights while the less round product

1109
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,920
stays on it and uh the belt is basically

1110
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:07,078
an incline belt uh it's sloped in one or

1111
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,880
two directions and the product basically

1112
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:12,240
rolls across it to make the separation

1113
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,920
okay um those of you not familiar with

1114
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:16,118
soy beans these are some of the reasons

1115
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,159
we may be uh concerned about uh

1116
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:21,358
shriveled or oblong seed um again

1117
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:23,440
typically physiological problems uh some

1118
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:26,598
pathogens as well that would cause it to

1119
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,838
not be a nice plump round seed uh in uh

1120
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:29,680
apps we can separate it by how well

1121
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,318
it'll roll you can get some of this by

1122
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:33,639
air you can get some with a slotted

1123
00:38:31,318 --> 00:38:35,199
screen or other things but typically uh

1124
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:37,239
you know the shape sort here is

1125
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:39,598
important and uh you'll see some Optical

1126
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:41,358
shape that's also developing further but

1127
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,160
sometimes we see this able to do things

1128
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:46,239
we can't do with the uh the optical

1129
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:48,039
sorting yet okay um so just a couple

1130
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:50,039
examples here these are different

1131
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:53,079
numbers of cores depending on capacity

1132
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:54,960
you know one two or four and then I see

1133
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:57,440
multiple machines I've been in some seed

1134
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,400
large soybean plants that had 40 8 cores

1135
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,559
but we also see them used for small Lots

1136
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,519
you know laboratory samples and so forth

1137
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:05,559
and for just selecting the the right

1138
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:07,800
geometry for that core uh can be

1139
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:10,880
important now the classic problem that I

1140
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,480
hear from uh uh a plant operators is

1141
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,838
their spiral doesn't have enough

1142
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,358
adjustment okay it's always throwing

1143
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:17,679
away too much or too little and uh so

1144
00:39:16,358 --> 00:39:20,279
one thing that we're seeing people

1145
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:21,598
working with are rotary spirals this

1146
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,839
idea is pretty simple it's just

1147
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,680
basically spinning the core uh with a

1148
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:28,838
small motor and that basically Is Us

1149
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:30,440
just to adjust to change to adjust the

1150
00:39:28,838 --> 00:39:32,519
separation we can change the amount

1151
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,200
that's being saved or thrown away a four

1152
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:38,000
core just has one motor and a timing

1153
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:40,559
belt inside there to do this and uh just

1154
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,199
a quick example here this is uh one of

1155
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:45,679
the two rotaries in our lab and uh

1156
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:48,598
Agronomy lab this fall we did a virtual

1157
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:51,159
lab for the students due to covid-19 and

1158
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:52,400
um so I had some footage and so forth of

1159
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:54,799
this but these are the four different

1160
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,519
speeds that we ran the same basically

1161
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,440
samples through and kind of almost a uh

1162
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:02,000
visual bar graph this is a different

1163
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,800
speeds this is the the basically the the

1164
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,639
the round and the flat and uh then as we

1165
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,318
shifted we threw less and less more and

1166
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:11,118
more round out basically and got to a

1167
00:40:09,318 --> 00:40:13,279
smaller amount of flat and then this was

1168
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,920
the uh the product off of those so you

1169
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,640
can see the effect of just changing the

1170
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:20,559
speed and uh dramatically difference in

1171
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:21,920
the quality of the discards here this

1172
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:23,358
definitely throwing away too much on

1173
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,159
first of these but getting down to a

1174
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:28,480
more reasonable amount here and uh then

1175
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:30,440
uh I happen to have the uh images from

1176
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,280
an optical Imaging uh counter that we

1177
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:36,119
use sometimes for evaluating it uh

1178
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,920
sometimes you wind up having to uh um

1179
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:39,960
you know measure seeds or try to

1180
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,318
quantify them visually or other things

1181
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,318
this can take a picture of it and give

1182
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:45,279
us some numbers very fast again this

1183
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:47,039
isn't a replicated trial it was just

1184
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,480
things from that Agronomy lab but

1185
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:51,719
basically the round seed off of the 30

1186
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,358
RPM the the one that had the smallest

1187
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:55,559
amount thrown away that's probably the

1188
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:56,960
closest to a realistic separation that

1189
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:58,639
basically was our good good seed and

1190
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,079
this was our bad so you know we're

1191
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:01,440
getting corn we're getting other things

1192
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,560
we're getting what almost looks like a

1193
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,280
color sort but it's really based on on

1194
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:09,199
shape and how well it'll roll um so

1195
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,760
again uh interesting idea on what

1196
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:13,039
something like that could be adjusted to

1197
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,760
do again I'm going to back up here the

1198
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:17,000
idea of trimming that bell-shaped curve

1199
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,760
if we can uh you can adjust that easily

1200
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,280
with one knob basically move the speed

1201
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:23,079
up and down until you throw away as much

1202
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,960
bad and you start to see too much good

1203
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:27,760
in there and you back off a bit okay uh

1204
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,639
when I work with the uh food grade

1205
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,119
soybean people I see a lot of belt

1206
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:35,679
separators um for export to Japan but uh

1207
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,519
in in simplest form it's just a this

1208
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:39,318
Draper belt it's down here at the bottom

1209
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:41,079
is a single slope the seeds put in in

1210
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:43,000
the middle uh it's run the belt is

1211
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:44,680
running up the hill the round seeds

1212
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,920
basically roll down the hill and the

1213
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:48,679
less round ones go over the top I

1214
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,159
sometimes say that this is much like uh

1215
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:52,598
trying to run down and up escalator if

1216
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:54,000
you're in good shape you can run down

1217
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:56,400
the escalator if you're not in good

1218
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,318
shape it'll take you over the top okay

1219
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,639
um most of the newer ones I see are

1220
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:02,239
slope two directions and uh you'll see

1221
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:04,519
that on the next slide as well but the

1222
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:06,358
idea here is that uh the seed basically

1223
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:07,759
the round stuff can run across the belt

1224
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:09,598
the belt is running here towards the

1225
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,280
right the round product comes down the

1226
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,000
flat product comes over and sometimes we

1227
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,160
can make some intermediate fractions as

1228
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,039
well the large machines for food grade

1229
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:18,960
beans are basically multiple belts in

1230
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:21,838
parallel that's really just about

1231
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,480
capacity okay uh few samples this is a

1232
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:26,000
small single belt unit that we have

1233
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,358
running some soybeans at this point it

1234
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,838
was still on a uh running gear outside

1235
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:34,880
it's in the facility now but uh this is

1236
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:36,440
one waist basket full of Sobe and uh the

1237
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,920
output from it okay so you can see

1238
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,079
there's a small amount of flat and

1239
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,000
oblong and then progressively more as we

1240
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,039
get into this so the the round is

1241
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,760
obviously the good aalong is probably

1242
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:48,239
going to be good for most applications

1243
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:52,559
other than the Japanese assure me they

1244
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:54,039
don't taste as well um the uh discard

1245
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:55,839
you know would be something like this so

1246
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:57,639
you there could be a debate on something

1247
00:42:55,838 --> 00:43:00,119
along that line but most people are

1248
00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:02,199
definitely going to discard those uh uh

1249
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:04,318
the splits that we'd have down in here

1250
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:05,598
uh these two sometimes I see a valve or

1251
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:07,719
something so they could the operator can

1252
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,640
quickly make a decision on those it's a

1253
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:12,118
more precise separation than the spiral

1254
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:14,400
but it's larger and more expensive and

1255
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:15,720
less capacity okay then as we start

1256
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,039
dealing with things that would be used

1257
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:20,598
for upgrading seed um these two are work

1258
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:22,279
on completely different principles but

1259
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:25,838
we'll see gravity separators and color

1260
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:28,240
sords um we have seven gravities in our

1261
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:29,679
fac and uh three color sords now but

1262
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:31,558
more that come and visit us during the

1263
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:33,358
summer so uh there's a lot of interest

1264
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:35,160
in what can be done for those types of

1265
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:36,519
things these are both finishing machines

1266
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:37,960
they are normally toward the end of the

1267
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:42,239
line they should never really be ahead

1268
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:43,480
of your cleaner uh but um it's um it's

1269
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:47,358
some things that we're going to get into

1270
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:49,119
on it we're at a is there a uh I I got

1271
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:51,799
the chat window off here right now are

1272
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,920
there uh any questions maybe anyone that

1273
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:56,440
him or somebody's got questions that I

1274
00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:01,039
should deal with here before we uh give

1275
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:03,599
you a just a short break um here's the

1276
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:05,960
chat okay I don't have any does anyone

1277
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,559
have any questions just take a break

1278
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:11,280
here while I grab some coffee and we'll

1279
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:14,599
continue sure you know obviously Allen

1280
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,920
is you know has tremendous depth of it

1281
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:20,119
information as well as experience with a

1282
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:22,720
lot of different cropping uh systems as

1283
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:25,000
well as just all this different type of

1284
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:29,078
equipment so if you have something in

1285
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:32,119
your own particular Seed Company sorting

1286
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:35,160
questions uh he he's he's the one to ask

1287
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:37,318
so please feel free to jump in here

1288
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:39,838
while while he at least has a chance to

1289
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:42,039
rest his vocal

1290
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:45,440
cords

1291
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:49,800
um let me just jump in and this this is

1292
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:52,000
more of a of a grain question uh you

1293
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:56,519
know hemp is a big thing for us here at

1294
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,960
Cornell and uh so we have an impact

1295
00:44:56,519 --> 00:45:01,759
hauler which would be a small commercial

1296
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:04,358
scale just and again is to get the hemp

1297
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,640
hearts out which should be used as a as

1298
00:45:04,358 --> 00:45:10,000
a food type of a

1299
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:11,558
situation so since hemp grain and hemp

1300
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,480
seed are about the same so I got

1301
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:14,640
involved and wet equipment to use and

1302
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,599
things like that which we've already

1303
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:20,078
purchased a year or so ago the first

1304
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:22,200
thing and even with hemp seed the seed

1305
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,599
companies are not doing a very good job

1306
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:26,759
at all of sizing the seed so we're

1307
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:29,359
getting a fair range there so I feel

1308
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:32,359
like one of the first steps I need to do

1309
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:35,799
is to go ahead and and to get this size

1310
00:45:32,358 --> 00:45:38,400
but the main piece of equipment is the

1311
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:40,160
impact huler so we're using a fosberg

1312
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:45,079
unit which would be one of their smaller

1313
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:48,558
commercial size so our challenge is is

1314
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:51,960
you know hemp is a oil seed with like

1315
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:53,760
35% oil seed so you can run this stuff

1316
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:57,720
and all of a sudden you're kind of just

1317
00:45:53,760 --> 00:46:00,240
making a an oil seed C inside of the of

1318
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:02,480
the huler so I think we just need to be

1319
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:04,959
very careful how fast we're running this

1320
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,679
thing and things like that or else like

1321
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,318
I said is the seeds I don't know how

1322
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:11,519
close they would be to like a baby

1323
00:46:09,318 --> 00:46:13,719
soybean or say but but it's a very high

1324
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:15,599
oil and when that you fracture off that

1325
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:18,439
parac carp paracap is just like a

1326
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:21,440
sunflower basically very hard that these

1327
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:24,599
things can get you know really just

1328
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,440
impacted inside of the impact huler so

1329
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:28,280
so I know you you don't work with hemp

1330
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:30,079
there I know I always been slow in

1331
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:33,359
getting into the whole hemp thing but

1332
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:36,000
but you kind of see the the grain seed

1333
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:39,119
situation that we're dealing with in in

1334
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,679
this okay right two things there I I do

1335
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,200
wind up with a lot of products that have

1336
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:44,960
dual use and uh some some Summers about

1337
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,439
30% of the people at the workshops are

1338
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,880
actually doing a food grade product of

1339
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:50,039
some sort but they happen to use much

1340
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,760
the same equipment as you indicated hemp

1341
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:53,279
has been kind of a problem here for me

1342
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,359
because up until very recently we

1343
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,800
couldn't legally bring the stuff to Iowa

1344
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:59,239
uh you could get into trouble and i' I'd

1345
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,039
run a blind question off to the

1346
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:03,759
regulatory people and get an email back

1347
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:06,279
in big capital letters that under no way

1348
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,520
should I bring it to Iowa State um so we

1349
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,440
didn't have you know a write up in the

1350
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:15,318
De Moine register or something over it

1351
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:17,000
but uh the uh uh so I it's I I can't

1352
00:47:15,318 --> 00:47:18,400
speak directly a lot of experience with

1353
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,039
it sometimes we had to physically take

1354
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,200
machines across state lines and order to

1355
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:24,279
run a test and uh the hulling I I I've

1356
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:26,000
done dehulling on other things uh when

1357
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:30,160
we get into some of the nut crops and so

1358
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,519
forth um how tough that Hull is is a

1359
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:33,399
huge difference between different seeds

1360
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:36,280
dehulling soybeans just requires a

1361
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:38,280
handling system typically uh but uh

1362
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,040
something like this sound and so if you

1363
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,760
start breaking seeds uh we've been into

1364
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:44,599
some things for food grade application

1365
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,440
dehulling cotton seed which is brutal um

1366
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:50,240
some other spelt or something might be

1367
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:52,760
an issue as well but um usually I wind

1368
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:54,358
up trying to take a light pass and then

1369
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,839
recirculate the product back through

1370
00:47:54,358 --> 00:47:58,159
somehow so there may be some

1371
00:47:55,838 --> 00:48:00,880
opportunities on that we uh perhaps can

1372
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:02,440
discuss that later and uh maybe there's

1373
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,160
some things we can look at to help

1374
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,760
resolve that problem I don't have a lot

1375
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:07,399
of De huling equipment but there's some

1376
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,520
Elsewhere on campus as well that we can

1377
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:13,440
get to and uh other potential

1378
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:15,719
applications okay all right very enough

1379
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,000
uh any anybody else have a question

1380
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:19,558
they'd like to to to bring up at this

1381
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,838
time to to

1382
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:25,119
Allen or you can put it on the chat just

1383
00:48:22,838 --> 00:48:27,199
go ahead and type in anything at this

1384
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:30,039
point

1385
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:31,799
alen uh this is uh Garett Coleman I was

1386
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:33,119
had a quick question this summer when we

1387
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,240
were running wheat and you're going to

1388
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,599
get into uh uh gravity tables but I was

1389
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:39,598
showing one of the guys that works for

1390
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:42,079
us the difference in test weight going

1391
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:44,720
across the gravity weight uh table from

1392
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,960
light to dense and I was using one of

1393
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:50,798
the handheld moisture test that has a

1394
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:53,039
test weight and from the light side it

1395
00:48:50,798 --> 00:48:54,920
was almost a point moisture difference

1396
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:56,239
to the Wet Side it was going from like

1397
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:59,079
11

1398
00:48:56,239 --> 00:49:02,199
five to like 127 or 12 eight I guess it

1399
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:05,280
was over a point is that pretty

1400
00:49:02,199 --> 00:49:07,118
common it's it's deceiving okay uh you

1401
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,240
said this is a handheld moisture meter

1402
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,920
okay so you're just you're not you're

1403
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:13,479
you maybe preway a sample or you're just

1404
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,838
pouring it into a cup and filling it to

1405
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:19,000
a certain point okay um that moist that

1406
00:49:16,838 --> 00:49:21,159
meter is based on capacitance okay the

1407
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,159
capacitance of seed it turns out that

1408
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:25,078
that can be correlated with density and

1409
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:26,558
it can correlate with moisture if you

1410
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:29,480
mix both both of them together it's a

1411
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:32,559
problem uh is an undergrad years ago we

1412
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:34,960
managed to prove that we could run uh uh

1413
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:36,240
wet corn 25% moisture corn across the

1414
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,679
gravity and the different fractions

1415
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:42,279
would read anywhere from

1416
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:44,598
um 14% to 40 off the same lot that was

1417
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,920
supposed to be 25 the air oven samples

1418
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:46,760
came back and they were all basically

1419
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,440
within

1420
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:52,359
1% uh plus minus one but uh so we were

1421
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:54,079
basically fooling the moisture meter

1422
00:49:52,358 --> 00:49:56,159
because the density differences moisture

1423
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:58,359
meters are not typically calibrated ated

1424
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:00,759
on at least in the 80s were not

1425
00:49:58,358 --> 00:50:02,639
calibrated on density and I've got an

1426
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,799
idea your machine can be fooled by the

1427
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:07,239
density variation it's much more likely

1428
00:50:04,798 --> 00:50:09,719
that the uh that that you're really

1429
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:11,199
seeing a density difference but it's

1430
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:12,759
being reflected in the moisture meter

1431
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:15,358
readings as well since it's not

1432
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:18,520
compensating for that um you will

1433
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:19,960
typically see a a difference in density

1434
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:21,599
what we're usually looking for here and

1435
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,599
we'll talk about more curves but the

1436
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,838
idea is that if I can get this right

1437
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:27,519
here is that we have a lowered it

1438
00:50:25,838 --> 00:50:29,558
product you know toward the light end

1439
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:31,400
it's kind of an incline perhaps uh and

1440
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:33,880
then to a more of a plateau with the

1441
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,720
higher density and uh we're trying to

1442
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:38,119
frequently remove the product that's low

1443
00:50:35,719 --> 00:50:39,798
density maybe recirculate or do

1444
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:41,760
something else with that intermediate

1445
00:50:39,798 --> 00:50:43,440
product and then hopefully keep the good

1446
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,440
and maybe we have to remove stones or

1447
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,880
something as well uh off the heavy

1448
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:50,119
fraction but yeah density is one of the

1449
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,599
big things when you're talking about

1450
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:53,760
gravities I see people frequently

1451
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,160
looking at things just visually but

1452
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,599
sometimes you'll miss stuff that way uh

1453
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:58,118
if you you don't see the density

1454
00:50:56,599 --> 00:51:01,838
difference I've got a couple examples

1455
00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:03,079
we'll use to to do that um likewise if

1456
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:04,960
we don't have time if you don't get a

1457
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:06,119
question in here uh my email was at the

1458
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,798
beginning and it'll be at the end of

1459
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:09,519
this presentation as well so you're

1460
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:12,000
always welcome to email me things as

1461
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:13,639
well and uh we can help deal with it uh

1462
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,920
gravities and color Sor seem to be

1463
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:16,358
something I talk about a lot the

1464
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,798
students joke sometimes that you could

1465
00:51:16,358 --> 00:51:19,279
wind up the key in my back and I'll

1466
00:51:17,798 --> 00:51:22,039
start mechanically telling you about

1467
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:24,359
gravities and color orders so um they'

1468
00:51:22,039 --> 00:51:27,480
be an important topic in the

1469
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:29,440
business other

1470
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:32,318
questions probably we'll just let you

1471
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:34,880
get back into your your presentation too

1472
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:36,639
but uh again start thinking about these

1473
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,680
questions and again you know

1474
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:40,078
there's you can see the tremendous

1475
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:41,759
amount of experience and like I said

1476
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,318
what you think is oh well we have a

1477
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,559
moisture gradient well it's it's like I

1478
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:48,480
said it's confounded with the density of

1479
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,519
the of the product so that was that's

1480
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,559
really really neat insight there so

1481
00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:55,400
thank you after we did those tests in

1482
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:57,798
the 80s um I was working with uh Dr

1483
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:00,680
Charles herberg at Iowa State at the and

1484
00:51:57,798 --> 00:52:02,119
uh there's some more history there but

1485
00:52:00,679 --> 00:52:05,279
let's just say later on the moisture

1486
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:06,798
meters came out that uh would take when

1487
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,880
the moisture meter started taking test

1488
00:52:06,798 --> 00:52:10,798
weight it's because they're attempting

1489
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:12,798
to compensate for the effect of density

1490
00:52:10,798 --> 00:52:14,798
differences on that and we basically

1491
00:52:12,798 --> 00:52:17,639
just showed how aggravated it could be

1492
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:19,960
uh when we were playing with it um so

1493
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:21,519
anyway back to the uh gravities and

1494
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,000
color orders things that are upgrading

1495
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:24,639
it and it depends a little bit on you

1496
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,838
know you I frequently see people

1497
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:27,798
thinking that these are somehow

1498
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:29,519
interchangeable um because maybe they

1499
00:52:27,798 --> 00:52:31,480
see the same defect coming out in either

1500
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:33,039
one and it depends on what the problem

1501
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:34,599
was you know back to physiology and

1502
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:35,798
pathology does it affect the density

1503
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:37,599
does it affect the color maybe it

1504
00:52:35,798 --> 00:52:39,759
affects both if it affects both we might

1505
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:41,519
be able to get them with either one uh

1506
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,599
but sometimes density is more important

1507
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:45,358
or color can be um you know color if

1508
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:46,960
I've got purple stain on soybeans I

1509
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:48,960
really can only get it with the color

1510
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,639
but there's times when low density seed

1511
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,000
comes out unfortunately if it's only low

1512
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:54,239
density humans aren't very good at

1513
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
seeing that so I get into this argument

1514
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:58,078
we have an on on going debate in the

1515
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,599
midwest on you know do we replace the

1516
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,200
gravity with a color order and things

1517
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:03,559
and that might make some sense in

1518
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:05,439
soybean but for surely that weed example

1519
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:11,559
he had would probably be the wrong

1520
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:13,720
choice um for that okay um okay then uh

1521
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:15,798
so if we start talking about uh you

1522
00:53:13,719 --> 00:53:17,719
gravity separators and D Stoners both

1523
00:53:15,798 --> 00:53:19,280
separate with a fluidized bed to kind of

1524
00:53:17,719 --> 00:53:21,639
differentiate it from an aspirator that

1525
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,200
might blow the low density away um in

1526
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:25,239
this case we're going to float a layer

1527
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:26,919
of uh fluidized product across and

1528
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:29,078
basically float the light from the heavy

1529
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:32,880
a d Stoner uh is the name implies

1530
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:35,039
basically removes the uh um heavy

1531
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,480
product Stone soil pads you know lumps

1532
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:38,759
of dirt or other things that might be in

1533
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,480
there uh whereas the gravity provides

1534
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,319
more of a continuous range from light to

1535
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,240
heavy and we get into this decision on

1536
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:48,199
where we're going to cut and try to keep

1537
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:50,078
and throw away uh we start talking about

1538
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:51,879
density everything we've talked about

1539
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:54,119
here so far is bulk density it's test

1540
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:55,920
weight uh that's done with a test weight

1541
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:57,160
apparatus but then

1542
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,880
the moisture meters are actually

1543
00:53:57,159 --> 00:54:00,679
calibrated against something like this

1544
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,440
in order to give you that number the

1545
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:04,879
bulk density does kind of in since

1546
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:07,159
you're just filling a volume like a pint

1547
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,599
or a quart cup uh for setting of gravity

1548
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:10,399
I've actually used coffee cans and

1549
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:13,280
weighed them if we didn't have anything

1550
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:15,160
else available but uh particle density

1551
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,160
tries to remove the void spaces you know

1552
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:19,358
what's the density of the seed itself uh

1553
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:20,759
it's a little harder to measure and uh

1554
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:22,440
actually a little less useful in most

1555
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,119
seed applications we use it more for

1556
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,760
research and we're trying to determine

1557
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:28,358
what's you know because you can do it on

1558
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,520
individual seeds if necessary and uh you

1559
00:54:28,358 --> 00:54:31,880
can remove the size and shape effects

1560
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:33,639
and there's a term called specific

1561
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,838
gravity I bring it up here it's it's

1562
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:37,879
really the particle or the seed density

1563
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:39,920
relative to water it's just a number

1564
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:41,920
that's greater than or less than one if

1565
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,559
it's greater than one which is most

1566
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,639
seeds it'll it'll sink in water if it's

1567
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:48,480
less than one it'll float uh if it was

1568
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:50,239
one it's the same density as water but

1569
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,880
it's interesting because the term

1570
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:53,279
gravity table or gravity separator

1571
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:55,599
actually comes from the term specific

1572
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,280
gravity however on large seeds the

1573
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:59,119
density separation is really more of a

1574
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,160
weight separation it comes closer to

1575
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:02,559
that than it does to specific gravity

1576
00:55:01,159 --> 00:55:04,000
okay how does this thing work some of

1577
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,280
you very familiar with it you know that

1578
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,400
you shouldn't have it boiling on the

1579
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,880
deck and so forth but uh not physically

1580
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:11,200
boiling just bubbling but uh basically

1581
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:13,559
if I have a little

1582
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:15,199
hypothetical um bin full of seed here

1583
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:16,480
with air flow straighteners and a fan

1584
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:18,838
that can deliver any amount of air I

1585
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:21,119
need if I turn on the fan low maybe I

1586
00:55:18,838 --> 00:55:24,078
can dry it or aate it but I'm not going

1587
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:27,039
to separate anything um maybe some hulls

1588
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:28,599
um is I after a Goldilocks Point here we

1589
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:31,799
want the point where there's enough air

1590
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:34,359
that it starts to uh basically become

1591
00:55:31,798 --> 00:55:36,159
buoyant uh it'll start to lift and and

1592
00:55:34,358 --> 00:55:38,119
fluidize the product make it act like a

1593
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:39,719
liquid at that point the heavy product

1594
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:42,119
sinks to the bottom and those heavy

1595
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:44,118
particles displace the light ones and

1596
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:45,720
and cause a vertical stratification

1597
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:47,880
we've got to get this to happen before

1598
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:50,679
we can get the separation some air is

1599
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:52,720
good but more is not better uh if I put

1600
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:55,558
too much it's going to tend to bubble

1601
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:57,239
and uh basically mix this um

1602
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:59,119
the whole fluidized layer together and I

1603
00:55:57,239 --> 00:56:01,000
lose the stratification that's why that

1604
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:04,039
they always tell the operators not to uh

1605
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,838
to use too much air um the other problem

1606
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:07,599
with excessive air is it tends to lift

1607
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:08,920
the uh seed away from the deck and you

1608
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:10,480
lose friction with the deck and it's

1609
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:12,519
harder to get the seed to climb up the

1610
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,240
hill I also want to point out that this

1611
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:15,679
whole this type of a separation depends

1612
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:17,558
on the interaction between those two

1613
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:20,358
particles so there's no way to gravity

1614
00:56:17,559 --> 00:56:22,880
separate one seed by this method um and

1615
00:56:20,358 --> 00:56:24,318
it it has an effect on small Lots so

1616
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,599
sometimes you don't have enough product

1617
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:27,519
to cover the de

1618
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:29,200
and so you know we have an assortment of

1619
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:31,000
different sizes of gravities for some of

1620
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:32,759
that same reason but other times you

1621
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,159
physically can't get down to that small

1622
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:37,039
amount quick idea on a Don Stoner and

1623
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:39,759
again it's a single slope uh compared to

1624
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:42,079
a dual slope system uh much like I saw

1625
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,440
on belts but uh the idea here is that we

1626
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:47,440
have a maybe a wire mesh reciprocating

1627
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:50,280
deck and it's uh shaking in such a way

1628
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,920
that it will tend to uh move the seed

1629
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:55,319
whatever is touching the deck will tend

1630
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:57,200
to move up the hill um the uh f put seed

1631
00:56:55,318 --> 00:56:58,838
on at least three seeds deep uh but

1632
00:56:57,199 --> 00:57:01,000
maybe more depending on the application

1633
00:56:58,838 --> 00:57:02,480
in the machine and I bring air flow

1634
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,639
through their perpendicular to the deck

1635
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,119
and I basically stratify this okay I get

1636
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:08,400
that right amount of air flow I

1637
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:09,880
magically get the Goldilocks point of

1638
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,680
you know where I can stratify the

1639
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,920
product the lights on top the Heavies

1640
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:15,558
are on the bottom and they're touching

1641
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:17,039
the deck they get conveyed up the hill

1642
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:19,359
uh and the lights basically float

1643
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:20,599
downhill much like a sled on a snowy

1644
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:22,838
hill or something that you might have

1645
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:24,318
and they're just floating downward and

1646
00:57:22,838 --> 00:57:26,480
uh so they're a bit counterintuitive and

1647
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:27,960
the heavy go up and light things go down

1648
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,798
I've had students look at me because

1649
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:31,960
they're sure I lost my marbles or

1650
00:57:29,798 --> 00:57:33,400
something through and uh in this case I

1651
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:36,639
didn't completely remove all doubt

1652
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:38,240
perhaps but um a gravity is going to

1653
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:40,920
look much the same except that now I

1654
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:42,279
introduce another slope this was uh the

1655
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:45,240
second of three Olivers that have been

1656
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:46,839
in our our plant but uh the idea that

1657
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:50,679
we're going to be bringing this product

1658
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:52,920
uh you know across here um this is the U

1659
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:54,960
top view the highest corner is here so

1660
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:57,400
the slope that you saw over here on this

1661
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:00,079
uh cross-section is vertically through

1662
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,480
this diagram okay so as it's shaking

1663
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:03,720
it's tending to take the Heavies and

1664
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:05,679
move them up the hill uh as we put

1665
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:07,598
product on there's about maybe a two

1666
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:09,239
degree slope along the length and so as

1667
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:11,880
the shakes it just sort of walks its

1668
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:13,639
down a fluidized product has uh a

1669
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,200
relatively low angular Repose and so

1670
00:58:13,639 --> 00:58:17,199
it'll gradually travel down the length

1671
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:19,480
of this if I increase that slope it'll

1672
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:21,439
travel down faster the net result is

1673
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:23,199
that I get a range here again from light

1674
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,200
to heavy and then I'm setting these

1675
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:28,318
Gates perhaps to try to decide what to

1676
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:31,199
keep and uh what to throw away

1677
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:32,759
um okay um there's our slope this was

1678
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:35,199
some really bad soybeans that were

1679
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:37,280
rejected uh from for an organic seed lot

1680
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:38,919
for Japan but uh you can see the dark

1681
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,200
colored seed in here this case I was

1682
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,720
pushing that machine really too fast but

1683
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:44,399
you can kind of see a curve that shows

1684
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:46,798
up that curve really should come down

1685
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,680
more like this and follow this this this

1686
00:58:46,798 --> 00:58:50,400
part um but you can kind of see we're

1687
00:58:48,679 --> 00:58:52,159
again we're rest stratify it and we're

1688
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,559
moving this product down I'll show you

1689
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:55,239
that a little bit more on some Brom

1690
00:58:53,559 --> 00:58:58,400
grass but I want to point point out that

1691
00:58:55,239 --> 00:59:01,000
this separation is not purely um based

1692
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,880
on density it uh if it if everything was

1693
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,318
the same size and shape it basically

1694
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,240
would be uh but if it varied if maybe

1695
00:59:05,318 --> 00:59:10,440
it's made out of plastic it's candy corn

1696
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:12,679
or plastic soybeans or something then

1697
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:14,400
basically the large seeds will sink to

1698
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:16,759
the bottom and displace the small ones

1699
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,200
and you'll get a size separation uh if

1700
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,920
there's a shape difference like we' have

1701
00:59:18,199 --> 00:59:21,679
on corn where you could have flat or

1702
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:24,039
plump round seeds the plump ones will

1703
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:25,838
tend to go to the deck and displace the

1704
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:27,839
others if you mix that together the

1705
00:59:25,838 --> 00:59:28,920
separation is tough to predict uh

1706
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:30,880
sometimes you can get a usable

1707
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:33,079
separation but this is one reason that

1708
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,559
the seed corn company's size product in

1709
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:36,880
addition to plant ability is that it

1710
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:38,240
does gravity separate better uh with at

1711
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:41,000
least a few

1712
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:42,679
sizes okay uh promised you brome grass

1713
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,280
slide this is an older one with a cloth

1714
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:47,480
deck uh running uh Native PR grass

1715
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:49,400
basically across so uh there's a

1716
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:52,240
stratification Zone you can kind of see

1717
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:53,838
the colors on this perhaps but uh we've

1718
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:55,519
got to stratify it once it's been

1719
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:57,599
stratified the lights will start to go

1720
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:59,038
down and then again this is a a large

1721
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,680
difference in density so you can see it

1722
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:02,640
come down pretty quickly and then follow

1723
01:00:00,679 --> 01:00:04,519
the light edge I have progressively

1724
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:06,440
heavier product coming out I was also

1725
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:09,719
taking some product off the stone trap

1726
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:11,880
here so uh we had um some waste baskets

1727
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:13,519
of product here and I shot this picture

1728
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:16,440
these are not Stones these are actually

1729
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:18,038
product that uh um has been excessively

1730
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:19,639
brushed okay when this product came

1731
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:21,480
through it had some secondary threshing

1732
01:00:19,639 --> 01:00:23,879
going on it would be rubbed against a

1733
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:25,480
you know brushing machine and um if you

1734
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:27,318
took the uh

1735
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:29,639
uh remove the parac cartp basically have

1736
01:00:27,318 --> 01:00:31,639
just the kopsis left the kernel inside

1737
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:33,480
is what you have here and then basically

1738
01:00:31,639 --> 01:00:35,358
light hulls and it was interesting that

1739
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:36,719
these hulls were uh actually aspirated

1740
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:38,318
several times before they got to the

1741
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:40,118
gravity and we still had not removed

1742
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:42,318
them the gravity takes them out pretty

1743
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:44,400
easily just a quick example here of what

1744
01:00:42,318 --> 01:00:46,558
those look like here's those light hulls

1745
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,599
only about 4% of these were even filled

1746
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:49,880
but a gravity uh it's it's tough for

1747
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:51,160
something to stay standing vertically

1748
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:53,000
it'll fall over and then I could

1749
01:00:51,159 --> 01:00:55,118
separate it uh that whereas it might

1750
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,519
fall this way through the aspiration and

1751
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,559
again you can see the heavy ones that

1752
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:01,280
were excessively uh brushed they're only

1753
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:03,119
about 3% they're a lot heavier in terms

1754
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:05,240
of test weight than uh than my hulls

1755
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:06,880
would be so there was an obvious

1756
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:08,639
solution to take you know the choice to

1757
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:11,640
remove these you start to get into some

1758
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:15,279
debatable issues on the rest of

1759
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:17,960
this um couple historical diagrams here

1760
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:20,798
on why uh we use gravities and soybeans

1761
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:22,280
and corn um some that same project I

1762
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:23,679
showed you for the mechanical damage

1763
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:25,440
concluded that the biggest single

1764
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:27,838
difference in germination Improvement

1765
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:32,079
for the soybeans was the gravity table

1766
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:33,759
um the uh in corn This was um probably

1767
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:35,160
some 7s eror material but there's some

1768
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,799
light product and if you could remove

1769
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:38,399
this you could basically raise the

1770
01:01:36,798 --> 01:01:40,199
average germination the balance of the

1771
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,639
lot this is kind of a numbers game

1772
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:44,118
because these are not all dead in this

1773
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:45,679
case they were 76% but if what you could

1774
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:47,720
remove would slightly improve the

1775
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:49,719
germination of something like this the

1776
01:01:47,719 --> 01:01:51,519
the numbers are more dramatic when you

1777
01:01:49,719 --> 01:01:53,358
get into some of the vegetable seeds

1778
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:55,798
here was uh some onion seed and this is

1779
01:01:53,358 --> 01:01:57,598
upgrading onions okay when you first run

1780
01:01:55,798 --> 01:01:59,960
anion seed through it you get a lot of

1781
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:01,680
foreign material that comes out but uh

1782
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:03,119
if the germination is not good enough

1783
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:04,679
oops we've got to run it back over the

1784
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,599
gravity and cut some more maybe we cut

1785
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:07,719
20 or 30% in order to get something

1786
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:09,559
that's marketable because the

1787
01:02:07,719 --> 01:02:11,159
germination is just not high enough I

1788
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:14,119
see the same thing on carrots and some

1789
01:02:11,159 --> 01:02:15,960
other vegetables but um there's no real

1790
01:02:14,119 --> 01:02:17,358
color difference here but if you look

1791
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,880
and this is just done with a little toy

1792
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:20,759
gravity practically it's not even a very

1793
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:24,559
good separation but my light is more

1794
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:25,720
like uh 23% versus 64 a big gravity

1795
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:27,160
probably would have gotten at least a

1796
01:02:25,719 --> 01:02:29,480
little bit of product here off the you

1797
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:31,278
know about 80% this is just blowing that

1798
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:32,880
up looking at it closer again very

1799
01:02:31,278 --> 01:02:35,358
little visual difference but definitely

1800
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:38,119
a density difference and uh here's just

1801
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:39,480
a quick shot of some uh the the roll

1802
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:41,838
towels basically looking at the

1803
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:45,679
germination sample for the light uh

1804
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:47,719
versus uh the heavy product here um so

1805
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:49,278
uh again the numbers weren't dramatic

1806
01:02:47,719 --> 01:02:51,838
but it can see a difference that density

1807
01:02:49,278 --> 01:02:53,278
would make in viability okay uh here's

1808
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:55,358
another one that was interesting not

1809
01:02:53,278 --> 01:02:57,199
replicated but I have some really nice

1810
01:02:55,358 --> 01:02:59,119
looking sweet corn that came through and

1811
01:02:57,199 --> 01:03:00,919
we gravity separated it and separated it

1812
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:02,519
by density you know measured the density

1813
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:06,440
differences on this curve that we talked

1814
01:03:02,519 --> 01:03:08,719
about and oops I I I realized I had 25%

1815
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:10,240
of the product I'd removed um so we did

1816
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:11,358
some things and made it into five and

1817
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:12,679
then Blended them back you know a

1818
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:14,838
miracle kind of occurred and we came

1819
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:16,278
back but got it back to three fractions

1820
01:03:14,838 --> 01:03:19,159
and then uh thought it'd be interesting

1821
01:03:16,278 --> 01:03:22,159
to show you the uh the results from the

1822
01:03:19,159 --> 01:03:25,078
germination trays so basically from uh

1823
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:29,719
light to heavy this was about 54 % this

1824
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:31,480
is about 94 94 95 and uh there's a

1825
01:03:29,719 --> 01:03:32,759
difference in Vigor as well on it now

1826
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:34,358
I'm going to warn you the sweet corn and

1827
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:36,520
yellow Dent are uh certainly not the

1828
01:03:34,358 --> 01:03:38,440
same uh sweet corn tends to have more

1829
01:03:36,519 --> 01:03:39,759
problems but we had tried colored

1830
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,880
sorting this there really was very

1831
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,880
little visual difference to be had but a

1832
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:45,480
big difference for density okay

1833
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:46,920
sometimes contaminants might come out we

1834
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:49,760
had a Serial grain question here on

1835
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:51,838
wheat uh we frequently see uh Urgot and

1836
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:54,400
wheat or barley or rye was the classic

1837
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:55,920
problem with Urgot um have a lot of time

1838
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:58,119
to get into it today but in food grade

1839
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,400
products uh Google ergotism and uh

1840
01:03:58,119 --> 01:04:02,160
you'll you'll find some interesting

1841
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:04,079
things um there it's it's a bad idea to

1842
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:05,838
have this stuff in feed and food okay

1843
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:09,440
and this was looking at separating Urgot

1844
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:11,639
by density and uh we were looking at uh

1845
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:14,079
in this case is they were looking at

1846
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:15,480
different lots and basically the uh what

1847
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,960
it came out after the cleaner is the

1848
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:20,159
blue and the percent Urgot and uh the

1849
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:22,000
red is the gravity heavy which it did

1850
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:24,558
not get to zero but it removed the bulk

1851
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,199
of it the gravity lights have a lot of

1852
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:28,960
so don't feed that to your neighbor's

1853
01:04:26,199 --> 01:04:31,118
horse uh something that effect but uh

1854
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:33,159
we've done a uh it can be very very

1855
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:35,079
effective at removing that again

1856
01:04:33,159 --> 01:04:36,838
sometimes when we're getting uh things

1857
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:40,119
like Urgot or if we have some of the mot

1858
01:04:36,838 --> 01:04:42,960
toxins perhaps apoxin and corn or peanut

1859
01:04:40,119 --> 01:04:44,640
uh if you get into you know vomitoxin

1860
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,440
perhaps you have to be a little careful

1861
01:04:44,639 --> 01:04:48,239
if the if the overall lot was not safe

1862
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,599
for feeding food and now we concentrate

1863
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:52,358
it it can be substantially worse we see

1864
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:54,599
that even aggravated if it's corn going

1865
01:04:52,358 --> 01:04:57,199
to an ethanol plant because the uh the

1866
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:59,318
fumonisin don't go away they just get

1867
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:01,919
basically tripled as far as the percent

1868
01:04:59,318 --> 01:05:03,639
level once the starch goes away so uh

1869
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,519
other diseases on corn this was just

1870
01:05:03,639 --> 01:05:08,519
showing uh the effect of uh sizing and

1871
01:05:06,519 --> 01:05:10,838
gravity separating so basically have

1872
01:05:08,519 --> 01:05:13,400
four sizes here and then gravity uh

1873
01:05:10,838 --> 01:05:14,960
lights mediums and Heavies and uh we'll

1874
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,599
cut to the chase here but in this

1875
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,119
research they found that on that

1876
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:20,359
particular lot that they were working

1877
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:24,318
with they were getting about uh

1878
01:05:20,358 --> 01:05:25,838
3.2% of the uh uh the seed in that

1879
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:28,079
particular size in the lights for the

1880
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:29,519
small round but it was about 40% of the

1881
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:31,920
infected seed for

1882
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:34,599
fusarium um so it it kind of shows you

1883
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:38,240
this advantage of sizing and uh density

1884
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:39,680
separation uh together we'll um okay

1885
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:41,159
when you start talking about gravities

1886
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:42,838
you'll see different shapes I mentioned

1887
01:05:41,159 --> 01:05:44,480
that there's seven different machines

1888
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:46,679
with triangular and trapezoidal and

1889
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:50,000
rectangular decks uh in our lab they

1890
01:05:46,679 --> 01:05:51,759
have different purposes um but uh I have

1891
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,119
to teach people how to run this

1892
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,640
assortment of different machines the

1893
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:57,519
first thing we look for is which way is

1894
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:59,679
the shake going if you overlay the uh

1895
01:05:57,519 --> 01:06:01,679
trapezoidal machine like this one with

1896
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:03,399
the rectangular so that the deck motion

1897
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:05,440
is in the same direction it's much

1898
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:07,160
easier to understand what's going on so

1899
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:09,159
perhaps we have a rectangular deck like

1900
01:06:07,159 --> 01:06:11,078
the one I've been showing you it's uh

1901
01:06:09,159 --> 01:06:13,159
this sort of a shape the conventional

1902
01:06:11,079 --> 01:06:15,720
wisdom is that provides a longer travel

1903
01:06:13,159 --> 01:06:17,239
path for the uh light seed and does a

1904
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:18,798
more efficient job of separating the

1905
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:21,318
light which is usually what we're trying

1906
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:22,838
to remove if we're trying to just get a

1907
01:06:21,318 --> 01:06:25,278
you know like on a lot of the fuel crops

1908
01:06:22,838 --> 01:06:27,639
or other things if we're after the heavy

1909
01:06:25,278 --> 01:06:29,199
product sometimes we see the trapezoids

1910
01:06:27,639 --> 01:06:31,480
these used to be very common for corn

1911
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:34,358
for some historical reasons as well but

1912
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:36,318
uh longer travel path for the heavy uh

1913
01:06:34,358 --> 01:06:38,719
again this I see them a lot in vegetable

1914
01:06:36,318 --> 01:06:40,278
plants yet uh where they're trying to uh

1915
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:42,598
get you they're trying to salvage some

1916
01:06:40,278 --> 01:06:45,159
product from a lot that's uh perhaps

1917
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:45,160
inadequate

1918
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:51,880
otherwise okay uh here's an old video

1919
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,760
1988 uh showing uh the the first Oliver

1920
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:56,838
that was in our lab uh running

1921
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:59,520
um and uh you'll see some product again

1922
01:06:56,838 --> 01:07:00,838
coming in uh from the top here the inlet

1923
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:02,838
stratifies you can kind of see the

1924
01:07:00,838 --> 01:07:04,599
lights coming down over here and then a

1925
01:07:02,838 --> 01:07:06,838
range from the light up to the heavier

1926
01:07:04,599 --> 01:07:10,559
product uh as this migrates down through

1927
01:07:06,838 --> 01:07:12,480
the deck if I uh uh get Brian Fischer I

1928
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:14,160
believe thre that uh that's that's

1929
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,719
actually a Nightshade Berry but we do

1930
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:18,679
the same thing type of thing today with

1931
01:07:15,719 --> 01:07:20,639
a uh roasted Coffee Bean um but uh

1932
01:07:18,679 --> 01:07:22,000
they'll take off and they'll just float

1933
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:23,558
down here you can see the lights uh

1934
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,278
it'll work its way the reason that's

1935
01:07:23,559 --> 01:07:29,200
blinking is not your system it's a very

1936
01:07:25,278 --> 01:07:31,480
short video in a loop so um case you

1937
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:33,358
hadn't seen one of those run okay now we

1938
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:35,358
do all the things to try to adjust it we

1939
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:36,960
we have full day or now we were trying

1940
01:07:35,358 --> 01:07:39,239
to do a two-day workshop on gravities

1941
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:41,199
this year before covid came around but

1942
01:07:39,239 --> 01:07:42,959
um once you separate it there's

1943
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:44,558
sometimes the efficiencies this isn't

1944
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,358
good enough we know that if we have a

1945
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:49,039
range from light to heavy that you know

1946
01:07:46,358 --> 01:07:52,159
if if this is good and that's bad um

1947
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:53,920
somewhere in the middle is intermediate

1948
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:55,838
uh mediocre product and so it's a

1949
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:58,240
question if that's a mix of good and bad

1950
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:59,558
or if it's uh just mediocre if it's just

1951
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:01,879
if it's just mediocre running it in

1952
01:07:59,559 --> 01:08:03,440
circles isn't going to make it better um

1953
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:07,880
if it's a mix of good and bad maybe we

1954
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:10,720
can recover um the good so um the

1955
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:14,000
traditionally um we'll just simply cut

1956
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:15,838
it okay uh on small Lots but and I see a

1957
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,399
few companies that will store that

1958
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:18,798
middling and do something else with it

1959
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:20,920
that typically means they have another

1960
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:23,479
use for it okay it's you can never

1961
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:25,399
really add it back to the same lot lever

1962
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:27,198
uh the most common thing was much like

1963
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:29,079
the little forsberg you see here where

1964
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:30,838
it's uh recirculated over the deck that

1965
01:08:29,079 --> 01:08:32,960
was a trapezoidal deck there's a short

1966
01:08:30,838 --> 01:08:34,479
travel path for the lights and it

1967
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,960
wouldn't be completely separated and by

1968
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:38,158
bringing that back around it gave it

1969
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:40,239
another chance basically to separate out

1970
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:42,158
I see a lot of that on Seed corn small

1971
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:43,759
lots and so forth uh when you get into

1972
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:45,559
the larger volume field crops I

1973
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:47,198
frequently see a second Gravity used

1974
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:48,880
maybe they bought a big new Gravity and

1975
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:50,838
they used the older gravity to recover

1976
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:53,400
the midling sometimes I'll see a color

1977
01:08:50,838 --> 01:08:55,318
sorder or a belt separator used if uh if

1978
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:56,759
you can imagine imagine like if the only

1979
01:08:55,319 --> 01:08:58,719
thing wrong with the middling product

1980
01:08:56,759 --> 01:09:01,880
was it had dark seed in it a small color

1981
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:03,399
sorder might be able to recover that um

1982
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:05,159
so biggest thing if you are

1983
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:07,119
recirculating this product try to

1984
01:09:05,158 --> 01:09:08,798
minimize the amount that's recirculating

1985
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:10,479
I've been to plants where 50% of the

1986
01:09:08,798 --> 01:09:12,079
product from the gravity is running back

1987
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:14,318
over the same Gravity the gravity is

1988
01:09:12,079 --> 01:09:16,238
overloaded it's not doing a good job

1989
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:17,880
maybe it should be 10 or 15% that

1990
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:19,439
depends on the application but you can

1991
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:24,759
definitely overdo

1992
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:26,798
recirculation um okay um any any gravity

1993
01:09:24,759 --> 01:09:28,920
separator questions while I'm here I can

1994
01:09:26,798 --> 01:09:30,679
assure you there's plenty of slides but

1995
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:31,798
uh are there other things that we should

1996
01:09:30,679 --> 01:09:36,199
cover

1997
01:09:31,798 --> 01:09:36,198
here we had a good test weight question

1998
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:46,439
before if not I'm going to go ahead and

1999
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:47,600
plow into color sords um again probably

2000
01:09:46,439 --> 01:09:48,879
a little less of this I don't know how

2001
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,359
many of them are out there in your

2002
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,640
Market we see plenty of them going into

2003
01:09:50,359 --> 01:09:53,719
corn plants and they're gradually going

2004
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:54,960
into soybean plants as well the first

2005
01:09:53,719 --> 01:09:56,760
first ones I did were actually for

2006
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,880
popcorn food grade product again trying

2007
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:00,480
to get things out for retail uh I

2008
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,560
frequently show things like these

2009
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:04,238
rejects the the accepts and rejects are

2010
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,920
actually the two streams off of a color

2011
01:10:04,238 --> 01:10:08,678
sorter it's necessarily good and bad but

2012
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:10,119
usually the rejects are the bad um the

2013
01:10:08,679 --> 01:10:11,520
the Junior High kids will tell me these

2014
01:10:10,119 --> 01:10:13,319
are gross and they would never want them

2015
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,719
in their package at the store so uh you

2016
01:10:13,319 --> 01:10:16,920
can see why there was an advantage to

2017
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:18,480
sorting that product up front uh foreign

2018
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:21,319
material is the other big reason for

2019
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:23,399
popcorn but uh there's happens to be

2020
01:10:21,319 --> 01:10:25,439
sataki and what we're sortex or ber

2021
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:27,639
machine here I have several of those in

2022
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:29,279
our lab the other machines tend to visit

2023
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:32,520
so you're going to see those more often

2024
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:34,279
in this uh but uh you know that isn't

2025
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,679
necessarily endorsement or disadvantage

2026
01:10:34,279 --> 01:10:37,399
of one or the other so I have lots of

2027
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:39,480
pictures of other slides but not enough

2028
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:40,719
time to show them all okay um so when

2029
01:10:39,479 --> 01:10:42,319
we're dealing with color sords we're

2030
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:43,640
dealing with some interaction of light

2031
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:46,039
you know we dealt with gravities you

2032
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:47,360
know on density and screens with size or

2033
01:10:46,039 --> 01:10:48,880
perhaps but you know you can have

2034
01:10:47,359 --> 01:10:51,839
different parts the electromagnetic

2035
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:53,159
spectrum and uh in this case perhaps uh

2036
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,039
most of it's going to be visible light

2037
01:10:53,158 --> 01:10:56,599
because that's what we can see it's also

2038
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:57,760
going to be reflected light because if

2039
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,840
you're looking at the surface of the

2040
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,840
seed you're seeing light reflect from

2041
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:04,279
that surface and uh so if we're trying

2042
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:07,039
to get discolored defects uh that's we

2043
01:11:04,279 --> 01:11:09,439
want something similar but I do see

2044
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:11,158
translucent sorts occasionally where the

2045
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:13,079
light goes through it we're basically

2046
01:11:11,158 --> 01:11:15,119
candling it I see a fair amount of neur

2047
01:11:13,079 --> 01:11:17,000
INF fored at this point that's primarily

2048
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:18,719
foreign material removal but uh that's

2049
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,679
an area where seeds are or the machines

2050
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:22,920
are evolving pretty fast there's been a

2051
01:11:20,679 --> 01:11:26,480
few UV machines that would use a

2052
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:29,000
fluorescent typ swort as well um but um

2053
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:30,559
we'll focus mostly on visible today and

2054
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,399
uh you may remember from high school

2055
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:35,360
physics that if you had a uh a prism you

2056
01:11:33,399 --> 01:11:37,039
could separate visible light like what's

2057
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:38,839
coming from the window over here uh into

2058
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:42,519
different colors and those correspond to

2059
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:44,600
different wavelengths of light um so we

2060
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:46,960
can pick a certain wavelength perhaps

2061
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,719
and you accentuate the contrast uh and

2062
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,679
then use combinations of them to improve

2063
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:52,719
our separation uh we're dealing with

2064
01:11:50,679 --> 01:11:54,760
something in color separation so uh it's

2065
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:56,359
a light and dark it's not always as easy

2066
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:57,719
as this one I like to joke with the

2067
01:11:56,359 --> 01:11:59,799
students here that we've got a seed

2068
01:11:57,719 --> 01:12:01,719
identification quiz that happens to be

2069
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:03,679
roasted in green coffee beans uh when

2070
01:12:01,719 --> 01:12:05,520
that lot came in it was 1,200 pounds of

2071
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:07,719
it I've had upwards I've had coffee

2072
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:09,560
beans in about six times uh the biggest

2073
01:12:07,719 --> 01:12:10,840
lot was 5,000 pounds so our idea of a

2074
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,719
samples a bit bigger than the rest of

2075
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,520
the

2076
01:12:11,719 --> 01:12:15,399
building but this is actually an

2077
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:17,800
interesting separation it smells great

2078
01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:19,559
going through the tower uh we can get

2079
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:21,600
discolored seed because that's what

2080
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:23,800
we're doing it's rarely ever This Clean

2081
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:26,360
Cut okay uh usually you need something

2082
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:27,600
much more subtle uh broken seed depends

2083
01:12:26,359 --> 01:12:28,920
on whether there's actually a color

2084
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,480
difference I've seen where you could

2085
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:34,920
maybe pick up a shadow you know off a

2086
01:12:31,479 --> 01:12:36,519
shriveled seed but uh the a straight

2087
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:38,239
color sorder is just looking for color

2088
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:40,080
differences it doesn't really see

2089
01:12:38,238 --> 01:12:42,000
density but sometimes you can remove low

2090
01:12:40,079 --> 01:12:44,079
density if it's off also discolored if

2091
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,760
there's an overlap in those two curves

2092
01:12:44,079 --> 01:12:47,279
this is one example where a gravity will

2093
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,679
give you almost a straight line because

2094
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:50,158
there's a huge difference in the density

2095
01:12:48,679 --> 01:12:52,600
of those two products on the roasted is

2096
01:12:50,158 --> 01:12:54,000
a lot lighter moisture's been removed

2097
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:55,679
but um

2098
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,158
the uh then maybe we finish up with a

2099
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:59,880
color sorder or you can do it all in a

2100
01:12:58,158 --> 01:13:03,079
color sorder but it'll take several

2101
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:05,520
passes okay uh if it's a 50/50 mix is

2102
01:13:03,079 --> 01:13:08,119
what that was okay so couple quick seed

2103
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:10,120
examples here this is soybeans uh if you

2104
01:13:08,119 --> 01:13:12,479
don't happen to run across those in your

2105
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:13,960
territory uh but uh very colorful

2106
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:15,479
product it's one reason I see people

2107
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:17,520
trying to use just you know they'll use

2108
01:13:15,479 --> 01:13:20,319
like a cleaner and then a spiral or a

2109
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:22,120
belt and a color sorder perhaps but uh

2110
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:24,279
you can see some of the purple stain in

2111
01:13:22,119 --> 01:13:27,559
here it's a physiological

2112
01:13:24,279 --> 01:13:28,759
defect uh but immatures other things uh

2113
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:30,039
I've had students joke that they were

2114
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:31,320
going to put this in a little fancy

2115
01:13:30,039 --> 01:13:34,800
bottle and tie a ribbon around it and

2116
01:13:31,319 --> 01:13:37,158
sell it at Walmart um might bring more

2117
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:39,760
than the seed but uh Farmers Market

2118
01:13:37,158 --> 01:13:41,960
perhaps but uh in corn we're typically

2119
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:43,600
removing darks or maybe some brights

2120
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:45,880
which is tricky because there's bright

2121
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:47,600
Parts on the yellow Dent corn as well in

2122
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:49,600
Iowa we have lots and lots of yellow

2123
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:52,600
Dent pollen floating around and during

2124
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:54,480
the summer and uh so one common thing we

2125
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:57,120
have if it's other types of corn classes

2126
01:13:54,479 --> 01:13:59,359
of corn we can be frequently removing

2127
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:01,800
yellow Dent from white corn or from Red

2128
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:03,399
corn or from blue corn or orange corn uh

2129
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,639
whatever other kinds of corn we might

2130
01:14:03,399 --> 01:14:06,679
have out there because they've been

2131
01:14:04,639 --> 01:14:09,319
cross-contaminated with the yellow Dent

2132
01:14:06,679 --> 01:14:11,000
pollen um another big Advantage I

2133
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:12,599
mentioned that a gravity can't run very

2134
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,920
small Lots because you can't cover the

2135
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:16,440
deck adequately uh a color sorter can

2136
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:19,359
theoretically color sort individual

2137
01:14:16,439 --> 01:14:21,198
seeds Okay so we're looking at uh

2138
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:22,238
actually a small lot here uh this they

2139
01:14:21,198 --> 01:14:24,599
would use these for breeding

2140
01:14:22,238 --> 01:14:26,198
applications but that was the the

2141
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:28,000
student doing this for three years was

2142
01:14:26,198 --> 01:14:29,519
running 800 to a thousand of those lots

2143
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,800
through a color sorder that we tweak for

2144
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:33,520
small lots and uh could do it more

2145
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:35,440
consistently than he could do it

2146
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:37,159
individually okay uh we had a wheat

2147
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:39,479
question before this is separating white

2148
01:14:37,158 --> 01:14:41,079
and red classes of wheat uh for a

2149
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:42,759
breeding application maybe only five

2150
01:14:41,079 --> 01:14:45,920
bushels total but trying to get it as

2151
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:47,960
close as possible to Pure okay uh

2152
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,760
sunflowers uh we're dealing here with

2153
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:52,960
taking a a black seed out of a black

2154
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:55,000
defect in some cases so uh this was a

2155
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,880
case were near infrared because they use

2156
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,238
both visible light and near infrared and

2157
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:01,039
sometimes a few more combinations uh the

2158
01:14:59,238 --> 01:15:03,279
bane of this is usually something called

2159
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:04,760
scor roia it's a black defect that by

2160
01:15:03,279 --> 01:15:06,399
the time it reaches the color sorder is

2161
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:09,039
the same size and shape and density as

2162
01:15:06,399 --> 01:15:11,158
the seed itself and so uh and it's kind

2163
01:15:09,039 --> 01:15:13,238
of bad in confectionary and uh for

2164
01:15:11,158 --> 01:15:16,519
pathological reasons as well but can be

2165
01:15:13,238 --> 01:15:18,678
removed with reasonable uh efficiency

2166
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:20,960
okay uh then you can also get spot

2167
01:15:18,679 --> 01:15:22,560
defects uh this was uh it's a long story

2168
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,719
here but basically we're picking out

2169
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:28,280
seeds that had little bug bites that

2170
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:29,960
subsequently became um moldy and uh we

2171
01:15:28,279 --> 01:15:31,639
could kick those out as long as the

2172
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:33,319
product is presented towards the camera

2173
01:15:31,639 --> 01:15:35,039
a color sorter typically has a camera at

2174
01:15:33,319 --> 01:15:37,840
front and rear view if it's turned

2175
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:40,158
sideways it may not see that okay so a

2176
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:41,760
couple quick examples I mentioned I I I

2177
01:15:40,158 --> 01:15:43,839
could show you slides quite a while here

2178
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:45,560
but uh the the larger versions of the

2179
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:47,920
sortex machines that I've shown you look

2180
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:49,320
something more like this uh to where we

2181
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:51,039
might have and they've gone to LED

2182
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:53,639
lights instead of fluorescence like used

2183
01:15:51,039 --> 01:15:55,479
to be in most of them um this sataki

2184
01:15:53,639 --> 01:15:57,319
machines uh the monochromatic machines

2185
01:15:55,479 --> 01:15:59,279
look more like the upper right uh you

2186
01:15:57,319 --> 01:16:00,799
start to see some RGB machines which is

2187
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:03,039
really kind of the trend in the business

2188
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:05,480
here right now I want to bring up just a

2189
01:16:03,039 --> 01:16:07,198
few things to talk about uh you know as

2190
01:16:05,479 --> 01:16:09,079
far as how these things work this I'm

2191
01:16:07,198 --> 01:16:11,000
going to go a little bit quick here so

2192
01:16:09,079 --> 01:16:14,840
uh bear with me to try to get closer to

2193
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:17,158
lunch but uh the uh uh here's just an

2194
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:18,760
older uh sortex machine and a

2195
01:16:17,158 --> 01:16:22,238
cross-section of that so basically you

2196
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:23,440
have a feeder on top you have uh a chute

2197
01:16:22,238 --> 01:16:25,079
that basically acceler Ates and

2198
01:16:23,439 --> 01:16:27,519
simulates the product as it goes down

2199
01:16:25,079 --> 01:16:28,960
past in front of the cameras and uh we

2200
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,600
basically try to look at it in the front

2201
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:33,239
rear view and then based on the signal

2202
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:37,079
there's air ejectors that fire at it and

2203
01:16:33,238 --> 01:16:38,959
basically blow the U rejects out which

2204
01:16:37,079 --> 01:16:41,600
are normally The Bad Seed so you wind up

2205
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:43,319
with two streams of Rejects and accepts

2206
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,760
okay um there's three things that any

2207
01:16:43,319 --> 01:16:47,319
color sorder has to do uh basically it's

2208
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:49,079
got to convey the product pass the

2209
01:16:47,319 --> 01:16:50,960
cameras properly at a single stream so

2210
01:16:49,079 --> 01:16:52,559
it can see them all and there's some

2211
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:54,760
issues on trying to go fast enough to

2212
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,920
get Capac capity and spaced far enough

2213
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:58,880
apart to get an efficient separation uh

2214
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:00,560
without losing too much yield we have to

2215
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,119
detect it and that's where one of the

2216
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,639
subsequent slides here gets into the

2217
01:17:02,119 --> 01:17:05,920
ability to tell the difference between

2218
01:17:03,639 --> 01:17:07,600
good and bad uh and then compare that

2219
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,679
signal to something that tells the thing

2220
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:11,360
to remove it and so timing of those air

2221
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:12,920
ejectors is another thing that we talk

2222
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:15,519
quite a bit about uh during the

2223
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:16,719
workshops okay um this next one gets a

2224
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:18,520
little more involved but there's a

2225
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:21,359
signal on the older ones it's a voltage

2226
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:23,840
but there's a signal based on uh on on

2227
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:25,880
the intensity how dark the product Mak

2228
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,800
and uh you'll see here machines being

2229
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:29,840
called monochromatic Bic chromatic or

2230
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:31,079
RGB and I just want to help explain that

2231
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,400
if you've got someone talking to you

2232
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:33,559
about the differences in machines

2233
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:35,158
because it makes a difference in what

2234
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:37,400
they can separate the traditional

2235
01:17:35,158 --> 01:17:38,920
machines had basically one signal we get

2236
01:17:37,399 --> 01:17:42,559
back to my bell-shape curve they would

2237
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:45,279
try to uh um Center the U middle of that

2238
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:46,560
bell-shaped curve that's the relative

2239
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:47,880
lightness or darkness of the good

2240
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:49,360
product some's a little darker than the

2241
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:50,960
others they put that in the middle

2242
01:17:49,359 --> 01:17:52,519
there's another probability curve

2243
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:54,000
basically for the dark defects or the

2244
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:56,000
light defects and then there's one

2245
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,960
number that basically can be adjusted to

2246
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,600
tell it how much dark to remove if you

2247
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:02,719
raise that too much you start to carve

2248
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:04,560
into the good seed and uh likewise a

2249
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:06,319
light sort there were some machines that

2250
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:08,120
did an independent sort it's basically

2251
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:10,319
like having two color sorters one after

2252
01:18:08,119 --> 01:18:12,238
the other uh basically if it's saw in

2253
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:14,599
dark or if it's saw in light then it

2254
01:18:12,238 --> 01:18:16,439
might remove it um and there's a few

2255
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,960
combinations this has kind of gone away

2256
01:18:16,439 --> 01:18:20,039
to be replaced with what was called a

2257
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:22,399
Bic chromatic or the next step will be

2258
01:18:20,039 --> 01:18:24,079
the RGB machines a Bic chromatic machine

2259
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:25,559
allows it to look at the interaction of

2260
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:26,880
those two things so that in addition to

2261
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:29,560
saying that it's dark in one and light

2262
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:32,159
in the other or you can say that you you

2263
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:34,639
can you can look at combinations thereof

2264
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:37,198
um basically red versus green or red

2265
01:18:34,639 --> 01:18:39,480
versus blue were common visible spectrum

2266
01:18:37,198 --> 01:18:42,238
ones red versus infrared is harder to

2267
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:44,039
show on a PowerPoint slide um the some

2268
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:45,919
of the one of the ones I have basically

2269
01:18:44,039 --> 01:18:47,920
has these trip lines that can be used to

2270
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:50,359
box in the good seed and any defect that

2271
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:52,440
goes outside of the the Box basically

2272
01:18:50,359 --> 01:18:55,039
tries to be removed um the newer

2273
01:18:52,439 --> 01:18:57,039
machines you started to see ooids that

2274
01:18:55,039 --> 01:18:58,800
basically surround the good seed and

2275
01:18:57,039 --> 01:19:00,880
then uh there were defect perimeters

2276
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:03,000
around here so uh they were different

2277
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:05,719
like these are brights these are darks

2278
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,479
maybe uh on this up up here on red

2279
01:19:05,719 --> 01:19:09,679
versus green I might have some kind of

2280
01:19:07,479 --> 01:19:11,599
reddish type seeds or green immatures or

2281
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:13,679
something you know down on this side and

2282
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:15,480
so we can have different uh defect

2283
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:18,279
classes color defect classes that we can

2284
01:19:15,479 --> 01:19:19,678
have individual sensitivities for um it

2285
01:19:18,279 --> 01:19:21,439
doesn't take too much to figure out that

2286
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:22,960
if I can plot red versus green or red

2287
01:19:21,439 --> 01:19:24,439
versus blue that I could do red green

2288
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,359
blue in a cube and have a

2289
01:19:24,439 --> 01:19:28,079
three-dimensional color map which is

2290
01:19:26,359 --> 01:19:30,039
really the way the RGB machines are

2291
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:31,519
going uh almost every new visible

2292
01:19:30,039 --> 01:19:34,760
spectrum machine I see come on the

2293
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:37,520
market today is is an RGB unit okay um

2294
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:39,239
or some more advanced things okay then

2295
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:41,480
um the other thing you'll typically see

2296
01:19:39,238 --> 01:19:43,399
people talk about doing a shape sorting

2297
01:19:41,479 --> 01:19:46,319
I mentioned this kind of in context

2298
01:19:43,399 --> 01:19:48,238
contrast to the spirals but this is a a

2299
01:19:46,319 --> 01:19:50,679
two-dimensional profile it depends on

2300
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:52,359
how the seat is oriented uh but you

2301
01:19:50,679 --> 01:19:53,840
usually you can look for area it works

2302
01:19:52,359 --> 01:19:55,519
better on things like soybean that it

2303
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:57,199
does on corn that could fall this way

2304
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:59,800
soybeans being roughly spherical makes

2305
01:19:57,198 --> 01:20:02,719
it a bit easier area and length are

2306
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:04,480
usually pretty useful maybe circularity

2307
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:06,600
depending on product presentation but

2308
01:20:04,479 --> 01:20:08,359
it's uh definitely an evolving area

2309
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:10,039
happens quite a bit I mentioned that on

2310
01:20:08,359 --> 01:20:12,519
gravities we sometimes Resort the

2311
01:20:10,039 --> 01:20:15,519
middling on color sorters this is back

2312
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:17,639
to my uh Infamous uh coffee a single

2313
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:19,719
sort might not get there uh by itself

2314
01:20:17,639 --> 01:20:21,719
and so we have to go at it again uh we

2315
01:20:19,719 --> 01:20:23,520
frequently recirculate either the good

2316
01:20:21,719 --> 01:20:24,960
or the bad product uh depending on what

2317
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,960
it is more often they're trying to

2318
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:29,039
recover good from the uh reject in a

2319
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:30,439
commercial plant here in the Midwest so

2320
01:20:29,039 --> 01:20:32,600
I'm going to show you just a couple

2321
01:20:30,439 --> 01:20:34,039
quick examples at the workshops we can

2322
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,840
get into more detail on various

2323
01:20:34,039 --> 01:20:37,399
configurations but the idea here was

2324
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,760
there was a four module machine running

2325
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:41,519
the primary product the rejects were

2326
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:43,400
then going to the single module machine

2327
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:45,920
the smaller one over here and uh

2328
01:20:43,399 --> 01:20:47,638
recovering The Good Seed from the reject

2329
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:50,119
so here's just an example of what that

2330
01:20:47,639 --> 01:20:54,239
would look like in a soybean uh facility

2331
01:20:50,119 --> 01:20:55,599
so we basically have uh uh kind of a

2332
01:20:54,238 --> 01:20:56,799
there's a couple of Handling Systems

2333
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,400
happening here but basically we're

2334
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:01,159
sorting it the first time this is an

2335
01:20:58,399 --> 01:21:04,439
intermediate product uh that's then

2336
01:21:01,158 --> 01:21:07,119
being sorted again uh the accepts from

2337
01:21:04,439 --> 01:21:08,799
the the resort are going down here and

2338
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:10,559
you still see that there's some defects

2339
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,000
there that actually gets Blended back

2340
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,639
with the incoming product give it a

2341
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,639
chance to get these remaining darks back

2342
01:21:13,639 --> 01:21:19,039
out of there at the end of the day this

2343
01:21:15,639 --> 01:21:21,440
is basically our uh discard over here uh

2344
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:22,760
our good seat is over here these two in

2345
01:21:21,439 --> 01:21:24,000
the center are just intermediate

2346
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:25,480
products that kind of whirl around

2347
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,840
within the

2348
01:21:25,479 --> 01:21:30,359
process um okay uh big problem again we

2349
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:32,159
talked about like measuring test weight

2350
01:21:30,359 --> 01:21:33,799
on a gravity uh you know how do you tell

2351
01:21:32,158 --> 01:21:35,238
if a color sorder is doing its job you

2352
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:38,039
typically have to me you know look at

2353
01:21:35,238 --> 01:21:39,919
things uh look at samples so uh I wind

2354
01:21:38,039 --> 01:21:41,639
up being uh very interested in you know

2355
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:43,399
automating some of this thing trying to

2356
01:21:41,639 --> 01:21:44,840
to be consistent you know humans aren't

2357
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:46,679
consistent from one day to the next or

2358
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:48,199
one operator to the next so we're

2359
01:21:46,679 --> 01:21:51,319
gradually doing more work with uh

2360
01:21:48,198 --> 01:21:53,198
Optical Imaging to try to help uh make a

2361
01:21:51,319 --> 01:21:56,359
better tool that gets results more

2362
01:21:53,198 --> 01:21:57,638
quickly uh for that so with that as we

2363
01:21:56,359 --> 01:21:59,759
start we've kind of got through our

2364
01:21:57,639 --> 01:22:02,159
separation part I want to just uh

2365
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:03,800
mention again I I promised Dr Taylor

2366
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:05,759
there'd be one Traer slide I have some

2367
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:08,760
more that are hidden here but uh this is

2368
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:10,719
an one I put in years back I was happen

2369
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:13,520
to be back there doing some training but

2370
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:15,439
um basically we wind up you most of the

2371
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:18,199
traditional treatments were put on for

2372
01:22:15,439 --> 01:22:19,359
pathogen protection um you there's

2373
01:22:18,198 --> 01:22:22,079
various things that can be done to

2374
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:24,158
improve improve planner performance uh

2375
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:26,238
as you get into um some of the specialty

2376
01:22:24,158 --> 01:22:28,359
seeds you see more uh buildup or

2377
01:22:26,238 --> 01:22:30,279
pelleting occurring uh some of that is

2378
01:22:28,359 --> 01:22:32,359
gradually migrating into the field crops

2379
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:33,719
as well but uh this happened like sugar

2380
01:22:32,359 --> 01:22:35,920
beets would be an example where they'd

2381
01:22:33,719 --> 01:22:37,359
make them more spherical or Canola where

2382
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:39,920
they'd make them larger and a rape seed

2383
01:22:37,359 --> 01:22:41,279
so they'd plant a little bit better um

2384
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,840
but uh you're going to hear a lot more

2385
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:45,158
of that from uh Peter Marx this

2386
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:47,159
afternoon and uh again the whole

2387
01:22:45,158 --> 01:22:48,920
business on uh on treating you know to

2388
01:22:47,158 --> 01:22:50,279
get good results from your treater

2389
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:52,279
sometimes proper preparation is

2390
01:22:50,279 --> 01:22:53,679
important we talked about how uh we have

2391
01:22:52,279 --> 01:22:55,479
problem s in the seed plant if that

2392
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:57,039
combine operator didn't do his job or if

2393
01:22:55,479 --> 01:22:58,799
the seed came in it was moldy because it

2394
01:22:57,039 --> 01:23:01,158
wasn't dried properly when we start

2395
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,719
talking about treating uh if we leave a

2396
01:23:01,158 --> 01:23:04,000
lot of foreign material in there some of

2397
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:06,279
your treatment's going to stick to that

2398
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
dust and dirt that's in there uh instead

2399
01:23:06,279 --> 01:23:09,800
of the seed you're more likely to get

2400
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,399
dust off there's going to be problems uh

2401
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:13,679
that occur uh because of that so we want

2402
01:23:11,399 --> 01:23:16,279
to get a a nice clean product to the

2403
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:18,239
treater uh before we go on to it uh the

2404
01:23:16,279 --> 01:23:19,759
peling gets to be an interesting example

2405
01:23:18,238 --> 01:23:21,839
we got into some things with some flow

2406
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:23,639
seed we're removing uh little hairs uh

2407
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,800
from the flower but they didn't think

2408
01:23:23,639 --> 01:23:27,119
that was a problem because they don't

2409
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:29,000
germinate well it turns out that uh when

2410
01:23:27,119 --> 01:23:30,399
they pellet it the little hairs would

2411
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
also get pelleted and they look just

2412
01:23:30,399 --> 01:23:35,000
like a seed when they got to the seed

2413
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,800
lab and they would try to plant them and

2414
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,800
by removing the little hairs before they

2415
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:40,719
pelleted their germination results went

2416
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:43,600
up which uh was kind of an interesting

2417
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:45,600
story so with that uh we get into you

2418
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:47,440
know different packaging again beyond

2419
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,520
the scope of this but uh various things

2420
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:51,439
may happen from Little foil bags to

2421
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:53,639
large bulk bags or even true bulk out

2422
01:23:51,439 --> 01:23:55,359
here winds up in the warehouse and uh

2423
01:23:53,639 --> 01:23:57,119
you know Proper Storage conditions again

2424
01:23:55,359 --> 01:23:59,839
are important to deliver uh you know

2425
01:23:57,119 --> 01:24:02,158
good product and uh you can be subject

2426
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:03,920
for another presentation someday so uh

2427
01:24:02,158 --> 01:24:07,319
with that I'll leave you read through

2428
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:08,719
some of this um oops sorry back up I

2429
01:24:07,319 --> 01:24:11,279
didn't intend for you to read it that

2430
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:13,239
fast are there uh any questions I can

2431
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:14,920

2433
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:17,520
for the uh

2434
01:24:18,158 --> 01:24:22,759
credits did we put everyone to sleep we

2435
01:24:21,039 --> 01:24:24,238
talked about efficiency and you know

2436
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:28,400
like a batting average so if I'm trying

2437
01:24:24,238 --> 01:24:32,399
to kill cure insomnia uh are we at

2438
01:24:28,399 --> 01:24:32,399
100% is there anyone that's still

2439
01:24:32,679 --> 01:24:38,800
awake well I'm awake alen and right I

2440
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:41,600
appreciate this uh this stuff helps with

2441
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:44,840
that this it it doesn't dat but no

2442
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:48,079
please feel free anybody you know is an

2443
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:51,360
attendee to the you know this this is a

2444
01:24:48,079 --> 01:24:53,679
a font of information and and a lot of

2445
01:24:51,359 --> 01:24:55,559
information but if you have a question

2446
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:59,440
or you can put it in the chat again

2447
01:24:55,560 --> 01:25:00,920
Allen is is the person and uh you g to

2448
01:24:59,439 --> 01:25:03,519
talk a little bit more about the short

2449
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:05,560
courses then before you wrap up okay

2450
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,719
we'll go to this one uh this well we

2451
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:09,119
actually have something called a short

2452
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:12,079
course it was virtual this year uh but

2453
01:25:09,118 --> 01:25:14,238
uh the workshops um this is my uh

2454
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:16,399
perhaps optimistic uh schedule we put

2455
01:25:14,238 --> 01:25:18,319
together for 2021 there's at this point

2456
01:25:16,399 --> 01:25:20,279
a still high probability I have to turn

2457
01:25:18,319 --> 01:25:22,559
this into a virtual program or something

2458
01:25:20,279 --> 01:25:23,960
we had to cancel these last year uh put

2459
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,400
some other things together it gave us an

2460
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:26,760
opportunity to put some other content

2461
01:25:25,399 --> 01:25:28,679
and we've been gradually working on

2462
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:29,840
better ways kind of like a little bit of

2463
01:25:28,679 --> 01:25:31,600
what you're seeing here today better

2464
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:34,119
ways to deliver you know information

2465
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:35,520
remotely but um at least there's the

2466
01:25:34,118 --> 01:25:37,679
type of things that uh we would

2467
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:40,320
typically go through I promise to give

2468
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:43,319
you uh email address and this is the

2469
01:25:40,319 --> 01:25:45,840
website for it um we typically try to

2470
01:25:43,319 --> 01:25:47,559
formalize these uh dates by the atin

2471
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:50,360
meeting in Chicago which is next week

2472
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:52,280
and also virtually uh but uh I'll share

2473
01:25:50,359 --> 01:25:53,799
at least some you know what we we think

2474
01:25:52,279 --> 01:25:56,238
think are going to be the dates if the

2475
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:58,159
uh uh if the co situation improves where

2476
01:25:56,238 --> 01:25:59,718
people can physically visit us on campus

2477
01:25:58,158 --> 01:26:01,039
otherwise uh you could watch that

2478
01:25:59,719 --> 01:26:03,639
website and hopefully something else

2479
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:05,319
will show up or drop me an email um

2480
01:26:03,639 --> 01:26:07,719
again appreciate your patience here

2481
01:26:05,319 --> 01:26:09,238
today uh we'd love like you saw in the

2482
01:26:07,719 --> 01:26:10,760
poster it's kind of neat when people can

2483
01:26:09,238 --> 01:26:12,479
physically come there but the advantage

2484
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:14,239
of remote delivery is sometimes that we

2485
01:26:12,479 --> 01:26:16,799
spend less time on airplanes and uh

2486
01:26:14,238 --> 01:26:20,638
maybe a larger audience um

2487
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:22,800
so appreciate that opportunity and uh

2488
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:24,480
that I'm going to I promised Dr I can

2489
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:26,079
come back to this if we need but uh

2490
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:27,479
promise Dr Taylor would' show this at

2491
01:26:26,079 --> 01:26:30,158
the end for those of you that might need

2492
01:26:27,479 --> 01:26:32,039
some credits right good any questions

2493
01:26:30,158 --> 01:26:34,960
while that's up

2494
01:26:32,039 --> 01:26:39,760
there yeah this this is your opportunity

2495
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:41,760
with the with alen and again his large

2496
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:44,400
array of knowledge and experience with

2497
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:47,520
so many different seeds and working with

2498
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:49,679
so much different seed cleaning

2499
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:51,360
equipment now it's some some sometimes

2500
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:52,920
it's a case where you know an awful lot

2501
01:26:51,359 --> 01:26:54,439
about a very narrow feed field uh we

2502
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:56,158
know I've been I've spent my whole

2503
01:26:54,439 --> 01:26:57,919
career pretty much around seed plants

2504
01:26:56,158 --> 01:26:59,359
and uh you know some food grade what I

2505
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:01,399
call food grade seeds like you know the

2506
01:26:59,359 --> 01:27:03,799
popcorn dry beans serial grains this

2507
01:27:01,399 --> 01:27:06,319
type of thing very little in in the the

2508
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:07,679
commodity grain okay I I haven't done a

2509
01:27:06,319 --> 01:27:09,599
lot with that I get to some of those

2510
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:12,440
facilities I've refurbished a few of

2511
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:13,800
them but uh you know in the the 22 years

2512
01:27:12,439 --> 01:27:16,039
out there working you know designning

2513
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:18,079
plants now I mostly talk about them but

2514
01:27:16,039 --> 01:27:19,279
uh we see a a much more diverse array of

2515
01:27:18,079 --> 01:27:20,639
different seeds you know hopefully at

2516
01:27:19,279 --> 01:27:22,479
some point we can bring the hemp seeds

2517
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:27,039
in and help answer those questions

2518
01:27:22,479 --> 01:27:29,359
better but um chestnuts hazelnuts uh

2519
01:27:27,039 --> 01:27:30,719
Iowa ones that are being domesticated I

2520
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:33,679
mean a lot of funny things wander

2521
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:35,840
through uh our facility um again a small

2522
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:37,279
part of a bunch of different plants

2523
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:38,560
sometimes learning something for

2524
01:27:37,279 --> 01:27:41,118
instance uh we've done some work I

2525
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:42,880
didn't show you here with uh with u with

2526
01:27:41,118 --> 01:27:44,559
cerus but it turns out that many of the

2527
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:48,480
methods we had developed for flax worked

2528
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:48,480
and so you can kind of build on what you

2529
01:27:49,479 --> 01:27:54,118
learned

2530
01:27:51,118 --> 01:27:54,118
okay

2531
01:27:54,760 --> 01:28:02,159
okay well this this does take us to noon

2532
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:05,719
and uh again I W to thank you

2533
01:28:02,158 --> 01:28:09,359
and give you a a nice thumbs up for your

2534
01:28:05,719 --> 01:28:10,439
presentation and a virtual clapping

2535
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:14,799

again such such an excellent

2538
01:28:17,319 --> 01:28:22,118
presentation with so much information

2539
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:24,039
provided uh I think I have to go back

2540
01:28:22,118 --> 01:28:27,519
can listen to the recording sometime

2541
01:28:24,039 --> 01:28:30,039
just to to pull out some some individual

2542
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:32,040
information where you were going talking

2543
01:28:30,039 --> 01:28:34,760
about some of the equipment so again

2544
01:28:32,039 --> 01:28:36,479
thank you so much all right well again I

2545
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:38,679
G to give you a thumbs up on your end

2546
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:40,559

2547
01:28:38,679 --> 01:28:42,800
we get some people in from uh various

2548
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:45,440
companies up there doing pumpkins doing

2549
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:48,239
uh organic uh white corn and things like

2550
01:28:45,439 --> 01:28:50,158
this uh um you know some Flint corns and

2551
01:28:48,238 --> 01:28:51,759
stuff have come in samples and so forth

2552
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:53,839
and uh We've we've some small family

2553
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:55,679
owned companies have been out uh one of

2554
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:58,560
their sons came out and came to Iowa

2555
01:28:55,679 --> 01:29:00,118
State after a workshop uh so uh he's now

2556
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:02,400
an agronomist that's working for one of

2557
01:29:00,118 --> 01:29:04,399
the seed companies so um it's it's a

2558
01:29:02,399 --> 01:29:07,960
neat opportunity for collaboration and

2559
01:29:04,399 --> 01:29:09,679
uh much appreciate that so okay like for

2560
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:11,319
me i' I've got another hour till lunch

2561
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:12,880
but uh you know so I could stay on but I

2562
01:29:11,319 --> 01:29:15,118
suspect a you you've got other things

2563
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:16,600
that you'd like to do and I I I would

2564
01:29:15,118 --> 01:29:18,198
you know recommend trying to catch that

2565
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:19,520
presentation at one and some of the

2566
01:29:18,198 --> 01:29:21,118
others later this afternoon will get

2567
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:23,239
more into product and performance but

2568
01:29:21,118 --> 01:29:25,279
the the equip part you get into treating

2569
01:29:23,238 --> 01:29:27,599
and things that affect those results uh

2570
01:29:25,279 --> 01:29:29,238
you know should be covered and for you

2571
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:32,079
know a range of seeds but that are not

2572
01:29:29,238 --> 01:29:35,678
probably just corn so be there either

2573
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:35,679
good thank thank

2574
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:43,639
you this has been a production of

2575
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:46,639
Cornell University on the web at

2576
