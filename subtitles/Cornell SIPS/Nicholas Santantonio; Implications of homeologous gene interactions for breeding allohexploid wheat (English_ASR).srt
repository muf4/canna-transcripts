1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,639
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:09,900
University actually one of the things I

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:17,429
did in this presentation was tried to

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:19,710
remove most of the math there was a lot

5
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:22,640
of math in there so I produced a lot of

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,310
that and hopefully made it digestible

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,140
okay so yeah as John Luke introduced I

8
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:30,868
did my masters at New Mexico State

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,250
University I was working on auto

10
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:34,710
tetraploid alfalfa there and

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,049
particularly in transpiration efficiency

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,469
these are leaf peels just for fun you

13
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:42,628
can see the little stomata there and why

14
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,929
I got when I came or now I got

15
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:50,699
interested in G by E because I had seen

16
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:54,030
it right so so a little a little

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:57,420
exciting when I get in there so you can

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,609
see here this this is a this was a study

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,320
I had during my Master's it's under

20
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,030
really heavy drought conditions and

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,640
you'll notice the alfalfa that's going

22
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,349
right in front of it is much healthier

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,769
so there are differential responses to

24
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:12,509
environment and so I'm gonna briefly

25
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:15,239
talk about a little bit of the work I've

26
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,950
done with genotype and by environment

27
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:23,429
interaction mostly just as a plug or a

28
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:25,890
our package I wrote and then I'm gonna

29
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,080
move on to the part of my PhD that I'm

30
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,799
most excited about okay

31
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:34,349
so typically we think of genotype by or

32
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:38,130
typically we think of a phenotype as

33
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:40,519
some function of the genetics and the

34
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:43,589
environment in which those plants are in

35
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:45,000
however you know different genotypes

36
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,009
respond differently to different

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,349
environments and so there's really an

38
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,680
interaction term here this this is GE

39
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:54,629
right so there's some population mean mu

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,140
some genetic effects some environmental

41
00:01:54,629 --> 00:02:02,709
effect and then some deviation from that

42
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:06,780
from that additive model okay and

43
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:09,489
so I was interested in utilizing

44
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,219
utilizing what's called an additive main

45
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:16,020
effects multiplicative interaction

46
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:17,979
popularized by Hugh Gao himself and

47
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,480
who's sitting in the audience which is

48
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:22,810
great to have him here so he can put me

49
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:25,389
out on all the things I've been wrong so

50
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,580
anyway the idea is is that you can think

51
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:29,529
of you can think of this problem as a

52
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:33,100
matrix right you have a table of

53
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:35,590
genotypes in some environments right so

54
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:37,180
here I've got a table of genotypes where

55
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:39,280
they're the same across all environments

56
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,810
and a table of environment effects where

57
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,500
they're the same across all genotypes

58
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:46,780
and then I have some deviation from that

59
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,969
ok and but so the problem with with this

60
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,439
G by E term is what we'd like to do you

61
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:54,099
typically want to separate out the

62
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:55,810
largest sources of variability as the

63
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:58,750
treat you know the Chronicle true G by E

64
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,580
and pull out the smaller sources is

65
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,969
error and this is particularly useful

66
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,890
when you have unreplicated field trials

67
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:07,840
okay so this is done through right so

68
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:09,298
this is a matrix right and what we can

69
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,239
do is use singular value decomposition

70
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:16,390
to find linear combinations of that G by

71
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:18,819
E matrix that are the most associated

72
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:21,339
with that G by E effect okay or explain

73
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:23,049
the bulk of the variance now estimating

74
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,599
how many of these we should pull out

75
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:28,629
right so we're trying to find K of them

76
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:31,509
is is another problem especially for

77
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:35,919
unreplicated data because the the G by E

78
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:41,019
effect and the error okay so I developed

79
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:43,988
a an r package called bilinear that fits

80
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:47,709
a me models it also fits other bilinear

81
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:50,140
models such as the GG e and the g reg i

82
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:51,459
don't know some of you may be familiar

83
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:53,559
with these I'm not going to talk about

84
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:56,979
them in great detail there's quite a bit

85
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,110
of literature on this I my my preferred

86
00:03:56,979 --> 00:04:01,590
method is the a me because I think it's

87
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,590
most parsimonious

88
00:04:01,848 --> 00:04:08,628
and so this this this package that I

89
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,730
wrote fits various models and can't you

90
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:14,268
know does some you know produces plots

91
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:16,250
and tests but more importantly has a

92
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:17,870
couple of tests for how many of these

93
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:22,430
dimensions we should pull out of the G

94
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:25,269
by a turn in particular we have an F our

95
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:28,189
test that was developed by P fo and 95

96
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:30,589
and this is great for replicated data or

97
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:34,579
at least data where you have a known

98
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:36,728
within trial variance but when we don't

99
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:39,258
have replicated data we can use a

100
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:41,060
parametric bootstrap method that was

101
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:42,830
developed by fork min and P so I've

102
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:46,250
implemented these in this our package

103
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:48,139
because at the time there were no are

104
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:52,370
packages that would fit these and I

105
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:53,810
think that now there's a gge at GUI or

106
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,668
something like that it's a it's a

107
00:04:53,810 --> 00:05:00,379
graphic user interface but it is in our

108
00:04:57,668 --> 00:05:01,879
but this this this fits both types of

109
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:03,439
models and and it tests and what's

110
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:07,069
really important is is that this can

111
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:08,689
handle unreplicated data now the test

112
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:12,529
tends to be more conservative than the

113
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:13,759
apart but it's really useful especially

114
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:16,189
for our trials where we don't

115
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,629
necessarily have replication looking

116
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:21,439
environment because there's been this

117
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:24,918
big shift to moving toward putting much

118
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,930
more lines in a trial as opposed to

119
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:29,930
replicating those lines many many times

120
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,939
within a trial okay and so this is

121
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,470
available on github I'm still uncertain

122
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:34,848
it probably needs a little bit more

123
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:38,570
polishing before it'll ever go on to

124
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:40,639
cram and but right now from github you

125
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:44,930
can install this directly in our using

126
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,728
the package so that's kind of fun so

127
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,199
these are just some examples for those

128
00:05:46,728 --> 00:05:51,110
of you not familiar with a bi plot

129
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:53,120
essentially what you're doing is you're

130
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,038
you decompose this thing right and

131
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,079
you're looking at there's a genotype

132
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,569
dimension and an environment dimension

133
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:02,060
so we have the first two principal

134
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:03,560
components of the genotype and the first

135
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,189
two principal components related to the

136
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,718
environment okay and so I'm not going to

137
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:10,759
go into the details of how to interpret

138
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:12,370
these models in particular but basically

139
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,469
these by class are useful because

140
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:18,199
relationships between

141
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,880
environments or genotypes and genotypes

142
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,129
and environments are related by their

143
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,079
angles okay where where a cue angles are

144
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:26,449
associated with positive relationships

145
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:30,430
and right angles are associated with

146
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:34,370
independence and a negative relationship

147
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:35,509
right so so Helfer here help for 2014

148
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:40,189
here is a very different environment

149
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:44,539
from say khatola 16 but apparently has a

150
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:45,769
very independent G by E response whereas

151
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:50,210
these sets of environments are all

152
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:51,500
relatively in the G by E response okay

153
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:53,719
and then we can do things like we can

154
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:57,620
make these these winter plots that are

155
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:01,940
also out of Gaussian so veld 97 I

156
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:04,610
believe and what you what we do here is

157
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:07,279
we we have the main effect of the

158
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:10,310
genotype and then the slope is the a

159
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:12,709
me--one fit right that says how they

160
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:14,569
respond to a changing environment so

161
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:15,649
down here we've ranked the environments

162
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:19,069
and indicated them with these look like

163
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:20,359
triangles and then you can see that

164
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:22,029
there are individuals that do

165
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,410
particularly good in poor environments

166
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:26,479
and then their response goes down as the

167
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,430
environment decreases whereas their

168
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,310
individuals that do particularly well in

169
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:35,540
good environments but not particularly

170
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:38,780
bad environments okay so this was just

171
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:41,180
to kind of introduce this package we've

172
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:43,129
I've worked together with Lisa

173
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,540
kissing Cusack a colleague of mine in

174
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:50,120
Mars lab she was looking at organic

175
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:54,140
wheat yield trials that were replicated

176
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:58,310
from Vermont and North Dakota looking at

177
00:07:54,139 --> 00:08:00,829
the response of organic grains to

178
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:02,720
different growing environments and she

179
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:05,000
found that there was significant

180
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,770
location or genotype by location effects

181
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,240
such that it made sense to have these

182
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:11,539
decentralized programs in these

183
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,850
different region now this this study was

184
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,800
nice because it was replicated but we

185
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:17,930
ended up using the parametric bootstrap

186
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,389
regardless because they tended to give

187
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:23,800
more biological relevant numbers of

188
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:23,800
interactions so typically fewer

189
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:34,100
dimensions

190
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:36,529
right so KK was low like 1 or 2 that's

191
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:38,930
in contrast to another paper I worked on

192
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:40,250
with another student from Mark's lad

193
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:42,168
Lundeen straw both of these students

194
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,460
have graduated this one hasn't quite

195
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:49,549
been submitted yet but it's very close

196
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:51,170
and we worked on G by E and we were able

197
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:53,029
to show that there were significant G by

198
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:54,620
E effects but in general the genetic

199
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:56,509
correlation across the environments that

200
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,419
she evaluated in New York were very

201
00:08:56,509 --> 00:09:03,679
similar or was was relatively high so

202
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:07,459
then we were able to recommend that that

203
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:10,429
breeding for fruit and content could be

204
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:12,320
done with relatively few environments if

205
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:15,469
only a single environment and as well as

206
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,020
under a genomic selection scape now this

207
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,029
one we did not have replicated

208
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:21,740
individuals so this in this case the

209
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:25,730
parametric bootstrap was really

210
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:27,649
convenient to have ok now I'm gonna move

211
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:30,920
on to Ella polyploid really what I want

212
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:33,350
to talk about so in my second year of

213
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:35,389
grad school I was taking a course with

214
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,970
marks laurels that I think many of you

215
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:41,059
have taken it's basically a paper review

216
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,740
class and in that class we read this

217
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:45,979
paper by James McKee that was published

218
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:50,090
about in 1970s almost 50 years ago and

219
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:53,539
he talks about how there okay so he

220
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:55,850
notes that that whole genome duplication

221
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:57,679
events are just pervasive in the blankey

222
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,409
they're everywhere especially in

223
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,359
angiosperms right where even if you know

224
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:03,949
there are these paleo polyploid events

225
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,700
that happened a long time ago and then

226
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,060
there's a bunch that have happened

227
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:10,040
relatively recently too and he talks

228
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:12,979
about how there's this balance and be in

229
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:14,929
in creating new genetic variation but

230
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,529
then preserving particularly good sets

231
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:21,289
of alleles right and so so one thing he

232
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:24,379
notes is that a low polyploids have this

233
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:26,480
ability to establish homozygosity so

234
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:28,659
that they can keep good sets of alleles

235
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,550
but they end up being heterozygous

236
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:33,079
across the sub genomes now that might

237
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:37,029
sound a little confusing and I'm going

238
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:40,250
to clarify in a second and that

239
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:42,620
essentially this idea of a low

240
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,210
polyploidy bringing bringing

241
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,710
relatively you know closely related

242
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:49,730
species together into the same organism

243
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:51,650
allowed for multitudes of gene functions

244
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,080
that should allow for broader out

245
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:56,090
adaptation or you know adaptation a much

246
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,980
broader landscape because you have these

247
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:00,820
different combinations of alleles to

248
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:04,240
draw from for different genetic pathways

249
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:08,540
okay so a little a little on bread wheat

250
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:11,090
so there was the a genome ancestor and B

251
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:13,159
genome ancestor the a genome ancestor

252
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:15,970
you may know today as einkorn start the

253
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:18,379
same species is very closely related and

254
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:21,740
the B genome species is thought to be

255
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:26,210
extinct and which is unfortunate I wish

256
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:28,990
I hope that one day we find it and you

257
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:31,400
know roughly half a million years ago

258
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:33,350
there was a spontaneous cross between

259
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,689
these two closely related species and

260
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,909
they produced a tetraploid that had that

261
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,410
had both an A and a B genome right so

262
00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:41,990
all this one you took a complete set of

263
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:43,250
genes from one species and a complete

264
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,649
set from another and you brought them in

265
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,600
the same organism all right and then

266
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:49,220
this happened again

267
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,610
roughly ten thousand years ago and maybe

268
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:55,430
only once with a related species called

269
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:58,789
a jalops how GI which contributed the G

270
00:11:55,429 --> 00:12:01,039
excuse me of a D genome to common wheat

271
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:04,789
okay so now what we know of is common

272
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:07,669
wheat which you know bread we primarily

273
00:12:04,789 --> 00:12:10,129
bread wheat but of course also wheat for

274
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:13,579
cake flour and so on and so forth has

275
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:16,820
three separate genomes ie three sets

276
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:21,290
complete sets of genes okay and I've

277
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:23,420
just been fascinated why what is the

278
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:26,269
driving mechanism for duplicating an

279
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:28,669
entire genome right so so a single gene

280
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:31,039
we imagine may get duplicated and then

281
00:12:28,669 --> 00:12:33,709
you you can maintain function with one

282
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,120
copy and allow the other one to diverge

283
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,980
but what what is the what is the

284
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:43,970
advantage of having complete whole set

285
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:45,860
or you know of genes okay and so so so

286
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,570
here's kind of lay this out right we

287
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,149
have three genomes in a low hexaploid

288
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:51,350
wheat and undergoes disomic inheritance

289
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:53,600
which means there's no crossing over

290
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,490
between homologous chromosomes so more

291
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,540
or less the three sets maintain

292
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:00,529
themselves within

293
00:12:56,539 --> 00:13:04,399
they don't they don't switch pieces it's

294
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:06,829
self pollinated so it can fix itself

295
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:10,250
right so so so it becomes completely in

296
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:11,480
bread and and individuals will self

297
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,519
pollinate and produce seed that is

298
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,960
genetically identical to the parent

299
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,899
right so they this is the self

300
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,030
preserving part but they maintain this

301
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:22,879
allelic diversity across the three

302
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:24,709
genome okay so this is the this is the

303
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:26,509
you know the new generating part right

304
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:29,509
so you grab you grab a whole set of

305
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:31,009
genes from from one species and one from

306
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:36,769
the other station I got two sets of

307
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:39,350
tools right and so I'm wondering is we

308
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:43,669
can we think of wheat as an immortalized

309
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:45,620
hybrid okay so you brought two okay and

310
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:47,929
so here's my here's my justification for

311
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:50,029
this okay so in typical hybrid

312
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:53,449
generation you've some sets of alleles

313
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:56,029
XY and Z that are in an open pollinated

314
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:57,230
population they get separated from one

315
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:58,879
another either intentionally or

316
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,370
unintentionally into two hetero duck

317
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,990
groups Group A and Group B and then when

318
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,549
you bring these back together to form

319
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:06,409
the hybrid you've essentially

320
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:09,109
established hetero zygosity at all those

321
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:11,659
I and you know you have these allelic

322
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:15,440
interaction which we believe may be

323
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:19,789
important for for what we observe as

324
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:22,940
hybrid bigger which is the which is

325
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:24,669
essentially the tendency for offspring

326
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:27,670
to be better than their than their

327
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:29,919
parents okay

328
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:31,689
so now think about the Ella polyploid

329
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:34,269
right we have some set of alleles in the

330
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,860
in the in the common ancestor and then

331
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:37,990
these are a lot you know these may

332
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:40,930
diverge in the in the descendant species

333
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:43,690
uses a and B and then you bring them

334
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:46,419
back together but again right so so this

335
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:48,070
thing becomes inbred and what you've

336
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:50,679
done is essentially established hetero

337
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:53,410
zygosity although sign but now you fix

338
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:55,389
this hetero zygosity because it you

339
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:57,549
through selfing right and the this

340
00:14:55,389 --> 00:15:00,189
disomic inheritance so so what I'm

341
00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:03,219
curious about is can we see evidence of

342
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:05,440
homie allelic interactions that are you

343
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,120
know analogous to allelic interactions

344
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,630
that we see in traditional diploid

345
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,500
hybrids okay and so to investigate this

346
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:16,450
I wanted to know how this played out on

347
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,070
agronomic traits now we have a winter

348
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:21,940
wheat breeding population here at

349
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:24,070
Cornell and so I kind of curated this

350
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:28,150
data set it's roughly 9,000 phenotypic

351
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:29,830
records 1,500 lines crossed about ten

352
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:32,919
years two to three environments per year

353
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:36,610
and and we have evaluated them for

354
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:38,199
portraits essentially in every year now

355
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:41,409
this is a lot of work

356
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,600
it's funny how this amount of man-hours

357
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:46,899
can be you know distilled down into

358
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,889
9,000 you know lines on a you know a

359
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:50,919
computer file somewhere

360
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:53,980
and I will definitely recognize people

361
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:55,389
who have helped put this together okay

362
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,120
so this is the data I'm going to be

363
00:15:55,389 --> 00:16:01,000
working with to describe this

364
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,250
investigation to you so first thing I

365
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,059
was interested in is sub genome additive

366
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:08,950
and interaction effects we typically

367
00:16:07,059 --> 00:16:11,079
think okay so coming back to this idea

368
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:13,570
we typically think of the phenotype as

369
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:17,050
some you know summation of all the

370
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:18,220
genetic effects okay on average but

371
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:20,019
there's no reason why we can't split

372
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,420
these into their individual sub genome

373
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:25,299
effects okay and we can estimate these

374
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:28,719
using you know a very standard genomic

375
00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:30,159
prediction model where and I don't you

376
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,810
know ignore the math math is not

377
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:33,309
particularly important it's just to say

378
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:35,079
that here we're getting a single

379
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:37,809
estimate for a breeding you know for the

380
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:40,310
for the value of every individual based

381
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:43,039
on its entire genome whereas for

382
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:45,139
for in this model we get a different

383
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,120
estimate for each individual based on

384
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:48,949
the free sub genome so you get three

385
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,310
estimates right one for a one cookie one

386
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:55,220
for D ok and we what this is very simple

387
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:59,689
to do we estimate the covariance between

388
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:01,670
individuals using molecular markers and

389
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,950
so we can subset those markers based on

390
00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:05,990
their native genome and then we can

391
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,670
calculate the the covariance between

392
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,150
individuals based on each separate

393
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,870
genome

394
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:14,030
ok for all three and and here's a

395
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:17,208
motivating example to think of why we

396
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:19,250
might be interested in this imagine we

397
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:21,439
had this little toy population of three

398
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:24,588
individuals and we want to pick two to

399
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:27,500
me the obvious choice might be

400
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:29,960
individuals one and two which have the

401
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,849
highest two values but then if we could

402
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,710
see you know for their whole genome but

403
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:36,409
if we could see their individual effects

404
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:38,480
for their sub genomes um well note that

405
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,190
they while they both have very good AMV

406
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,860
genomes they don't tend to have a very

407
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:44,870
good DG so when we make these guys the

408
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:48,740
best value we could possibly obtain is

409
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:50,899
12 right whereas whereas you know

410
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,400
contradictory if you included the third

411
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,830
individual with the lowest breeding

412
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,269
value right you have this potential to

413
00:17:54,829 --> 00:17:59,689
bring it well it doesn't do very good on

414
00:17:56,269 --> 00:18:02,179
a and P it does have and you increase

415
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:06,980
the the you know the maximum value from

416
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:08,480
that cross okay and similarly a you know

417
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:13,279
this is true for both of the two process

418
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:16,019
with it okay so and and more importantly

419
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,309
potentially we

420
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:20,519
look at individuals that have the exact

421
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:22,799
same breeding value and find ones that

422
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:25,230
might have particularly good sub genomes

423
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,599
that we want to incorporate for specific

424
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:31,500
crosses and so what I've done here is

425
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:33,750
I've I've I've plotted the the breeding

426
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,880
values or the or the you know the value

427
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:38,369
that we assigned to the individual based

428
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,820
on its whole genome or the sub genome

429
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:43,379
effect a B&amp;B right and then and then and

430
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:45,899
then I've highlighted kind of the best

431
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,280
5% of the individuals here and what I

432
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,560
want I just want to point out briefly

433
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:52,470
you know the the individual that has the

434
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:54,599
best a genome here is not the individual

435
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,309
with the best whole genome nor does it

436
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:58,919
have a particularly good B genome it's

437
00:18:56,309 --> 00:19:01,139
very moderate and similarly the best B

438
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:04,670
genome individual right has a moderate a

439
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:09,509
and so these are these blue blue squares

440
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:12,779
and and you know the best you know best

441
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:14,609
individual for the D genome again has a

442
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:16,950
you know relatively moderate values for

443
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:18,839
the amv so you might say okay well let's

444
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:20,430
let's take you know the individuals best

445
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:23,220
for a and made it to the one that's the

446
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:24,720
best ability you know and similarly so

447
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,190
in this case for grain yield you know

448
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,319
maybe most of these individuals or at

449
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,789
least be in your pool of individuals you

450
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,179
might select to do this even if you

451
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:34,170
wouldn't necessarily make these crosses

452
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:37,259
but you can see for test weight for

453
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:38,970
example the best D individual it doesn't

454
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,440
have a particularly good whole genome

455
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,140
with that so it might be thrown out

456
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:49,410
altogether and never considered for

457
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:52,080
population so so what this allows us to

458
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:53,880
do is it allows us to select on

459
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,500
complimentary sub genomes for crossing

460
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,280
right we can bring ones that have

461
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,269
different you know good effects together

462
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:01,500
now you could do this with any set of

463
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:02,819
chromatin right you could estimate a

464
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,269
breeding value for every chromosome if

465
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:08,839
you want but that's this gets more

466
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:10,829
complicated the more of these you have

467
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:14,579
interestingly the other thing we could

468
00:20:10,829 --> 00:20:16,649
do is increase in is select on sub

469
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:18,210
genomes specifically right like so one

470
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,950
of the problems is you'll notice the D

471
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:23,850
genome has significantly less variance

472
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:26,100
than the amb which means that when you

473
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:27,659
make selections based on phenotypes you

474
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,039
are making selections on the largest

475
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,880
sources of variants which are coming

476
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,009
from the AMD

477
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,960
so a lot of this work you know a lot of

478
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:37,019
the variation in the D genome is going

479
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,000
to get fixed just through drift and so

480
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:40,859
you could you could select base just on

481
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,019
them eating for example for several

482
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:45,479
rounds you know after say introgression

483
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:49,259
inter dressing from a wild species or

484
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:51,870
something like that but this is just

485
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:53,250
those were just individual sub genome X

486
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:54,779
right what I really care about is how

487
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,788
are these things interacting with one

488
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:58,649
another and we do this through using how

489
00:20:56,788 --> 00:21:00,599
to market products of these covariances

490
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:02,429
the math isn't really important it's

491
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:06,058
just it's just that we can now get a

492
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:08,190
value for every individual based on its

493
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:11,819
interaction between a and B genome B and

494
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:13,409
D and the amp and the and D alright and

495
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:15,569
then we can estimate these variants

496
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:16,590
components and here what I've shown is

497
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:20,038
the different terms

498
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:23,399
a BD a by B a by D for a couple of

499
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:25,230
traits the the estimates are in red with

500
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,740
their standard deviations and then the

501
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:32,190
violin thoughts are our distributions

502
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:33,839
from sampling that data so we subset the

503
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,830
data we estimate those variance

504
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,139
components actually during

505
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:38,548
cross-validation but what we can do is

506
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,659
just see how stable is that variance

507
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:41,548
estimate will notice it for the most

508
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:44,280
part they align very well with their

509
00:21:41,548 --> 00:21:45,569
estimates interestingly you'll notice

510
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:47,000
there's very different genetic

511
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:50,490
architecture between these two traits

512
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,269
while the B genome explains you know

513
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:56,130
most of the variants in both of them

514
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:57,629
you'll notice that here the the D genome

515
00:21:56,130 --> 00:22:00,000
explains a lot more for plant height

516
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:03,120
than it does for granule and the a by D

517
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,339
and B by D interaction effects are much

518
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:08,129
larger than than they are in granule

519
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:09,869
where they're actually very small so so

520
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:12,270
granule doesn't have a whole lot going

521
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:14,548
on or sub G no interactions but we do

522
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:17,548
see it from play and then we can show

523
00:22:14,548 --> 00:22:21,089
that these things some to two to the

524
00:22:17,548 --> 00:22:25,859
same variants as the full genetic effect

525
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:27,959
as well as their interactions okay we

526
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:29,788
can incorporate these interactions into

527
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,409
a genomic prediction model and we can

528
00:22:29,788 --> 00:22:33,960
see that when we model just the additive

529
00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:36,290
effects of the whole genome versus the

530
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,480
three individuals and then some of them

531
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:41,269
you'll see that we get essentially the

532
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:45,130
exact same prediction accuracy for all

533
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:47,240
trades and and then if we incorporate

534
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,110
epistatic interactions one of the things

535
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,349
we can do is incorporate all

536
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:53,389
interactions or we can just incorporate

537
00:22:51,349 --> 00:22:54,829
the interactions across the saloons

538
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:57,259
we'll notice that again

539
00:22:54,829 --> 00:22:59,119
you see what we see increases in

540
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:01,879
prediction accuracy for all the traits

541
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:04,219
except for arguably grain yield here and

542
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,750
that those increases are the same

543
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,079
regardless of whether or not we're

544
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:15,769
modeling all pairwise or or just the

545
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:17,869
pairwise across sub jeans however the

546
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:20,269
problem is is that these things are not

547
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:21,619
independent right so so you know you

548
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:23,839
know in a population under pure

549
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:25,039
hardy-weinberg these these variance

550
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:27,319
components should be independent of each

551
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,359
other but we do have population

552
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:31,579
structure it's not like we see in

553
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:33,919
something like rice for example but you

554
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:37,669
know this is this is just a PC plot of

555
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:39,050
the genetic covariance and you know

556
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:42,980
where we're explaining maybe you know

557
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:44,089
eighteen percent or so of the of the

558
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:47,509
variance which is the first two

559
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:49,099
principal components so there is some

560
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:51,379
population structure in here and it's

561
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:52,490
Mason basically it probably mostly due

562
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,730
to the fact that with many small

563
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:57,140
families right so this is done you know

564
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:00,170
wheat is done a pedigree selection so

565
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:02,690
this is not some big random mating you

566
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:04,820
know population of cattle right there

567
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:06,529
are very specific crosses there are few

568
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:11,689
individuals from each cross that go into

569
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:13,910
it you know advance trial so there could

570
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:17,720
be confounding of estimates here and so

571
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:20,300
I had an attempt to try to remove the

572
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:23,930
largest sources of variation from the

573
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:27,379
marker matrix before we actually

574
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:29,750
calculate how related individuals are so

575
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:32,330
basically under hardy-weinberg these

576
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,710
variances should be independent but

577
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:35,809
typically in a breeding program they

578
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:37,610
will not be so we can take the marker

579
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:39,500
matrix and decompose it using singular

580
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:41,539
value decomposition which is obviously

581
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:47,450
my favorite tool because that's what we

582
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:49,159
used for the ami model and we can pull

583
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:50,190
out the first few principal components

584
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,640
as populations

585
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:55,830
I'm calling that Q we can reform the

586
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,230
marker matrix after we pulled that

587
00:24:55,829 --> 00:25:01,230
population out of all of the markers at

588
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,940
the same time and we reform this by

589
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:06,000
setting the the the first case singular

590
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:08,029
values of D to 0 and and multiplying

591
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,940
right so we make this D tilde multiply

592
00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:13,649
isn't important again but then then we

593
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,029
just incorporate our population

594
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:18,570
structure as a fixed effect and then we

595
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:20,369
have the sum of our different sub genome

596
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:22,829
of okay so now I can pull out this this

597
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:24,959
M and make a covariance from that so and

598
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:26,819
so forth and while having removed

599
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,450
population structure from all three of

600
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:32,460
them at the same time okay

601
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:34,740
when we do that okay so what I've done

602
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:38,579
here is I've plotted in the black lines

603
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:42,359
here showing the correlation of genetic

604
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:45,089
relationships estimated based on the a

605
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:47,219
genome and the D genome or the a genome

606
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:48,599
and the B genome and or the B genome of

607
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,579
the genome and you'll notice that they

608
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:52,319
tend to have a high correlation right

609
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:53,669
and that's because individuals that are

610
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,169
closely related are going to be closely

611
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:57,840
related to each other no matter which

612
00:25:55,170 --> 00:26:00,210
pieces of DNA you choose to calculate

613
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:02,099
that relationship but also because of

614
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,690
population structure and it looks like

615
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:06,149
we have this nice shelf here right so

616
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:09,000
you know roughly around a K of maybe

617
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:11,490
four or five it looks like we kind of

618
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,130
hit this asymptotic relationship where

619
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:15,269
where where the more principal

620
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:18,930
components we pull out of that market

621
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:21,029
matrix we don't get much reduction in

622
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:25,890
the correlation of the relationships

623
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:27,480
across the subject okay we also take a

624
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:29,100
hit in the amount of variance in the

625
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:33,809
entire population or in the entire

626
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:37,919
matrix so we can so what I've done is

627
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:40,259
okay so we know we know that K appears

628
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,519
to be removing right so pulling out this

629
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:44,450
population structure appears to be

630
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:47,700
removing these various opponents but

631
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:49,259
through as as I increase K to I see big

632
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,630
you know changes and you'll notice for

633
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:54,720
the a B and the D genomes no matter what

634
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:58,050
the size of K for these four traits the

635
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:01,049
the additive values don't differ very

636
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:02,759
much but their interaction components do

637
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:03,839
have rank changes especially for these

638
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:07,169
different

639
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:09,178
four traits that are not very old

640
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:13,080
so it's really unclear whether or not

641
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:14,610
we're pulling population structure out

642
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:17,970
or also genetic signal right because

643
00:27:14,609 --> 00:27:20,668
they're related to each other what I did

644
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:23,669
was I used the variance of the variance

645
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:25,799
estimates to decide whether or not we

646
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:27,179
should be doing this and in general

647
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:29,879
there is not much change in this

648
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:31,470
covariance okay so the variance

649
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,330
components related to the interactions

650
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:35,548
and have a high correlation regardless

651
00:27:33,329 --> 00:27:39,349
of how much population structure you a

652
00:27:35,548 --> 00:27:45,929
lot of this thing so in general this was

653
00:27:39,349 --> 00:27:47,849
probably not there probably isn't a

654
00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:49,169
whole lot of benefit to this or if there

655
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:51,149
is it's really unclear at least in this

656
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:53,490
population may be very important for

657
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:57,298
certain populations that have very

658
00:27:53,490 --> 00:28:00,210
strict sets of population structure like

659
00:27:57,298 --> 00:28:02,548
in rice for example but of course that's

660
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:04,048
a diploid okay so we estimated the

661
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:06,710
additive effects relatively well it's

662
00:28:04,048 --> 00:28:09,089
not certain if we get good interactions

663
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:10,650
we don't lose prediction accuracy so

664
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:12,569
there's no reason not to do this from a

665
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:14,340
predictive perspective but it's unclear

666
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:17,009
how you would then make selections on

667
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:19,079
each individual right we can we can do

668
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:20,250
complimentary sub genome selection we

669
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:21,750
select individuals that particularly

670
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:24,538
good versus individuals have

671
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:27,929
particularly good B's we can select

672
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:29,490
certain sub genomes and what's great

673
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:31,110
about this method is we don't need to

674
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:34,109
know much about where the marker lives

675
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:37,889
only what genome it came from which is

676
00:28:34,109 --> 00:28:41,069
important in crops like wheat where for

677
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:43,049
a long time we knew where markers

678
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:45,808
belonged from a perspective of what

679
00:28:43,048 --> 00:28:47,879
chromosome they are they were on but had

680
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:50,399
no idea what the what their relative

681
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,690
position next one another was because

682
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:56,070
each of the chromosome arms was

683
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:57,870
assembled independently yes and this is

684
00:28:56,069 --> 00:29:00,418
true for a lot of polyploid sequence

685
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:02,609
assembly is very difficult because you

686
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:03,570
have the right because it's replicated

687
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:04,769
it's like you're trying to sequence

688
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:06,720
three different things at the same time

689
00:29:04,769 --> 00:29:11,869
so it's hard to assign from those way

690
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:14,210
okay so this paper

691
00:29:11,869 --> 00:29:16,668
preparation is really close I'm hoping

692
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:18,829
we're gonna get this one out soon but I

693
00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:22,640
want to talk about explicitly modeling

694
00:29:18,829 --> 00:29:24,769
homie ologists relationships we can

695
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:29,150
consider a 2 locus model right where we

696
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:30,859
have a locus B say on one genome and a

697
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,990
locus see on another genome with

698
00:29:30,859 --> 00:29:36,408
additive effects alpha B alpha C and

699
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:37,788
their interaction ok and so there's

700
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:39,169
different ways to think about how

701
00:29:37,788 --> 00:29:40,849
epistasis works there's a classic

702
00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:43,220
additive by additive I'm not gonna go

703
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:45,769
into this too much this is this is what

704
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:48,250
you get from multiplying marker scores

705
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:50,509
and anyone who's done this is probably

706
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:52,960
seeing this relationship your

707
00:29:50,509 --> 00:29:54,679
contrasting you know the two homozygotes

708
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,778
little weird thing to say because

709
00:29:54,679 --> 00:30:01,809
remember they're all as I guess from the

710
00:29:58,778 --> 00:30:03,980
heterozygotes across the genomes right

711
00:30:01,808 --> 00:30:06,500
you can look at the duplicate factor

712
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:10,220
model where essentially having a B or a

713
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:11,359
C gives you the effect and having both

714
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,490
of them does not give you any further

715
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:15,349
effect right so if this coefficient was

716
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:17,390
2 it would be completely additive but

717
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:19,879
it's it's it's only that it's the same

718
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:20,990
as having one or the other and I'm going

719
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,110
to introduce this idea of sub

720
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:26,808
functionalisation epistasis and this is

721
00:30:24,109 --> 00:30:29,418
actually a pretty so this model is

722
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:31,730
flexible it allows both everything from

723
00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:34,159
a duplicate factor all the way to an

724
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:36,829
additive and then beyond and so I'm

725
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:39,740
gonna go into this I'm going to give you

726
00:30:36,829 --> 00:30:43,908
an example of this so you have some

727
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:46,880
ancestor allele a and it it is allowed

728
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:48,080
to change into the two descendant

729
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,059
species and when that's brought back

730
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,579
together in the allo polyploid you

731
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:53,869
essentially get the sum of those two

732
00:30:51,579 --> 00:30:55,879
effects times some divergence

733
00:30:53,869 --> 00:30:58,668
coefficient right where you can see that

734
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,830
if d equals one this is completely

735
00:30:58,669 --> 00:31:02,480
additive if d equals half it's

736
00:31:00,829 --> 00:31:04,189
completely redundant and if it's

737
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,819
somewhere in between a half and one it

738
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:09,169
there's there's some partial redundancy

739
00:31:06,819 --> 00:31:12,200
okay and when I say partial redundancy I

740
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:14,750
mean I mean these genes still to some

741
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,850
extent perform similar functions such a

742
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:20,148
having one or the other doesn't result

743
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:21,619
in a total loss of function but but you

744
00:31:20,148 --> 00:31:24,199
need both of them to have complete

745
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:27,349
functionality in

746
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:31,370
in the organism okay so this is your

747
00:31:27,349 --> 00:31:34,158
classic epistasis plot where you have

748
00:31:31,369 --> 00:31:35,569
you know a change from C to Big C you

749
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,500
know little C the Big C change from

750
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:38,950
little bita Big B

751
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:41,388
I'm gonna explain this using an example

752
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:44,569
so we had a by parental population that

753
00:31:41,388 --> 00:31:47,329
was that where the two parents each had

754
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:49,398
a single dwarfing gene you know the

755
00:31:47,329 --> 00:31:51,428
dwarf in genes from that were very

756
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:53,178
famous from the Green Revolution

757
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:54,559
essentially if you have one of these

758
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:56,929
dwarfing genes you're what you are

759
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:59,720
what's called a semi dwarf that brings

760
00:31:56,929 --> 00:32:01,100
the height of the plant down such that

761
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,919
when you put a bunch of fertilizer on it

762
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:05,689
it doesn't all over which is called

763
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,480
lodging and when obviously the plants

764
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:13,038
all over and they lodge we are you know

765
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:15,378
all total grain loss so making these

766
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:17,388
guys short is good but you don't want to

767
00:32:15,378 --> 00:32:19,128
make them too short okay

768
00:32:17,388 --> 00:32:22,069
so what's interesting is this population

769
00:32:19,128 --> 00:32:23,569
had one parent had a dwarfing gene on

770
00:32:22,069 --> 00:32:27,189
the B genome the other one had a

771
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:30,678
dwarfing gene on the DG no this RHD one

772
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:32,570
okay now because we made this cross

773
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:34,820
there are double dwarfs in this

774
00:32:32,569 --> 00:32:36,950
population so they have two mutant genes

775
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:39,168
that are completely different and

776
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:41,600
sensitive and they are tiny

777
00:32:39,169 --> 00:32:42,799
they're super short and here we've

778
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:44,028
tagged them with markers that were

779
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:45,408
relatively close you notice it's not

780
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:46,730
perfect

781
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:49,070
but when we look at the mean of the

782
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:50,628
population of the double dwarf and then

783
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:53,089
we can look at the effect of adding a

784
00:32:50,628 --> 00:32:55,038
wild type D allele there's a linear

785
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:57,678
response similarly there's a linear

786
00:32:55,038 --> 00:33:00,169
response when we add a wild type B

787
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,788
allele to the double dwarf and now based

788
00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:05,750
on additive 'ti you would expect the

789
00:33:01,788 --> 00:33:08,119
mean of the the double roughly here but

790
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,409
when we observe this it is significantly

791
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:12,888
lower than you might expect

792
00:33:09,409 --> 00:33:13,940
okay so there's this deviation from the

793
00:33:12,888 --> 00:33:17,089
additive model right

794
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:20,450
classic episode change the slope okay

795
00:33:17,089 --> 00:33:21,980
and so this this value Delta is how what

796
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:24,500
you know we can estimate this directly

797
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:28,399
and we can calculate this divergence

798
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:29,690
coefficient D okay and then essentially

799
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:31,398
you know this is this great example of

800
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:33,200
one plus one does not equal two there is

801
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:35,289
some functional redundancy between these

802
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,400
two genes now this

803
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:38,079
different from their being pure

804
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,000
redundancy in which case you would see

805
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:43,119
this right where this Delta is is

806
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,890
exactly you know where this this slip is

807
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:49,779
now flat so one or the other gives you

808
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:51,700
the you know the wild type and this is

809
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:55,539
obviously different from seeing an

810
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:57,220
increase in response okay so that's one

811
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:59,829
gene but I wanted to know do I see this

812
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:04,269
pattern across the genome okay

813
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:06,549
and so using the the international wheat

814
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:11,860
genome sequencing consortium refseq one

815
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:14,679
I was that with roughly 1100 coding

816
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:17,370
sequences I was able to basically

817
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:21,700
establish homeo allelic gene sets

818
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:23,769
roughly 18,000 triplicates 5000 doubles

819
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:26,289
so triplets means one on a when I'm b1

820
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:28,059
on D the expected places and then the

821
00:34:26,289 --> 00:34:31,418
duplicates is one on a and one on B but

822
00:34:28,059 --> 00:34:33,668
you're missing one on safety right so we

823
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:36,819
end up with about 23,000 homie ologist

824
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:40,210
sets and then I tagged those sets with

825
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:42,220
GPS markers so now I can track them okay

826
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:46,869
and I ended up with a total of about

827
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:48,969
10,000 markers now when we look at so

828
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:50,380
what what can we do we can take these we

829
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:51,730
can take these molecular markers and we

830
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:54,190
can do G walks right which is our

831
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:56,230
favorite thing to do here and what I've

832
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:57,909
done is I've plotted the the 21

833
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:00,579
chromosomes of wheat around the circle

834
00:34:57,909 --> 00:35:02,409
and then I'm indicated these are like

835
00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:04,299
Manhattan plots here so these are the

836
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:06,009
negative log 10 of the p-values and

837
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:08,410
you'll see we don't have a bunch of huge

838
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:11,170
hits there's a couple plant height we

839
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:13,750
have the dwarfing gene on 4d heading

840
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:15,490
date we have PPD 1 on 2d for example but

841
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:17,739
there's not a whole lot of large Becky

842
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:19,359
TL however you notice from earlier we

843
00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:22,149
had a high prediction accuracy with BC

844
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,800
so there is genetic signal in there it's

845
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:25,300
just going to be that just indicates

846
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,650
that where there's many genes we're

847
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:30,370
looking at that are involved in this

848
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:33,039
similarly we don't find a whole lot of

849
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:35,679
quote-unquote significant homie ologist

850
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:38,139
HEPA static interactions and these are

851
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:39,969
indicated by these hoops here so you

852
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:44,769
know a couple on three couple on four up

853
00:35:39,969 --> 00:35:46,519
on five couple on seven relatively few

854
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:50,440
however

855
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:54,139
um we can look at the global trend of

856
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:56,960
these individuals or of these low sigh

857
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:58,670
okay so so and then and then we can see

858
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,000
do they increase prediction actually I'm

859
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:05,470
gonna get to that in a couple of slides

860
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:08,449
what I've done here is I've plotted oh

861
00:36:05,469 --> 00:36:10,429
my gosh I'm running low on time so what

862
00:36:08,449 --> 00:36:12,559
I've done is I've plotted the home of

863
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:15,619
like one homolog say the a genome home

864
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:19,880
you log effect against the other homeo

865
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:21,349
log which is the like say the B okay and

866
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,210
then and then in color I've indicated

867
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:24,949
the direction of the interaction of

868
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:30,050
their inner their pairwise interaction

869
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:32,299
and their magnitude is is shown with the

870
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:34,340
size of the of the point here and you'll

871
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:36,920
notice that we see this drastic negative

872
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:39,380
trend between the additive effects and

873
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:42,829
their interaction right so if you have a

874
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:44,809
positive if if both of your both of your

875
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:46,509
alleles are positive your interaction

876
00:36:44,809 --> 00:36:50,059
tends to be negative and vice versa

877
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:51,470
okay and so I was like yeah this is

878
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:52,670
totally showing me exactly what I

879
00:36:51,469 --> 00:36:54,559
thought this is this is sub

880
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:56,720
functionalization right but this has to

881
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:58,159
do with how we coded this so what we

882
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:00,049
were doing is we were contrasting

883
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:03,039
genotypes you're trying to assign who

884
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:05,900
has you know what is the functional copy

885
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:09,469
and and this is using you know zero one

886
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:12,250
marker coding and what happens is if so

887
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:16,339
so to check to make sure I'm not crazy I

888
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:18,440
simulated a data set using the exact

889
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,550
same parameters from the original four

890
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,980
data sets using the exact same

891
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:25,039
parameters from the original population

892
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:27,139
only here I intentionally did not allow

893
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:29,559
them to have interactions okay but I

894
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:32,960
didn't touch the LD in the population

895
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:34,699
and you can see we still observe this

896
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,500
this trend and so I was like ah man

897
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:38,210
bummer this is the and this is the

898
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,510
problem is this is a multicollinearity

899
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:43,869
problem right so the predictors are

900
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,870
correlated to each other

901
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:48,480
but we can ask are they greater than

902
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:50,730
expected by chance and so what I did was

903
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,690
I plotted those epistatic or interaction

904
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:57,030
effects from the the true data and this

905
00:37:54,690 --> 00:38:00,480
you know the additive only simulated

906
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:02,730
data and if if there's no effect we

907
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:07,079
should not see any deviation from this

908
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:09,780
this diagonal line and I multiplied them

909
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:12,180
by the inner by they're additive effect

910
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:14,640
sign so that if they have a negative

911
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:15,750
relationship they should have a low tail

912
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,338
here and if they have a positive

913
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:19,260
relationship they should have a tail

914
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:21,900
here and you'll notice for heading date

915
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,849
we see this this push down that's

916
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,530
indicating that these are more negative

917
00:38:23,849 --> 00:38:28,530
than expected by chance unless I see

918
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:30,089
some for plant heights down here but you

919
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:33,630
know we see it reflected not a lot for

920
00:38:30,088 --> 00:38:36,989
grain yield and it's unclear for test

921
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:40,410
weight it doesn't look like a whole lot

922
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:43,889
of signal interestingly if I remove the

923
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:46,129
LD pattern in the population then I see

924
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:48,539
this this effect is to some extent

925
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:50,568
emphasized again I'll come back to that

926
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:55,019
in a minute

927
00:38:50,568 --> 00:39:00,358
we also ah I'm gonna skip over this okay

928
00:38:55,019 --> 00:39:02,250
so so we looked at okay so so not a lot

929
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:05,400
of large effect interactions but do they

930
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:07,739
increase prediction accuracy we see that

931
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,869
modeling all pairwise gives us this bump

932
00:39:07,739 --> 00:39:12,259
from the ads right additive model all

933
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:15,000
pairwise interactions and the homie alla

934
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:21,000
ggest attak interactions explain between

935
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:22,500
you know 60 to 75 percent of of that

936
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:29,338
increase now this is a very small

937
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:31,798
increase so for sanity's sake we also

938
00:39:29,338 --> 00:39:34,460
sampled pairs random pairs within and

939
00:39:31,798 --> 00:39:34,460
across the genome

940
00:39:34,659 --> 00:39:37,509
of markers and then we looked at their

941
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:38,740
prediction accuracy and you'll see that

942
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:40,750
we actually got higher prediction

943
00:39:38,739 --> 00:39:43,419
accuracy with these random pairs across

944
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:45,759
which might be like oh man did we did we

945
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:48,159
you know did we miss something why would

946
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:51,130
we expect random pairs within a genome

947
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:52,808
or across the sub genomes to have higher

948
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:55,630
prediction accuracies than the

949
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:58,059
homologous I if anything I would expect

950
00:39:55,630 --> 00:40:02,380
them to be about the same and the reason

951
00:39:58,059 --> 00:40:04,930
I think is we see an a much higher rate

952
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:07,680
of linkage disequilibrium so here I'm

953
00:40:04,929 --> 00:40:09,669
plotting the leakage disequilibrium

954
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:13,118
parameter D Prime so it's been

955
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:15,430
standardized and so the the solid line

956
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,140
here is the homologous set and then the

957
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:18,368
dotted lines are our two random sets and

958
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:23,469
you notice that there's an enrichment

959
00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:25,660
for fixation at homeo allelic sites so

960
00:40:23,469 --> 00:40:28,808
certain pairs of homeo alleles are being

961
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:30,639
fixed okay and this is this you so an

962
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:32,789
example of this would be the dorsum

963
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:35,348
genes just to bring it back

964
00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:37,089
most modern wheat varieties have a

965
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:40,000
single dwarfing gene because they get

966
00:40:37,088 --> 00:40:42,730
the reduced stature that helps them

967
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,230
resist lodging but if you have both

968
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:45,519
dwarfing genes you're too short and

969
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:47,920
you're not you're not economically

970
00:40:45,518 --> 00:40:50,139
harvestable so so what we've done is we

971
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,960
fixed pairs right we fixed pairs where

972
00:40:50,139 --> 00:40:54,518
you have a wild-type and a mutant and a

973
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,170
mutant and a wild-type and you never

974
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:59,798
have a double mutant or and it's rare to

975
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:01,480
have double wild okay so this this may

976
00:40:59,798 --> 00:41:03,759
be this may explain why we're seeing

977
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,469
lower prediction errors

978
00:41:03,759 --> 00:41:07,539
additionally physical position is not

979
00:41:05,469 --> 00:41:10,268
necessarily a good indicator of LD right

980
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:12,130
you know it's both position and the time

981
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:14,919
of those of those mutations that

982
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:17,318
indicate lb and I'm not going to go into

983
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,970
this into too much detail but there's

984
00:41:17,318 --> 00:41:22,808
also some difficulty in picking specific

985
00:41:18,969 --> 00:41:26,798
sets of markers to call homie oolagah

986
00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:28,690
right given that given that we don't

987
00:41:26,798 --> 00:41:30,730
know we're just using physical position

988
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:32,740
to assign these as opposed to say

989
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:35,409
linkage disequilibrium now that would be

990
00:41:32,739 --> 00:41:37,629
really difficult to do because it's not

991
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:38,889
just it's not just LD between the marker

992
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:40,690
and the functional polymorphism but also

993
00:41:38,889 --> 00:41:43,088
LD between marker the functional

994
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:46,690
polymorphism on the other arm and their

995
00:41:43,088 --> 00:41:48,579
interaction right so this it's not a

996
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:50,200
problem for simple gos right

997
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:51,699
tagging these and it's not a problem for

998
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:53,469
all pairwise interactions because you

999
00:41:51,699 --> 00:41:56,559
test everything but here we're only

1000
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:59,859
testing a very small subset of that okay

1001
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:01,840
so really so we do see these

1002
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:04,300
interactions tend to be less than

1003
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:08,019
additive for some traits that appears

1004
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:11,650
pretty clear homie allylic pairs pairs

1005
00:42:08,019 --> 00:42:14,469
explain some of this increase in genetic

1006
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:16,990
predictability but not more so than

1007
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:20,409
random pairs and this may be due to LD

1008
00:42:16,989 --> 00:42:23,459
or lo pairing so we need a better way to

1009
00:42:20,409 --> 00:42:26,529
pair markers and in my last five minutes

1010
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:28,360
okay and so this this this paper is

1011
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:29,560
essentially written it needs to be

1012
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:32,230
tightened up a little bit and we're

1013
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:33,429
waiting for wheat genome consortium to

1014
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:35,349
publish their paper so that we can

1015
00:42:33,429 --> 00:42:38,190
publish and they've had the genome

1016
00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:40,839
available for quite some time now and

1017
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:42,400
they won't let anyone publish on it

1018
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:45,130
until they publish so anyway we're

1019
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:48,910
waiting for that in the last few minutes

1020
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:50,890
I'm gonna go into a strategy I use so I

1021
00:42:48,909 --> 00:42:52,929
had a problem tag right so there's this

1022
00:42:50,889 --> 00:42:56,230
question of am I having a hard time

1023
00:42:52,929 --> 00:42:57,669
tagging specific homeo alleles with

1024
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:59,740
specific markers right they may not be

1025
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:02,740
in high LD well what if we use more than

1026
00:42:59,739 --> 00:43:04,389
one pair right so with with with I

1027
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:05,739
talked about the pairwise epistasis the

1028
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:08,679
problem with this is a multiple test

1029
00:43:05,739 --> 00:43:10,659
problem you have 11,000 markers or so

1030
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:12,549
you end up with you know 67 million

1031
00:43:10,659 --> 00:43:16,589
tests and a bonferroni correction is

1032
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:19,390
really hard to see especially for

1033
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:21,670
interactions which tend to only have

1034
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:23,319
maximized variability at allele

1035
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:25,990
frequencies of point 5 right so as those

1036
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,880
a little frequencies go to 0 you reduce

1037
00:43:25,989 --> 00:43:30,039
the effect of the ability to see the

1038
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:34,210
interaction and that variance gets

1039
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:35,889
partitioned to additive variance but

1040
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:38,230
what if we just looked at chromosome

1041
00:43:35,889 --> 00:43:40,299
arms what if we took individual

1042
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:42,730
chromosome arms and looked at contrast

1043
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:44,370
it to see if those arms were were

1044
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:47,440
interacting with one another

1045
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:48,909
this would drastically reduce the you

1046
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:53,650
know now I'm only looking at 42

1047
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:55,389
different chromosome arms we 861 total

1048
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:59,740
test so the bonferroni correction is way

1049
00:43:55,389 --> 00:44:01,299
less okay so

1050
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:03,129
you know again essentially what I did

1051
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,630
was I took our model and it pulled out a

1052
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:06,550
couple of chromosome arms and model

1053
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:09,070
their interaction and then we do a

1054
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:11,200
series of likelihood ratio tests to

1055
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:13,090
determine if the additive effects or the

1056
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:18,579
interaction or and the interaction is

1057
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:21,220
significant and then mmm essentially we

1058
00:44:18,579 --> 00:44:23,710
can plot the p-values and here in light

1059
00:44:21,219 --> 00:44:25,779
gray is the additive p-value so is the

1060
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:26,980
additive effect significant and in dark

1061
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:29,019
gray is the interaction effect

1062
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:31,480
significant you'll notice that that

1063
00:44:29,019 --> 00:44:33,550
essentially so so you know these are

1064
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,110
these would be considered significant

1065
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:37,810
over here these are not these are

1066
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:39,700
essentially a p-value of one and so

1067
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:42,190
you'll notice for these four traits most

1068
00:44:39,699 --> 00:44:44,529
of the at most of the chromosome arms

1069
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:45,940
have an additive effect a significant

1070
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:47,769
additive effect which makes sense that's

1071
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:50,429
what we expect we expect large pieces of

1072
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:52,300
chromatin to have effects on a phenotype

1073
00:44:50,429 --> 00:44:53,529
but you'll notice most of the

1074
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,730
interactions are not which is good

1075
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:55,990
because we don't expect all of these

1076
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:58,809
things to be interacting with each other

1077
00:44:55,989 --> 00:45:00,159
necessarily and then of course when

1078
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:02,130
these various parameters were estimated

1079
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:04,480
on boundary you have a problem with

1080
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:06,010
essentially but they end up being zero

1081
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,320
so that's where you get this really this

1082
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:09,550
big lump of key values instead of the

1083
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:14,350
uniform the expected uniform

1084
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:16,450
distribution okay and then I just want

1085
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:18,670
to show so these are the results from a

1086
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:20,439
bond for running correction what's

1087
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:23,110
interesting is we see some sites where

1088
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:27,760
it looks like we have you know four d

1089
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:29,920
six a seven D big regulator or you know

1090
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,920
some site that appears to be interacting

1091
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,420
with many loci which is maybe suggestive

1092
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:39,099
of some kind of gene regulator if we

1093
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:40,119
relax this cut off a little bit and just

1094
00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:42,009
look at interactions that were

1095
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:43,779
significant at say point zero zero one

1096
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:45,280
just just to look at a pattern I'm not

1097
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:48,340
saying that these are causing I'm just

1098
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,860
curious we see that we see that this

1099
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:53,530
this appears you know we see these these

1100
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:56,620
sites where just a bunch of interactions

1101
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:58,060
with a single locus or single chromosome

1102
00:45:56,619 --> 00:45:59,619
here's another one for heading day right

1103
00:45:58,059 --> 00:46:01,509
it's it looks like it's affecting a

1104
00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:03,369
bunch of different things and so we see

1105
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:10,150
some of these hotspots you know on seven

1106
00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:12,759
seven D seven seven be here and for V or

1107
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:16,000
excuse me for Dean

1108
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:18,069
recently there was paper by young that

1109
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,730
came out last year and they also saw

1110
00:46:18,068 --> 00:46:23,739
this enrichment at 7b and 7d so you know

1111
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:25,650
or these are this is essentially the

1112
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:29,379
same thought that there's this rotated

1113
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:31,240
but they saw that these two chromosomes

1114
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:32,829
appeared to have a lot of you know

1115
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:34,479
appear to be influencing a lot of

1116
00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:37,089
regions they also saw an area on 4a

1117
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:41,588
which we didn't see but we saw the 4d

1118
00:46:37,088 --> 00:46:43,539
seem to be important just looking at the

1119
00:46:41,588 --> 00:46:45,250
homologous chromosome arms we don't see

1120
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:47,230
a whole lot of evidence for this this is

1121
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:48,250
a bonferroni correction we only were to

1122
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:50,260
consider all the ones they're

1123
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:51,969
significant it's 8.05 or their

1124
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:53,380
interactions we see this now you're

1125
00:46:51,969 --> 00:46:55,959
probably wondering what the colors are

1126
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:57,550
the colors are due to are basically

1127
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,010
colored the relationship between the

1128
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:01,300
additive and the epistatic effect so if

1129
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:02,740
they're blue there's a positive

1130
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,510
relationship between the additive and

1131
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:05,919
the epistatic effect and if they're red

1132
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:07,210
there's a negative relationship and if

1133
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:12,099
they're black there's you know or gray

1134
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:16,150
there's no based on just a correlation

1135
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:18,010
coefficient and what's one of them one

1136
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:21,670
of the things i like to point out in my

1137
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:24,400
last minute is that for the for BL and

1138
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:28,480
for dl here has a had a really strong

1139
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:30,579
negative and when we when we plotted

1140
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,869
this you can see there's this drastic

1141
00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:34,568
negative relationship between the

1142
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:36,190
additive effects early interaction so

1143
00:47:34,568 --> 00:47:37,239
this might indicate this might be

1144
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:40,780
another indicator or some

1145
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:42,818
functionalisation however when we looked

1146
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:44,619
at this for a different trait right so

1147
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:48,219
this was for plant this is for plant

1148
00:47:44,619 --> 00:47:52,210
height this is for testing there was we

1149
00:47:48,219 --> 00:47:54,250
did not see the same pattern and when we

1150
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:56,230
looked at our spot where we assumed we

1151
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:58,599
might see the interaction of the two

1152
00:47:56,230 --> 00:48:00,369
dwarfing genes we don't have a whole lot

1153
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:03,190
of them from the bee genome in our

1154
00:48:00,369 --> 00:48:08,440
population but we don't really see much

1155
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:10,210
of a pattern here although there is okay

1156
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:14,230
so we see a lot of these interactions

1157
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:15,670
granule handsome few potentially it

1158
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:17,679
looks like we see some regions there

1159
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:18,909
have large ret you know large regulatory

1160
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:21,429
regions you can be interacting with many

1161
00:48:18,909 --> 00:48:23,679
different low huh and we see strong

1162
00:48:21,429 --> 00:48:25,569
relationships between some of these

1163
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:27,699
homologous arm pairs in

1164
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:30,220
hating that we may have some of these

1165
00:48:27,699 --> 00:48:32,069
homie Ollie you know that there may be

1166
00:48:30,219 --> 00:48:34,539
relationships between these homeo Leo's

1167
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:36,700
additionally I think that I think that a

1168
00:48:34,539 --> 00:48:38,849
lot of this stuff probably is really

1169
00:48:36,699 --> 00:48:41,109
suggestive and probably needs a lot more

1170
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:45,579
fine-tuning I think a lot more research

1171
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:47,019
can be done I imagine I imagine that

1172
00:48:45,579 --> 00:48:48,429
there are some other populations that

1173
00:48:47,019 --> 00:48:50,110
you could look at this and as opposed to

1174
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:51,849
a breeding population where you fix a

1175
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:54,130
lot of these interactions you could look

1176
00:48:51,849 --> 00:48:56,699
at a synthetic wheat population which

1177
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:58,869
would maximize these these interactions

1178
00:48:56,699 --> 00:49:00,909
and so I think that there is much more

1179
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:03,699
research needed into into how these

1180
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:06,969
three genomes are talking to each other

1181
00:49:03,699 --> 00:49:09,730
to produce a phenotype and so at my pag

1182
00:49:06,969 --> 00:49:13,139
talk was in translational genomics and

1183
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:16,329
it was I gave some of this information

1184
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:19,089
and I had to figure out how what the

1185
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:22,119
translation was okay so my translation

1186
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:23,620
is uh I will probably plays or not over

1187
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:25,869
the last hundred years we have been

1188
00:49:23,619 --> 00:49:28,779
treating owl polyploid props as diploid

1189
00:49:25,869 --> 00:49:30,940
because they undergo disomic inheritance

1190
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:33,130
right so you can treat them as diploid

1191
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:36,659
because the chromosomes pair up and

1192
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:39,970
segregate you know in a behaved manner

1193
00:49:36,659 --> 00:49:42,699
but we now have the molecular tools to

1194
00:49:39,969 --> 00:49:45,939
start to look at these things as the

1195
00:49:42,699 --> 00:49:50,169
immortal hybrids that they are and with

1196
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:52,450
that I'd like to acknowledge my

1197
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:56,050
committee members mark Searles

1198
00:49:52,449 --> 00:50:00,639
John Luke Yannick here mark couldn't be

1199
00:49:56,050 --> 00:50:04,210
here today he is at a he's at CIMMYT and

1200
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:06,699
Jason easy some great folks in the yonex

1201
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:09,369
Rose lab I worked closely with Lisa

1202
00:50:06,699 --> 00:50:11,649
kissing Cusack and Lynn bean straw on

1203
00:50:09,369 --> 00:50:15,900
some G by E stuff I've also gotten some

1204
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:18,000
really good input from tars you

1205
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:20,099
and you che and Martin and Roberto

1206
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,989
Roberto I will point out was the first

1207
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:23,940
person that said hey you know you could

1208
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:26,459
go in and like look at those coding

1209
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:29,369
sequences and then see if she could find

1210
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:31,980
pairs and I was like oh yeah good idea

1211
00:50:29,369 --> 00:50:34,048
and then of course without the help of

1212
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:36,510
the folks at the small grains David

1213
00:50:34,048 --> 00:50:39,599
venture Amy Fox and Justin Chavez and

1214
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:41,099
James we're all here I couldn't have had

1215
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:44,579
this data to ask these questions with

1216
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:48,329
and so I very much appreciate their work

1217
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:51,539
into this as well as the relationships

1218
00:50:48,329 --> 00:50:52,230
we developed over time yeah and thank

1219
00:50:51,539 --> 00:50:56,278
you guys very much

1220
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:58,380
one last one I'm writing I'm keeping you

1221
00:50:56,278 --> 00:51:01,318
guys late I really like to thank my

1222
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:03,088
family they've given me a lot of support

1223
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:05,759
and I couldn't have finished this

1224
00:51:03,088 --> 00:51:07,699
without them and I would like to thank

1225
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:11,309
particularly my father who is here today

1226
00:51:07,699 --> 00:51:32,009
and my girlfriend Amy who also joined us

1227
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:34,260
today and thank you all Skyler ization

1228
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:36,359
of the environment

1229
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:40,500
thank you sort of a minus one to plus

1230
00:51:36,358 --> 00:51:43,588
two I said presented do you think that

1231
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:48,210
as a as an asymmetry and that measures

1232
00:51:43,588 --> 00:51:51,269
that yeah that's a good question

1233
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:56,099
so I centered all of this data so

1234
00:51:51,269 --> 00:51:57,449
theoretically so but what I did was I no

1235
00:51:56,099 --> 00:52:00,450
no no I can I can explain this

1236
00:51:57,449 --> 00:52:02,308
so what I didn't want to do was Center

1237
00:52:00,449 --> 00:52:03,838
the data so this is all standardized

1238
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:06,269
data right you subtract mean and divide

1239
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:08,239
by the standard deviation now I could

1240
00:52:06,269 --> 00:52:10,528
have centered within each environment

1241
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:13,169
but I didn't want to do that because

1242
00:52:10,528 --> 00:52:16,079
then you are assuming that every

1243
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:19,079
environment has the same bearings both

1244
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:20,970
error and genetic variance okay so what

1245
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:23,880
I did instead was I centered on

1246
00:52:20,969 --> 00:52:26,848
everything at the same time and so then

1247
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:28,920
if if the environment size is for

1248
00:52:26,849 --> 00:52:29,410
example like right there might remember

1249
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,970
which three

1250
00:52:29,409 --> 00:52:32,139
it was in was there it was a heavier on

1251
00:52:30,969 --> 00:52:35,230
the negative side or heavier on the

1252
00:52:32,139 --> 00:52:37,750
positive well I thought I'd seen there

1253
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:41,079
was debris on the houses so that could

1254
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:43,480
be from if there were larger trials that

1255
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:46,299
tended to be better trials those ones

1256
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:47,889
would push that whole that whole thing

1257
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:50,560
right because you're taking a meat

1258
00:52:47,889 --> 00:52:52,269
so as you summarize that thing you're

1259
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,610
you're you're you're taking a single

1260
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:55,929
point for something that had maybe 400

1261
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:58,960
genotypes in it that was a particularly

1262
00:52:55,929 --> 00:53:00,789
good environment and then another single

1263
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,110
point that maybe only had 200 genotypes

1264
00:53:00,789 --> 00:53:03,759
that was particularly bad right so that

1265
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:06,760
that's going to shift that that mean

1266
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,680
point of the environmental I mean

1267
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,990
roughly they should be close to centered

1268
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:13,929
around zero but they weren't because I

1269
00:53:10,989 --> 00:53:15,879
think because I Center the data as in as

1270
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:17,169
a whole as opposed to within environment

1271
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:51,190
how to done it with an environment they

1272
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:55,090
should evolve then smack down a zero the

1273
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:58,300
opportunity cost duplication is a much

1274
00:53:55,090 --> 00:54:03,450
more conservative process than full

1275
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:07,140
genome colonization and yeah if the

1276
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:09,189
hypothesis is true which is that every

1277
00:54:07,139 --> 00:54:11,049
basically every interest burden is

1278
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:19,570
undergone at least one mile maybe two or

1279
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:23,769
three of whole genome we gain and loss

1280
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:29,019
right my question is do you see the kind

1281
00:54:23,769 --> 00:54:34,719
of preferential loss Oh mostly in these

1282
00:54:29,019 --> 00:54:38,199
more you know he's replete polyploid

1283
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:41,879
that we see in the long term perspective

1284
00:54:38,199 --> 00:54:43,088
on all of our nation that they actually

1285
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,608
get

1286
00:54:43,088 --> 00:54:48,099
made up more than half the genes but

1287
00:54:45,608 --> 00:54:50,889
they don't want to bother to maintain

1288
00:54:48,099 --> 00:54:55,509
either because of your Chum

1289
00:54:50,889 --> 00:54:57,298
they are fortunately done or maybe

1290
00:54:55,509 --> 00:55:03,568
there's a cost to the new

1291
00:54:57,298 --> 00:55:06,998
functionalities and you expect to see

1292
00:55:03,568 --> 00:55:10,748
complete loss and how much loss you see

1293
00:55:06,998 --> 00:55:15,459
even death we G right okay so to repeat

1294
00:55:10,748 --> 00:55:17,949
the question essentially the idea is in

1295
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:20,858
diploid species you have genes that get

1296
00:55:17,949 --> 00:55:22,689
duplicated and then and then those are

1297
00:55:20,858 --> 00:55:26,679
oftentimes subsequently lost because

1298
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:27,969
they're unnecessary right right and so

1299
00:55:26,679 --> 00:55:30,518
and during a whole genome duplication

1300
00:55:27,969 --> 00:55:32,798
yeah and that happens and then do we see

1301
00:55:30,518 --> 00:55:35,018
that same thing happen now the answer is

1302
00:55:32,798 --> 00:55:37,329
yes in fact it happens really

1303
00:55:35,018 --> 00:55:40,149
drastically especially very shortly

1304
00:55:37,329 --> 00:55:41,950
after the hybridization event they

1305
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:43,960
usually go through this this weird G I

1306
00:55:41,949 --> 00:55:45,699
mean this genome shock moment where

1307
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,409
they're like oh my god well how am I

1308
00:55:45,699 --> 00:55:49,598
gonna deal with all of this right and so

1309
00:55:47,409 --> 00:55:50,920
oftentimes big big chunks break cuz

1310
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,930
you're gonna have a lot of negative

1311
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:55,450
epistasis too so there's this other

1312
00:55:52,929 --> 00:55:58,778
thing that happens where you can think

1313
00:55:55,449 --> 00:55:59,889
of a gene from this species and a gene

1314
00:55:58,778 --> 00:56:02,858
from that species while they work

1315
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:04,239
completely fine within their own species

1316
00:56:02,858 --> 00:56:05,619
you bring them together and all of a

1317
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:06,728
sudden like think of like a homeo dimer

1318
00:56:05,619 --> 00:56:10,358
for example i think this is a good

1319
00:56:06,728 --> 00:56:11,889
example the homeo dimer is formed from

1320
00:56:10,358 --> 00:56:14,498
the product of protein products within

1321
00:56:11,889 --> 00:56:15,940
the two species are functional but you

1322
00:56:14,498 --> 00:56:17,759
might have a thing where they can still

1323
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:20,229
bind together and form a heterodimer

1324
00:56:17,759 --> 00:56:22,719
across these two really closely related

1325
00:56:20,228 --> 00:56:24,218
genes that may disrupt their function so

1326
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:26,889
I think that when that kind of thing

1327
00:56:24,219 --> 00:56:28,659
happens there is a there is a push to

1328
00:56:26,889 --> 00:56:31,469
get you know to Wow

1329
00:56:28,659 --> 00:56:34,088
I don't know about a push but there is a

1330
00:56:31,469 --> 00:56:35,920
selective advantage to drop a lot of

1331
00:56:34,088 --> 00:56:39,328
these really important and we do see

1332
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:42,460
that in fact so of the you know a

1333
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:44,259
hundred and ten thousand or so genes in

1334
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:46,590
the genome I was only able to get

1335
00:56:44,259 --> 00:56:48,449
triplicates for like

1336
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:51,329
so 110,000 genome you divide that by

1337
00:56:48,449 --> 00:56:54,629
three of roughly looking at a haploid

1338
00:56:51,329 --> 00:56:58,469
number of 33,000 genes okay I was only

1339
00:56:54,630 --> 00:57:01,140
able to get 18 of them that had at least

1340
00:56:58,469 --> 00:57:04,559
three copies or no was it at least two

1341
00:57:01,139 --> 00:57:06,509
copies yeah at least two cop no I have

1342
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:09,239
to go look at it okay yeah so there's

1343
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:10,470
you know a third of the genome has been

1344
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:12,269
lost and there was a bunch of

1345
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:14,549
Singleton's the other thing that happens

1346
00:57:12,269 --> 00:57:17,759
is you get a lot of tandem duplications

1347
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:19,920
and that's 210 duplications are super

1348
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:23,100
interesting because they have a tendency

1349
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:26,059
to be Co inherited whereas duplications

1350
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:33,269
across chromosomes there's no there's no

1351
00:57:26,059 --> 00:58:00,269
linkage that holds them together yeah I

1352
00:57:33,269 --> 00:58:01,889
think most diverse team writes more so

1353
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:03,719
so there's a spot that essentially on

1354
00:58:01,889 --> 00:58:06,269
the old functionalisation goes through a

1355
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:07,709
process of sub functionalisation where

1356
00:58:06,269 --> 00:58:08,670
at first they start off the exact same

1357
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:10,409
function and then you have small

1358
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:11,909
mutations that change them a little bit

1359
00:58:10,409 --> 00:58:13,379
and then eventually they develop such

1360
00:58:11,909 --> 00:58:15,359
different pieces and I think that this

1361
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:17,970
is really evident when you look at genes

1362
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:19,530
genes have these domains right and it's

1363
00:58:17,969 --> 00:58:22,079
interesting that you can stick these

1364
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:24,120
domains together and have this thing

1365
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,309
that you know so you can like it's

1366
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:28,559
almost like mix and match you know what

1367
00:58:26,309 --> 00:58:32,009
do they put this poison yeah they're

1368
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:35,190
like Legos yeah yeah and so yeah I think

1369
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:37,260
it's really important and that I I would

1370
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:42,440
be I would be super curious to try this

1371
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:45,750
in a species that is kind of in-between

1372
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:48,059
that whole genome duplication event and

1373
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:49,829
being an already becoming a diploid and

1374
00:58:48,059 --> 00:58:52,969
seeing if we could find evidence of this

1375
00:58:49,829 --> 00:58:56,069
happening in you know across

1376
00:58:52,969 --> 00:59:00,480
non-homologous site that really

1377
00:58:56,070 --> 00:59:13,110
yeah they lost more let's say do you see

1378
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:14,940
more losses right when you bring I think

1379
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:16,800
you also bring a thing in there's

1380
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:21,480
probably a lot of stuff that's good but

1381
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:24,900
most of it actually so there is I would

1382
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:28,019
assume that much I should tabulate that

1383
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:29,670
I should see how many the ones I saw you

1384
00:59:28,019 --> 00:59:31,590
know where the third copy that I didn't

1385
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:44,880
have was from the DG I wouldn't be

1386
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:48,630
surprised this has been a production of

1387
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:51,320
Cornell University on the web at Cornell

1388
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:51,320
