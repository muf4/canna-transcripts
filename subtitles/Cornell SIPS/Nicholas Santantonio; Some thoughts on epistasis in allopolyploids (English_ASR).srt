1
00:00:00,549 --> 00:00:05,310
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:05,309
University

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,539
okay yeah so I'm here today to talk

4
00:00:11,128 --> 00:00:18,989
about some recent work I've been working

5
00:00:12,538 --> 00:00:22,618
on in epistasis and alle polyploid okay

6
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:25,949
so in your typical hybrid production at

7
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:27,419
some point you have some alleles so yeah

8
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:29,609
some alleles that are floating around in

9
00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:31,289
an open pollinated population and then

10
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,308
at some point either intentionally or

11
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:37,558
unintentionally they get separated from

12
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:40,140
one another and you end up with

13
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:41,339
different heterotic groups and then when

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,740
those heterotic groups are brought back

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,740
together you end up with a hybrid and

16
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,780
you've established a hetero zygosity and

17
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,630
essentially all loci in the genome right

18
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,609
okay so now you've got these allelic

19
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,560
interactions which we think are what is

20
00:00:53,609 --> 00:01:01,500
important is part of what is important

21
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:05,579
for hybrid vigor in these progeny and so

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,950
uh excuse me and so I like to think of a

23
00:01:05,578 --> 00:01:10,589
low polyploid as hybrids and the reason

24
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,749
why is because you start off with a

25
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,569
common ancestor that has some set of

26
00:01:12,748 --> 00:01:18,420
alleles okay and then through through

27
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:20,340
gene mutation and evolution this thing

28
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,769
specie eights into two species a and B

29
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,439
and then that are still more or less

30
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:27,349
related to each other but hybridization

31
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,699
between them becomes relatively rare and

32
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:31,468
wet but when it does happen you bring

33
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,389
both of these genomes together into the

34
00:01:31,468 --> 00:01:35,849
same organism and you have established

35
00:01:33,388 --> 00:01:40,048
essentially hetero zygosity at all the

36
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:42,899
low side okay so based on this of maybe

37
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:45,600
we have some homeo allelic interaction

38
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:48,929
okay and these may be what's important

39
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:51,718
for why we is so while why a lot of our

40
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:58,618
crop species including we are so widely

41
00:01:51,718 --> 00:02:02,278
adapted okay so a brief reminder of

42
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:05,129
epistasis epistasis is the interaction

43
00:02:02,278 --> 00:02:07,888
between two low five and these lows I

44
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:10,228
can have you know I'm showing two low

45
00:02:07,888 --> 00:02:13,318
side B and C here I'm showing for the

46
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,329
inbred case because a lot of alle

47
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:18,179
polyploid are instantly sexually

48
00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:19,530
isolated they usually cannot continue to

49
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,569
out cross

50
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,270
after that hybridization event so they

51
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,769
have to self in order to in order to

52
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,480
continue on but what's cool about that

53
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,950
is they end up fixing all of these

54
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,689
allelic interactions right so you

55
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:33,239
maintain a little of diversity across

56
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:36,959
your sub genomes while preserving your

57
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,969
your genotype by selfing okay and so you

58
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,430
can have two low side B and C perhaps

59
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:44,068
these are homeo allelic right so one is

60
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:47,099
on the a genome one on the B genome and

61
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:48,988
there's various models we could have for

62
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:51,870
how these genes might have an

63
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:54,209
interaction so a will be the effect on

64
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:58,950
the phenotype okay and you have the the

65
00:02:54,209 --> 00:03:01,050
classic multiplicative interaction which

66
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:02,909
you see often you may also have like a

67
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:06,630
duplicate factor interaction which is

68
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:08,009
which is analogous to two genes that

69
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:10,169
have essentially the same function and

70
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:12,539
so if you have a functional copy of one

71
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:14,669
or the other you get the effect in

72
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:17,729
otherwise you don't and similarly we

73
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:20,189
have complementarity which is which is

74
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:21,689
like two genes in a pathway you need to

75
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:23,879
functional alleles in order to get the

76
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:26,969
result but you'll notice that in in

77
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:31,319
breads and this isn't true for hybrids

78
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:33,329
or I'm sorry heterozygous populations

79
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,280
you'll notice that the complementary is

80
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:37,469
essentially just a mathematical inverse

81
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,640
of the duplicate factor okay so I'm not

82
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:41,280
going to talk about the complimentary

83
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,609
anymore but I will revisit the duplicate

84
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,799
factor and so I would like to propose

85
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:50,519
another way to look at this epistatic

86
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,799
problem that is related to sub function

87
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:56,189
ization okay so the idea is there is

88
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,920
some haplotype a in the in the ancestor

89
00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:03,269
okay and then through time and mutation

90
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:05,548
you get a change in this in this allele

91
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:07,109
a or you can allow these alleles to

92
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:09,000
diverge in their function they don't

93
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:10,290
have to but you can allow them to okay

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,840
and then when you bring them back in to

95
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:15,239
the same organism like in an olive

96
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,340
polyploid you essentially give to some

97
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:21,538
of their effects times some divergence

98
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:24,299
from their initial value okay so the

99
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:25,259
idea here is you'll notice that when D

100
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,210
equals one

101
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:30,120
they have diverged such that they have

102
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:32,219
completely new function and so they no

103
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,819
longer perform the same function within

104
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,850
the organ of

105
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:39,089
and when D equals 0.5 and these are

106
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,800
equal they essentially have they have

107
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:43,879
not diverged in their function okay and

108
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:48,090
everything in between and past right so

109
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:49,949
so my my sub functionalization epistatic

110
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:53,879
model actually covers sub

111
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:57,029
functionalisation which is when D is in

112
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:59,399
between zero point or a half and one but

113
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:03,149
we it allows for a completely additive

114
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:04,739
model as well as for something that's

115
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:06,209
like over dominance when D is greater

116
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,519
than one there's something about having

117
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:10,069
the sum you know having two things is

118
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,870
greater than the sum of its parts

119
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:16,709
which you could come up with all kinds

120
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:18,180
of fun biological reasons for and then

121
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:19,019
of course when D equals zero this ends

122
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,160
up being the inverse of the

123
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,569
multiplicative which is kind of

124
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,000
complicated and I'm not going to go into

125
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:28,649
it okay

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,209
so from an ordinary least-squares

127
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:32,819
perspective you can think of this

128
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:34,829
problem as a lineage of effect for the B

129
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:37,860
allele and additive effect for the C

130
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:40,019
allele and then an interaction okay and

131
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,910
what's cool is in in inbreds if they're

132
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:45,329
truly inbred you can code all of the

133
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,890
markers as 0 or 1 okay so you either

134
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:49,680
have the B allele or you don't have the

135
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:52,680
B allele and then the interaction is

136
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,689
just the product of those and so here

137
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,400
I've got like so this I'm showing like

138
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:59,250
marker scores but then you've also got

139
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,589
this is just like a design matrix right

140
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,839
and then this would be the additive

141
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:08,219
effect of a of B C and then the

142
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:10,019
interaction effect as beta and what's

143
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,230
nice about this is because you only have

144
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:15,779
zeros and ones this nasty matrix algebra

145
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:19,740
looking thing here really simplifies

146
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:21,359
into a much more simple equation that is

147
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,240
just a function of allele frequencies

148
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,259
which is super neat and is a nice

149
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,810
property of having zeros and ones and so

150
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,089
once we can get the expected value of

151
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:35,009
y's here we can actually figure out what

152
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:37,229
the answer to this what the expected

153
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:38,250
answer to these betas are and that what

154
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,900
that's going to do is it's going to

155
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,730
allow me figure out what the interaction

156
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:44,250
is or what the relationship is between

157
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:47,910
the estimated additive effects

158
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:49,529
their interaction effect okay so there's

159
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,990
a lab there's some map that goes in

160
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:56,189
there I'm not going to show all that but

161
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:57,660
too far so you'll see that here for the

162
00:06:56,189 --> 00:06:59,519
multiplicative epistatic model

163
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,330
essentially the additive effects will

164
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:06,120
end up being zero and and the

165
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:09,479
interaction is is is nonzero in the

166
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,459
duplicate factor we have the additive

167
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,340
effects being positive or negatively

168
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:17,039
related to the interaction effect and

169
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:19,399
similarly in my sub functionalization or

170
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:23,040
what I'm calling sub functionalisation

171
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:24,449
and when when B is less than one there

172
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,250
will be a negative relationship between

173
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:28,199
the additive effects in the interaction

174
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,699
and when D is greater than one there

175
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,620
will be a positive relationship between

176
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:35,459
the additive effects and the interaction

177
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:37,139
okay unfortunately if you want to test

178
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:39,120
all pairs of epistatic Llosa you run

179
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:41,579
into a put this thing down because I'm

180
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,550
using it too much you run into a

181
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:46,769
multiple testing problem here in even

182
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:50,939
with a modest amount of markers you know

183
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:52,918
like 6000 you have about 17 million

184
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:55,500
tests okay and one of the things I can

185
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:58,649
do is we can use some properties of

186
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:02,490
linear mixed models and epistatic

187
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:04,679
genetic covariances where if you okay so

188
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,240
this this looks disgusting but but but

189
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,209
the most important thing is you have

190
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,329
some genetic effect okay and then you

191
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:14,069
can have the epistatic effect that is

192
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:16,199
simply the Hadamard product of two

193
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:19,949
separate genetic covariance matrices

194
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:21,839
okay and with the zero one coating this

195
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:24,180
all works out very beautifully and it

196
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,649
drops out such that this Hadamard

197
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,269
product is exactly equal to the

198
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:29,699
covariance that you would calculate

199
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:32,009
based on all of these pairwise

200
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:34,259
interactions okay so then you can

201
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:35,580
estimate a genetic effect for their

202
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:38,158
interaction and you can estimate a

203
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,500
genetic effect for the additive portion

204
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:42,479
you can also transform these back into

205
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,639
marker effects but that's really ugly

206
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,089
because you have to make a matrix of

207
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:50,338
this size so I haven't actually done

208
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:54,089
that but so I'm utilizing this property

209
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:56,220
to keep from having a deal with 17

210
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:57,440
million okay and so then I'm just going

211
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,600
to look at what the

212
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,889
what the relative relationship between

213
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,709
the additive effects is in the

214
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:07,730
interaction okay so this is the classic

215
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:10,250
way you think of a phenotype at some

216
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:13,490
function of the genetics and what I'm

217
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:16,549
going to do is is I want to find groups

218
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:19,430
of markers that make sense to test for

219
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:21,109
epistatic interactions okay and but I

220
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:22,909
want a relatively small number of those

221
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,339
that way I don't have seventeen million

222
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:28,490
of them right so what I do is I might

223
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:31,430
pick say two homie ologist chromosome

224
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:33,110
arms right chromosome one a from our one

225
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:35,359
the short arm of chromosome one a and

226
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,310
the short arm of chromosome one B right

227
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,870
and I can pluck those out and so I can

228
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:39,979
model the rest of the genomic effect

229
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,688
account for it

230
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,420
while I look at the additive effect of

231
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:48,009
each chromosome arm as well as their

232
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:50,688
interaction so and then and then I use a

233
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:52,759
series of nested likelihood ratio tests

234
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:54,409
to test whether or not these additive

235
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,209
effects are greater than or have a

236
00:09:54,409 --> 00:09:57,528
nonzero variance and then to test

237
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,388
whether or not the interaction has a

238
00:09:57,528 --> 00:10:01,970
nonzero variance and once I establish

239
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:03,560
that both of those things are true okay

240
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,720
then I can look at the relationship

241
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:09,018
between their additive effects and their

242
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,028
interaction okay and so I did actually

243
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:14,240
test this on real data

244
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:15,438
I have also simulated it but I think the

245
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,310
real data example is much more

246
00:10:15,438 --> 00:10:20,299
interesting and so relatively larger

247
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:21,588
population

248
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:25,039
twelve hundred lines seventy five

249
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:27,550
hundred observations I also have about

250
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:30,110
six thousand markers that have been

251
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:34,758
pretty heavily filtered for missing this

252
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:38,289
and minor allele frequency I impute this

253
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:41,629
and then I set the heterozygous calls to

254
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:44,058
the major allele because I need

255
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:46,429
everything to be zeros and ones right so

256
00:10:44,058 --> 00:10:48,708
I can't have a heterozygous call and so

257
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:50,419
essentially these small two percent of

258
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:53,778
heterozygous calls that I get I just set

259
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:55,878
to the major allele and then importantly

260
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:57,828
because of this epistatic model I'm

261
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:01,278
showing you effectively I've made the

262
00:10:57,828 --> 00:11:04,120
assumption that having that being

263
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:09,259
functional allows you to increase the

264
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:11,328
value say yield okay so then I have to

265
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:13,068
fade the markers bye-bye there

266
00:11:11,328 --> 00:11:16,368
effect and so I just run a G wash and

267
00:11:13,068 --> 00:11:18,349
then I just multiply sorry and then I

268
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:19,910
just have all of the positive effect

269
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,290
alleles be a 1 and the negative effect

270
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:25,368
alleles be a zero okay

271
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:28,338
and so yeah here's the result from that

272
00:11:25,369 --> 00:11:31,339
so here I have out of 42 homologous

273
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:34,339
chromosome arm pairs I test all 42 of

274
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:36,350
them and I find eight of them that have

275
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:38,089
significant additive effects as well as

276
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:41,360
significant interaction and you'll

277
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:44,089
notice I find I find so here I've

278
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,039
colored these the red indicates that

279
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:47,389
that there was a negative relationship

280
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,248
between the additive effect and the

281
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:50,629
interaction the blue indicates a

282
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:52,639
positive relationship between the

283
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:54,259
additive effect in the interaction okay

284
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,928
so the blue corresponds like be greater

285
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:58,579
than one or like that over dominance and

286
00:11:56,928 --> 00:12:01,698
the red corresponds to more of a sub

287
00:11:58,578 --> 00:12:05,539
functionalisation and then these black

288
00:12:01,698 --> 00:12:07,669
ones are are a couple that I found that

289
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:10,578
have significant interaction effects but

290
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:13,548
don't necessarily have a significant

291
00:12:10,578 --> 00:12:15,138
correlation to the additive effect so I

292
00:12:13,548 --> 00:12:17,389
don't I don't know what's going on with

293
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:20,778
those ones but you'll notice that I have

294
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:24,918
tested these at an alpha of p equal or

295
00:12:20,778 --> 00:12:26,568
you know alpha 0.05 and remember I did

296
00:12:24,918 --> 00:12:28,100
not correct for multiple but this has

297
00:12:26,568 --> 00:12:30,528
not been corrected for multiple testing

298
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:34,699
and when I do I basically lose these

299
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:36,980
things which isn't super surprising but

300
00:12:34,698 --> 00:12:39,229
kind of frustrating for me these multi

301
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,639
kernel models get kind of difficult to

302
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,459
fit because I thought okay so I've got

303
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,899
this whole I've got this big genome

304
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,789
right and it's having an effect on yield

305
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:48,078
and then taking one tiny little piece

306
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:49,519
out of it and I'm setting it aside and

307
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:51,558
I'm asking what is the variance that you

308
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,600
explained and then what is the variance

309
00:12:51,558 --> 00:12:55,129
that your interactions explaining and I

310
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,389
think that I'm just getting so small

311
00:12:55,129 --> 00:13:00,319
that it's hard to find really

312
00:12:56,389 --> 00:13:02,798
significant differences but I did but

313
00:13:00,318 --> 00:13:05,360
you know I did do this for actually all

314
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:06,769
861 chromosome pairs regardless of

315
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,009
whether or not they are homey ologists

316
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:12,409
or not and I do find signal all over the

317
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:14,318
genome particularly within the B genome

318
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:16,818
there's a lot of signal there's also a

319
00:13:14,318 --> 00:13:19,308
lot of signal between the a and the B

320
00:13:16,818 --> 00:13:25,188
but not necessarily on what we believe

321
00:13:19,308 --> 00:13:25,519
our homologous regions so yeah and this

322
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:28,669
is

323
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:32,539
this is at a bonferroni of 10 to the -5

324
00:13:28,669 --> 00:13:34,069
roughly so and and the bulk of them tend

325
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:37,879
to show something that looks like this

326
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:39,709
sub functionality which I really I guess

327
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:43,429
I haven't really had enough chance to

328
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:46,250
digest these results from what why I

329
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:50,719
would expect this but it is interesting

330
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:52,610
to see okay so in conclusion epistatic

331
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,990
interactions do if you're important but

332
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,430
I'm finding them mostly within and

333
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:58,070
across the a and B genomes and not

334
00:13:55,429 --> 00:14:00,319
necessarily how many Oligocene I do keep

335
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:02,390
one of those homologous interactions but

336
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,300
one out of you know I don't know 20 or

337
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:06,559
whatever it was is arguably maybe not

338
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:10,159
the most significant thing in the world

339
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:11,419
and it may be because the signal is

340
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,778
being drowned by having multiple

341
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:17,000
interactions it because there's such

342
00:14:14,778 --> 00:14:18,740
large pieces of chromatin I'm testing so

343
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,299
one way I've been thinking about

344
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,799
circumventing this moving forward is now

345
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:26,120
that we actually have a reference genome

346
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:28,069
I plan on scanning the genome for

347
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,470
triplicates genes so basically you find

348
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:32,149
one gene in the a genome one and the B

349
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,528
one and the B and then you take the mark

350
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:35,350
of its nearest those and then basically

351
00:14:33,528 --> 00:14:38,328
I would just use the multiplicative

352
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:40,550
products of those markers and so then I

353
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:43,278
would be drastically reducing the number

354
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:44,509
of interactions I'm testing and

355
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:48,799
therefore I may pick up a lot more

356
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:51,350
signal and with that I just like to

357
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:55,370
thank my committee the yannick Soros

358
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:57,230
group and the small grain field crew who

359
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,509
which I could not have all of this data

360
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:07,720
without okay thank you

361
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:07,720
[Applause]

362
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,560
yeah but see but then but you're still

363
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,840
making so you're still actually making I

364
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:26,389
think that's the problem if you you've

365
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,060
already done the test right you already

366
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:30,319
asked whether or not they're additive is

367
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:34,789
significant right so then so then you

368
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,720
have to take that into account right so

369
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:37,250
you have to you have to have a

370
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,420
correction for the fact that you said

371
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,659
okay now that I'm saying that they're

372
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:42,829
additive is significant then but yeah I

373
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:44,360
mean you could do that you could just

374
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:57,500
condition on it and not worry about it I

375
00:15:44,360 --> 00:16:02,620
mean right right all right yeah and

376
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,620
right right did

377
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:13,769
all right yeah yeah okay sure

378
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:22,129
there's also a lot more of them but yeah

379
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:49,590
it could be I mean I could speculate a

380
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,750
lot on this too especially since there's

381
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,580
been there's also been translocations

382
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,769
that have happened since right and so I

383
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,810
have not been specifically careful about

384
00:16:55,769 --> 00:17:00,210
saying okay this this region is exactly

385
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:01,979
syntetic to that region on these three

386
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:04,950
genomes I basically made the assumption

387
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,410
that there's more or less gene Sentinel

388
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:09,529
comas from the chromosome which is I

389
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,910
mean which is arguably a pretty rough

390
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:13,049
assumption to make I just wanted to do

391
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:15,959
this genome scan to see if I can even

392
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:17,849
see it right yeah but yeah it's possible

393
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:19,769
that it's possible that you could have

394
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:21,539
ancient duplications doing this I would

395
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:22,588
expect them to have diverged to the

396
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:25,740
point of being either completely

397
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:28,440
additive or fixed by by that point

398
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,640
though I in fact I'm concerned that part

399
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,400
of the reason I don't see this is

400
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,740
actually because wheat is too old of a

401
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,390
hybrid even though it's not that old so

402
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,069
it was the last hybridization that

403
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:43,100
happened like nine ten thousand years

404
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:43,099
ago yeah Christine

405
00:17:55,509 --> 00:18:01,700
right so I think I think if you wanted

406
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,820
to ask that question the cool way to do

407
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:06,440
it would be to do like exome capture and

408
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:07,669
then and then you could grab all of

409
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,710
those things since the problem is that

410
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:13,580
my markers aren't in genes necessarily

411
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:16,850
right but week has like large has really

412
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:19,730
large regions of chromatin or LD blocks

413
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:21,829
so I'm hoping that I get that a better

414
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:23,539
response to your question would be yes

415
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:25,429
you could you could find all of those

416
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:26,990
but then how do you decide whether or

417
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:30,470
not they're different because they're

418
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:32,990
certainly not identical by descent right

419
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,700
and they might be identical by state in

420
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,380
their amino acid sequence but without

421
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,200
like without sequencing like the

422
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,670
transcriptome you wouldn't even have a

423
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:48,799
wonderful idea of how yeah how close

424
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:51,830
they were anyway this has been a
