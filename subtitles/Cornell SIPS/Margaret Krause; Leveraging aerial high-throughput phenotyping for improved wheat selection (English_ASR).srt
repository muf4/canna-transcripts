1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:05,320
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,718 --> 00:00:05,320
University

3
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:15,490
and first off today live from Mexico

4
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:17,739
we're going to have Marga Kraus to tell

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,750
us about leveraging Ariel high

6
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:22,659
throughput phenotyping for improved

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:32,439
early generation selection and we'd take

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:35,769
it away to start off giving a little

9
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:38,350
background on Ariel - Oh typing this

10
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:41,489
relies heavily on the concept of light

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,899
reflected off of the crop canopy and

12
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:46,238
recent developments in the remote

13
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:48,338
sensing imaging and aerospace industries

14
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,649
have given us a wide range of

15
00:00:48,338 --> 00:00:52,748
technologies to use to acquire these

16
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:54,609
phenotypes and we're using quite a

17
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:56,350
number of them here at CIMMYT to look at

18
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:58,359
different problems in plant breeding and

19
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:01,359
genetics but today I will just be

20
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:04,359
focusing on unmanned aerial systems or

21
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,540
UAS s as well as multi spectral sensors

22
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:09,189
which give us reflectance at a small

23
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,460
number of wavelengths in the light

24
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:13,929
spectrum in our case we get five and

25
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:17,019
from this information we can calculate

26
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,549
what are called vegetation indices it's

27
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:21,218
been well characterized in the

28
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:23,109
literature that vegetation indices can

29
00:01:21,218 --> 00:01:25,780
be useful proxies for things like

30
00:01:23,108 --> 00:01:29,500
overall plant health response to stress

31
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:31,810
changes in phenology etc so we're

32
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,269
interested in those for potentially

33
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:37,600
using them to select at the early stage

34
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:39,640
and wheat I am calculating and working

35
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:41,828
with quite a number of them but for this

36
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:46,478
presentation I'll just be working with

37
00:01:41,828 --> 00:01:48,459
NDVI which is a ratio of reflectance in

38
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:52,478
the near infrared and red regions of the

39
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:55,239
spectrum so a little bit of background

40
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:57,188
on the Senate breeding programs some of

41
00:01:55,239 --> 00:02:01,390
you might be familiar with their method

42
00:01:57,188 --> 00:02:03,519
of selected so plants are selected in

43
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,310
both between the F 2 and F 5 generations

44
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:08,079
and the F 6 is really the first time

45
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,569
when they're selected and harvested

46
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,690
individually and then they're planted in

47
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:15,280
small to raw plots and that are one

48
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:18,250
meter in length and these are

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,740
unreplicated um a couple weeks ago we

50
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,289
just finished hand planting 38,000

51
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,450
so it's a lot of work and we could

52
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:28,329
theoretically measure granules at the

53
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:30,399
stage but trait heritability is low and

54
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,960
not reliable for selection in addition

55
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,300
we don't really have the machine or

56
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,640
manpower to harvest and way that many

57
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,710
samples so at this stage we're still

58
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,839
working with visual selection and then

59
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:43,360
those lines move on into the first year

60
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,159
of replicated yield trials it could

61
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,250
potentially be beneficial to have

62
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:50,979
accurate predictions of green yield at

63
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,810
the f7 small plot stage and that's what

64
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:56,649
we're trying to look at with aerial

65
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:58,960
phenotyping so we've kind of designed an

66
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,180
experiment to ask this question can we

67
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,670
use phenotyping to select at the early

68
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,680
generation stage and we design the

69
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:07,839
experiment so that it would be kind of

70
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,620
integrated into the breeding program and

71
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,990
not use a lot of extra resources so the

72
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:17,289
breeders went through the f7 small plots

73
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:19,570
in 2016 to select lines to move on into

74
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:22,539
the large replicated yield trials in

75
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:25,299
2017 we went through and selected a

76
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:27,159
subset of those 1080 lines and planted

77
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,230
them again it's unreplicated one meter

78
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:32,710
small plots so these line these lines

79
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:35,739
were planted twice in 2016 both small

80
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:39,250
plots and as large yield plots we used

81
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:41,350
to mitrice 100 UAS by DJI equipped with

82
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,300
a micro sense red edge multispectral

83
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:44,889
sensor to phenotype the plots at

84
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,040
multiple time points during the growing

85
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:50,229
season we also assessed yield in both

86
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:52,299
the small and large plots again we don't

87
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:54,429
normally assess yield and small plot so

88
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:58,330
we did so this year for the purpose of

89
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:00,490
this experiment I want to take you guys

90
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,950
through some of the steps of the aerial

91
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,390
phenotyping and imaging pipeline that we

92
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:06,789
use at CIMMYT because there are a lot of

93
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:09,099
considerations that we have to get right

94
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:11,919
in order to get usable phenotype out at

95
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:13,930
the end before we can even fly there are

96
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,939
a few things to do and one of those

97
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,430
things is to make and place ground

98
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:19,930
control points in the field these need

99
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,790
to stay in one place throughout the

100
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,910
growing season and they need to be

101
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:27,250
visible to the sensor once we've

102
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,290
collected their RTK GPS coordinates with

103
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,500
our RTK system we can use that

104
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,360
information to

105
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,879
signed physical locations to each of the

106
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,670
images which is critical to being able

107
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:40,279
to stitch them together we also need to

108
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,689
create a flight plan for the UAS and we

109
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:44,209
do that in a software called mission

110
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:46,339
planner again in order to stitch the

111
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:49,219
images they have to have sufficient

112
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:52,699
overlap so we shoot for 80% overlap and

113
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:56,300
75% side lap and we can program that

114
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:58,490
into the flight plan the altitude speed

115
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,900
of the UAS and capture rate of the

116
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,900
sensor can also affect the overall

117
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:06,319
quality of the image and we fly the mic

118
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:08,719
ascents at 30 meters at 12 km/h and the

119
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:12,139
sensor has a capture rate of one image

120
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,940
per second on the day of the flight

121
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:15,620
there's a lot of things to remember to

122
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:17,959
bring out to the field batteries are

123
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,879
actually a big bottleneck for us we

124
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:22,009
bring out multiple SD cards for the

125
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:25,180
images and a computer to store them on

126
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:30,139
at the end um we run an app on a tablet

127
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:32,329
that will control the UAV and it runs

128
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:35,240
the flight plan mostly automatically so

129
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:38,569
this very little manual control of the

130
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,910
UAS that's needed before every takeoff

131
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:44,389
we also take images of a calibration

132
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:46,490
panel calibrating the images is really

133
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:49,069
important because atmospheric conditions

134
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,870
on the day of the flight can affect the

135
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:55,040
amount of light that's captured by the

136
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:57,620
sensor so what we do is we measure the

137
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,740
true values of the calibration panel

138
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:03,350
with a spectral radiometer and then

139
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:05,990
compare those two values taken on the

140
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:08,330
day of the flight and create a model

141
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,100
that will calibrate all of the images

142
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:11,959
prior to stitching this is really

143
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,169
important if you want to compare

144
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:18,918
phenotypes on different dates and track

145
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:20,750
grow throughout the growing season we

146
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:23,389
stitch all the images together using a

147
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,310
software called pix for D and the

148
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:27,168
composite image that comes out is called

149
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,478
an ortho mosaic I put up our ortho

150
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:32,149
mosaic of the small plots area from one

151
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:33,649
time point and I've taken out a section

152
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:35,569
for you to see up close what it looks

153
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:37,699
like that little white thing in there is

154
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:39,860
a ground control point our final

155
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:41,538
resolution is one to two centimeters for

156
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,460
pixels so it's pretty good again these

157
00:06:41,538 --> 00:06:44,860
are the 1 meter plots so they're fairly

158
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:48,169
small

159
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:51,980
to extract the data we use our GIS and

160
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:53,689
first thing we a soil vegetation mask

161
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,420
using a maximum likelihood

162
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:58,310
classification so this will sign a

163
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,189
binary value to pixels that are either

164
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:03,530
soil or vegetation we can apply that

165
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:05,870
mask back to the original image and

166
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:08,389
remove any data associated with soil and

167
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,160
then the last step is to draw polygons

168
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:12,439
around the plots and calculate plot

169
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,600
level statistics on the data bound by

170
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:16,699
the polygon so there are a lot of

171
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,560
considerations that go into this and

172
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:20,930
hopefully if you do it right you can get

173
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,449
a good quality results and that's what

174
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:25,519
we think we're starting to see here in

175
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:27,589
both the small and the large plots we

176
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,899
had higher heritability for all of our

177
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:33,139
MB bi time points than we did for yields

178
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:35,029
so that's promising in our in terms of

179
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:37,069
yield we had a correlation of 0.3

180
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:39,289
between the small and large plots that's

181
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:41,060
about what we expected and in both

182
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:44,750
experiments we saw significant

183
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:46,310
correlations between NDVI and yield it

184
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:50,509
was a little bit greater in the large

185
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,920
plots due to their size the relationship

186
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:54,349
that we're really interested in however

187
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,330
is between small plot NDVI and large

188
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,580
flat yield and here we're seeing that

189
00:07:56,329 --> 00:08:01,069
it's 0.4 3 so that's pretty good I

190
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:04,099
looked at this in terms of correlated

191
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:05,839
response to selection so in this case

192
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,360
the correlated trait is actually large

193
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,789
flat yield and we could theoretically

194
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,310
select off of small plot you small flat

195
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,990
nd bi or small pot yield and we're

196
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,910
seeing that the NDVI is twice as

197
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,610
effective the reason for this is because

198
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:21,470
it has higher heritability and it has a

199
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,949
higher correlation with large pot yields

200
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:27,980
than small pot yield so these are

201
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:30,079
looking promising as a selection tool I

202
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,418
also did some multi trait genomic

203
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:36,199
prediction work and this is work sort of

204
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:39,079
following Jessica's initial work using

205
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,180
hgp traits as secondary traits in gs and

206
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,250
the set up that I use is a little bit

207
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:45,889
complicated so I wanted to go through it

208
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:48,080
the training set that I used was 80% of

209
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:50,629
the lines the target trait was large

210
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,700
flat yield and the secondary trait was

211
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:55,399
large plot NDVI so we fit this model

212
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,830
using pedigrees and then for the text

213
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:59,029
that we use the remaining 20% of lines

214
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:01,879
yield was hidden

215
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:03,769
this time and small-plot NDVI was

216
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:05,840
actually the second the secondary trade

217
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:09,259
so the predictions that we got out we

218
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:12,500
correlated back to large flat yield so

219
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:14,689
the idea of doing this is you could fit

220
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,570
a model using the large plots where you

221
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:19,310
have both yield and NDVI available and

222
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:22,220
then use it to predict the small plots

223
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:23,750
where you only have an ABI and assess

224
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:27,410
what their yield would be as if they

225
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:29,360
were planted as large plots so I've

226
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:32,000
plotted the results along the bottom in

227
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,340
white and we're looking at multiple time

228
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,919
points for the NDVI so I tried to show

229
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,840
where those are in relation to the

230
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:41,929
phenology of the trials that's what the

231
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,940
top two graphs are um CIMMYT has a huge

232
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:46,099
aerial phenotyping program I think we

233
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,950
did more aerial phenotyping last season

234
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,779
than any CG Center has ever done we have

235
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:54,280
a lot of different experiments going on

236
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:56,559
so unfortunately those things as well as

237
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:59,839
changes in the weather and

238
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:02,359
responsibilities in the field prevented

239
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,970
us from phenotyping the both trials in

240
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,550
the same date we also had a lot more

241
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:10,279
phenotyping dates that we had assessed

242
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:12,319
but several of them didn't make it

243
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,909
through our quality control pipeline so

244
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,950
these are the dates that we have we have

245
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:18,350
two in the small pots and four in the

246
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:20,600
large plots you can see in the results

247
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:23,019
that adding NDB is the secondary rate

248
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,450
doesn't improve over the univariate case

249
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:28,789
in most cases but it does so twice most

250
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:31,730
notably when both the small and large

251
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:34,519
plots for phenotyped on march 13th we

252
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:37,879
know that NDB is sensitive to phenology

253
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:39,699
so this coming season we will be paying

254
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:42,350
a lot more attention to trying to

255
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:44,300
phenotype these trials at the same time

256
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:47,240
we got them planted on the exact same

257
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:48,859
date this year so that's really good we

258
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,870
just want to make sure that we're doing

259
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,940
our best so that we're not comparing

260
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:55,879
apples oranges one more thing I want to

261
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:58,430
say about this is in this experiment the

262
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:00,470
training set and the test set were

263
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:02,299
assessed within the same breeding cycle

264
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,279
but if we were to do this in practice

265
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:06,289
the training and test sets would be one

266
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:08,120
to two breeding cycles removed so it's

267
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:09,949
possible that what we're seeing here is

268
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,450
a little bit of within cycle

269
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,649
cross-validation bias which is

270
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:15,259
characterized in the

271
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:16,789
literature and that NDVI could actually

272
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:19,639
be more beneficial than what we're

273
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:23,539
seeing but we have not assessed that yet

274
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:26,180
so some quick take-home messages the

275
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:28,399
small plot Arial NDVI traits tend to be

276
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:30,558
more heritable than yield they are

277
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,509
predictive of yield in the large plots

278
00:11:30,558 --> 00:11:34,958
and they're correlated response is twice

279
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:38,509
as effective as the small plot yield

280
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:40,368
with our multi trait GS and EB I does

281
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:42,829
have the potential to improve accuracy

282
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:44,839
about timing around the phenology

283
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:46,729
appears to be really important and we

284
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:49,819
will be taking steps to improve that

285
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:51,289
this coming year so that's what I have

286
00:11:49,818 --> 00:11:53,899
for you guys today and I'd like to thank

287
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:56,688
my committee especially my advisers mark

288
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:59,058
and Mike at CIMMYT I'm working with dr.

289
00:11:56,688 --> 00:12:00,889
Jose Costa who's in biometrics but as

290
00:11:59,058 --> 00:12:02,958
you can see from the photos there are a

291
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:05,329
lot of other people who helped make this

292
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:07,609
phenotyping possible this project has

293
00:12:05,328 --> 00:12:09,739
also been heavily supported by Kansas

294
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:12,619
State jesse has been Co advising the

295
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,178
project his UAS technician rich brown

296
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:16,519
who's pictured there taught me how to

297
00:12:14,178 --> 00:12:18,799
fly and attina has been helping with

298
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:20,240
some of the image processing and of

299
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,109
course I wouldn't be in Mexico without

300
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,909
my funding sources so thank you to USAID

301
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:27,980
and their us for lab dollars in global

302
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:31,698
food security grant as well as the

303
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:33,319
National Science Foundation grant so I'm

304
00:12:31,698 --> 00:12:36,549
happy to interact with you guys for a

305
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:36,549
couple minutes if we still have time

306
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:50,409
[Applause]

307
00:12:43,028 --> 00:13:00,980
questions yeah or I could run the mic to

308
00:12:50,409 --> 00:13:03,519
ya tier so don't obrigada

309
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:06,980
you know when you're taking NDVI images

310
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,269
is the lack of greenness and that kind

311
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,100
of you know being robust for it's not

312
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:12,350
robust healthy versus not healthy is

313
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:15,048
that drought heat nitrogen stress all

314
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:18,528
three of them other things I mean like

315
00:13:15,048 --> 00:13:20,328
what fundamentally is the like yeah I

316
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:21,860
guess what is it stress tolerance or

317
00:13:20,328 --> 00:13:23,388
stress resistance or whatnot that is

318
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,370
being reflected in NDVI what are you

319
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:28,310
selecting on like terms of that

320
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:31,610
yeah so in terms of that for this

321
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:34,849
particular experiment it's probably just

322
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:39,529
gonna be a lot to do with biomass in the

323
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:42,019
small pots you know germination things

324
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:43,730
like that but we are using these

325
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:46,460
technologies at CIMMYT in our other

326
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:49,700
environments and so we have a drought

327
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:52,129
experiment we have a heat experiment and

328
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,590
in those experiments we see a lot of

329
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:58,389
difference a lot more variation in NDVI

330
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:58,389
that would be linked to those things

331
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,399
Margaret this dan could you pull back a

332
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:10,399
couple slides to the prediction

333
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:11,480
accuracies on yeah so the on march 13th

334
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,669
do you think the higher prediction

335
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,200
accuracy there is an artifact of being

336
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:17,059
scored on the same day and large and

337
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,100
small plots because it's just kind of an

338
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:27,009
arbitrary time in Granville or do you

339
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:30,080
think that's actually legitimate is that

340
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:33,980
the time points that tends to be the

341
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:38,810
most predictive in our program tend to

342
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:40,909
be during grain filling and we haven't

343
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:44,239
necessarily focused all of our

344
00:14:40,909 --> 00:14:46,639
phenotyping efforts to just focus on the

345
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,610
grain fill stage because I think the

346
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,370
breeders are interested in having

347
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:54,500
phenotypes from earlier in the season

348
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:58,039
certainly it takes time to process the

349
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,840
imagery so to have phenotypes in the

350
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:01,459
hands of the breeders at the time that

351
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,790
they're going through selections you

352
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:07,370
might have to start earlier so um that's

353
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:11,000
something that it'll be interesting to

354
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:13,490
see what the results come out as next

355
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,480
season if it's only grain filling that

356
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:20,299
is the time when we can phenotype

357
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:23,480
effectively well if there's no more

358
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:27,609
questions let's all thank Margaret

359
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:30,649
