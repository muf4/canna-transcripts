1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,399
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,759
University okay thank you Bill and thank

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,640
you Liam for the instruction and also

4
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:20,240
thank you uh everybody for coming to my

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:23,278
talk so here's the title of my talk

6
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:28,038
understanding the molecular mechanisms

7
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:28,039
underlying Al luminant resistance in

8
00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:35,840
plan uh so my topic is about aluminum

9
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:39,558
toxicity aluminum toxicity is tightly

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:43,480
associated with acid soil the reason is

11
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:48,319
that aluminum is the most abundant

12
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:51,640
metals on the earth Crest and neutral pH

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,039
aluminum is tightly BN to the soil CLS

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,280
which is not toxic to

15
00:00:54,039 --> 00:01:02,640
plant however under acid soil condition

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:06,200
the toxic Al luminance species so that's

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,640
al3+ will release from the soil clim

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:13,520
into soil solution which is highly toxic

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:17,759
to plan root growth here shows the map

20
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:21,560
of word ay soils so you can see the acid

21
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:25,118
soil which is in red color is widely

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:28,719
distributed around the world with a

23
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:31,959
significant fraction in the de uh

24
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:36,158
developing countries in the Tropic and

25
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:38,559
subtropics so there is really a need to

26
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,159
understand the molecular magnetisms

27
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,719
underlying or magnets underlying

28
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:48,680
aluminum resistance in crops in order to

29
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:51,000
further enhance resistance to acid soil

30
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,000
for

31
00:01:51,959 --> 00:02:00,798
crop so this slide shows the toxic

32
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:04,560
effects of aluminum on two wheat l so

33
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,479
when it's a ETA that's aluminum torent

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,759
and Esa this aluminum sensitive as you

35
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:13,080
can see under neutral pH there's no

36
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:16,679
difference uh in R growth between these

37
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,280
two lines however under A6 so condition

38
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,800
you can see this sensitive line the root

39
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,439
gr was completely

40
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:29,319
inhibited with stuned and damaged root

41
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:32,878
growth so the problem of aluminum

42
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:36,280
toxicity is so privileged in developing

43
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:40,318
country so it is the major limitation

44
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:43,680
for cor Crop Production on acid

45
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:46,799
soil so also from this slide you can see

46
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,959
U the genetic variation in terms of

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,280
aluminum resistance so this is the focus

48
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:57,598
for our study and this is also the uh

49
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,598
basis for plant breeding

50
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,439
purposes so in today today's talk I will

51
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:08,280
first briefly introduce the

52
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:11,479
strategies adopted by plans to cope with

53
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,719
aluminum stress and then I will

54
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:19,359
highlight some efforts in my group to

55
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:23,000
unveil how plans use these strategies to

56
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,000
achieve aluminum

57
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,959
resistance uh okay so here's the diagram

58
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:34,598
of a plant so this the RO and the above

59
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:38,840
uh part and this part is a um

60
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:41,639
magnification of the root especially the

61
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,840
root tape region so root tape is the

62
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:47,878
target for aluminum toxicity so it's

63
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,759
most sensitive to aluminum Jazz so

64
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:54,560
here's the risos spere and here's a

65
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:57,000
diagram for the uh root epidermal cells

66
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,239
with a plasma membrane the membrane of

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,039
VOR and a cell world

68
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,799
so the widely and most uh

69
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:10,000
documented magnet for Al luminant

70
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:14,280
resistance is the exclusion or avoidant

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,358
avoidance magism which prevents aluminum

72
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:22,279
from getting into the root cells so this

73
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:27,359
is done by uh the release of the root

74
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:31,359
cells of uh organic acid such as melee C

75
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,639
CH into the risos where the organic

76
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,759
gases can form

77
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:40,360
non-toxic uh OA aluminum complex that

78
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,600
cannot be get into the cell so it's like

79
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,960
exclusion so that's the first magn the

80
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,960
second

81
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:51,680
magnet uh the second magism deal with

82
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:54,679
the aluminum that enters into uh the

83
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,879
root cells so this aluminum can be

84
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:02,439
either sequestered into the vacu or can

85
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:05,240
be transl located from the roof to the

86
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:06,478
shoot so the shoes is less sensitive to

87
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,960
Al luminance

88
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:14,038
ja so recently increasing lines of

89
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,638
evidence indicate that modification of a

90
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:20,918
Cell World structure and function could

91
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:24,319
be a uh critical uh step for Al luminant

92
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:28,439
resistance in plants so I also focus on

93
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,439
that in my later talk

94
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:37,839
so here comes the second part of my talk

95
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:39,560
so I will uh highlight some effers in my

96
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:43,198
group

97
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:48,038
for for the uh aluminum exclusion

98
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:51,360
mechanisms in Swan and true aluminum

99
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:56,279
resistant uh in abodes and finally I

100
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,960
will uh report on some of our progress

101
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:02,638
in understanding the regulatory or

102
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:05,918
signaling pathway involving resistant to

103
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:10,120
low ph and aluminate stress in

104
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:13,598
arabidopsis so here comes the first

105
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:17,560
part so this shows uh the root growth of

106
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:21,959
two San lines one is tolerant

107
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:28,000
SC2 83 and the sensitive

108
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:30,159
br7 on the uh low PH plus aluminum

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,519
solution so you can see

110
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,120
the root growth of the T lines has no

111
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:38,719
effect but you can see stunted and

112
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:43,720
damaged rout for the sensitive

113
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:49,360
lines and this is the work done by

114
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:53,199
Jura uh mes so he's a former PhD student

115
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,439
uh for lion and um now he's a close

116
00:06:53,199 --> 00:07:00,120
collaborator for for our group

117
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:04,560
also so also he found that the

118
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:10,240
um the very close correlation between

119
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:12,280
the uh aluminum activated C release from

120
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,240
the torrent

121
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:17,239
line and aluminum resistance so there's

122
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:24,839
no uh or organic acid released from the

123
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:29,800
sensitive line Wass the uh the T line

124
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:32,038
and this Line's very sens sensitive so

125
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,079
here the summary for the relationship

126
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:39,719
between uh alumin Torrance

127
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:44,158
and uh root SE tray release so here

128
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:46,280
shows the uh the torrent line growth uh

129
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:49,560
with or without Al luminance so this the

130
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:52,918
control and the treatment in a period of

131
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:56,399
uh six days aluminum treatment so you

132
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:58,878
can see the first day uh the root growth

133
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,000
of even for the root growth of the

134
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,560
torent line

135
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,199
so it was uh inhibited by about 50%

136
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,120
compared to the uh control so it

137
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:11,680
continued being inhibited at this level

138
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,598
but on the third day of treatment you

139
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:19,800
can see uh gradually uh increase of root

140
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:23,158
gr and by the fourth day you see there's

141
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:26,720
no difference between uh the treatment

142
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:29,639
and the control and this process very

143
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,320
closely and positively correlated with

144
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:35,839
the root uh C release in the torent line

145
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:40,399
so you see without aluman you don't see

146
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:44,440
any c release but with aluminum so the

147
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:47,839
uh you can see gradually induction of C

148
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:51,959
release so by the I mean the third

149
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:54,399
day uh there's much more C release and

150
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:57,399
then this correspondent to the increase

151
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,200
of root growth so by the time of the six

152
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:02,278
day the huge amount of

153
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,879
uh SE release from the root tip and you

154
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:07,838
can see fully recovery of the root

155
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:10,320
growth in the torrent line in conest in

156
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,760
the sensitive line you never seen any uh

157
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,519
C release from the root with or without

158
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:19,200
aluminum and actually the root grows

159
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:22,560
never recover from the

160
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:27,399
treatment and based on that uh Jura he

161
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:30,439
did a uh K mapping project and he

162
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:34,360
actually um m

163
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:39,079
the aluminum resistant Locus into one

164
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:42,879
single bag so then I uh come into Leon

165
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:45,879
SL and Jura graduate and so we further

166
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:48,000
collab on collaborate on that project

167
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:53,399
and also by the way I mean uh he also

168
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:57,480
did the uh correlation analysis for uh

169
00:09:53,399 --> 00:10:00,720
Cate release and aluminum Torance for a

170
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,879
small panel of swans so this 10 a

171
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,278
section what he found is the SE trate

172
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:11,278
release is positively correlated with uh

173
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:11,278
aluminum Torrance among the uh this ass

174
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:19,079
section and

175
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:22,599
also so we finally CL the the gene the

176
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:27,838
resistant Gene it encodes a swan a

177
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:32,519
member of swan MJ and toxic compound

178
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:36,760
Extrusion so Gene so we demonstrate that

179
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:40,399
uh so this SP made Gene actually encode

180
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:46,000
the alumin activated C transporter in uh

181
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:48,519
in Swan and the expression of s SP is

182
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,720
positively correlated with aluminum

183
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:55,639
Torance as well as C release in the same

184
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,399
uh Swan assession panel I mentioned in

185
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:59,399
the previous slide

186
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:07,079
so here comes the problem

187
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:11,079
so what is a trade out for using SE

188
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:12,759
trade as a weapon for aluminum

189
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:17,479
resistance it's very obviously that's a

190
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:21,240
carbon cost so uh so for plants best

191
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:25,879
benefit is to use minimum amount of

192
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,720
C uh to achieve maximum um uh aluminum

193
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:30,679
tolerance so that's deal with the carbon

194
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:34,959
use efficiency

195
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:37,000
uh so how can swan achieve this the

196
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:42,838
one way is

197
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:46,839
to uh specialy the expression of s Spate

198
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:49,720
gene expression so we can see uh SB ma

199
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:52,240
is only is made Express in the root tipe

200
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,120
region so that's the the region most

201
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,120
sensitive to aluminum and that's the one

202
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,399
that need most

203
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,759
protection and not only that I mean if

204
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:06,559
you uh we also do the um imun

205
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:10,000
localization and LCM the laso dissection

206
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:14,039
microscope uh real time PCR actually the

207
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,159
as B made protein and uh transcription

208
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:19,599
is only expressed in the very defined

209
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:23,439
region like uh epidermal cells and the

210
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,399
first layer of uh cortex so that's

211
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:30,360
Define the sitro release only in that

212
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:34,240
part of the plan uh rout

213
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,959
issue so is that enough so

214
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:41,039
the uh question is not the reason is

215
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:44,359
that the acid soil is on uh in reality

216
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:46,838
is not a uh

217
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:50,240
homogenous yeah property actually is

218
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:54,120
quite hetrogeneous uh in distribution so

219
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:57,079
here shows a an acid soil uh field in

220
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,600
Australia so the red color indicate that

221
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:03,439
uh the soil is highly acidic but you see

222
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:06,839
not far away mean there's some uh

223
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:11,120
some s region that's high either neutral

224
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:13,279
or even alkaline so so that's in the XY

225
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,320
Dimension but if you look at the the

226
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:19,519
Third Dimension the vertical Dimension

227
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,160
so you can see also very uh lot of

228
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:27,198
variation usually I mean the top soilers

229
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:30,120
are less aluminum uh toxicity than the

230
00:13:27,198 --> 00:13:32,958
Deep Cell uh deep soil and

231
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,720
also when the plants grow from the top

232
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:41,719
soil into the deep soil so so plant

233
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:45,560
roots are grows as a tip growth uh Mana

234
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:49,720
so whenever he goes it's like constantly

235
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:52,679
meet uh the change of soil

236
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:55,000
environment so the question is how do PL

237
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:59,198
R since the

238
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,039
frequent uh changes in aluminum toxicity

239
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:05,198
and how it

240
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:06,439
react so that's the uh question we want

241
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,439
to

242
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,440
address

243
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:18,838
and so to answer this question in in

244
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:22,879
swen I actually um transform the spma

245
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:26,120
gene into East East has no homologue of

246
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:29,399
SP mag in is a genome so without

247
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:33,240
aluminum you see no uh with without

248
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:37,360
aluminum signal uh C release which is

249
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:41,799
mediate by SB made but with the SB made

250
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:46,399
expression is you can see the uh

251
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:48,679
constit is uh release of C trate with or

252
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,839
without aluminum so this is very

253
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:55,319
different for what we have seen in h

254
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:58,279
Swan so which uh so the six release is

255
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:04,879
actually activated only activated by

256
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:07,480
aluminous G test so no release uh under

257
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:11,958
control so this suggest there must have

258
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:16,278
some uh negative regulator for SB

259
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:18,278
made uh in plans so that's lead to uh

260
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:22,679
led to uh my

261
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:27,120
second uh work here so so I think and

262
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:29,879
then I decided to use the split ubiqutin

263
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,679
is two hybrid systems so be because I

264
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:36,958
use that uh because SP Spate is a

265
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:41,359
membrane protein so I have to use this U

266
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:46,039
syst is to hybrid system to screen um a

267
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:48,360
library that made from the s r tip and I

268
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:52,120
found a very strong candidate uh

269
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:54,800
interacting protein so it's a putative

270
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,720
metal binding protein so here we call in

271
00:15:54,799 --> 00:16:00,519
as

272
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,440
MBP as a strong candidate for the uh SB

273
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:05,799
made interacting

274
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,920
component so what happen if we co

275
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:11,838
transform uh these two component into

276
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:15,838
East actually we see the um

277
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:18,680
reconstitution of aluminum activated SEC

278
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:23,319
release as we seen uh in

279
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:24,879
Swan so here is the single SB made uh

280
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:27,879
trans

281
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:31,799
transformed and you see constitu large

282
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:35,159
amount of C release was the uh very

283
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:38,198
controlled and aluminum activated C

284
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:42,838
release in the uh double

285
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:47,198
transforming so the question is uh the C

286
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:50,000
is the I mean organic acid that binds to

287
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:53,958
aluminum so it's a foundation for

288
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,198
aluminum resistant so what what's the um

289
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:59,518
aluminum Torance of this two line with

290
00:16:56,198 --> 00:17:03,519
this one has higher amount of cated

291
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:07,120
can achieve higher degree of aluminum

292
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:09,759
resistance or not so here is the next

293
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:13,038
experiment for uh

294
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:16,640
testing uh relative growth or aluminum

295
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:21,359
Torance for three different east line so

296
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:23,720
this the uh East just transform with

297
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:27,240
empty Vector so you see that's very

298
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:31,480
sensitive to aluminum but the uh single

299
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:34,720
transform that uh the growth geometric

300
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:37,880
increase but it's not as good as the uh

301
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,720
double transform so we remember I mean

302
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:43,480
this line has huge amount of citrate

303
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,558
released so we thought oh it could be re

304
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,599
reach a higher degree of aluminum

305
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:51,000
resistance but actually it's not the

306
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:54,918
reason is that the carbon cost that's

307
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,359
too much and then actually inhibit uh

308
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:58,360
cell growth

309
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,799
very sensitive so here comes uh the

310
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,360
working model for how this two component

311
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:14,158
work together to achieve aluminum

312
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:16,439
activated uh C isolation so here is the

313
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:19,960
plasma membrane of the loot epidermal

314
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:23,440
cells and sbma is a uh C

315
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:26,600
transporter and MBP is a negative

316
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,120
regulator for SB mate so without Al

317
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:32,119
luminant it tightly binds to the uh

318
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:35,239
permeation pathway of uh the C

319
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:39,678
transporter so which can block the C

320
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:43,440
release from sale uh the cytool into uh

321
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:46,919
risos speld and nppp is a aluminum

322
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:50,679
binding protein under acidic condition

323
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:54,720
you uh npv binds to aluminum and change

324
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:56,759
its uh confirmation and also its

325
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,640
Affinity to

326
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:05,319
um s spma would be decrease and this

327
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:08,759
will lead to um dissociation or partial

328
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:12,798
dissociation of MBP from the sbma so

329
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:16,599
leading to opening of the C isation

330
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:21,158
perme permeation pathway so leading to

331
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:25,959
the exultation of um C

332
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:29,720
release okay so so next would be to uh

333
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:33,558
to address this model we need to confirm

334
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,880
uh yeah three things one is MVP is

335
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:39,480
aluminum binding protein and also the

336
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:43,240
binding to aluminum can disrupt the uh

337
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,919
MVP and SB made

338
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:49,079
interaction so here's the work by uh

339
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:52,200
Michael Lee so I think he's also in the

340
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:57,000
audience and so here's is the P down

341
00:19:52,200 --> 00:20:00,080
essay to demonstrate that uh MBP is a pH

342
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,400
dependent aluminum binding floting so

343
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:07,319
here is just the beads you see there's

344
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:09,840
no uh binding of aluminum to uh to

345
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:12,759
binding of the MVP to the beads so that

346
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:16,279
mean any binding here is specific and

347
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:21,240
also uh under uh the treatment we only

348
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:23,918
see The Binding of mbp2 um aluminum the

349
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,120
aluminum beads at the low PH but not in

350
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:30,840
the neutral pH so

351
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:34,158
that's uh confirmed that MBP is a pH

352
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:36,839
dependent uh aluminum binding protein

353
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:41,360
and second we need to demonstrate that

354
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:44,918
uh aluminum binding to MBP can disrupt

355
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:49,000
uh mppp and SB made interaction so here

356
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:53,159
is the invidual pull down essay so you

357
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:57,279
can see under the neutral pH so it with

358
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:59,919
uh with the in presence or in absence of

359
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:04,399
aluminum so there's always strong

360
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:09,440
interaction between SB mate and um SB

361
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:11,798
MVP here right however under the low PH

362
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,200
without aluminum we can see a little bit

363
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:17,519
decrease of uh interaction of these two

364
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:20,120
component but when Al luminance was

365
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:23,599
added you see there's no interaction

366
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:27,278
that mean that's completely dissociated

367
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:30,038
with these two uh uh two

368
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:34,119
component so that's invivo and then I

369
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:37,119
did uh the invivo

370
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:42,519
BFC uh interaction so that's a system

371
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:45,759
that tested for interaction of two uh

372
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:49,558
proteins if there's protein protein

373
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:53,558
interaction you will see fesen and if

374
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:57,200
the interaction was disrupted you will

375
00:21:53,558 --> 00:22:01,599
see decrease of the uh florescent signal

376
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:05,798
so so that's the uh BFC and then uh this

377
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:10,079
movie shows what happened after aluminum

378
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:12,400
was added so this the tobacco epidermal

379
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,399
leaf

380
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:28,720
cell yeah I mean it's quite rapid

381
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:32,000
process about 2 and a half hours you see

382
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:37,360
almost completely dis uh disappearance

383
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:40,480
of the uh floresent so okay what's the

384
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:44,839
uh control so this a control that just

385
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:47,679
um eject the buffer but without aluminum

386
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:50,678
and with the same period time of

387
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,679
recording

388
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:14,599
yeah see the difference so

389
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,839
uh so that demonstrate that uh the

390
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:21,079
interaction

391
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:25,199
of uh Al luminant I mean uh SB made MBP

392
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:28,918
was disrupted by adding aluminum so so

393
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:33,400
in previous slide we demonstrated that

394
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:36,000
MBP is a uh aluminum binding protein and

395
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:39,159
binding of aluminum could cause

396
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,119
dissociation of MVP and SB made

397
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:45,120
interaction so pretty much d uh confront

398
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:45,119
our

399
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,079
hypothesis so here comes the uh the

400
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:58,960
second

401
00:23:54,079 --> 00:24:01,519
of part so it's deal with the true t in

402
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,519
alop

403
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:08,519
CICS so so it's this part so deal within

404
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:13,519
uh remove Al

405
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:17,879
luminant from cell into cytosol so cell

406
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:22,119
is a very important organ for in in

407
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:25,278
aluminum Torance so it's estimated that

408
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:28,398
90% of the AL luminant in Roots was

409
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:32,119
accumulated in cell world so in

410
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:35,439
increasing number of um

411
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:37,759
increasing uh blindes of evidence

412
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,038
indicate that modification of cell World

413
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:45,839
components could be a very important uh

414
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:50,319
plays a very important role in alumin

415
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:53,759
resistance so um the true

416
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:57,558
Torance magnet inward like two parts one

417
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:59,398
is move aluminum into the um cytool

418
00:24:57,558 --> 00:25:00,480
followed by

419
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:03,678
uh

420
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:07,960
sequester sequestration into the VAC or

421
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:11,880
translocate into um the above ground

422
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:17,038
tissues so in fact in in plants there's

423
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:21,000
a specific class of um uh that actually

424
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:24,319
they like aluminum so this the So-Cal

425
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:29,240
aluminum accumulate plant species so

426
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:33,278
including like uh tea buckweed and hyena

427
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:37,759
so they tend to uptake larger amount of

428
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:40,000
aluminum from the soil and um

429
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:44,440
translocate into

430
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,880
the uh shoot tissue and store the

431
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:49,880
aluminum in the

432
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,880
VAC

433
00:25:51,278 --> 00:26:00,038
so so this photo shows

434
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:03,240
um Hyer plant in the uh in front of

435
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:06,278
wagamans in the next early spring yeah

436
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:10,839
so you can see there um the some of them

437
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:13,038
produce uh blue flowers with some uh

438
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:15,839
sometimes red flowers but I can tell you

439
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:18,519
they all have the same genetics so that

440
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:21,918
mean the flower uh color change is due

441
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:25,079
to environment environmental effects but

442
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:29,240
not genetic effects actually it's it's

443
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:32,439
on the uh assist of soil so the the one

444
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:36,720
on the left that's grew in the acid soil

445
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:41,360
so that produce uh the blue flour was

446
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:44,679
the neutral pH uh soil you see the uh

447
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:44,678
produce red

448
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:53,678
flow so so here's a close up for the

449
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,159
very beautiful I think yeah and actually

450
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,679
the only difference uh there's a a group

451
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,159
in Japan they they are horticulture they

452
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:04,000
actually analyze what's going on here

453
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:06,320
they found that actually the uh only

454
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,440
difference for for the these two flowers

455
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:14,319
is that uh this one the the blue one

456
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:17,080
they accumulate high amount of

457
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:19,839
aluminum in the uh seot I mean what we

458
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:23,119
see actually is a seot is not pattern

459
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:26,558
atse the uh the red red color

460
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:30,119
flow and then actually they um the

461
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:34,158
reason is that uh under neutral

462
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:38,678
pH so this the uh ening accumulated in

463
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:43,000
the VAC so called uh they fing 3

464
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:46,919
glucoside so it has a native red color

465
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,398
but under soil acidic soil condition

466
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:54,240
aluminum will be accumulated into the uh

467
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:57,879
V which combines to the aning and turn

468
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:02,399
its color into blue that's the uh secret

469
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:06,278
of that magic and actually they CL this

470
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:09,798
two uh transporter so one is responsible

471
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:12,480
for the uh moving of aluminum into the

472
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:16,119
cytosol so that's plasma membrane

473
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,278
localized they called um part or plasma

474
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:21,639
membrane localized aluminum

475
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:26,720
transporter and the the one responsible

476
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:30,120
for um Vora transporter is called V or

477
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,120
Vora AUM

478
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:38,679
transporter both these genes are belong

479
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:41,399
to um the eoin gene family so

480
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:45,440
aquaporin it's a very large uh Gene

481
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:50,959
family in plants so like they have 35

482
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:57,038
members in idopy and 33 in

483
00:28:50,960 --> 00:29:00,038
rice and also EOP tend to transport uh

484
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:00,038
neutral solo

485
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:07,760
um because and also I mean uh port and W

486
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:12,640
are the first members of EOP poring

487
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:16,839
demonstrate that um be able to transport

488
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:20,159
aluminum so that's the uh quite

489
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:23,359
interesting for us uh working on

490
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,360
aluminum uh

491
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:28,639
resistance so the question although they

492
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:31,000
demonstrate that this genes function in

493
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,120
aluminum transporter but they we don't

494
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,480
know if they have any function in

495
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:38,798
aluminum Torance imp

496
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:42,079
plant and because the part is the plasma

497
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:46,240
membrane localized uh aluminum

498
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:49,639
transporter and which is could be a

499
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:55,079
critical component for uh aluminum

500
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:59,159
uptake in uh in Roots so I we decid to

501
00:29:55,079 --> 00:30:01,319
focus uh to study the the port homolog

502
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:03,120
in

503
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:08,720
arsic

504
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:14,079
and hm p is closely related to the nip

505
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:18,640
sub family in uh in apopsis nip stands

506
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:22,519
for the nerine 26 in chinc

507
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:26,919
protein so this uh work was done lead

508
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:26,919
led by H1

509
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:36,839
and also we screen the library for the N

510
00:30:33,558 --> 00:30:41,319
member of the nip nips in epops and

511
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:43,359
found out that uh nip 1-2 actually has

512
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:47,398
the hypers sensitive

513
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:53,398
phenotype uh to aluminum just when it's

514
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:57,000
Bress in East so here's the uh control

515
00:30:53,398 --> 00:31:00,918
and the treatment and also we include uh

516
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,200
we included and red one so it's a famous

517
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:07,960
uh aluminum

518
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:11,120
transporter uh localized in the r cell

519
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:14,399
plasma membrane so this word are been

520
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:17,798
done by Jon in Leon

521
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:21,798
SCP and we can see hyper sensitive of uh

522
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:26,079
nip 1-2 to aluminum but it's the

523
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:29,440
sensitivity is not as strong as um the

524
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:34,079
Andro one indicated that but probably I

525
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:39,840
mean the nip 1-2 the capacity is lower

526
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:39,839
than uh And1 in terms of aluminum

527
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:46,480
transport and also each test the

528
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:49,919
aluminum accumulation in the three east

529
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:55,360
line we can see um the hyper

530
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:58,759
accumulation of aluminum in the uh nip

531
00:31:55,359 --> 00:32:03,199
one- two expiration east line but the

532
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:06,440
amount is not as high as uh the and one

533
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,080
further indicating that the capacity of

534
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,480
nip 1-2

535
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:14,240
transporter aluminum transporter might

536
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:18,558
be it's lower than and red

537
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:23,798
one also uh each test the subed

538
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:27,480
localization of nip 1-2 he made uh the

539
00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:28,558
gfp fusion protein and this slide shows

540
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,000
the

541
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:33,278
uh localization of diffusion protein so

542
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,960
it's in the plasma membrane and this

543
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:39,319
further demonstrate by the uh di dii

544
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:43,200
stain so it's very clear localized on

545
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:47,519
the plasma membrane for this

546
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:51,000
protein and nip one-2 is only made

547
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,558
Express on the root but not in shoe so

548
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,038
that's the uh

549
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:59,839
rtpcr and also this the real time PCR

550
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:03,440
and see the induction of of nip 1-2 is

551
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:05,439
brushing by aluminum so after 4 hours of

552
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,120
aluminum treatment so it reach the

553
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,558
maximum level and uh decrease a little

554
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:15,479
bit and

555
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:18,359
also nip 1-2 expression is specifically

556
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:22,319
induced by aluminum treatment but not by

557
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:25,879
other metal uh stress as well as by the

558
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:28,759
low uh pH

559
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:33,278
treatment so here's the uh teaches

560
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:37,240
specific localization of uh nip 1-2 so

561
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:39,599
this the gas uh analysis so you can see

562
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:42,798
uh nip 1-2 is mly Express in the root

563
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:47,079
tape region of uh the main the primary

564
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:50,480
and lateral root and so also the you see

565
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:53,599
the gas stainings was enhanced by

566
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,880
aluminum treatment so you can see the uh

567
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:59,119
not only inhance also but the region I

568
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:03,000
mean going up and down

569
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:06,678
so what's the phenotype for for the nip

570
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:11,679
1-2 mutant in uh in terms of

571
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:15,039
aluminum uh Torance so here shows that

572
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:19,599
the nip 1-2 so we acquire three

573
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:22,599
independent tdna insertion line from ABC

574
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:26,399
and can see uh all of them are hyper

575
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:28,280
sensitive to uh to aluminum treatment

576
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,878
compared to the wild type

577
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:34,359
so here is the wild type and the

578
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:38,480
significant decrease of uh the root grth

579
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:38,480
for uh two representative

580
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:49,440
line and so we try to understand the

581
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:52,320
magnesense why nip 1-2 it's can uh it's

582
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,119
function in aluminum Torance so one

583
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:59,680
thing is so we U measure I mean

584
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:05,280
stain uh the wild type and nip one-2

585
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:09,159
mutant with uh hoseline so this the D

586
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,720
that stained aluminum in the cell only

587
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:13,879
in the cell but not in the cytosol what

588
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:16,239
we can see there's almost no staining

589
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:19,720
without aluminum but strong staining in

590
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:22,239
the root uh tip region for the wild TI

591
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:27,519
but the uh the strength of the standing

592
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:30,598
much um higher in the uh mutant line so

593
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:32,519
that suggest there more aluminum was

594
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:35,480
accumulated in the mutant than the wild

595
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:39,000
type so here is the quantification for

596
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:41,480
this uh experiment we see compared to

597
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,480
the wild type and the mutant uh the

598
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:49,679
mutant tends to accumulate more aluminum

599
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:52,838
in the side uh C but in the cyos it

600
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:55,919
reverse I mean we see less aluminum was

601
00:35:52,838 --> 00:35:58,519
transported into the um cyto so that

602
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,800
suggest I mean uh

603
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:05,679
nip 1-2 is a aluminum transporter

604
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:09,240
responsible for uh uptake of

605
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:09,239
aluminum into the

606
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:17,480
cytool uh so here's the working model

607
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,720
for uh for this

608
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:25,119
part yeah so

609
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:29,439
the and nip 1-2 responsible for aluminum

610
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:32,920
uptake from C wall or from the

611
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:36,159
um risos spere and then move

612
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:40,880
to uh to the pericycle through the same

613
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:44,559
plastic FL so we don't know if n u nip

614
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,760
1-2 is also responsible for the silent

615
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:49,400
uptate or it could but it could have

616
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:52,960
some other components but definitely

617
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:55,200
it's uh involved in the aluminum

618
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,679
translocation from rout to shoe I didn't

619
00:36:55,199 --> 00:37:00,879
show the slide I mean we we found that

620
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:04,919
actually the uh aluminum content in the

621
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:09,358
shield for the um mutant is less than

622
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,358
than the in the wild wild

623
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:18,160
tydee yeah so this slight summarize alop

624
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:21,078
aluminum tance actually Aldis has adopt

625
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:24,399
the exclusion mechnisms that's involve

626
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:28,079
the release of Mele Cay and also we

627
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:31,160
demonstrate that uh the true Torance

628
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:34,920
magazines also function in arabidopsis

629
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:37,960
and also um in shaen Jen group in Jang

630
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:43,240
University they have done lot of work on

631
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:46,960
the S part so so it's a small plan it's

632
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:50,399
not very tolerant to uh aluminum but it

633
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,559
has almost every no mechnism for

634
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,200
aluminum

635
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:59,159
resistance okay the last part uh I will

636
00:37:55,199 --> 00:38:02,919
briefly report uh our some progress in

637
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:06,159
dissecting regulatory Pathways uh

638
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:08,559
involved in resistant to low ph and

639
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:12,960
aluminum stress in

640
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:17,599
apopsis so in apopsis in kayamas group

641
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:21,920
they identify a um mutant that

642
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:25,119
highly um sensitive to low PH so only to

643
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,400
low uh low per that's what they screen

644
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:31,480
uh for and then they colog this G uh it

645
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,200
they call the stop one it's encodes a

646
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,679
sing fingle transcription Factor

647
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:39,480
actually it's a master transcription

648
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:42,919
factor that can show many of uh the now

649
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:46,760
very very now alumin resistant Gene like

650
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:50,200
uh at amt1 that's a melee transporter

651
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:52,280
and at M is C transporter and A3 also

652
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:55,078
very important but we don't know exactly

653
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:58,440
how it function so probably it's

654
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:59,519
function in the junction of alum Torance

655
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,720
and

656
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:07,039
fosho uh deficiency yeah resistance so

657
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:10,838
it's a master uh

658
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:13,800
signal uh transcription fact Factor so

659
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:18,039
in this part is this work is led by F

660
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:19,720
Jang who is a uh twoyear visiting uh

661
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:23,480
graduate student I mean it's very

662
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:27,919
amazing as you can see uh in later has

663
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:31,199
made lot of progress so the this the uh

664
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,440
the possible signaling pathway for uh

665
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:37,439
for the St on

666
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:39,599
controlled uh system so we we know stop

667
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,358
one if you knock it out it's hyp

668
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:46,119
sensitive to low PH but also all these

669
00:39:42,358 --> 00:39:49,440
genes are are knock down knock out

670
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:51,000
and and there also hypersensitive hypers

671
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,358
sensitive to

672
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,440
aluminum uh toxicity but we know these

673
00:39:54,358 --> 00:40:00,920
two process are independent the reason

674
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,800
is that uh all of these mutant they are

675
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:07,400
not hypers sensitive to low PH so they

676
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:11,240
are separate so and in this word we try

677
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:13,680
to find uh the some component in any of

678
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:18,039
this uh

679
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:22,559
path so we're using traditional

680
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:27,400
um classic genetics to screen reverance

681
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:30,358
for the uh s the stop one uh phenotype

682
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:34,480
phal type so here the result I mean this

683
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:37,440
a wild type under low ph and uh the stop

684
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:40,039
one mutants hypers sensitive to to to

685
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,720
low ph and this the stop one revert and

686
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:48,440
you see uh it's not completely revertant

687
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:50,000
but as says 80% or 70% are are reverent

688
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,920
in terms of root

689
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,679
growth and here's some of the uh

690
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:59,119
putative

691
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:59,118
mutant uh for the revertant

692
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:05,479
and then we try to test their response

693
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:09,440
to different uh stress one uh like

694
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:13,400
aluminum you see some of the rant it's

695
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:17,240
actually it's more resistant to um to

696
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:20,880
aluminum compared to the uh it's

697
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:24,799
parine and some of hyp sensitive to

698
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,920
sodian and resistant to C cium compared

699
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,680
to the even to the wild type but some of

700
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:33,039
this are very sensitive to camian so

701
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:37,318
there we don't know what what's going on

702
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:40,559
now and then uh fan decided to uh clone

703
00:41:37,318 --> 00:41:43,358
one of these genes with the uh n gam

704
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:46,679
sequencing approaches so this the the

705
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:50,679
reverton so Andross with the stop one

706
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:53,239
mutant and in in the F2 population so

707
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:56,159
for the long route was the uh short

708
00:41:53,239 --> 00:42:00,279
route and exra DNA make Library

709
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:02,838
sequencing n and sequencing and can find

710
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:06,599
the U putative

711
00:42:02,838 --> 00:42:09,920
snip to uh associate with the different

712
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:13,760
phenotype and the last step would be uh

713
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:17,519
verif verify the uh if that's really the

714
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:21,920
positive snip so here's the the the

715
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:25,920
result the W type and uh the hyper

716
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:28,039
sensitive of stop one and root growth at

717
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,960
the low ph

718
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:32,599
and this the uh the

719
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:35,280
revertant so and so we know this Gene

720
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:38,359
and then we can order U the tdna

721
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:42,640
insertion line on this uh for this Gene

722
00:42:38,358 --> 00:42:48,239
and actually uh the TDN is not sensitive

723
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:51,719
to um to low PH stress so what if we

724
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:54,519
incorporate the tdna the dis mutant into

725
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:57,759
the uh stub one background could we see

726
00:42:54,519 --> 00:43:01,920
any reverting phenotype as the uh the

727
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:04,079
EMS M mutant mutation yeah actually it

728
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:08,960
is I mean there's almost no difference

729
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:12,559
between uh the EMS generated mutant and

730
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:15,280
the tdna uh insertion mutant in the St

731
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:19,079
one background so pretty much we think

732
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,079
we we uh find out this

733
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:26,440
G and finally that's uh the last slide

734
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:30,559
and I would like first thank Leah yeah

735
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:35,358
that's I mean I can express more my uh

736
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:38,839
opeation for him so first uh I work with

737
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:42,358
as a poster as he uh mentioned and also

738
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:46,558
he had me as a uh s and work on this

739
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:49,159
project I mean we have 10 years work uh

740
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:52,280
experience but I'm sorry he's living but

741
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:54,358
I think we are still um collaborate I

742
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:57,720
mean close uh collaborate in the F

743
00:43:54,358 --> 00:44:00,920
future and here's the work I mean uh

744
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:03,679
the the member in the group that work uh

745
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:07,559
in this project I'm sorry I cannot uh

746
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:11,679
present all of their work and also Jang

747
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:16,000
and Arif uh his um and also thanks for

748
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:18,318
the collaborator and the F founding

749
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,400
agency

750
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:25,039
and and also uh I can so this the

751
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:30,880
Michael he work for the uh most of the

752
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:35,400
protein part of work and Y uh he led the

753
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:39,519
uh nip 1-2 project and fan is a two-year

754
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:42,440
visiting uh graduate student from

755
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:44,838
Chinese Academy of Science so so he's

756
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:48,480
living I mean in the summer but he let

757
00:44:44,838 --> 00:44:50,920
the uh the stop one reverting project so

758
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,119
it's very amazing yeah only two years

759
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:55,500
yeah yeah thank you for your attention

760
00:44:53,119 --> 00:45:00,480
so I would like to answer questions

761
00:44:55,500 --> 00:45:04,440
[Applause]

762
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:06,240
is there uh any indication that um that

763
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,559
there's any sort of signal from the

764
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:11,598
shoot coming back down to

765
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:16,200
the uh that's a tough question yeah we

766
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:18,640
we haven't looking that yeah yeah um no

767
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:24,318
I I don't know that yeah yeah could be

768
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:28,519
but mainly I mean the um the toxicity of

769
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:31,759
aluminum is maybe Target at the

770
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:34,719
Ro region actually Shield is much much

771
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:37,720
less sensitive to to aluminous ja and

772
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:40,759
some and I know some of the pl species

773
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:44,279
like uh the aluminum accumulator like

774
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:46,720
tea like baky they actually like uh acid

775
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,720
soil they grew better in in the acid

776
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:51,959
soil environment what they did is like

777
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:55,838
uh upate large amount of

778
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:59,960
Alum uh from the soil and then

779
00:45:55,838 --> 00:46:04,440
translocated into the shoe like uh the

780
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:07,559
VAC of shoe tissues so I I don't I think

781
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:10,358
I don't know how this shoes signal can

782
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:12,839
coming back to yeah probably more

783
00:46:10,358 --> 00:46:16,759
important for for the root than Sho yeah

784
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:19,480
knowing your your field of research um

785
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:22,960
thinking not just signal but photosynthe

786
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:24,400
for the situ organic acid releasing

787
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,039
we've always wondered if you know you

788
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:30,200
get more photosyn going to those roots I

789
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:34,000
think we can finally look at that

790
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:36,960
um I where I'm going to have we can C1

791
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,480
label plants have aiss tography so we

792
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,960
can image the carbon coming

793
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,679
photosynthetic going to the roots at the

794
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,639
same time we can image you know roots

795
00:46:42,679 --> 00:46:47,239
and challenge them aluminum and see if

796
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:49,358
that or say just a specific room see if

797
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:51,118
that CH that you see because I've always

798
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:53,039
wondered is that going to turn on lot of

799
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,400
signal but photosynthate coming down

800
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:57,558
there so because you are losing although

801
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,440
the plant as you said

802
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:01,319
minimize how much it loses by having it

803
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,039
just in that little area so but it's

804
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:06,079
something we're going be able to look at

805
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:07,759
how much is it I me what what what what

806
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,720
amount of carbon is being exported into

807
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:14,440
the soil do you have any

808
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:17,159
idea um so we haven't I don't know if

809
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:21,880
you have any quantification but uh

810
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:23,759
actually we we saw indirectly yeah uh

811
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,599
the carbon loss

812
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:29,640
actually affect R growth yeah because we

813
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:32,760
have the over expression line or the uh

814
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:35,639
melee or C release and without Al

815
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:40,000
luminant so the growth actually is not

816
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:42,920
as good as the uh nonch genic line

817
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,199
suggest uh it has some NE yeah

818
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,519
definitely has a negative impact on the

819
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:49,799
gluc

820
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:51,599
so fact varies from spe to spe sorum

821
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,480
seems to be really localized rabbit op

822
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:55,599
seems to be more spread out so like us

823
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:58,000
rabbit opsis overexpresses these

824
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,480
Transporters without it's still release

825
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,719
a mod they don't grow as well well it's

826
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,719
depend on sink strength

827
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,480
and you know I think the biggest the

828
00:48:06,199 --> 00:48:11,318
most dramatic I don't needan to you know

829
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,960
example of this though is the lubens

830
00:48:11,318 --> 00:48:15,880
under efficiency in the in the hairy

831
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,599
Roots they can release 30% of the carbon

832
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,400
citrate but that's not a crop plant

833
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:21,680
though you know it's a it's just

834
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:25,838
survival shut

835
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:28,118
up so this might be a silic question but

836
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:30,519
does the when PL roads in acidic

837
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:33,079
conditions does the pH of the epidermal

838
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:34,759
cells in the root change does it drop do

839
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:36,920
epidermal you mean oh yeah I mean the

840
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,760
morphology does lots of morphological

841
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:42,559
Chang not the morphology but the PH does

842
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:44,160
it all when you're releasing the citate

843
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:47,079
yeah I mean that's that's a tough

844
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:49,798
question so we really wondering what

845
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:55,039
what's the pH what's the form of

846
00:48:49,798 --> 00:48:58,719
aluminum being transport uh from so to

847
00:48:55,039 --> 00:49:02,279
uh cyos definitely I the aluminum effect

848
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:04,078
has to be uh at the low PH that but we

849
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,760
don't know I mean the probably the micro

850
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:11,160
environment could be very different so

851
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:12,520
here as to um the idal C so it would

852
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:14,078
seem like the interface of the membrane

853
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:16,199
would have to be acidified for the

854
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,440
effect to

855
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:20,558
happen think about

856
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:23,599
your acid

857
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:29,720
chemistry you got that citrate sit a pH

858
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:32,880
7.4 C so it's actually least is the

859
00:49:29,719 --> 00:49:35,759
Bas on the outside but once it comes out

860
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,039
it's if anything's going to bind yeah

861
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,920
yeah see this is something I yelled at

862
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:42,679
marshner about in his text actually I

863
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:44,280
have a book autograph from Leon remember

864
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:45,879
none of us are right all the time or

865
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,920
something like that because he says

866
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:50,079
organic acid release acidifies and it

867
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,400
doesn't because you're not releasing the

868
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,720
acid you're releasing the base it's

869
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:56,119
already lost its protons in the

870
00:49:53,719 --> 00:49:58,519
cytoplasm anything might raise them by

871
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:00,880
releasing the protons in the cytoplasm

872
00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:03,039
de cify the that region of the cytoplasm

873
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,039
you

874
00:50:10,798 --> 00:50:17,679
think some seem to prefer a set of pH

875
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:19,318
like blueberries um do you think they

876
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:22,239
use the same

877
00:50:19,318 --> 00:50:25,759
mechanisms the blueberry for they prefer

878
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:27,879
low low PH oh I didn't could be I mean

879
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,000
some of the um

880
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:34,079
yeah aluminum could have some beneficial

881
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:36,519
effect I I read some paper

882
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:40,039
yeah don't

883
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:44,838
anybody T too t yeah t yeah that's also

884
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:48,159
I I that the um aluminum accumulation in

885
00:50:44,838 --> 00:50:50,599
tea mostly in the old V so you buy tea

886
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:50,598
by good

887
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:56,480
quality that might explain some of the

888
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,480
behavior of the British

889
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:07,159
that actually

890
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:07,159
concern scare about

891
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:16,039
that I know a lot of the tea in China

892
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:16,039
like gr around University that's

893
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:20,719
yeah that's green tea so it's the fresh

894
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:25,880
the young green tea yeah I mean the

895
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:25,879
younger they actually less

896
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:32,558
any other

897
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,559
questions join me in

898
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:41,000
thaning this has been a production of

899
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:44,000
Cornell University on the web at

900
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
