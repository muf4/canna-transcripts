1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:10,080
University well thank you all for coming

3
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:11,798
to the seminar today and thanks for the

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,039
invitation from plant biology to come

5
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:15,399
here um this is really cool for me you

6
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:17,799
know we T at Michigan State we talk a

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,039
lot about Cornell and I see at least one

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,399
Go Green uh uh there we love sending our

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,840
students uh to you guys and we also love

10
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:26,278
talking about you guys because you know

11
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:28,359
we we try to Benchmark a lot of our

12
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:30,960
programs a lot of our faculty are

13
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:33,559
Cornell grads and we uh hopefully we

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,160
send uh a good number of of students

15
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:38,078
your way and vice versa um in the bread

16
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,519
of Sciences plant Sciences here at

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,200
Cornell is very much within my comfort

18
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,719
zone uh similar to MSU we have about 180

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,079
faculty that work on plants at MSU so

20
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,480
quite similar we run the breath from

21
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,840
genes and genomes all the way to food

22
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:54,558
security food safety and and production

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,879
so again very similar this is um a new

24
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:57,198
building just for those of you who

25
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:59,119
haven't been to MSU in a while so the

26
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:02,320
idea for this building this is a kind of

27
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,558
a translational Hub um and you'll look

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,478
at my research that I'm going to talk

29
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:06,879
about today maybe the stuff I talked

30
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:08,200
with Chris smart about is more

31
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:09,599
translational of the stuff I'll talk

32
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,320
about today you'll say how did you get

33
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:15,879
in there uh so I share a lab with

34
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:18,359
shinyang he he's uh one of Allen's uh

35
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:20,319
proteges uh and Greg how who works on

36
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,519
insect interactions but Kristoff Benning

37
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,599
Dean delapena and the idea is that this

38
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:26,000
building bridges the gap between the

39
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:27,319
crop and soil Sciences the plant and

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,920
soil sciences and the fundamental

41
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:31,639
research and plant biology uh so this is

42
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,759
just some of the new things that we are

43
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,319
are doing here so in large part what I'm

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,519
going to talk about today is framed by

45
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,239
the history my training as a as a postto

46
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:42,438
and then as a graduate student or excuse

47
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:45,519
me as a postdoc and Brian sasat lab and

48
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:47,879
then as an early uh assistant professor

49
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:51,078
and in large part when I arrived at MSU

50
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:53,078
you know I was convinced that our genes

51
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:54,639
and affector genes were going to solve

52
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:56,599
all of the world's problems and you know

53
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,399
we just find those Magic Bullets and so

54
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:01,038
we did a lot of really deep drills on

55
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,599
understanding the basic mechanisms of

56
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:05,560
how plants and pathogens communicate and

57
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,478
in large part these are great tractable

58
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,959
systems and I'm going to talk about one

59
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:12,239
or two of these uh today in my talk but

60
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,000
resistance genes from Plants recognized

61
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,280
by specific Avance genes or broadly

62
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,878
affector proteins and pathogens and it's

63
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,318
this interaction and the function of

64
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:23,359
other auxiliary proteins chaperon Etc

65
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:24,919
that give yield to species level

66
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,440
interactions in Host range and

67
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:29,479
resistance ultimately and one of these

68
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,840
as I started working in Brian's lab you

69
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:33,359
know we had this kind of General diagram

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,439
this bifurcation here that once a

71
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,319
pathogen is recognized it signals

72
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:40,959
through one of two broad Pathways one is

73
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:43,359
eds1 which Jane Parker's group has

74
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,360
really uh done a remarkable job in

75
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,680
defining the processes that function

76
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,599
through this pathway uh and a number of

77
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,519
other labs uh also in this pathway Jin

78
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:55,719
for example my research initiated by

79
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,920
working on a protein called ndr1 and

80
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:00,479
ndr1 is required for the activity of a

81
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,719
specific class of ccnb LR R Class of

82
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,560
proteins and like any genetic screen

83
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,479
death is a great and easy phenotype to

84
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,199
identify so ndr1 was one of it's kind of

85
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:11,479
our newe Mouse model you just look at

86
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,039
and still it's the bane of my graduate

87
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:14,959
students some that work on this their

88
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:17,560
existence you look at this plant it just

89
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,640
gets sick uh and we're working towards

90
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,719
understanding and defining what role

91
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:23,958
ind1 plays in broader immunity but to do

92
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:25,639
that we've really taken a different

93
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:27,759
approach and and ask what is the

94
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:29,919
function of ind1 in the absence of a

95
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,120
pathogen and I think that is really

96
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,318
power of using affector proteins in this

97
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,360
day and age with uh genome sequencing

98
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,158
and transcriptome Analysis and really

99
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,920
the ability to easily collect the

100
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,798
diversity of pathogen isolates in their

101
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:45,598
hosts from uh all over the world is

102
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,959
understanding how did critical proteins

103
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,438
these auxiliary proteins or these

104
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:53,158
resistance and a avalance proteins

105
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:56,598
evolve uh from a basil function a

106
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:58,639
physiological function um and to do that

107
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:00,438
you know six seven years ago you had to

108
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,158
really use a rabid opsis and I made a

109
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:04,799
comment last night at dinner uh and I

110
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:06,280
think the chair of plant biology made a

111
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,920
comment about model systems you know the

112
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,079
model systems are great a Rabbid Ops is

113
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,238
a great model now in this day and age if

114
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,239
you've got a you know an alumin high

115
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,799
seek or even a my seek you've got a

116
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,560
model system you just set your plant

117
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,840
next to it sequence it and it becomes a

118
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,639
model system so one of the scariest

119
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,359
realizations that I had in talking with

120
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:24,918
shinyang a few years ago I said shingy

121
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,439
Yang do you know how many people work on

122
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:30,758
a Rabbid opsis in MSU and there actually

123
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,639
nine of us uh nine out of The 100 80 and

124
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:34,600
many of the people you know now are

125
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,918
working on you know potatoes are really

126
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,680
important uh field of study at MSU

127
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:42,839
tomato uh I do some work in cucumber but

128
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,720
all of these systems have quickly become

129
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,758
model systems um and are and in more you

130
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,199
know more importantly I think they're

131
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,840
just they're important ecosystems to

132
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,439
understand uh they're important for food

133
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,959
security and ultimately for food Health

134
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:58,360
Now using affector proteins I'm

135
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,839
obligated to show this slide so I

136
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,840
apologize in advance I have to show

137
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:04,279
slide like this uh but this will be the

138
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,758
last and only one uh using these

139
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:09,879
affector proteins we can probe immune

140
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:12,319
systems uh we can probe you know human

141
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:14,639
human systems uh far fewer factors in

142
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,038
human cells but they can use these to

143
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,038
define the physiological processes that

144
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,599
not only regulate immunity but they can

145
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,519
really Define the regulation of these

146
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,639
and the absence of pathogens and we do

147
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:26,599
the same types of things with uh plant

148
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,600
pathogens so you know you've got ubiquit

149
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,479
ination processes avrpto is one of the

150
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,800
you who don't know

151
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:35,399
avrpto maybe this a seminar down the

152
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,840
hall that you should be going into you

153
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:39,159
know Greg Martin Allen coler's Group

154
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,279
they really you know you know all of the

155
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,720
dc3000 affectors but the point of this

156
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:46,839
slide is really just to illustrate the

157
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,160
breadth of targeting and the bre the

158
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:51,038
processes that are involved in immunity

159
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,319
immunity is not just R genes it's not

160
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,800
just a veilance genes and so what my lab

161
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,199
is done is we've taken a step back and

162
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,319
said let's forget about the r genes

163
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:01,000
they're great they're tractable systems

164
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,879
but let's focus on the phys iology so

165
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,800
what my lab has been focusing on is a

166
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:08,399
couple of things one is because we are a

167
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,840
land grant University in Michigan State

168
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:13,598
um and there are a number of crops uh we

169
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,758
started working on using a functional

170
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:19,199
genomics approach to understand cucumber

171
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,038
Downy M interactions so uh and this is

172
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,439
used to I used to giggle a little bit

173
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:24,918
when I'd say this but you know if you

174
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:26,598
eat a pickle east of Denver Colorado

175
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:28,680
that pickle came from Michigan we're the

176
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:30,439
number one producer pickles so at a

177
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,319
Langer University when you've got these

178
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:34,639
Partnerships with Industries it's quite

179
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,400
easy to get industry funding to work on

180
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,519
an important problem and so we started

181
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,879
working on this but we totally you know

182
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:42,198
we took the the really the genan jockey

183
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,560
based approach we took it out of the

184
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:46,000
field we started developing the

185
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,360
resources so that we could deploy these

186
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,918
and we've you know we've made some

187
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,720
Market progress in this area uh one

188
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,879
recent paper I want to just point out

189
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,520
just came out a few months ago a week

190
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:58,839
ago uh is on a genome wi survey of

191
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:00,560
alternative splicing and so this really

192
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:02,119
kind of is represents a new area of

193
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,000
interest in my lab is asking how

194
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,519
pathogens can

195
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,918
reprogram um their host and in turn how

196
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:13,079
a host can respond at a transcriptional

197
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:15,000
level to develop and evolve uh

198
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,839
resistance responses and in turn the

199
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,240
pathogen can involve uh virulence

200
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,000
responses uh so we also work on

201
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,598
obviously plant pathogen interactions

202
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,598
and I don't know if it was uh Allan that

203
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:28,319
has has said this to me before but nr1

204
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:31,000
is really kind of an enigma and a black

205
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,319
box we don't know what this protein does

206
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,439
and I'm going to show a picture here I

207
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,598
think we've got at least a a snarky idea

208
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:39,598
of what it does uh and then what I'm

209
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:41,759
going to talk largely about today is uh

210
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,800
the function of actin cytoskeleton and

211
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,319
actin is as I'll mentioned is broadly

212
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,520
required for a number of host processes

213
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,800
and it is targeted by pathogens in both

214
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:52,719
plants and animals but the real key of

215
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,280
understanding and really kind of

216
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,440
bolstering my interest in focusing and

217
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:59,519
Shifting the focus of the lab to actin

218
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,038
was an observation that we made while

219
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,639
working on ind1 and we said well let's

220
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,800
see what the ACT inside a skeleton looks

221
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,720
like and it actually you know this is

222
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,000
evidence that my graduate students will

223
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,520
agree nr1 is absolute evil uh it looks

224
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,079
like for those of you who are not

225
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:17,758
absolute nerds uh this is from um uh a

226
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:19,959
popular movie uh I won't I won't uh

227
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,360
illustrate my nerdom here but you know

228
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,719
this is this is what the Acton side a

229
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,598
skeleton looks like in an indr one

230
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,000
mutant this is a wild type Colombia

231
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:28,199
status so this is going to be kind of

232
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,158
the focus of my talk today is kind of

233
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,399
defining how immunity regulates aidos

234
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:35,519
skeleton Dynamics and how pathogens have

235
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,759
evolved to Target this process so today

236
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,440
I'm going to give you just a brief

237
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:42,399
introduction to the a act and pathogen

238
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,919
connection uh I'm going to talk just a

239
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,080
couple of slides about some publish work

240
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,559
but most of what I'm going to show is uh

241
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,720
some new and unpublished data so I'd

242
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:52,359
welcome comments and and uh

243
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,959
opportunities to kind of you know

244
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,519
entertain the idea of Brad you're crazy

245
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:57,639
or oh wow this is really neat uh I'm

246
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,360
going to talk a little bit about

247
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:02,559
effector targeting and we've done a

248
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,800
genetic screen uh and with help from uh

249
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:07,239
a postto in Brian and shingy Yang's lab

250
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,799
Brian Kitco who was a a graduate student

251
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,879
with Allen uh and we've identified two

252
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,879
factors that specifically Target the

253
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:16,399
actin cytoskeleton with opposing

254
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:18,480
activities uh much like what's uh

255
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,679
observed in salmonella interactions with

256
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,800
mamons and then finally down to the

257
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:24,838
regulation of this process and this will

258
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,679
get us into another effector protein

259
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,600
that specifically targets a calcium

260
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:31,278
dependent protein chise so again what

261
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,320
we're what I'm going to show here is

262
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,559
largely grounded in the unifying theme

263
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,760
of quantitative Imaging at the P plant

264
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:40,119
pathogen interface and and some U

265
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,039
techniques so broadly the actin side a

266
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,679
skeleton is is really it's cool I mean

267
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:46,199
that's what the cover of our journals

268
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,120
you know are sometimes littered with uh

269
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,399
they just these really sexy pictures of

270
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,399
of tricomes and the ACT CTO skeleton is

271
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:55,159
involved in determining cell shape it's

272
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,440
involved in movement it's involved in

273
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:59,639
processes such as gene expression uh

274
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,760
growth pollen tube development uh

275
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:03,919
stomata open and closing not only during

276
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,600
pathogen infection but during the dial

277
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:09,319
Cycles uh and work from Y and stugard

278
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,240
this was about seven or eight years ago

279
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,120
really one of the first images these are

280
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,560
static images that showed that the Acton

281
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,919
cytoskeleton was uh uh they could

282
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,799
somewhat quantitatively assess the

283
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:23,159
rearrangement of the actan cytoskeleton

284
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,879
in response to a microbial infection so

285
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:26,879
this is a rium this is a a Lotus

286
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,838
japonicus root here and you can see that

287
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,039
during the infection process you go from

288
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:33,360
these transverse Arrangements of the

289
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,919
atinos skeleton more towards these

290
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,680
longitudinal uh processes and in large

291
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:39,240
part that mediates the growth the

292
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,159
orientation the development of the root

293
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,480
hair which ultimately become lead to

294
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:47,078
nodu formation so as a platform for

295
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,560
pathogens uh arguably some of the best

296
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:53,479
work has come from the work of of leria

297
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:55,439
and uh other pathogens uh urenia pesus

298
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,120
for example which demonstrate a couple

299
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,160
of mechanisms so in urenia pesus the

300
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,320
pathogen targets AC inos skeleton

301
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,639
somewhat indirectly by shutting down

302
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,360
phagocytosis L leria I think this is

303
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,639
just really cool leria actually uh

304
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,800
expresses actin binding proteins actin

305
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:14,240
polymerizing binding proteins on its

306
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:16,120
self Surface and can actually usurp the

307
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,360
actin SOS skeleton of its host and

308
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,159
create these actin Rockets which it uses

309
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,278
to propel uh through the cell and I I

310
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:26,879
you know it's just fascinating on plant

311
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:29,278
pathogens little bit less uh exciting

312
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,958
less uh cool looking pictures but

313
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,720
nonetheless the actan cytoskeleton has

314
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,199
been demonstrated so work from Ralph

315
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,079
puga's group so that you can get rapid

316
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,959
reorganization of the actan cyto

317
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:41,679
skeleton to the site of penetration uh

318
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:43,278
and it's believed that this is not only

319
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,359
as part of the callous deposition

320
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:47,519
response but could also be involved in

321
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,680
trafficking not only proteins but

322
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,240
organel to the site of of infection so

323
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:54,919
you can think about this kind of like

324
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,680
the fort that's being attacked uh by the

325
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:58,799
GU bad guys who are under the control of

326
00:11:56,679 --> 00:12:00,719
the eye of Sauron uh right you're going

327
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,639
to reinforce your front door reinforce

328
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,200
your wall and you need to bring all of

329
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:08,720
your resources there uh in pamon singi

330
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,240
not a lot is known about this we've

331
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,959
published you know half a dozen or so

332
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,919
papers and some in collaboration with

333
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:17,799
Chris Tiger's lab to actually ask how

334
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:19,919
does pomonis singi manipulate host actin

335
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:21,838
a skeleton and remember that pomonis

336
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,599
remains extracellular during its

337
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,680
infection process so the logical

338
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,800
explanation is it must be doing this

339
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,120
either one through secretion of a toxin

340
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:32,799
or manipulation of some sort of

341
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,000
extracellular Matrix uh component or

342
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,679
through effectors and so we kind of took

343
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,039
a little bit of approach and asked well

344
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:40,879
is there a PTI component is there a

345
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,399
cellular extracellular component such as

346
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:46,759
felin that manipulates actin but is

347
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:50,240
there also a secreted component uh that

348
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:53,159
uh can manipulate actin so how do we do

349
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,720
this the static images are great uh but

350
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:56,399
you I made a comment this morning that

351
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,639
microscopy is one of these things that

352
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,000
to be honest you can see what you want

353
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:01,360
to see you can look through the

354
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,958
microscope and say oh wow there is some

355
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,879
different looking stuff there and I'm

356
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,479
going to snap that image and do it 5 10

357
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,039
times and you're

358
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,159
done we really wanted to step away from

359
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:14,039
that and to assign um really let the

360
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:16,159
computer do this for us so what we did

361
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:18,159
was we collaborated uh initially with

362
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,919
Chris stiger at Purdue uh who had

363
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,519
developed the turf microscopy based

364
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,639
method and adapted it for plant

365
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:27,240
pathogens to monitor act in side a

366
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,278
skeleton so as a as an organ you know as

367
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,879
a structure the act in skeleton is

368
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,198
really Dynamic it undergos this

369
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:34,720
continuous cycle of phosphorilation or

370
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:36,919
excuse me of depolymerization and

371
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,959
polymerization and this is a very rapid

372
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:41,240
this is even slowed down you know these

373
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,838
these filaments will grow at uh

374
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,360
micrometers per second uh and and

375
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,199
they're redistributed and they're

376
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,159
redistributed in a stimulus dependent

377
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:51,278
manner we still don't know the end

378
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:53,399
points how an actin filament may be

379
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:56,039
anchored to one portion of the cell or

380
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,519
not but what we did was we we said well

381
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:59,159
let's let's see if we can use this

382
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,078
method of monitoring this Turf

383
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:03,278
microscopy which stands for total

384
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:06,359
internal reflective fluorescence

385
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,879
microscopy and uh take angle of

386
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,240
incidence measurements of the actan

387
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:13,039
cytoskeleton during infection and just

388
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,519
our first simplest observation here uh

389
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,240
you can see that there are striking I'll

390
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,000
show you even more striking images when

391
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,399
you inoculate a plant expressing um

392
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,879
tagged or marked with gfp for the atinos

393
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:26,679
skeleton you can see a mixture of of

394
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:28,399
dense arrays of of of filaments these

395
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:29,599
are just fine filamental structures and

396
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,679
then you can see these periodic

397
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,278
alignment of these uh of of bundled uh

398
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:36,120
microfilaments but when you inoculate it

399
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:39,759
with a veent strain you can see The

400
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,839
Disappearance of these U of this dense

401
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:45,240
bundle array and most of it goes into

402
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,440
these uh highly uh arranged uh bundles

403
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,879
of actin

404
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,839
filaments I'll I'll ask this question

405
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:53,480
now and then I'll ask it again later we

406
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:55,480
still don't know though is this a cause

407
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,759
and effect is this a part of the defense

408
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,560
response or is this part of the veilance

409
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,320
mechanism and and so this is where a lot

410
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:03,119
of our our work using some of the

411
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,120
strains that we got from Allen's lab has

412
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,519
come in really handy to enable us to

413
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,480
really ask the question are we looking

414
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:11,639
at a veilance question here or we

415
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,600
looking at a host uh immune question and

416
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:16,680
a lot of this started with work uh from

417
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,199
a former um postto in the lab and this

418
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:21,239
is one of these uh dreams that I wish

419
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:23,519
upon any young assistant professor is

420
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,320
that I got kind of like the best post

421
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,000
ever uh she was a gradu St in sophan

422
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,639
Kimo's lab and then she was a post here

423
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,039
in in Dan Classic's lab and her husband

424
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,759
had a job at Michigan so it was one of

425
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:35,799
these things okay well let's go to

426
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,360
Michigan State and she just came in and

427
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:39,958
and published three papers in like three

428
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,720
years and did a great uh great job and

429
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:44,399
then ultimately came back to um Dan's

430
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,720
lab two more years and now she's got the

431
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,078
dream job in Hawaii so uh there are

432
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,079
still jobs out there you may have to

433
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:52,638
move to Hawaii to get them but uh you

434
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:55,599
know that's just for all you young

435
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,278
people uh so meing did a screen so we

436
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,360
got the idea said well let's think about

437
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,278
acting and she said well let's look at

438
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,759
what's known about actin in the Maman

439
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:07,159
systems and urenia pesus secretes a

440
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,120
suite of five or six yops and these yops

441
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:11,318
stands for urenia outer protein they're

442
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,120
affector secreted affector proteins and

443
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:17,240
they target uh Rog gtpases and they shut

444
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,759
down actin so is there anything in

445
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:23,159
pseudomona stringy that might uh be

446
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:25,839
similar to uh yops and so uh she

447
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:29,838
screened uh what was at the time some of

448
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,680
the available sock lines uh available um

449
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,240
from the uh resource center and screened

450
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,000
it against uh all of these Pon stringy

451
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,839
expressing effectors here's ndr1 over

452
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,720
here kind of our nude Mouse model

453
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,680
control sick in all cases and what she

454
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:47,759
identified was uh in this adf4 mutant

455
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:49,919
AVR pphb was uh led to a susceptible

456
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,879
interaction so really nice quick easy

457
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,198
genetic screen from there we moved on

458
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:56,600
and really characterized uh that was all

459
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:58,198
published six years ago now uh we've

460
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,920
been focusing a little bit more on AC

461
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:04,480
and dimerization factors uh in a rabid

462
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:07,078
opsis there are 11 of these U acting

463
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,000
depolymerization factors many more in

464
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:11,279
Plants than there are in humans many

465
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,199
more act in isoforms in Plants than

466
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:17,000
there are in humans so we've kind of

467
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,519
developing this idea is that is actin uh

468
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,480
because of the number of isoforms is it

469
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:23,439
highly specialized in Plants does actin

470
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,599
7 for example perform an immune role in

471
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,839
plants and humans they only two Acton

472
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:31,639
isoforms plants like I said have about

473
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:34,399
12 are expressed uh adfs in general they

474
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,080
bind filamentous F actin uh they break

475
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,559
it in half they sever it and then they

476
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:41,240
deize it into monomeric G actin and uh

477
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:43,720
so we focused on this we wrote a a

478
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,798
proposal with Chris tiger and Jeff Chang

479
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,400
and it was funded and the basic idea of

480
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:49,160
this proposal was we were going to poke

481
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,960
every acum binding protein in a rabid

482
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,640
opsis against pseudomona stringi and

483
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,000
then rep pooke it again against all of

484
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,559
the affector proteins and so it comes

485
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,640
out to about a combination of 2100 or so

486
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,359
pokes that we were going to make and the

487
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,640
basic idea was to understand not only

488
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:06,798
the immune function but the regulation

489
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,400
of this process so faactin is

490
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:11,519
depolymerized by adfs broken down it's

491
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,559
recharged by a capping protein ATP

492
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:16,400
loaded becomes a substrate for profilin

493
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:19,639
and it's added on to the minus end here

494
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,400
so it's this repetitive continuous cycle

495
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,200
and we had begun screening some of these

496
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,240
for phenotypes and we had found that if

497
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,240
we start to perturb this cycle if we

498
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,960
kind of speed it up or slow it down we

499
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,200
could speed it up potentially by

500
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,159
knocking out an ADF protein so then you

501
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,960
don't have as many substrates acting

502
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:37,720
upon your F actin so you slow down the

503
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,640
conversion from F to G or we could speed

504
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,600
it up by overexpressing actin uh and

505
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,159
just increasing the actin pool one

506
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:47,399
important point is in Plants only 5% of

507
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:50,080
actin is polymerized in humans it's

508
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,759
about 95% so plants have this huge

509
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:54,678
reservoir of unpolymerized actin and

510
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:56,798
from a biochemical standpoint you could

511
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:58,880
hypothesize that this uh would support

512
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:01,079
explosive rates of polymerization right

513
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,480
you highly regulate this population and

514
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:05,279
when you need it you thrust it into the

515
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,519
the cycle here through the activity of

516
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,440
profin and so that's why you can see you

517
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,200
know these Dynamic polymerization and

518
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,320
Rapid depolymerization processes I

519
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,120
showed you a few slides ago so we got

520
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,759
the grant we followed this up quite

521
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:20,158
quickly and followed up me Ying's work

522
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:22,400
by showing that adf4 is required for

523
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,720
affector triggered immunity uh me Ying

524
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,000
had already demonstrated that but we

525
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,720
really wanted to ask what is the

526
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,679
mechanism and so what we identified is

527
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,600
that ADF is actually required for the

528
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,759
expression of

529
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:37,879
rps5 and again all of this was published

530
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:40,798
a few years ago uh phosphorilation is

531
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:43,720
highly diminished in an adf4 mutant in

532
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:46,240
the in the presence of the affector AVR

533
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,798
pphb I'll apologize for all the alphabet

534
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,200
soup for those of you that aren't used

535
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:53,558
to it so AVR pphb appears to at least

536
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,279
Target map kind signaling in the ad in

537
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:57,678
an adf4 dependent

538
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,399
Manner and kind of just some of the

539
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,200
simple bi ology here really

540
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,200
demonstrating that phosphorilation and

541
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,880
the activity of adf4 is phosphoregulated

542
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,200
adf4 phosphorilation leads to a

543
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,200
disassociation from actin you know

544
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,440
that's just the basic concept of you

545
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,360
know it's kind of like doing a kinas

546
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,759
assay to demonstrate that a kinas is a

547
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:19,399
cyas uh this just demonstrates that an

548
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:21,000
ADF is an ADF because it binds actin and

549
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,919
it's phosphor regulated but this

550
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,359
phosphor regulation is also has an

551
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:28,480
immune function uh demonstrating that

552
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:31,158
when adf4 is UN phosphor relatable uh

553
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,599
the plants are sick and this is also uh

554
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:34,880
revealed by the induction of the

555
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:38,759
hypersensitive response so in a wild

556
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,360
type plant AVR pphb induces HR when adf4

557
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:43,119
cannot be phosphorated you don't get an

558
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:45,279
HR and that ultimately leads to disease

559
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,599
so that really got us into kind of the

560
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:49,359
first deep drill and I'll talk in a few

561
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,519
slides about how we're furthering this

562
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:55,119
so the important take-home here is that

563
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:58,119
adf4 is regulated by a kinas and this

564
00:20:55,119 --> 00:21:02,158
kinas appears to be Associated through

565
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:03,319
some veilance activity of Av pphb and in

566
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,480
a few slides I'm going to show you what

567
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:07,599
that kinas is and and and hopefully

568
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,880
provide some evidence that uh there is a

569
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,678
specific interaction the next year we

570
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,600
published that there was actually uh

571
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,919
adf4 response to pamps this was work uh

572
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:17,359
uh we collaborated with Chris Tiger's

573
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,600
lab on and showed that there are

574
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,599
actually two responses in in plants in

575
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,759
response to pathogen infection there's a

576
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:25,839
very early response that occurs between

577
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:28,278
1 and 3 hours where you get this burst

578
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:31,038
of act and filament organization and

579
00:21:28,278 --> 00:21:35,000
this is was largely attributed uh to the

580
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:37,158
activity of uh felin and kiten and ef2

581
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,240
other pathogen Associated molecular

582
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:40,919
patterns and then this later response

583
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,720
that I'm going to show a little bit more

584
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,600
in detail some more unpublished data

585
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,519
that occurs around 24 to 30 hours and

586
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,038
this later response so we really you

587
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,000
know we've got this temporal separation

588
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:54,038
which worked out well for us we can look

589
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,679
at early events that we can genetically

590
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:58,720
determine and Define as being associated

591
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:00,080
with the function and activity of pamp

592
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,600
recognition so we've got all these

593
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,399
mutants you can knock out the plants and

594
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:06,119
if you you can knock out this early

595
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,600
response and then the big question

596
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:11,479
though was is what are what is the

597
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:14,319
pathogen doing to prevent this so let me

598
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:17,360
back up this early response we believe

599
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:19,119
is immune related we believe that this

600
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:20,639
early response obviously is required

601
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:22,479
we've done all the growth curves this

602
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,960
early response is is kind of priming the

603
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,038
immune system it is the kind of the deep

604
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,640
breath the plant takes when the pathogen

605
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:32,079
first initiates it's infection and then

606
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,038
this later response we believe is a

607
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:37,119
virulence response it's a virulence

608
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:39,558
mechanism this is this lag period is the

609
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,798
plant and pathogen first shake hands

610
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:42,319
then they do this little dance for a

611
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,079
while and then if the pathogen is going

612
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:47,519
to win it's going to come back in with

613
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:49,278
affector proteins and further change the

614
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:52,720
Acton cytoskeleton actually change it in

615
00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:54,480
an opposite way so this is uh a bundling

616
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,079
resp or density response so act the

617
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,599
plant starts making a lot of actin at

618
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:00,720
this early response again in this kind

619
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:03,038
of deep breath and then at this later

620
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,960
response the pathogen comes in and just

621
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:06,879
bundles it bundles the actin cyto

622
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,880
skeleton and what that does is that

623
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,679
diminishes the plant response the plant

624
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,320
ability to have this Dynamic structure

625
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,600
that's involved in immunity so the

626
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:17,359
question was are there pamon stringy

627
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:20,319
factors that dampen or stimulate changes

628
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:22,678
in the otin and can we identify these

629
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:24,639
and and do they you know ultimately just

630
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:28,519
by definition are these effectors

631
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:31,840
functioning to block PTI responses and

632
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:33,200
is it an act and based PTI response so

633
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:37,038
to address this we really started

634
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,319
getting into really fine details and we

635
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:40,440
asked the question okay we've got to

636
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:43,359
develop a new system of how to measure

637
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,440
changes in actin a really highly

638
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,959
quantitative highly unguided we didn't

639
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,759
want to be looking at images we didn't

640
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,278
want to be looking at 900 images uh

641
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:53,720
which is what some of these so for each

642
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:57,319
one of these experiments we collect

643
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:59,200
about 900 images of each uh time point

644
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:01,079
of each data a point and then we feed

645
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,720
them into a computer and the computer

646
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:04,879
tells us yes this is significant but we

647
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,720
collaborated with a group at the

648
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,320
University of Tokyo that took it one

649
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,919
step further and they actually developed

650
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:14,000
an algorithm that could identify within

651
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:17,320
this population of act and within a

652
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,880
single cell four different

653
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:22,200
organizationally distinct actin

654
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,039
structures so you got filamentous you've

655
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,080
got longitudinally bundled you've got

656
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:28,919
radial bundled and then you've got this

657
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:30,278
dense microarray and they could develop

658
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:32,440
they developed an algorithm that could

659
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:34,960
go in we take all of these images we

660
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,278
feed them into image J do a a

661
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,000
hierarchical clustering and basically it

662
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:41,839
spits out these four classifications so

663
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,919
with this what we started asking and I'm

664
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:45,278
just going to show you one slide to show

665
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:46,640
you where we're taking this is you know

666
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:50,000
can we can we

667
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,799
use you know physiology and and compare

668
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,480
that to immunity so we all know that

669
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:57,798
stata open and close uh during the dial

670
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,240
cycle and you know to the untrained eye

671
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:03,000
an open stomata looks the same uh under

672
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,319
light conditions as it might look under

673
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,480
a six-hour pathogen infection but in

674
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:09,038
fact they're quite different and a

675
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,399
couple of other observations that we've

676
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:13,480
identified is that uh pathogen the

677
00:25:11,398 --> 00:25:16,359
pathogen infection actually introduces a

678
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,278
a transient deoration of the stamata

679
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:21,479
kind of bounce back the red highlights

680
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:24,200
there compared to open and close under

681
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,599
dial Cycles when you inoculate these

682
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,399
with ponos stringi you get this

683
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:30,278
deoration it's probably

684
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:32,079
kind of some turer pressure on the

685
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:34,159
adjacent cell as a result of the

686
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:37,398
infection but then it recovers but you

687
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,600
can see that an open stomata by a

688
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:43,199
pathogen looks markedly different than

689
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:47,199
an open stomata by uh light cycles

690
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:49,440
highly bundled highly dense uh uh radial

691
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,038
uh transverse arrays as opposed to here

692
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,399
more of a mesh network of of radials so

693
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:57,798
that's you know we can quantify this so

694
00:25:55,398 --> 00:26:00,759
the big question was can we go in and

695
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:03,240
use these types of analyses to identify

696
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:05,839
specific effectors using plant genetics

697
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,759
and bacterial genetics to identify uh

698
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,439
act inside a skeleton can we measure

699
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,798
these and really can we separate cause

700
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,519
from effect can we separate the immune

701
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:16,720
response from the pathogen veilance

702
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:19,278
response so just two definitions I want

703
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,360
you to uh remember for the next five or

704
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:23,798
six slides whenever I say

705
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,278
skewness uh this is really it's it's

706
00:26:23,798 --> 00:26:28,119
it's a mathematical measurement so we're

707
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:30,640
looking at the the distribution of

708
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:32,839
it has a bell-shaped distribution under

709
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,919
normal conditions skewness simply means

710
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:37,439
we take that Bell and we skew it to one

711
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:40,000
side or the other and that would be

712
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,880
skewness equals act and bundling so when

713
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,599
you see highly bundled arrays that means

714
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:47,760
you have high skewness the opposite is

715
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:50,798
highly dense arrays means unbundled and

716
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:52,759
I use that word not to be simplistic

717
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:53,918
here we don't know if it's depolymerized

718
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:56,720
we don't know if it's ever been

719
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,880
polymerized so we assigned a very um

720
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,679
kind of a general definition we just say

721
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:05,000
it's unbundled so an image like this we

722
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:07,360
would say it's highly unbundled it's

723
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,480
highly dense and this would be highly

724
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:13,278
skewed so this is mock inoculated and

725
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,480
dc3000 inoculated hopefully you can see

726
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:18,119
the differences there

727
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,720
dc3000 highly bundles the host acon

728
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:22,759
filaments whereas a hark C mutant really

729
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,558
doesn't change it quantitatively can do

730
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:29,079
the same we can go in they show up

731
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:31,158
better here uh um highly dense arrays

732
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:32,960
but clearly something so this became

733
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:34,480
kind of our metric this was our first

734
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,278
phenotype that we're going to follow

735
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,839
let's screen all of the plant mutants we

736
00:27:36,278 --> 00:27:41,519
might want to screen against all of

737
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:44,599
these uh cpb isolates that we got from

738
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:47,440
the cmer lab and say can we Define a

739
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:50,678
pattern within this can we narrow down a

740
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,679
specific effector so we got these uh

741
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:54,480
effectors and you first thing is to

742
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:55,840
standardize our system set up our system

743
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,440
so that we're taking our measurements at

744
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:00,398
24 hours we want want to eliminate any

745
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,080
bacterial density effects so we do a

746
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:05,079
growth curve at 0 hours and 24 hours we

747
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:07,158
count the bacteria at each one and we

748
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:11,839
set up the standard curve so this is

749
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:14,399
dc3000 at an initial inoculum of. 3 03

750
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:16,519
01 kind of our standard curve we

751
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:18,959
Benchmark all of Allen strains against

752
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:21,798
these and then what we do is we

753
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,399
inoculate our isolates so for example we

754
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:27,119
would inoculate cpb

755
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:29,839
5500 at the same concentration as to

756
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:34,158
compare with dc3000 at a

757
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:36,558
0.01 the this strain grows at an initial

758
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,000
concentration of3 as compared to Wild

759
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:40,440
types so there's a bit of a fitness

760
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,839
impact right so our main concern was we

761
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:46,120
want to make sure that in the end we're

762
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:48,398
not looking at bacterial density as as

763
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:50,079
cause and effect uh and then these are

764
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:52,278
just the isolates you can see I'm not

765
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:54,720
going to go through this but dc3000 has

766
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:58,079
all of these isolates and then uh some

767
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,000
of these uh CU let's say 5500 is

768
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,359
basically uh knocked out for all of

769
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,919
these isolates uh Delta cell it's the

770
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:06,199
conservative fector Locus is present in

771
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,360
all of these but not in these Etc so you

772
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,480
can start to line these guys up and say

773
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:11,959
which effectors and ultimately you get

774
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,880
down to two or three strains that are

775
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:17,000
missing the same couple of a factors and

776
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,399
then you can knock those out so our

777
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,200
inputs was pathogen genetics using the

778
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:23,639
the cpb strains it's Define tractable

779
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,120
growth we can say okay we know what

780
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,080
disease looks like death is a really

781
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,959
cool easy phenotype to identify we're

782
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:30,158
going to look initially at a single host

783
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,880
and we're going to use the power of

784
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,880
these over overlapping effector

785
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:38,240
inventories our outputs are going to be

786
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,960
uh disease assay so again using

787
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,440
skewness and density right so these are

788
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:47,840
kind of opposite when you have high

789
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:50,558
bundling you have low skewness excuse me

790
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:52,319
low density and vice versa so again kind

791
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:54,200
of these opposites black and white are

792
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,319
really uh where you want to be to

793
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,000
Benchmark these and we can do this using

794
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:01,519
a computer algorithm to quantify uh with

795
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,159
no human input so just quickly I'll go

796
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:07,919
through this this is all work that's in

797
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:09,080
revision uh so uh so we we've screened

798
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,919
through all of these lines and we've

799
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:14,240
narrowed it down to a couple of of of

800
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:15,840
the ccpb uh isolates from Allen's lab uh

801
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,038
and we narrowed it down to about five

802
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:19,240
effectors uh actually six effectors I'll

803
00:30:18,038 --> 00:30:20,839
tell you about one of them that we're

804
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,399
not really following up on we're playing

805
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:24,558
around with it with shing's lab a little

806
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:26,439
bit but we narrowed this one down to

807
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:29,440
five effectors we knew that there were

808
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:32,519
one of or multiple of five effectors

809
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,038
that were responsible uh for inducing

810
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:38,120
this decreased uh actin

811
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:40,599
response okay so it came down to this

812
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:42,678
isolate here and then this one here so

813
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:44,918
like salmonella we identified that ponos

814
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:48,200
stringi effectors have these opposing

815
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:50,679
activities camonos or salmonella has

816
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,319
some effector one effector that binds

817
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:55,120
host acum and they have one that or

818
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:57,439
excuse me that bundles hos actin one

819
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,439
that unbundles hos actin so you can

820
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,960
imagine I'm a very analogy person my

821
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,320
students always tease me imagine walking

822
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,399
into this room with a all the chairs are

823
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:07,240
littered in different different

824
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:08,599
directions and you had to walk through

825
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,038
you would push some chairs out of the

826
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:12,119
way and take a step then you would pull

827
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:14,038
some chairs so this is what the pathogen

828
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:16,199
doing it is pushing and pulling on the

829
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:18,759
Acton SOS skeleton depending on the

830
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,360
state of the immune signaling pathway uh

831
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:24,158
I'm going to talk more about this one uh

832
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:26,038
for those of you that are curious uh AV

833
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,200
actually induces acting polymerization

834
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:30,638
and its host and we don't know why uh

835
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,000
we're working with Shing Hees group a

836
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:34,638
little bit on AV AV is one of the

837
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,398
conserved effector Locus highly

838
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:39,798
important uh widely abundant uh but it

839
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:41,719
has a very strong effect when you

840
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:45,319
express it in Plants either

841
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:47,278
transgenically in plants or uh through

842
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:49,798
affector uh delivery through the

843
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:50,720
pathogen it immediately bundles the

844
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:53,240
Acton

845
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,720
cytoskeleton so we narrowed it down from

846
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:59,038
this isolate cpb 549 to this affector

847
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,240
this is the the the the N the cluster

848
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:04,960
nine there are what six or so effectors

849
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,519
on this one uh we went through and we

850
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,079
screened all of these looking at growth

851
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:10,798
curves there was no real impact of

852
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:12,638
growth when we knocked out any of these

853
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:14,599
individual factors you can see so that

854
00:32:12,638 --> 00:32:16,199
really was a nice thing because we now

855
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:18,079
we can do standardized assays where

856
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,919
we're inoculating all of the same

857
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:23,278
concentrations counting all of the same

858
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,440
growth Etc uh we then we start to add

859
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:28,038
back in individual effectors and the

860
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,919
long story short is that it's hot G1 one

861
00:32:28,038 --> 00:32:32,919
actually induces act and

862
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,200
bundling uh in its host uh and this was

863
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:37,720
a factor that's been worked on a little

864
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,919
bit by another uh colmer Alum Jim Alano

865
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:44,200
that showed that hopg1 uh can actually

866
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,440
induce cell death in its host so uh and

867
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,038
interesting I'm not going to show this

868
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:51,159
it's published and we're working on

869
00:32:48,038 --> 00:32:52,879
getting some really a better repeat the

870
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:54,320
result the publish results real we're

871
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,200
just having trouble getting it to work

872
00:32:54,319 --> 00:33:00,759
the way uh we to the reviewer satisf

873
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,600
action hot G1 appears to bind kinesin

874
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:05,398
which is a mitochondrial localized

875
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:07,480
protein kinesin are motor proteins that

876
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:10,239
mediate the interaction between myosin

877
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,240
and actin and so what we believe our

878
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,278
kind of our method is or our mechanism

879
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,679
is that hot G1 it's delivered in the

880
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:20,240
host cell it immediately Targets kinesin

881
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,320
in the mitochondria and that induces

882
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,558
acum bundling acum bundling in the

883
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:26,638
mitochondria if you Pub Med search that

884
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:27,918
boom it's cell death so that's one of

885
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:29,479
the cool things about actin satto

886
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,120
skeleton depending on the distribution

887
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,000
of actin within the cell as well as its

888
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:35,000
organization you can tickle certain

889
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,079
responses if you send actin into the

890
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,839
mitochondria in a human cell it

891
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:42,319
initiates apoptosis if you bundle actin

892
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:45,359
in plant cells and pollen cells it

893
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:47,240
induces cell death apoptosis so we

894
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,519
believe that the the virence at least

895
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,319
maybe one of the virence targets of

896
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:53,240
hopg1 is kinan and it requires a

897
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:55,960
functional Actos skeleton it manipulates

898
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,480
Actos skeletal Dynamics to initiate cell

899
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,319
death and we have some data

900
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:03,159
that demonstrates this so P

901
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:05,439
dc3000 at 4 days induces this nice

902
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:08,760
chlorotic phenotype if you knock out hop

903
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,280
G1 you get uh no Chlor chlorotic

904
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,919
phenotype if we add back hopg1 it's not

905
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,720
as strong you recover much of that we've

906
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:19,000
done chlorophyll analysis we cover about

907
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:21,519
70% of that uh Brian kavit is helping us

908
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,398
on this we think either it's a a

909
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:27,519
contribution

910
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:30,319
to uh the cmal locus um we think we've

911
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:32,039
eliminated the contribution there or we

912
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,559
think it's a position effect that we're

913
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:35,960
just not getting strong expression of

914
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:38,559
this hot G1 but to demonstrate that this

915
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:40,720
is an acting dependent response uh you

916
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:42,480
can take dc3000 you get this yellowing

917
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:45,519
phenotype again a little bit clearer

918
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,838
here you knock out the Hop G1 the Delta

919
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:50,480
9 cluster you remove that but if you

920
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:51,279
back add back in a deising factor you

921
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,599
can

922
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,000
restore the cell death phenotype this

923
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:58,079
experiment by itself has been done

924
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,559
several times but demonstrating that hot

925
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,920
G1 can really compensate or is additive

926
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:06,519
to this process so just to tie up this

927
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,639
first part of my talk is really what

928
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:09,639
we've demonstrated here is that

929
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:11,960
pathogens modulate the host act inside a

930
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:14,039
skeleton uh and that there are multiple

931
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,358
points of this interaction and really I

932
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:17,960
think this is the first example of a

933
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:20,400
pathogen induced modulation uh of

934
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:23,838
transcription back to the uh ADF story

935
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:26,160
we've got it a link there

936
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:28,199
so the big question for us and I'm going

937
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:31,159
to wrap up my with this last story was

938
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:33,879
back to this story here that Katie

939
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:35,960
Porter had published so we know that

940
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:40,240
adf4 is required for the expression of

941
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:43,199
rps5 we know the AV pphb is the affector

942
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:44,879
protein that tickles rps5 we also know

943
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:47,279
from other work from Roger in's group

944
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,000
from jeam mjo's group that AVR pphb

945
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,079
targets multiple proteins in its in its

946
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,039
host and we've got this kinas link

947
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,440
remember the function of adf4 is kinas

948
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:58,079
dependent so we asked again another one

949
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,358
of these I wish I had a time machine I'd

950
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,960
send the post do to Vegas uh she really

951
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:05,880
got had a good guess and it worked out

952
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,880
she said can we identify the kinas that

953
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:11,720
phosphor ada4 and is in fact this this

954
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,640
kinas targeted by AVR pphb again we're

955
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:16,759
hoping that maybe we can identify the

956
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:18,400
veilance Target and uh thanks to Greg

957
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,720
Martin and his lab for publishing this

958
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,480
just a couple weeks ago because I was

959
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:23,000
looking for a slide that demonstrated

960
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,480
the function of kinases and plant

961
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,280
pathogen interactions and these are the

962
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,960
two that I wanted to show uh so a PTO is

963
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,560
one of the best characterized uh kyes

964
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:35,440
signaling mechanisms through prf and PTO

965
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:37,358
kinas uh Roger Anis i' mentioned this

966
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,400
this is what I'm going to focus on AVR

967
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:44,960
pphb is a cine proteas that cleaves the

968
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:47,720
kinas pbs1 that leads to the activation

969
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,318
of resistance jeam meno's group

970
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:53,000
demonstrated that not only does pphb

971
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:56,358
cleave this KY it CLE about 20 others

972
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,079
there about 20 other pbs1 like proteins

973
00:36:56,358 --> 00:37:00,719
many of these are functionally unknown

974
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:02,560
uh and but some of them have been

975
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:05,480
identified some of them are required for

976
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:07,799
the function of fls2 such as back one

977
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,039
and so postto my lab eru said well let's

978
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,359
set up this type of process we

979
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:14,880
hypothesize that the pathogen delivers a

980
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:16,159
factors these affectors Target a kinas

981
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,680
and this kinas is required for the

982
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:20,838
phosphorilation of actin which leads to

983
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:23,358
immunity so we took this template that

984
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:25,838
jee's lab used to

985
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:28,279
screen other potential targets and again

986
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:29,599
it was a bit of a approach we said oh

987
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,720
well let's just look for the three amino

988
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:34,640
acid Target sites that uh AVR pphb

989
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:37,559
cleaved and jeano's group had

990
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:40,000
demonstrated bck one previous work by U

991
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:42,000
uh Roger an's group uh and Jack Dixon's

992
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,318
group showed that pbs1 there are some

993
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,119
other sites up here but we said well

994
00:37:44,318 --> 00:37:48,159
just forget those let's just you know

995
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:51,000
throw throw this at it really quick and

996
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:53,039
what eru identified was the cdpks

997
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,239
calcium dependent protein kinases also

998
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:58,279
some of these have this cleavage site so

999
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:00,559
the question question was is are there

1000
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:04,880
additional sites uh are there is there

1001
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:08,159
recognition of this site by the uh uh by

1002
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,960
the uh KY or excuse me by AVP PHP and

1003
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:14,118
kennet cleave big question is are there

1004
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,400
additional substrates was John MOS were

1005
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:18,599
saturating and are these any of these

1006
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,960
substrates the candidate that phosphates

1007
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:23,000
adf4 so this is basically we're going to

1008
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,318
look for the effector that targets the

1009
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,159
kindness and What U found was cpk3

1010
00:38:26,318 --> 00:38:29,519
actually

1011
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:31,679
does both cpk3

1012
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:34,000
phosphates oh shoot I forgot to put the

1013
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:37,960
phosphorilation trust me famous last

1014
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,318
words cpk3 phosphorites adf4 but more

1015
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:43,480
importantly from a Plant Pathology

1016
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:46,800
standpoint cpk3 actually uh is cleaved

1017
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,400
by AVR pphb so this is the experiment

1018
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,440
here if you include the buffer only you

1019
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:54,720
see nice expression of AVR pphp in the

1020
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,760
presence of um excuse me CPK in the

1021
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:59,598
presence of avrp phb you get cleavage if

1022
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:02,359
we mutate this cleavage site we don't

1023
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:05,559
get cleavage if we include a uh

1024
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:09,039
assisting um to sering mutation it's

1025
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:10,960
catalytic mutant so uh AVP phb is ayine

1026
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:14,639
proteas it's a catalytic Triad a hisin

1027
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:17,880
to sering and a hisin

1028
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:20,318
searing and ayine uh if you knock out

1029
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,440
one of these we we significantly reduce

1030
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:23,519
the cleavage we're getting a little bit

1031
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:27,639
of cleavage here we believe and if you

1032
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:29,800
knock out both again you a block uh

1033
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:32,118
cleavage the real proof is in the

1034
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,640
pudding if you knock out CPK what does

1035
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,400
it do from a disease resistance

1036
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:37,639
standpoint and as we would have

1037
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,318
predicted if we knock out cpk3 these

1038
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:41,799
plants are susceptible when inoculated

1039
00:39:40,318 --> 00:39:43,920
with AV

1040
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:47,160
pphb the reciprocal we've done this

1041
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,800
about 50 or 60 leaves no HR when we

1042
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:52,719
inoculate the plants with AVR pphb

1043
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,920
whereas with Colombia you get an HR none

1044
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:56,959
of these plants appear to be affected in

1045
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:00,079
the hyper sensor response what's really

1046
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:03,119
cool is if we add in an actin modifying

1047
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:05,960
agent co-infiltrated it we restore the

1048
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,240
hypers sensitive response to while type

1049
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,280
kind of demonstrating that there is a

1050
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:12,039
functional role for acting in this

1051
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,880
process and then this is just last week

1052
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:16,000
type data but just looking at the

1053
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,079
function of the kise as a relationship

1054
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,960
to Acton you can see that if you knock

1055
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,720
out the kise and mark the line with

1056
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,639
actin you get this really high density

1057
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:28,759
actin array indicative of an immune type

1058
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:32,480
response so we're hypothesizing that

1059
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:35,880
cpk3 is evolved excuse me is required

1060
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,960
for immunity to pamon stringi and that

1061
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:41,440
actin is a big part of this process and

1062
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,880
this is again just quantitative analysis

1063
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,880
but I think that the difference here

1064
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,200
striking this is only 90 images so we've

1065
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:51,318
got about uh 800 to go to to get this

1066
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:54,399
but it's looking pretty good so just to

1067
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:56,920
wrap up uh we're really focusing on this

1068
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,160
process here of how act inside a

1069
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,639
skeleton touches many processes immunity

1070
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:03,838
again is is a great phenotype to study

1071
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:06,719
especially when death is involved uh we

1072
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:08,279
know that cpk3 phospholes adf4 and this

1073
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:10,879
phosphorilation we demonstrated in

1074
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,560
previous paper is what kicks ADF off of

1075
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,079
acnos skeleton so that eliminates

1076
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:20,199
breaking down or deiz of actin through

1077
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:21,880
phosphorilation AVR pphb Cleaves cpk3 uh

1078
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:24,000
we're doing the invitro experiments now

1079
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,559
where we do recombinant Express of each

1080
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,719
of the proteins and then we'll send it

1081
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:30,519
from ASPC to to you know to definitively

1082
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:33,078
Define that that cleavage point that

1083
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:35,079
cleavage site uh we know that cpk3 is

1084
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:38,000
required for wild type actin filament

1085
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:40,760
organization so we believe that Acton is

1086
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,519
or at least cpk3 from an Acton

1087
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:45,119
standpoint adfs are the key Regulators I

1088
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:47,000
mean you know I drew it just like we all

1089
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,358
draw the the globe when you ever you see

1090
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,838
a globe that's printed in the United

1091
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:51,039
States the United States is right there

1092
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:52,880
in the center it's like the biggest

1093
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:55,119
country uh we believe from the

1094
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,400
standpoint of act and cpk3 and adss are

1095
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,760
like the biggest the players here and

1096
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,920
cpk3 therefore would represent a key

1097
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,800
regulator of act and filament Dynamics

1098
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:08,519
and we know that CPK is required for

1099
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,560
resistance and uh cpks so have been

1100
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:13,000
previously identified as involved as

1101
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:14,400
required for stamata opening and closing

1102
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,159
uh so we think we're on the right Trail

1103
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,838
here Julian scher's lab published a few

1104
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:22,279
years ago in plant bi PL biology that if

1105
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:25,759
you knock out cpk3 you uh diminish the

1106
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:28,640
ABA closure of stata and for us at least

1107
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,640
it makes theoretical logical step to say

1108
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:33,879
that pathogens entering through stomata

1109
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:37,679
would require or potentially Target cpk3

1110
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:39,920
to uh to eliminate static closure so the

1111
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:43,399
big picture of where my lab is primarily

1112
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,119
interested in moving is defining

1113
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,280
actinide a skeleton is kind of the ideal

1114
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,920
surveillance platform you know one of

1115
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,280
the neatest observation I think we saw

1116
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,159
and that I'm trying to figure out this

1117
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:55,880
experiment of how to do it in Plants but

1118
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:57,399
if you talk about actin and this is a

1119
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,240
review we wrote a few years ago you know

1120
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,599
it's a very highly regulated process

1121
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:04,199
there's about 75 actin binding proteins

1122
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:06,519
in plants there's about 250 in humans so

1123
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:09,199
it's tightly regulated process but if

1124
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:09,920
you ultimately if you push actin into

1125
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:13,039
the

1126
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,800
mitochondria uh you initiate death uh

1127
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:17,880
that's true in an animal systems uh at

1128
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:20,760
least you know we may have some signal

1129
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,160
with the hot G1 Kines and Acton

1130
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,680
relationship to the ACT to the

1131
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:26,199
mitochondria that we may have the

1132
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:28,719
similar type of process so our

1133
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:30,519
hypothesis is really that actant is the

1134
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:32,159
ideal surveillance platform it touches

1135
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:34,920
many many processes it touches

1136
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:37,318
physiological processes such as stomata

1137
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,559
gene expression uh organel movement and

1138
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:42,759
organization as well as immune processes

1139
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:46,760
such as uh internalization of receptor

1140
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:48,240
complexes uh vacular processes immune

1141
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:52,520
signaling processes such as the

1142
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:55,679
expression of rps5 cpk3 Etc so our big

1143
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:57,440
question here is can we alter not

1144
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:59,719
necessarily the Dynamics of the ACT side

1145
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,599
of skeleton by knocking out an actin

1146
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:04,279
binding protein or overexpressing an

1147
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:06,480
actin binding protein but can we alter a

1148
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:09,040
phys a cell's response by simply

1149
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,000
changing where Acton is localized could

1150
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:12,039
and we've started to mess around a

1151
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,079
little bit with these we've got some

1152
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:16,800
inducible lines and some stable lines

1153
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:19,400
but basically can we thrust adf4 into

1154
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,960
the nucleus almost exclusively by

1155
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,760
putting strong nuclear localization

1156
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,800
signals and the preliminary data here is

1157
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,240
that when we do do this plants don't

1158
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,200
like it uh but they really don't like it

1159
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:30,879
from a Plant Pathology standpoint from a

1160
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:33,480
plant pathogen standpoint these plants

1161
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,680
are highly susceptible uh We've altered

1162
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,480
this Dynamic organization of the Acton

1163
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:39,679
cytoskeleton so that gets back to the

1164
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:42,318
overarching hypothesis that we have is

1165
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:45,759
that in humans there is Killin and

1166
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:47,800
there's ADF there is beta actin and

1167
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,000
there's one other actin so there are

1168
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:52,760
four there are two ADF proteins in

1169
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:57,000
humans two actin and humans in Plants

1170
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:59,760
there are 12 actin isoforms there are 11

1171
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,239
adfs Are there specific partners and

1172
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,800
pairs of these that are required for

1173
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:08,318
very specific responses and I was glad

1174
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:11,720
to see j u uh Jean Greenberg published a

1175
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:13,800
short small little paper in in a in a in

1176
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:16,279
a little highly specialized Journal

1177
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,920
recently that suggests that their work

1178
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,280
where they've identified hop W1 you may

1179
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:24,599
know this as hop X Allan from the

1180
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,960
meeting a few years ago uh um they

1181
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:29,240
demonstrated that Acton 7 is required

1182
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,800
for immune signaling and whenever we do

1183
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:33,759
imuno precipitation experiments we

1184
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,318
always pull down actin 7 and actin 2 so

1185
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,040
we think that there are certain Partners

1186
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:40,558
kind of a locking key mechanism where

1187
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:43,039
adf4 May preferentially deize actin 2 or

1188
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:46,160
actin 7 filaments and that this is the

1189
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:49,199
immune signaling uh specific uh pathway

1190
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:51,759
we have no mechanistic support for this

1191
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:53,318
it's simply a hypothesis and uh

1192
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,520
unfortunately a lot of the evidence out

1193
00:45:53,318 --> 00:45:57,519
there would argue against it but all of

1194
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:59,559
the evidence out there is human based

1195
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:01,960
where there is there's only two actin

1196
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:04,160
and two adfs so they don't have the the

1197
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,838
power of of numbers so with that I'd

1198
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:08,199
like to uh just thank the people this is

1199
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:11,078
a relatively recent live picture Brian I

1200
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:13,118
was telling Allan Brian's kind of a many

1201
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:15,240
of you may know Brian he's he's really

1202
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,079
extroverted a lot like me so he anytime

1203
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:19,279
there's a camera and a picture uh he

1204
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:20,519
kind of inserts himself into it uh so

1205
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,920
he's an honorary member this was

1206
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:24,920
celebrating one of my post's uh 40th

1207
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:29,039
birthday and so we all got shirts that

1208
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:31,159
uh uh say obey masaki so uh essentially

1209
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:33,400
uh this is the lab so eru is the one

1210
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:35,199
that has identified the CPK Katie

1211
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:38,079
graduated in December and she was the

1212
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:39,439
ADF person uh Alex is a new student who

1213
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,480
actually will be spending uh three

1214
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,119
months in Japan this summer uh to do

1215
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:45,240
more of the act and stuff at ngoya

1216
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:47,400
University masaki is the one that has

1217
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:50,879
worked not only on the hot G1 story

1218
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:53,000
that's in revision but also um is doing

1219
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,920
this very precise measurement with Tokyo

1220
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,800
University on the stamata organization

1221
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:01,480
and the other people ind1 uh and ind1

1222
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:04,318
and this is my lone uh cucumber student

1223
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:06,559
who's uh graduating and and moving on to

1224
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:07,960
uh really great thing so uh with that

1225
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:10,880
I'd like to be happy to take any

1226
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,880
questions thank

1227
00:47:14,838 --> 00:47:20,558
you this has been a production of
