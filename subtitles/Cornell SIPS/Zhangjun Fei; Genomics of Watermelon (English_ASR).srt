1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,878
This is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,718
University. So also thank you for giving

3
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,119
me this opportunity to uh present our

4
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,038
work on

5
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:19,600
watermelon.

6
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:21,760
Okay. So here's uh the outline of my

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,519
talk today. First I will provide a

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,000
little bit of background for watermelon

9
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:28,239
although most of people already know you

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,160
know and then I uh talk about the

11
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:34,079
generation of high quality reference

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,079
genomes of watermelon and then we uh I I

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,799
will talk about the genomeary sequence

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:42,719
of davos rep representative watermelon

15
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:45,839
accessions and I uh then we talk about

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,120
the go and mapping of important

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,800
watermelon trace using the resource we

18
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,558
generated and then at the end of my talk

19
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,799
I will spend like a couple minutes to

20
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,799
introduce a new project it's called

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:03,359
cuc so as most of you may already know

22
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:06,519
that watermelon is a member of cuc cubid

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:10,719
family which includes

24
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:14,000
uh okay melon cucumber watermelon and

25
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:16,879
pumpkins several very important

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,879
uh fruit

27
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:25,280
crops and this is a uh what fruit

28
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:27,759
map and and you can see watermelon is a

29
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,680
very is a worldwide fruit c. You can see

30
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,680
watermelon everywhere in the

31
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,759
world and watermelon is also a

32
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,078
economical crop

33
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,319
and it it

34
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:46,359
uh so in 200 this is the data I got from

35
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:50,879
uh F

36
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:55,039
2012 what the whole vegetable is 57

37
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:57,359
million hectare was was grown about 6%

38
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,118
is for watermelon

39
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:03,039
And in China even more you got

40
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:05,519
7%. That China is the leading producer

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,159
of watermelon. And you can see the

42
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:15,598
production in the world is about

43
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:17,719
105 105 million tons annually and China

44
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,878
produce about six

45
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:23,039
67% of the watermelon in the world and

46
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:26,239
also the consumption per capita

47
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:29,519
consumption is about 3.5 times in China

48
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,520
than the average of the

49
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:37,040
world. So watermelon is also um the the

50
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,959
most popular fruit worldwide ba based on

51
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,878
the production and you can see

52
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,039
watermelon ranked number one on the

53
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:46,560
production. So tomato is not kind of

54
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:48,318
here. Tomato is if you count tomato as a

55
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,360
fruit then tomato is a number one.

56
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,958
Tomato is about 160

57
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,760
million but most people treat tomato as

58
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,759
vegetables not fruit.

59
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,920
So you can see the several popular

60
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,079
fruits watermelon, banana, apple,

61
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:07,079
oranges, grapes. You know watermelon the

62
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,319
production is the rank number

63
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:13,319
one. So watermelon is also a very

64
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:15,399
nutritional crop and this is a nutrition

65
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:18,560
fact and

66
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,200
also the watermelon contains very high

67
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,080
levels of lacine than any other fresh

68
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:27,518
fruit or vegetable. It it has uh

69
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,680
contains like 15 to 20 microgram per two

70
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,599
cup serving. That's very

71
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:37,519
high. And the watermelon also contains

72
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:39,199
this citrine. So the name of citrine was

73
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,039
derived from the Latin name of

74
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:44,079
watermelon. So watermelon the Latin name

75
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,840
of watermelon is the crolos lanatas. So

76
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,440
that citruline was derived from the

77
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,519
crolos.

78
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,239
So this is a very important amino acid

79
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,879
that maintains cardiovascular function

80
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,640
and also there's a report say that this

81
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,959
amino acid have some biagara like

82
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:02,158
effects but it's certainly good to your

83
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,158
uh to to your heart to your

84
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:09,839
health. So watermelon is also emerged as

85
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:13,920
a model system for uh for nonclimactaric

86
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,719
fruit quality development. It it uh when

87
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,159
people study like single

88
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:19,399
accumulation, fruit wening and rapid

89
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,160
fruit

90
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:26,638
expansion, watermelon become a very good

91
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:29,840
system and also the cucub species like

92
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,000
watermelon, melon and cucumber fl is

93
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,000
they also as a model system for flower

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,360
sex

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,918
determinations. So this they have a

96
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,400
three different flower types. So male

97
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:43,599
flower, female flower and a bisexual

98
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:46,799
flower. And based on com combination of

99
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,360
these different flower types, the plant

100
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,439
one plant could have different flowers.

101
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,319
So you have different flower types plant

102
00:04:53,439 --> 00:05:00,800
like this monocious that's only have

103
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:03,918
male and female flowers in one plant and

104
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,199
mono is a male and bisexual flowers. So

105
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:09,839
this these are two major uh flower types

106
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:14,160
in watermelon. But in cucumber you have

107
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,159
all kind of the seven different flower

108
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:21,599
types. But watermelon now has uh the civ

109
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,600
watermelon have very narrow genetic

110
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,840
diversity. Although their phenotype

111
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,080
diversity is is very large but their

112
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,839
genetic diversity is very very narrow.

113
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:33,680
That's causing the bottleneck for

114
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:35,839
breeding. And also the watermelon has a

115
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,400
complicated quantity of traits. I think

116
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:41,038
this same as other crops like fruit,

117
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:44,560
fruit size, sugar content, shape, fruit

118
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:47,918
shape, the flavor and maturity, shelf

119
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,199
life, uniformity, growth ve

120
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:52,719
etc.

121
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:56,400
And also uh watermelon is sensitive to

122
00:05:52,720 --> 00:06:00,000
to quite a lot of diseases like f this

123
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:04,318
is the most important disease in

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,319
watermelon is a fizarium build and also

125
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,800
it's a

126
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,240
uh there's a lot of pest in watermelon

127
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,560
like a and also root

128
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:18,879
not neop

129
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,800
neatode so not because of this problems,

130
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,439
the narrow genetic diversity, all kinds

131
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,000
of different complicated traits and we

132
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:29,199
need modern tools such as the genomic

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,759
tools. That's what we the the talk the

134
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,520
the focus of the talk today that need to

135
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,120
be developed for watermelon to

136
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:39,120
facilitate its breeding and

137
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,199
research. So next I will talk about the

138
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,680
reference sequence we generate for

139
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:47,759
watermelon. So so far we have generated

140
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,439
three reference genome in uh like last

141
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,680
seven or eight

142
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:57,199
years. The first one we generate. So in

143
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,000
2008 we are we we formed a international

144
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,439
watermelon genome

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,000
initiative and we uh the the the goal of

146
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:09,439
this uh project the watermelon genome

147
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,918
project the one of the goal is gen

148
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:15,680
generate a high quality draft genome of

149
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:19,120
watermelon cardiva 9713 is this cardio.

150
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,560
So this is a east asotype. It has early

151
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,319
maturity and high fruit

152
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:28,560
quality. And we also have these uh

153
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:31,400
additional go uh go um the objectives.

154
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,839
One is the resequencing of uh of the

155
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:36,478
watermelon accessions that I'm going to

156
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:40,399
talk today also and also we generate a

157
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:42,478
lot of transchrome data involved in uh

158
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:46,799
different interest biological process

159
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:49,598
but this I will not talk this today.

160
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,800
So watermelon is uh the genome size is

161
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:56,199
about 425 million base pairs and it's

162
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:00,720
highly homozygous and is can be easily

163
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:02,639
inbred. So so I even in 2008 it's not

164
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,360
not that difficult to do genome

165
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,879
assembly. So we uh we we did a genom

166
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,919
assembly using the whole genome shutter

167
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,160
gun approach purely enomina sequence and

168
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:15,439
at that time the main sequence is like

169
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:18,400
40 50 base pairs or 75 base pair now

170
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:21,279
it's like 250 but we still managed to to

171
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:24,159
assemble a very high quality genome. So

172
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:26,878
the uh the M50 size is 2.3 million base

173
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,479
pairs that's pretty high compared to all

174
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:33,038
other assembled genome at that

175
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:34,958
time. And we also assembled about 80%

176
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:38,120
more than 80% of the genome. So the

177
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:41,759
genome size is 425, we assembled

178
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:45,200
353. So as we we we did at that time we

179
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,958
did analyze the unasssembled reads. We

180
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,160
found most of them are repeated

181
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,159
sequence. So that's that's what I what

182
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,919
we

183
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:58,639
expected and we did a genome annotation.

184
00:08:53,919 --> 00:09:02,159
We identified about 23,000 genes. It's

185
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:04,399
uh it's less less than most of the crops

186
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:09,079
that the tomato has 35 million. Even

187
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:12,080
abdops had 27 35,000. Even abdopedis has

188
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,080
27,000

189
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:19,600
genes. So the reason we have much less

190
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,278
gene this could be one reason. So the

191
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,959
first thing we analyze this genome we

192
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:26,639
found there's no whole genome

193
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:28,479
duplication event occurred in in in c in

194
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,319
watermelon and also in cucumber we

195
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:35,600
didn't find any uh recent whole genome

196
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,440
duplication but we uh in arbopsis they

197
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,080
have two recent whole genome

198
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:44,240
duplications and in tomato and potato we

199
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:47,920
have a recent whole genome triplication

200
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,680
event and all uricots have a ancient

201
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:52,559
triplication And you can see this

202
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,719
ancient triplication also exist in in

203
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:58,239
watermelon and and and cucumber. That's

204
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,040
expected you know. So without this whole

205
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,440
genome duplication then that's why we

206
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:06,159
got much less gene numbers in in

207
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,760
cucumber. And recently we sequenced the

208
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:11,360
uh the pumpkin genome. This is also in

209
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,919
the cucet family. We found a whole

210
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,720
genome duplication and the the gene

211
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:20,078
number in pumpkin is is like 32,000. is

212
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,079
much higher than than

213
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,759
cucumber. We did some comparative

214
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:28,879
genomic analysis. So our finding is that

215
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:32,720
the transition from the 21 chromosome

216
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:36,039
utic. So the udicart has an ancient

217
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:40,240
ancestor which has 21

218
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:43,039
chromosomes. So uh that that involved a

219
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,399
large number of fishes and fusions. So

220
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:48,799
in order to reach the modern 11

221
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,360
chromosome structure of watermelon and

222
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:55,278
you can see this uh mosaics of different

223
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,480
ancest blocks. So during the whole

224
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:01,838
genome evolution this shows how the uh

225
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,920
the genome from the ancestor come to the

226
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,519
modern watermelon and also we identified

227
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:10,399
large synonyy we found a lot of synonyy

228
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,639
between the cucubid species the melon

229
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,639
and the

230
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:21,039
watermelon. We also checked the uh this

231
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:23,360
citrine metallic uh metabolic pathway

232
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:24,519
and the interesting thing is that so we

233
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,278
compared to

234
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:30,560
arabopsis and this is the pathway the

235
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:33,120
only thing we found that there's a

236
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:35,679
expansion in this two families in

237
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,278
abdopsis there's only one gene gene

238
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:41,919
members but in uh in citrine in

239
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:44,240
watermelon we have two members for this

240
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:48,078
two gene families and then we are

241
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:51,120
Because data we we we checked the uh the

242
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:53,759
expression pattern and we found the

243
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,320
three genes are downregulated during

244
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,559
fruit development that's that's

245
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,560
corresponds to the high elevated

246
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:04,719
settling content during fruit

247
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:08,599
development because this uh this this

248
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:12,000
two gene families are involved in

249
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,920
degradation of the settling. So this is

250
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,759
a settling that is degradation although

251
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:19,599
this form this circle and feedback loop

252
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:23,039
but I mean we believe that citling

253
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,320
accumulation in the maturing fruit in uh

254
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:31,039
is likely due to decreased activity. So

255
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,040
this decreased activity of citrine

256
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,278
degradation okay with uh the uh rapid

257
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:42,078
advance of sequencing technology. So we

258
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:44,838
recently sequenced another genome. So

259
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:47,919
the the one the NASA M3 is a East Asia

260
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:50,399
ecotype. So now this one was American

261
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:53,559
eype. So you can you can clearly see the

262
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:57,278
big difference of this two uh two uh two

263
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:58,879
ecotypes. So the fruit shape is a is

264
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:02,159
different. This one is round and this

265
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:04,559
one is oblong. And then the uh the fruit

266
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,439
size this one is much larger. This one

267
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,879
is about 25 to 35 pounds. And this one

268
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,480
is about 10 to 15

269
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:17,559
pounds. And there are also uh I mean

270
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,159
other uh phenotypic phenotypic

271
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:23,119
difference. And the reason we s this one

272
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:25,078
because of the a group in Charleston. So

273
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,399
this this one was a was developed in

274
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:31,359
Charleston, South Carolina. And they are

275
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:36,000
using this as a system to develop all

276
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:38,000
kinds of studies. So we uh we we we also

277
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,600
using the whole genome shot gun using

278
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,120
the illuminina the most recent

279
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,720
illuminina technology we didn't use any

280
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,480
pack bio and you can see the difference

281
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,800
I mean after the the technology

282
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,519
evolvement you know this was done in

283
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:54,958
2009 something 2020 2010 this was done

284
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:58,879
in 2014 and you can see the M50 size

285
00:13:54,958 --> 00:14:02,159
from 2.3 million to 7.5 million increase

286
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:04,639
and also the uh the genome we assembled

287
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,919
So when when risk getting longer then a

288
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,440
lot of repeative sequence now can be

289
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:12,319
assembled. So we assembled about more

290
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,399
than 90% of the genome. So this I mean

291
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,040
this genome probably the the highest

292
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,839
quality we have been we have assembled

293
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:21,679
so far in my

294
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:24,399
lab we got about about the similar

295
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,559
number of genes and then we identified

296
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,720
the single nucleotide variations between

297
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,838
these two between East Asia and American

298
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,879
and American nucleotide. And we found

299
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:38,079
that they are the genome of these two

300
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:41,759
species are highly similar. This is only

301
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:46,078
the snip rate is only about like six

302
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:47,720
snips out of 10,000 base pairs. That's

303
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:51,120
that's very very

304
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,959
low. And we also identified as uh

305
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,399
structure variations larger insertions

306
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,479
deletions inions or duplications.

307
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,759
And we

308
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,320
identified mainly deletions. We

309
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:05,439
identified

310
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:07,240
2771 deletions in Charison gray. This

311
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,959
American

312
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:13,440
eucalype and and only uh you can see

313
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,039
when we talk about the wild reference

314
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,399
genome next you can see the big

315
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:21,838
difference. So now we only have

316
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:25,600
200 233 kilobase deletions in the genome

317
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,320
and also 500 kilob 600 kilobase in this

318
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,079
9113

319
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:33,440
genome and interestingly we found that

320
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:37,679
this deletions are enriched in in this

321
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,920
uh uh fruit QTL fluid weight QTR region.

322
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,759
So we have this orange lines are fruit

323
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:46,479
weight QTR we have five fluid weight

324
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,759
QTLs. So the uh chromosome 6 to 11 I

325
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,800
didn't show here because they don't

326
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,720
contain any fluid weight CTL as far as

327
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:55,198
as

328
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:58,480
reported. So uh you can see the uh 36 of

329
00:15:55,198 --> 00:16:00,799
this delions are in this five regions.

330
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,199
It's highly enriched and that's

331
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,679
understandable because you can see this

332
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:09,120
fruit two fruit are this fruit size

333
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,120
fruit weight are highly

334
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:16,078
different. Okay. Next we uh I will talk

335
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,599
about a wild watermelon. This the

336
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,719
reference genome. This is more

337
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,240
interesting than the American

338
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,879
eotype. And we actually we initiated

339
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,360
this wild watermelon before the that

340
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:31,360
chalice gray American type. And and

341
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:33,199
uh and you can see the highly diff the

342
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,360
the the the phenotypical difference of

343
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:39,120
this two uh accession. The wild species

344
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,399
there's no sugar content. You don't want

345
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,759
to eat it because also bitter you know

346
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,639
and it had white flesh and hard texture

347
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,600
is very hard and it has late maturity.

348
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,278
It also mature but it's very late but

349
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,240
the good thing of this one is the

350
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:59,399
resistance to the uh filement rail to

351
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:04,199
the fun

352
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:08,240
012 and nas3 is sensitive to this

353
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:10,959
one. So we did a genome assembly the the

354
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:15,199
uh the uh assembly the quality is about

355
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:17,679
the same as 9713. So we we emphasize

356
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:21,279
about 2.1 million base pairs and we

357
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,199
assembled about 80% of the genome. And

358
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:26,000
then we uh we did a comparative genomic

359
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,200
analysis and use a molecular clock to

360
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,440
date the speciation events between the

361
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,558
wild and cultivate watermelon. And we

362
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:38,640
found out that these two species was uh

363
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:40,279
the speciation event was occurred about

364
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,480
1.3 million years

365
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:47,440
ago. So tomato and potato the speciation

366
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,558
event occurred about six million years

367
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,960
ago. So this is much I mean because it's

368
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:55,839
the same species it's much closer than

369
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,840
tomato and and

370
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:02,240
potato and we identified genomic

371
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:06,280
variations and you can see now we have

372
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:10,079
3.9 snip identified compared to

373
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:13,279
200,000 that's like 5% of the snips

374
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:15,839
identified in between nasal mastery and

375
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:18,399
charison gray so that mean this two this

376
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:21,279
genome and the the wild wild species and

377
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,280
the uh the cultivated watermelon their

378
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:26,558
genome are highly different. There's a

379
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:30,000
lot of difference and you can see this

380
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:31,240
50 almost 16,000 genes were affect by

381
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,079
this

382
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:37,200
variations. That's about 80% of the

383
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:41,359
genes in the genome. 70% maybe 70% of

384
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:44,038
the genome. And we also identified 680

385
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:46,719
kilo uh,000 small

386
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:50,240
indail and which leading to frame shift

387
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,480
in 247 genes.

388
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,160
So we also identified the large

389
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,919
structure variations the present and

390
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:00,720
absent variations and we identified in

391
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,280
NASA Y3 we identified 6.7 million base

392
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:07,600
pairs compared to like 200 or 600

393
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:10,960
kilobase it's is much much more and we

394
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:15,038
uh the gene affected by this is 270 and

395
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:18,720
also we identified 5 7 million uh

396
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:23,000
present variations in uh in this this w

397
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:26,319
wild watermelon it contains 223

398
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,679
genes as I mentioned before. So this uh

399
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:32,399
uh wild accession they have

400
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:35,160
resistance to uh found one found risk 02

401
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,798
and 01 and

402
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:41,840
two and we compare this genome and we

403
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:44,798
found that the the uh the R gen MS

404
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:47,599
resistant genes. We only found that two

405
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:50,798
two genes that are totally unique that

406
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:55,199
that only exist in this PI and one gene

407
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:55,200
would exist in in this

408
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:02,000
NAS13. So that means this gene are

409
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:04,639
totally absent in one or another. But

410
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,440
when we check this uh this present and

411
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,679
absent variations because some genes

412
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,200
they uh they are not totally gone. the

413
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:16,000
the the the violation maybe just uh just

414
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:20,240
cause a frame shift maybe truncate a

415
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,279
part of intron. So we found several MBSR

416
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,679
genes that in this list and also disease

417
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:29,599
resistant genes disease related genes

418
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,679
like receptor like protein can also find

419
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,519
some

420
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:36,038
u some genes are related to abotic

421
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:39,440
stress stress like heat shock

422
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:40,960
proteins. So this may also explains the

423
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,919
difference between these two uh the

424
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,319
phenotypical difference of these two uh

425
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,840
watermelon accessions. So wine is highly

426
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:53,119
resistant to disease and also can grow

427
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:55,879
in very high conditions like desert you

428
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:58,319
know a high

429
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:01,280
temperature I think this uh this stuff

430
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:03,439
may relate to the flavor I'm not sure

431
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:03,440
you

432
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:10,240
know we also identified the uh the

433
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:12,798
inversions we identified 66 inversions

434
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,519
and interestingly we identified one into

435
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:18,639
chromosome rearrangement events And you

436
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:20,639
can see this is in cartuate watermelon.

437
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,200
This is a wild watermelon. So in

438
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,038
cartivate

439
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,880
watermelon this watermelon chromosome 11

440
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:30,879
in wild this part was was uh become

441
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,120
rejected into chromosome 2 in in

442
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,640
cultivate

443
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:38,719
species. The uh we we we we did several

444
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,080
checks to make sure it's not assembly

445
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,558
error. We using read the pair and rates

446
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:48,399
or met pair rates to to confirm this is

447
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:51,158
it is a real interchromosome rearment

448
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,400
but the uh the implication of this re

449
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:56,320
rearrangement in watermelon qualities of

450
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,200
phenotype that's we don't know we don't

451
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:59,200
know yet remains

452
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,720
unknown okay so we generate the

453
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,440
watermelon reference genome which

454
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,319
provide a great resource now with this

455
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,320
this resource available now we can do uh

456
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:16,558
genome

457
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:19,519
resequencing. So we did genome

458
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:22,720
resequencing was a wide range of

459
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,639
watermelon accessions. So watermelon was

460
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,240
was

461
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,240
thought to originate from

462
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:34,079
Africa. So was originated from Africa

463
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,880
then distribute to the world but whether

464
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,960
is is originated from southern Africa or

465
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,200
western Africa. So now it's still a

466
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,759
debate. There's no clear evidence to

467
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,798
support that. Most people thought it's a

468
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:49,599
it's originate from southern Africa. But

469
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:53,839
recently people argue that they maybe

470
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:56,798
get from western uh Africa. The still is

471
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,798
still not resolved

472
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,240
yet. So this is uh the wild watermelon.

473
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:06,639
But in in about 4,000 years ago, we are

474
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,960
the seeds as well as the paintings of

475
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,200
watermelon. This p this painting of

476
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,640
watermelon was found in in Egyptian

477
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,038
tombs that's built more than 4,000 years

478
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,559
ago. And and you can clearly see that

479
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:19,480
this watermelon I'm not sure this

480
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:22,319
picture

481
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,960
shows. So the shape the first shape is

482
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,879
different from from the wild type. So so

483
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,880
wild type or wild type watermelon is

484
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,559
round is round shape. And that means

485
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,640
that 4,000 this one is a little bit

486
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:38,158
long, right? I'm I'm not sure whether

487
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,240
it's that clear. So that means in 4,000

488
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,840
years ago, people is already start to

489
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:48,200
dumpate watermelon and use watermelon as

490
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:53,279
a as a as a I mean as a fruit, you

491
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:55,759
know, this called a a far fruit in

492
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,000
Egyptian.

493
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:01,599
So this is a watermelon in the 17th

494
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,720
century. So you never see watermelon now

495
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:07,599
this kind of watermelon in nowadays. So

496
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,120
I mean in 17th century the watermelon is

497
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:11,519
like this. Maybe you think oh people

498
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,129
living in that area it's is very tough

499
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:16,839
you know eat this kind of

500
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:19,440
[Laughter]

501
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:23,119
watermelon. So then this this is a

502
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,240
modern day sweet dessert watermelon.

503
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:28,399
This this kind like the

504
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:31,440
evolution uh history of watermelon based

505
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:34,240
on the uh on the uh available evidence.

506
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,558
But the problem is that the scen the

507
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,120
scenario of watermelon evolution still

508
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:42,200
remain largely unclear. The first one is

509
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:44,479
a what is the ancestor of of

510
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,240
watermelon and we know this white

511
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,159
watermelon there's all kind of different

512
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,720
white watermelon but which one is the

513
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:54,720
ancestor the ancient ancestor of the of

514
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:58,000
watermelon and the second one is what is

515
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:01,720
the direct progenitor of cart watermelon

516
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:05,440
and also what's a domatification

517
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:07,600
process so uh to to answer this question

518
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,679
I'm I'm sure it will hard to clearly

519
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:12,399
answer those questions but we are trying

520
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:16,038
to using this genomic sequence data to

521
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:18,759
answer part of these questions and the

522
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:23,038
watermelon has four

523
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:26,079
species. So this red one is it's a uh

524
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:28,558
citulus nanatas that's the watermelon

525
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:31,278
species is also include three sub

526
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:34,079
species. So this one is cultivated

527
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:36,880
watermelon. One is American cultiv

528
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:40,399
watermelon also divided into uh American

529
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,919
eotype and east Asia eotype. And then we

530
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,600
have this semi-wired

531
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:49,038
watermelon. And then we have cetroidis.

532
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:51,000
That's it's called wild wild watermelon.

533
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:56,400
And then we have a

534
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:01,640
se I call horses watermelon. the uh

535
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:05,038
salana satellas uh rai and then this

536
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:08,480
choleens and also this one. So this is

537
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:12,158
this this this wild species and this one

538
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,240
is now the uh neonos. It's hard for me

539
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,600
to pronounce this one. is originally

540
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,159
called the Jumpspark cucumber but they

541
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:23,439
they classified as a stolas and you can

542
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,440
see this is a fruit of that

543
00:26:23,558 --> 00:26:30,399
one and uh also the taxonomy in

544
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,278
watermelon is also a huge debate. So

545
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:36,320
this is people classify this as a as a

546
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:39,079
four five different species but now

547
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:41,519
people thought it's probably seven

548
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:43,079
species. So they they they class this

549
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:46,720
one as different

550
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:51,240
species not sub species. So it's still a

551
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:55,919
debate you know. So we did a uh we

552
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:59,159
select 174 representative accessions

553
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,759
from a jump plant collection of 2,000

554
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:04,720
accessions and we we did genome

555
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:07,679
sequencing. We generate a total of 910

556
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,000
gigabyte data gigabase data and the

557
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:14,400
average risk coverage depths for each

558
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,400
genome is about 15x. That's pretty

559
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:23,120
high. So we identified 24 million

560
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:25,200
snips a lot because of those wild wild

561
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:28,479
species. But you can see we only

562
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:32,440
identified about one million snips from

563
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:36,360
from this cultivate species within those

564
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:39,640
groups. And we identified 5 million in

565
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:43,719
semi-w another close to 60 million from

566
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:46,480
ctoides and 7 million from

567
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:49,038
choleys. And we use this snip to derive

568
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,919
the uh the genetic diversity using the

569
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:56,319
pi uh parameter. And we found the uh the

570
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:59,240
uh the civ species the uh genetic

571
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:02,038
diversity is less than one

572
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:05,038
one to

573
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:06,879
negative3 and the uh the choleensis the

574
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,440
genetic diversity of chessens is pretty

575
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,600
high. It's

576
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:14,320
6.48. When you compare this to uh to

577
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:16,599
other crops and you can see the genetic

578
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:19,278
diversity of watermelon is is extremely

579
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:23,519
low even lower than cucumber. You know

580
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:25,640
cucumber is uh the uh the cular one is

581
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:29,038
about 1.85

582
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:32,720
85 East Asia is lower is is greater than

583
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:33,879
one you know and the rice indica 5.7

584
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,159
Japan

585
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:40,399
3.7 and soybeans the civ one is close to

586
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:43,278
two so this confirms the previous study

587
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:46,639
that the cultivated watermelon had very

588
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:49,599
very very narrow genetic diversity that

589
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,559
cause huge problem for breeding a

590
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:52,558
bottleneck for breeding

591
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:58,879
We we then use this snip to build this

592
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:00,759
filogenic tree. And the uh the first

593
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,278
thing we found is that this

594
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:07,519
one we use cucumber as a root as all the

595
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:09,919
group. And we found this one was not

596
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:11,599
clustered to watermelon. It's clustered

597
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,559
to to cucumber. You know, you can see

598
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:17,678
this these two cluster together.

599
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:20,398
And as expected we found a lot of all

600
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,640
the uh cardiv species they clut together

601
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:23,719
then this

602
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:27,038
semi-w then this

603
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,679
ctoidis and this uh this wild species

604
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:31,200
they cluster

605
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:33,440
together and then we have thought about

606
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,640
does this uh this one is is a real

607
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,558
watermelon or is a melon or is a

608
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,720
cucumber. So we did some analysis. The

609
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:42,639
first one we did is bas this the

610
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,519
fogellic tree clearly shows it's not

611
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,399
watermelon right then we did we map the

612
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,720
risk to all kind of different genomes we

613
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:53,038
have we have cucumber genome we have

614
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,839
watermelon genome we have melon genome

615
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:59,519
we also have two pumpkin genomes we

616
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:02,278
align the the the rect to them we found

617
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:06,558
the it matches most to

618
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:08,839
melon and also we did fish and we found

619
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:12,319
the the chromosome number of this one is

620
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:14,480
24. It's 12 chromosome pairs. That's

621
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:17,359
same as melon. The cucumber had seven

622
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,640
chromosome pairs. Watermelon had 11 and

623
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:22,879
melon has 12.

624
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:27,278
So we conclude that this one is not a

625
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,278
watermelon species. It should be a melon

626
00:30:27,398 --> 00:30:33,439
species. So then we did not use this one

627
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:36,439
in the in the downstream analysis.

628
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,840
So we did a a population structure

629
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:42,000
analysis and the the uh the conclusion

630
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,720
from this population structure analysis

631
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,679
is that the

632
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:49,079
uh this semi wild

633
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,679
uh

634
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:54,439
watermelon should be the direct

635
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:58,480
progenitor of the civular

636
00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:00,640
watermelon and the uh and originally

637
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,720
people thought this choleensis should be

638
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,200
the ancest

639
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,278
uh the ancient ancestor of watermelon

640
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,960
but this this population structure

641
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:11,599
another did not support that because you

642
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,319
can see we didn't see any this orange

643
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:16,319
block the orange alo we didn't see in

644
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:19,519
the cultivate species we didn't see any

645
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:21,480
orange block from this uh from the u

646
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,918
from this choleic

647
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:30,000
senses and we uh

648
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:32,720
we haveized that these two species you

649
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,880
can see this have green, blue, orange

650
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,519
and and

651
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:40,640
and this was scion

652
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:44,000
whatever. So that's have this uh all

653
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,320
colors from the cultivate species. So we

654
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,159
uh we hypothesize that this two could be

655
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:53,359
the ancient ancestor of watermelon. But

656
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:56,000
this conclusion is not that uh

657
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:59,479
conclusive you know because we didn't we

658
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,240
didn't sample a lot a lot of

659
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,839
species but we can uh we can rule out

660
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:08,079
this choices as a

661
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:14,199
ancestor and also we uh we found that

662
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:17,759
this one this uh ctoidis or lanatas the

663
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:20,399
subspecies they could be a separate

664
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:21,960
species instead of a sub subspecies

665
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:24,798
based on this population structure

666
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,679
analysis it it's you can say it's highly

667
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:27,679
different from the other

668
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:34,959
species. So we then uh identified the

669
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:38,558
selective swap swap we using the p ratio

670
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:41,360
between the uh the semiwired watermelon

671
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:42,918
and the cable watermelon. So we

672
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:46,879
identified the

673
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:48,120
uh the the select swept across the whole

674
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,360
11

675
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:53,398
chromosomes and one thing that very

676
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:56,798
interesting is that we identified this

677
00:32:53,398 --> 00:33:01,199
uh this this uh uh select swap. You can

678
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:05,119
see this the huge genetic diversity

679
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,038
uh decrease reduction in in this region

680
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:10,639
and we found this region corresponds to

681
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:13,278
a fruit weight CT. So fruit weight is a

682
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,480
major trait that was selected during

683
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:17,839
human

684
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:21,278
domatification. This then we we found

685
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:23,439
this one and also we found a a lot of

686
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:27,720
other interesting stuff that but I will

687
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:30,640
not talk about here due to the time

688
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,159
conference. So watermelon we we we are

689
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,799
it's a major problem as I mentioned

690
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:37,840
before a major problem for watermelon is

691
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:42,879
a disease and we check the watermelon

692
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:45,199
genome we identified 46 MBSR genes

693
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:50,240
that's represent the least number of

694
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,960
MBSR genome genes in any any genomes of

695
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,839
crops you can see

696
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:59,200
uh cubid species normally has very few

697
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:01,918
but watermelon even has less cucumber

698
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,720
and what and the melon and other like

699
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:07,840
tomato you got several hundred but in

700
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,000
water in the watermelon you only have 46

701
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:12,440
that's cause

702
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,358
uh problems for

703
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:17,280
watermelon. So then we think about

704
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:19,519
because the wild species they are highly

705
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,119
resistant to watermelon to dis all kind

706
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:26,320
of different diseases and we hypothesize

707
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,079
that maybe some genes was lost during

708
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,879
the

709
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:31,519
domestification. So we did some

710
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:35,039
analysis. This is this analysis was not

711
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:37,679
done on the uh on the 134 accessions was

712
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:40,639
on 20 accessions we did at the fourth

713
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:44,720
time but the results should be similar.

714
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,960
So we denote we align the reads to the

715
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:50,000
uh reference

716
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:52,720
genome and those that are aligned we do

717
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,119
a denovo assembly. We we divide those

718
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:57,559
unaligned to two different groups. The

719
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:00,079
group one is from the cutwood

720
00:34:57,559 --> 00:35:02,799
watermelon and then the group two

721
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:05,359
includes semi- wild and wild watermelon.

722
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,960
And you can see the group one we didn't

723
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:08,799
find this is this is the gene was

724
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,838
missing in the tomato in the watermelon

725
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:16,400
genome but we didn't find any diseased

726
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:18,400
genes then from the uh the wire species

727
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,039
denovo assembly of those unmapped reads

728
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,480
to the wire species and we found is

729
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:24,279
highly enriched with the disease

730
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,760
resistant

731
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:31,000
genes and we are we then map this risk

732
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,200
to confirm this this is not a uh

733
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,079
sequencing or assembly the arrow

734
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:38,919
whatever or in the in the genome we map

735
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:42,119
the uh the cart

736
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:46,159
reads we we map the reads from this

737
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:48,480
cartas to this genes and none of them

738
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:49,319
was was found. So that means this this

739
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,519
this

740
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:56,119
this genes are are real missing during

741
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:58,480
domestication

742
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:00,160
process. Yeah. So the conclusion is that

743
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,800
a large portion of disease resistant

744
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:05,039
genes have been lost during watermelon

745
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,680
uh domestication. So this domestication

746
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:10,079
process which have focused on desirable

747
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:14,000
fruit trade and yield. So it's not

748
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,000
focused on disease resistance until

749
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
recently. Okay. Next I will talk about

750
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,639
using this this data resequence data we

751
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,079
generate and other resource we generate.

752
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:29,519
I uh show you several examples on how uh

753
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:32,880
we identify QTLs using GWAS approach and

754
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:36,559
also QTL mapping approach.

755
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:39,200
So we did on the uh the uh GW was

756
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:41,440
analysis on form one resistance. We

757
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:44,799
identified QTLs on chromosome one and

758
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:48,000
the chromosome 3 and also found two

759
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,880
resistance. We identified QDR major KDR

760
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,920
in chromosome

761
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:56,039
11 and sugar content we identified a

762
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,039
major on chromosome

763
00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:01,440
2 and this one I will talk a little bit

764
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:04,358
more later you know is a bitterness is a

765
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:07,760
a major trait during uh

766
00:37:04,358 --> 00:37:10,358
domestication and I don't think probably

767
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,079
no one would like to eat a bit

768
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:16,719
watermelon so this is why uh was mapped

769
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,119
to the chromosome one later we clone

770
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:19,118
this

771
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:25,358
gene. So that's using the natural

772
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:27,838
natural accessions the 134 natural

773
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:30,319
accessions to do gbas analysis that

774
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:34,480
proves that it can identify some

775
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:37,800
interesting QTRs. So so we have a a

776
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,960
recominant inbred line population real

777
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:45,039
population. So this real population was

778
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:48,320
derived by cross from this 973 the east

779
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:50,480
Asia ecotype and also this wild

780
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,519
watermelon. So we have whole genome

781
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,960
sequence genova genome sequence for both

782
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:58,719
and we we we generated this real

783
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:02,400
population and we did a shallow genome

784
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:05,919
resequence for this 96 reals and we

785
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,400
generated like 247 gig data and the

786
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:12,039
average genome coverage was about 5.2

787
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:15,920
and 2x for for this real

788
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:18,800
lines. We checked the uh the uh the re

789
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:23,519
combination pattern and also and also

790
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:26,079
the uh the the origin of the uh of the

791
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:29,759
genome from which parent right so this

792
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:32,320
uh this uh blue means that this this

793
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,400
region is from

794
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:40,000
uh nam 3. So red means this region is

795
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:43,280
from that PI from that wild watermelon

796
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,000
and gray mean green means hoacles that

797
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,440
confirm that this this uh population is

798
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,800
high quality. You didn't

799
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:55,519
find any green or I at least I couldn't

800
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,359
find any green from this figure that

801
00:38:55,519 --> 00:39:00,480
hoyagos because this is a highly

802
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:03,838
embedded real population confirm this

803
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,838
the quality of this this

804
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:12,240
population and we you we use this uh uh

805
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:14,639
this population to identify additional

806
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:16,719
cods or kind use kind of like a

807
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:20,719
complimentary approach.

808
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:23,439
for critical mapping and you can see uh

809
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:24,598
this for F1 is confirmed. This is the

810
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,679
peak of the

811
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:30,320
F1 and F one also mapped to the same

812
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:34,480
region at using G was but this one did

813
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:38,559
not map this uh this uh this this locos.

814
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:41,119
But for fun two we identified this major

815
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:44,719
QTR also identified in this population

816
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:48,400
but we identified another QTR on

817
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:48,399
chromosome I believe it's chromosome

818
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:56,319
9 and for content it's confirmed

819
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:59,279
confirmed the g data is also on

820
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:02,160
chromosson 2 we uh we identified this uh

821
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,480
this QTL then we did further analysis we

822
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:09,279
we we mapping them to very nar arrow

823
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,119
region between this this two this two uh

824
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,480
beam

825
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:18,079
markers. So in this within this uh this

826
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,880
region we found a large cluster of uh of

827
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,039
transmembrane sugar

828
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:25,800
transporters and we uh when we compare

829
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:27,800
to uh do some comparative analysis with

830
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:31,960
melon

831
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:35,599
melon sugar criteria also contains this

832
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:39,280
this transm sugar transport. So we did

833
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:45,200
some functional analysis and turns out

834
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:45,200
that one of them indeed can transport

835
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:52,960
sugars. Okay, this is the fine map QL

836
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:55,680
mapping of bitterness trait. So we clone

837
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,519
this gene and first this is uh the GW

838
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:59,838
was

839
00:40:56,519 --> 00:41:02,559
analysis. So it's a uh first map to the

840
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:05,519
to the chromosome one. Then we use this

841
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:10,920
uh uh real population and narrow down to

842
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:15,239
this region and then we use uh 1647 F2

843
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:18,480
population and narrow down to this two

844
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:20,479
markers. So this two markers and it's

845
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,280
highly it's a co- segregated with this

846
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,240
indoor marker. We didn't find any re

847
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,599
combination events for this marker and

848
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:31,598
we narrowed down to

849
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:34,480
uh I think it's about I forgot the the

850
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:39,519
region the region contains five genes

851
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:42,079
and one of them uh we found is 200 base

852
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:48,119
pair of mitochondria sequence inserted

853
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:49,800
at first axon in nonben non non betito

854
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:52,480
accessions.

855
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,920
So, so this 200 base pair of

856
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,199
mitochondria sequence insertion in the

857
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:00,159
nonpent accessions are highly consistent

858
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:02,480
with within this 96 real population and

859
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:05,358
also in the natural population. So in

860
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,318
the natural population we check the they

861
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:10,078
be or they no be and for non beetle

862
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:13,279
accessions they all contain this 200

863
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:16,240
base pair mitochondria secret insertions

864
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,560
for n for beta watermelon they do not

865
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:23,879
contain this one.

866
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:26,679
So I think they are this 200 base pair

867
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:30,318
insertion disrupt the function of this

868
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:33,559
gene then it will not generate that

869
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:37,199
little chemical you

870
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:39,838
know okay here's a uh uh I before I go

871
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:42,159
to that that new project introduced to

872
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:45,239
that new project I would like to uh

873
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:47,759
provide a summary on what I talked so

874
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:49,759
far so firstly is a high quality

875
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,960
reference genome have been generated for

876
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:56,560
an east Asia genotype or ecotype I'm

877
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:59,519
sorry and American ecoype and a wild

878
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:02,400
croid accession. So compatible genomic

879
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:04,679
analysis provide no insights into water

880
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,920
watermelon genome

881
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:11,799
evolution and the resequence of the uh

882
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,200
the genomes of 134 divers watermelon

883
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,240
accessions generate a large

884
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:19,279
comprehensive watermelon genomic

885
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:21,078
varation map. This provide another very

886
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,720
useful

887
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:27,440
resource and based on this uh uh genetic

888
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:29,439
variation map we uh we find that civ

889
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,920
cultivated watermelon had very narrow

890
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,920
genetic diversity that's causing the

891
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,680
bottleneck for uh for watermelon

892
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,599
breeding and also we found that a large

893
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:43,159
portion of disease resistant genes have

894
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:45,920
been lost during watermelon

895
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:48,639
domestication and based on the sequence

896
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,760
analysis We found that this one

897
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:53,639
previously classified as a watermelon

898
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:57,720
species should belong to

899
00:43:53,639 --> 00:44:00,960
welon and the sub species the

900
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:03,799
ctoidis and could be a separate species.

901
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:07,760
It should not be classified as a sub

902
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:10,200
species and g analysis identified from a

903
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:13,440
number of

904
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:16,799
agonomically important traits. So

905
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,679
including the uh the found resistance,

906
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,839
sugar contents, fruit size and the bet

907
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:24,399
gene was further cloned through QTL fine

908
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:26,400
mapping. So we are in the process of

909
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,880
doing functional confirmation of this

910
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,880
business

911
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:35,279
gene. So last I will spend like two or

912
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:38,400
three minutes talk about this uh uh kick

913
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:41,280
cap project. So this is a newly funded

914
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,760
project by USDA is for through the

915
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,839
specialty crop

916
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:48,160
program. So the title of this project is

917
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:50,679
leveraging applied genomics to increase

918
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:53,358
disease resistance in cuca

919
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:56,000
crops. This is a beginning of a new

920
00:44:53,358 --> 00:45:01,000
project to develop additional genomic

921
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
resources for the cucida community.

922
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:07,280
uh Rebecca Gumat from Michigan State is

923
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:10,880
the PI of the project and we have 21

924
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:13,839
copiis and from 11 institutions. So I'm

925
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:16,599
the uh the leader of the genomic and the

926
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:20,078
bionformatic team and

927
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:22,559
Michael Mazuric is for from plant

928
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:25,519
breeding department is the lead he's

929
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:30,279
leading the squash team and also

930
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:30,280
Christian also involved in this project.

931
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:35,239
So we have uh this project have three

932
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:37,679
objectives the big

933
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:40,159
objectives. The first one is a develop

934
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:43,118
genomics and a bionformatics breeding

935
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:47,519
tool kits for accelerate crop

936
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,519
improvement across the cubit

937
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:53,440
cubitization and the second is perform

938
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:57,440
genomic asset breeding to integrates

939
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:59,519
disease resistance in cubit cardio.

940
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,559
So the third one is perform economic

941
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:05,440
impact analysis of cost of production

942
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:07,239
and disease control and provide readily

943
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,720
accessible information to facil

944
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:10,719
facilitate disease

945
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:17,119
control. So I'm highlighting several

946
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:19,838
points. So because the these three uh

947
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:23,358
big objectives have a lot of small

948
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:25,759
objectives I I I I can't go to too much

949
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:29,719
detail. So in the uh in the

950
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:32,560
bionformatics team there are two main

951
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:35,679
objectives. The first one is uh perform

952
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:39,039
GBS analysis of PI that means jump plot

953
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:44,318
collections of the four species. We uh

954
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:46,639
we probably uh do GBS for about 1500

955
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:50,239
collections for each species. That's

956
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:53,440
that's about 6,000 species. Then we we

957
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:55,919
uh from those species based on the TBS

958
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,880
uh information we identify a core

959
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,559
collection of

960
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:03,039
384 accession for each of the four

961
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:06,199
species that can be used for the

962
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:10,318
community uh used as a comm community

963
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:12,439
resource for gass analysis. So in total

964
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:17,679
we we probably do uh

965
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:17,679
10,000 uh do do genotyping for 10,000

966
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:24,239
accessions. We uh we provide access to

967
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:27,519
cucub genomic tools and a database while

968
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:29,439
this international uh uh cucub genomic

969
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:32,559
initiative website. This website was

970
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:35,280
developed by my group about like seven

971
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:37,960
or eight years ago was also maintained.

972
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:41,280
So this database was developed in my

973
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,800
group during the past like seven or

974
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,599
eight years. I didn't get any funding

975
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:48,400
for this database but now finally we got

976
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,599
some funding to do this. So we we we we

977
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,358
plan to make a huge improvement of this

978
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:55,280
database. We did get some small money

979
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:57,559
from the company but that's not compared

980
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:01,519
to this big

981
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:04,559
one. So here is a list of of diseases

982
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:08,318
that they focused in this project.

983
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:11,679
So this uh the uh ferasm revealed that's

984
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:15,039
a major focus for watermelon and dy

985
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:17,559
mildo is for cucumber and also we have

986
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:21,318
others the gummy

987
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:24,799
stem and also the

988
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:26,400
viruses. Okay so with that I would like

989
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:30,318
to thank everyone involved in this

990
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:32,960
project. This is a a huge consortium and

991
00:48:30,318 --> 00:48:35,679
