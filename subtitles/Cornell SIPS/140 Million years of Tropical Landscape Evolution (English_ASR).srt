1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,800
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,400
University I did a a sabatical two years

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,118
ago I think three years ago I forgot

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,760
already in New Haven and then we have

5
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:22,160
this big do you think we can turn the

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,160
the first row of lights

7
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:30,000
please we have this uh bigest snow storm

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,679
I think after the hurricane sanding and

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,640
and I spent about three days trying to

10
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:38,200
get out of my house I did I did my PhD

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,640
in Florida and I thought I knew what

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,840
Winters were about and then I go to New

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,079
England I spent one very long long

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,280
winter there and then I I sent these

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,840
photos to camil and Monica and they told

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,239
me no that happen in in itaka every

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,280
single day for a few

18
00:00:54,238 --> 00:01:00,839
months so I learned really that I love

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,840
the tropics that's what I

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,280
now if you are a plant biologist

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,118
probably I don't need to tell you but if

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,759
you are a geologist the diversity in the

23
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:12,438
Tropic sounds really amazing so one

24
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:16,400
Hector in Ecuador has most more species

25
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:18,758
of trees than the entire Continental USA

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,118
so it's a huge latitudinal gradient in

27
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:25,319
diversity from the tropics to to

28
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:28,118
temperate latitudes and and St has been

29
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:31,679
in Panama for almost 100 years last year

30
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:33,879
we missan put a 100 Years of research in

31
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,560
the tropics because we all there are

32
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:37,560
very interesting in understanding why

33
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,159
there are so many species in the tropics

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,759
and you have to answer that question

35
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,719
from many different point of view

36
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:49,519
because it's not that an easy question

37
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:52,000
to answer but first let's say what is a

38
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:55,920
tropical neotropical rainforce so what

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,840
during the next 50 minutes is what I I

40
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,320
will Define as a as a tropical

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,719
rainforest it's a part combination of

42
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:06,078
climactic parameters floristic

43
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:08,359
composition Forest structure and plant

44
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:11,199
fomy that's what I'm referring to a

45
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:15,040
neotropical rainforest so a climate if

46
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:17,839
the Minal precipitation is about 1.8 m a

47
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:20,560
year so it's rains a lot the Minal

48
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,439
temperature is about 18 degrees celus

49
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,719
the floristics if the if the the forest

50
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:29,199
dominate abundance and diversity by

51
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:32,878
certain families plant families like Fai

52
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:35,839
moresi and on AC for B

53
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,759
AC also by the forest structure that the

54
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,920
the forest is multi-stratified so you

55
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:43,399
have several layers of the forest and

56
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,679
also that the top layer that is called

57
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,480
the canopy is

58
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,800
closed and is dominated by anges by

59
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:53,439
flower imp plants by close means that if

60
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,040
you get this photo was taken from a

61
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:58,000
canopy crane something we have a St in

62
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:59,959
Panama is like a capsule that you can go

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,959
and see the forest from above that that

64
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:04,199
is something that is very hard to see

65
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:05,959
from the ground when you go and and see

66
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:08,639
the forest from above you realize that

67
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,560
every single space in this canopy is

68
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,598
covered with a leaf because most of the

69
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,840
Light in the Forest is trapped within

70
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:17,079
the few meters so the trees they really

71
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,239
need to to reach the canopy they want to

72
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:23,560
do a lot of photosynthesis and also

73
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,560
plant physynergy

74
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:36,199
without edges and also has a drip de so

75
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,559
when I see this characteristics is what

76
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:40,798
I will call an neotropical

77
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,840
rainforest now if you want to track

78
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,239
vegetation over time well probably all

79
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,438
your data will come from Continental

80
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:53,400
sequences and having a tool to be able

81
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:55,719
to date the Continental rocks is very

82
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,000
important otherwise you always be lost

83
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:00,560
in time and you don't have for aifer or

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,680
anop Plum to do that

85
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,840
to do that we we to solve that problem

86
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,879
we use pinology this is a real example

87
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,680
of a well drill by a an oil company in

88
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:14,798
Colombia just before I joined this

89
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,280
company like 13 years ago just after I

90
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,600
finished my PhD I start working for this

91
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,319
oil company and and this is a

92
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,000
cross-section of the food Hills in

93
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:27,279
Colombia and this is the well they drill

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,319
and as you can see here in the first

95
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:33,319
track they did they drill from here here

96
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:36,240
to here over our almost three months

97
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:38,159
they spent $20 million from here to here

98
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,360
and as you can see they were parallel to

99
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,680
the same bed so they thought they were

100
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,800
going across the strata but they were

101
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,280
really along the same time profile

102
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,280
because they didn't have a tool to

103
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:52,799
during the drilling to say well we are

104
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:55,279
stuck in time we need to change the

105
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,120
direction of the of the drilling bit so

106
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:00,079
I joined this company and over many

107
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,120
years we use pollen as a tool to solve

108
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:05,038
this problem and in the tropics penology

109
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,399
has been used for almost 60 years

110
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:10,319
because plan evolution is a fantastic

111
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:12,399
tool to track time over time so we

112
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:15,399
develop some that is called a

113
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:18,359
biographics on Asia so we went to many

114
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:22,198
different sites in Colombia Venezuela

115
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,520
and Ecuador and we count a lot of pollen

116
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,639
grains almost a million polling grain so

117
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:29,279
you you realize I really love polling

118
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,400
grain so many size many different

119
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,159
samples

120
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:37,079
and based on all this information we

121
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:39,039
develop a biographic sonation that that

122
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:42,399
is basically a hypothesis on plan

123
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:44,399
Evolution on when a particular species

124
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,959
originate when that particular species

125
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:50,679
go extinct and so forance this is an

126
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:52,758
example of one of the of the events in

127
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,199
this zonation and this is the extension

128
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:58,080
of this particular species tell us that

129
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,720
we are in 61.9 million years the

130
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,159
advantage of working with old companies

131
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,680
is that every time you do this bio

132
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,960
sonation you have you are testing that

133
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,240
hypothesis in the next drilling rig and

134
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,799
if you do a mistake and you tell them

135
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,879
that you are in 65 and you are in 61 and

136
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,960
they end in a different rock you know

137
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:19,598
right away that your hypothesis was not

138
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:23,279
correct and you will have to find a new

139
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:26,240
job and we develop a a method called

140
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:29,359
maximum we use a maximum likelihood

141
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,280
approach to assess the probability of a

142
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,879
given of assigning an age to Any Given

143
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:38,839
sample so in instead of saying oh this

144
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:41,478
rock is a late myosin we say we use a

145
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:44,038
pro bar and it will tell us the

146
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:46,318
confidence we are on any given age for

147
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:50,360
every particular sample so for instance

148
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:53,879
this sample here taken at 400 m has a

149
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:57,479
probability of having this age uh with

150
00:06:53,879 --> 00:07:00,719
this probity so we are doing that for

151
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:05,079
every sample we date in our

152
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,639
analysis now you also have to consider

153
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:10,839
climate now this idea that the tropical

154
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:12,280
La tropical plants need live very close

155
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:15,318
to the optimal

156
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:17,719
temperature has been really rooted in in

157
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:19,800
the literature for many years and it's

158
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,919
very easy to understand why you will say

159
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,520
something like that so in this graphic

160
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:27,359
we have me anual temperature here and

161
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:30,439
here me anual precipitation and every of

162
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,759
these dots represent a floristic plot

163
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:36,120
within the tropical belt and as you can

164
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,000
see here you by changing the

165
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,879
precipitation you can go from a tropical

166
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,680
rainforest here in red to a dry forest

167
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:47,360
in blue to a a savannah a grassland or

168
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:51,319
to a desert here in green but also you

169
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,598
notice that you don't find almost any

170
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:57,598
tropical forest no matter what you where

171
00:07:53,598 --> 00:08:00,120
you are above 28° C so you may think

172
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:04,038
well that's that's the the

173
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,759
the optimal for tropical plants today

174
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:08,839
however if

175
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,879
you search the temperatures of the

176
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:13,758
tropical land within the tropics

177
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,560
represented here by this red line you

178
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,000
will realize that there is not really a

179
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:23,000
place within the tropical belt that has

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,680
a minimal temperature above 28 28 point

181
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,478
degre celsus so perhaps plant tropical

182
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,158
plants cannot leave Beyond 28 because

183
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:33,158
there are not really many places in the

184
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:36,599
tropics today with a temperature higher

185
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:39,240
of 28° C now if you are a geologist

186
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:43,519
probably you know this have seen

187
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:45,200
this cure many times and it represent

188
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,440
the proxy for the temperature of the

189
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,640
botton of the ocean by measure the Delta

190
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:55,120
o of foraminifer ventic foraminifer

191
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:56,958
going back from Zer to 120 million years

192
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,879
and as you and this is a very good proxy

193
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,919
for Global temperature of the bottom of

194
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,600
the ocean that could be correlated to

195
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:06,120
the ambient temperature of the planet

196
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,120
and when you compare today with most of

197
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:13,360
the the the last 120 million years we

198
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:16,679
realized that being in a cool planet is

199
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,240
a very rare compared to most of the the

200
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:21,639
over the past 200 million years so most

201
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,720
of the time the planet has been much

202
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:27,600
warmer than today now for years we have

203
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,440
this dichotomy we thought well perhaps

204
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,959
the tropics are very stable and the

205
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,320
Tropics work like a thermostat so no

206
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:37,319
matter if the global planet is warming

207
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,760
or cooling the the the temperature in

208
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,920
the tropics will be always stable so

209
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,559
will will something like that you the

210
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,120
poles get warmer or cooler but the

211
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:48,719
tropics are always static and because

212
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,600
it's very stable climate that the reason

213
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,920
we have so many species there now over

214
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,759
the past 10 years we have been using

215
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:59,799
different techniques to assess the

216
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:03,480
temperature of the tropics during past

217
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:06,359
Global warmings and as you can see here

218
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:09,759
we are using plants Tex

219
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,959
86 biomarket in a in a molecule in the

220
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,799
ocean isotop on foraminifera one of

221
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:19,919
these techniques for instance this this

222
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:23,199
snake body Ling of a of a snake we that

223
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:25,360
is called tanon that we found in the

224
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,759
seron formation about 60 million years

225
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,759
old in the northern part of Colombia

226
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:35,799
just for comparison this this is a a mod

227
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:40,319
boa of 4 M 4 M long so this Titan was

228
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:43,838
about 45 to 50 ft long about 1 meter in

229
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,440
diameter and weigh about a ton and was

230
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,440
very common in the paleos of the

231
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:52,600
tropical forest of Colombia and today if

232
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,760
you if you measure the how long a snake

233
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,000
is versus where do they live because

234
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:59,078
they cannot control the inter temper

235
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,120
internal temperature you will realize

236
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:03,120
that there's a very good correlation

237
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,039
between the land of the snake and the

238
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,000
and the minol temperature of a place and

239
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:10,000
when we apply that to the F record we

240
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
realized that the tropics were much

241
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,200
warmer before than they are now we did

242
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,039
this compilation of all the empirical

243
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:22,920
data we have on tropical temperature for

244
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:26,958
the past 120 million years about 9 5,000

245
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:32,120
like 6,000 data points across the entire

246
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:35,039
geological span from 25 to today and you

247
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,000
will see that in the mid Cretaceous the

248
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,078
and this is just for the tropical Bel

249
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,639
the temperature the minol temperature

250
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:45,599
were about 7° C warmer than today during

251
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:48,680
the early Soso in mostly during the

252
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,720
early eosin the temperature was about 4

253
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:56,039
point de C warmer than today so the

254
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,440
graphic in the tropical belt will be

255
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:00,679
will look like that the temperature in

256
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,639
the Tropic has been warmer than today

257
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:05,759
and probably you already know that the

258
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:08,278
CO2 has been also much higher than it is

259
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,278
now the last time we have such a low

260
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:13,278
levels of CO2 you will have to go back

261
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:15,720
to the Carboniferous and so CO2 has been

262
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:18,600
the constant rather than high CO2 has

263
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,519
been a constant on the planet now let's

264
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,680
see the tropical fossil

265
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:27,560
record now we are going to divide this

266
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:30,039
the block that follows in two different

267
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:32,759
settings one the creation and other

268
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:35,278
Theos because the floras in the tropical

269
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,278
be are really fundamentally different

270
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,759
and so I call the crasus a non anos

271
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:42,159
sperm Tropical

272
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,759
World we know from the Poland record

273
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:47,838
that the oldest angiosperm don't have

274
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:49,958
any geographical pattern so we find them

275
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,680
both in high latitudes mid latitudes and

276
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:56,159
low latitude we still don't know really

277
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:58,319
where the all this angiosperm the the

278
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:01,919
the belt the latitudinal Bel that the

279
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,399
oldest SP originate one of the oldest

280
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:07,198
fossils are very tiny plant plants like

281
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,839
AR fructus fructus from

282
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:14,519
China now this paper was published about

283
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:17,000
20 years ago by liard and Peter K and he

284
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:19,320
compiled all the literature we have

285
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,639
about the all the plants within the

286
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,079
cretes and he produced this graphic that

287
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:26,519
has been used many many times showing

288
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:28,559
how the angel spurn were very few at the

289
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:33,240
beginning of the Cretaceous and by the

290
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,239
end of the aous the anges Dominate the

291
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:38,360
Flores you can and if you see all the

292
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:41,039
data points he used for analysis you

293
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:44,800
will realize that in the trop this is

294
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:47,480
age and this is Paleo latitude of microf

295
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,559
floras and and poen Flores that most of

296
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,079
the data he used came from tempered

297
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:56,838
regions he didn't have at this time any

298
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:59,159
any publ locality within the tropics for

299
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,519
the entire cretes and most of the

300
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:03,719
samples for the polling were done for by

301
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,399
a strateg graphy always just focusing a

302
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,360
few markers that were used by all

303
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:12,120
companies especially in Nigeria and

304
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,079
Brazil now when you look at the philogen

305
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:18,000
so plant Banis they take all the plants

306
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:19,879
they analyze DNA and produce these

307
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,879
philogen that where you express the

308
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:24,720
relationship on taxa many of the

309
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,000
philologist and the new philologist are

310
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,560
confirming this that most of the orders

311
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,278
of the angiosperm were evolved

312
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:34,799
by the senan about 100 million years 90

313
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:36,360
to 100 million years ago as as you can

314
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:39,559
see

315
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:43,199
here now this led us to publish this

316
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:46,838
paper 10 years ago with Chuck Davis from

317
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:49,439
University of Harvard saying well we we

318
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:52,720
we have all these families and orders

319
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,759
back in the M cretes therefore you will

320
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,480
expect to find a a mod tropical

321
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,519
rainforest tropical rainforest similar

322
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,839
to what we call today a tropical

323
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:05,198
rainforest back in the mid Cretaceous

324
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:07,680
and we published this paper in American

325
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:10,319
naturalist but at this time I have very

326
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:13,679
little record empirical record from

327
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,120
tropical plants and over the past 10

328
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:18,439
years we have been working very hard on

329
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,919
assessing the record and now I think we

330
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,680
were totally

331
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:27,919
wrong we don't see a that in the fal

332
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:30,039
record so we go back 136 million years

333
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:33,958
and to Easter Colombia this beautiful

334
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:37,078
Flora called s Felix not a single angos

335
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:39,719
sperm we move up in time to the opan

336
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:42,239
alvan and it's still the angos sper in

337
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,399
abundance are very very very little

338
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,360
about only 2% of the entire pal Flor

339
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:49,720
when you do countings of the different

340
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,879
elements of the

341
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,879
Flor you go into the middle cenomanian

342
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:59,039
with all the phog are saying well most

343
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:01,159
of the angern are already the orders are

344
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,639
already there and still the angp

345
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:07,198
represent just a small percentage of the

346
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:09,720
Abundant distributions of the

347
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:12,159
Flores even more that the the

348
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,319
latitudinal gradient in the ear

349
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:17,719
Cretaceous is either flat or inverted so

350
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:19,519
when you compare the diversity from

351
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,000
temporate latitude to the tropical to

352
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,919
the tropical latitude the the high

353
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,919
gradient we see today is is not there

354
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:31,159
now let's move to the end of the

355
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:34,240
citation to the mastrian so we have been

356
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:39,000
working on these coal mines in close to

357
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:42,278
Bogota so this this guy goes down in

358
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
these mines about 300 met and you can

359
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:48,759
see all the fossil plants in in the in

360
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,879
the roofs of of the coal mines and but

361
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:54,000
something very striking about this Flor

362
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:57,240
is that it like the typical components

363
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,799
of the modern tropical forest has many

364
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:03,318
palms and many families or taxa that we

365
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:05,519
don't have any idea what are they when

366
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:08,678
we compare the floristic composition of

367
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:11,160
this mastrian Flora with today most

368
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:13,480
common elements most common families in

369
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,839
tropical forest here represent by These

370
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,360
graay Bars and in red we have the

371
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,558
families we find in the mastrian Flora

372
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:22,318
you will see that the water this

373
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:24,599
mastrian Flora is not really

374
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,838
floristically a tropical

375
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,959
rainforest it's a forest that lives in

376
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:32,200
the tropics but is very different from

377
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,160
the forest we have today in the tropics

378
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,880
now you go back you go back to the

379
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,759
Cretaceous thary boundary probably all

380
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,559
have here about the the meteorite strike

381
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:45,038
the yukatan peninsula when you look at

382
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:47,558
the the pollen record in tropical

383
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:49,798
latitudes in Colombia especially we have

384
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:52,399
been working on a few cores one of this

385
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:54,720
is called the Alito where you can with

386
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,960
Poland you can get to a very fine

387
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,480
statgraphic resolution and you look at

388
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,759
the pollen the diversity of the

389
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,720
Poland going from 70 million to 62

390
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:08,480
million you see we saw a big sharp

391
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:11,319
decrease in the in the diversity and

392
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:15,480
about 75% of all the species that

393
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:18,399
wearing the mrican go extinct and this

394
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,558
level is also represent a fundamental

395
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,320
change in the Abundant distribution of

396
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:26,200
the Flor we went from a Flor where only

397
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:29,038
50% were angiosperm to a Florida is

398
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,919
already fully dominated by angiosperms

399
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,359
in the paleos not only that but when you

400
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,200
look at the abundance distribution of

401
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:38,558
the seeds and fruits you will see that

402
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,120
in the mastrian Flora all the fruits or

403
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:43,240
seeds are very tiny while in the in the

404
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:45,279
paleoin you have a wide distribution

405
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,440
from the small seed to Big seeds of

406
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:51,960
fruit that you can see here so I I think

407
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,640
this this event the tertiary the

408
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,759
Cretaceous ter event changed

409
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,400
fundamentally the structure and

410
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:00,279
composition of the tropical rainforest

411
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,120
we from a forest where the canopy

412
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:05,119
probably was open and dominated by

413
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:07,639
gymnosperms at alaras probably to the

414
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:09,000
canop closed canopy dominated by anger

415
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:13,120
we know

416
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,480
today we can look also at the venation

417
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:18,639
density in the fossil leaves so these

418
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:22,360
are closeups of fossil leaves and as you

419
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,880
can see we can see the very fine bation

420
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:25,798
of the of the leaves back in the pelosin

421
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,919
or the

422
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:31,279
mastrian now if you go today to a Rain

423
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:33,440
forest and you measure the venation

424
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,519
density of all the leaves from the

425
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,798
bottom of the forest to the top of the

426
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,359
forest you will see that there is a

427
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:42,798
strong bodal distribution so in the

428
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:45,158
canopy you have a very high venation

429
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:49,079
density and in the under story you have

430
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:50,960
low venation density and it's probably

431
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:52,480
you you could explain that because well

432
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,319
if you are here in the canopy you want

433
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,519
to maximize the amount of photosynthesis

434
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:58,439
you want to do because you are exposed

435
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:00,279
to the light and if you are in the in

436
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,759
the lower level with the light is very

437
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:05,119
diminished you don't spend so much

438
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:07,480
energy having a lot of veins because you

439
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:10,038
cannot do a lot of photosynthesis but

440
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,960
you you can see that this closed canopy

441
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:14,158
will give you this bodal distribution of

442
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,360
the forest

443
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,840
today and you see that in the liter so

444
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,000
you go underneath the forest and you

445
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:23,158
collect the leaves in the liter you will

446
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,679
see the same Bodel distribution that you

447
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:29,240
see represented in the forest

448
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,640
today we compare the the venation

449
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,359
density of many different floras within

450
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:37,000
the tropics and temporate latitude from

451
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:39,918
from the alterian to the paleos as you

452
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,519
can see here and only until the paleos

453
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,840
we see this bodal distribution that this

454
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:47,079
typical of modern tropical rainfor is

455
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:49,359
represented here in Black compared to

456
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,599
all the different distribution we see

457
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,199
during the

458
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:55,038
cretas we think this is an evidence that

459
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,798
not only the fistic composition changed

460
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:59,119
but also the structure of the forest

461
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:01,798
itself changed as well

462
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:04,439
now this change I think not only

463
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:07,200
affected the forest itself but also the

464
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,360
climate probably I think Camila told me

465
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:13,038
that Kevin Boyce came here a few months

466
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:16,719
ago to give a seminar and Kevin did this

467
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:19,319
beautiful study where he did a climatic

468
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,038
modeling of the Amazonia but instead of

469
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:24,119
having angos sperm he put gymnos sperms

470
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:27,558
and because the gymnos have a very low

471
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:29,119
venation density the leaves are smaller

472
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:31,678
they a transpiration

473
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:34,359
or the photosynthesis they do is slower

474
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:37,200
than the anus so he run this climatic

475
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:39,278
modeling and the results were really

476
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,600
staggering so just by changing the

477
00:21:39,278 --> 00:21:45,599
forest from a angiosperm to genos sperm

478
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:47,278
the temperature represented here by the

479
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:48,759
the precipitation represented here by

480
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:52,240
the blue of the

481
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:55,319
gnos no the by the yellow the the

482
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,919
geosphere the precipitation dropped by

483
00:21:55,319 --> 00:22:02,000
35% and the temperature increased by 3

484
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:04,440
degrees C and the L of the dry season

485
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,079
increased by two month so having a

486
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:11,240
gymnos forest there make the tropics

487
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:12,720
warmer and and drier just because the

488
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,319
effect of the transpiration of the

489
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,159
leaves had on the on the climate itself

490
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:19,200
about half of the rainfall that happen

491
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:22,880
in the Tropic today comes from the

492
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:26,840
transpiration of the plants

493
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:29,120
themselves so the

494
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:31,639
lessons I think we we can learn from the

495
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:35,119
Cretaceous that but the the end of the

496
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:38,120
Cretaceous the angos lack biomass bio

497
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:40,158
biomass dominance and did not rule most

498
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:42,719
of the landscape in the tropics even

499
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:45,840
though they were Diversified it doesn't

500
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,120
transer that into ecological dominance

501
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:51,278
that probably they were a lot of TRS and

502
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:53,798
herbaceous and mostly come in in flood

503
00:22:51,278 --> 00:22:55,759
Plaines and dist habitats and I think

504
00:22:53,798 --> 00:22:58,480
it's a fantastic example how

505
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:00,240
morphological Innovation all these

506
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,679
characteristics that make an angiosperm

507
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:07,400
and angiosperm lacks ecological success

508
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,200
by at least 55 million years and also

509
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:14,038
that the the change in landscape

510
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:16,400
occupancy lead to a change in tropical

511
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:19,038
climate now let's go to the second

512
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,679
chapter the the entire sosid where we

513
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:24,679
see a canopy that is already dominated

514
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,400
by yerm and I'm show you going to show

515
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:29,360
you one of the oldest tropical

516
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,559
rainforest as I Define it that we know

517
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:36,038
today and it's from suron just to keep

518
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:37,918
in mind the seron is within the

519
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:40,839
precipitation rate of modern tropical

520
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,919
rainforest but the temperature was about

521
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:45,000
a degree and a half warmer than any

522
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:48,679
tropical rainforest

523
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,038
today and that's how we think that the

524
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:54,400
this rainforest look like with these

525
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:57,119
giant snakes and huge massive crocodiles

526
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,440
and big turtles we have been studying

527
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:02,678
this in the in the s Coal Mine this is

528
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,440
the biggest open pit coal mine in the

529
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:07,759
world every year they remove the same

530
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,360
amount of material that was removed to

531
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:12,599
construct the Panama Canal and the the

532
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:15,399
mine has been operated for almost 35

533
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:19,519
years it produce about 3 million tons of

534
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:21,519
coal per year just to give you a a sense

535
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:25,278
of the size of this mine there are about

536
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:29,558
seven pits like this one and

537
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:31,960
this this here this tiny dot here is one

538
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:35,278
of these if you have been in a coal mine

539
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:38,399
one of these huge trucks that

540
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:41,720
uh that people in the Min industry use

541
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:44,879
that so it allow us an amazing

542
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:47,120
opportunity to to look for fossils so

543
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,120
it's just a collage of many of the

544
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:54,879
typical plants we find in in in the

545
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:57,119
suron we have legums many other fossils

546
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,559
now as we did from with the mastrian

547
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:02,519
when you compare the seron the pelosin

548
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:04,599
and in red the families we find in the

549
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:05,639
fossil record there with the modern

550
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:08,398
families today you see that

551
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,120
floristically seron is already a

552
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:13,519
neotropical

553
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:16,719
rainforest as I told you we have this

554
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:19,119
not only the the forest the biomass was

555
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,880
very large but also all the the animal

556
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:24,439
seems to be really

557
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:27,240
huge we did that this model of Tiano

558
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:30,278
this is my son you see has a very long

559
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:32,919
hair and and I haven't been able to for

560
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:36,440
him to cut the hair because he said I'm

561
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:38,720
jealous that he has so this model has

562
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,960
been traveling for the past two years

563
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:47,159
now it's a museum in I think

564
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:48,640
in Seattle and uh did was done by an

565
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:52,360
artist in

566
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,679
Canada so the the the seron also show us

567
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:56,199
that the families that dominated the

568
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:59,720
rainforest in the paleoin are still

569
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:02,798
dominating the exan neotropical rain

570
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:06,120
Forest now when you move from the paleos

571
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:09,798
in up in time you will find

572
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:12,319
this called the PM the paleos eosine

573
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:14,038
thermal maximum and this is a a unique

574
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,240
interval in Earth history that people

575
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:18,359
have been a study all over the world for

576
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,240
many years because it's probably the

577
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:23,678
closest analog to the warming we are

578
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:28,519
having today the temperature went up by

579
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:30,278
5 to 7° C in in 10,000 years that even

580
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:32,240
though probably the fastest in the

581
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:36,278
geological record is about 10 times

582
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,278
lower to what is happening

583
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,640
nowadays

584
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,720
when when you see all the climate models

585
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,440
that have been done to be able to

586
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,839
reproduce the

587
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,320
PTM the only way to reach the

588
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:54,439
temperature of high latitudes to the

589
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:57,558
empirical levels that we know happen

590
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,960
during the PTM is pumping a lot of CO2

591
00:26:57,558 --> 00:27:01,200
in the atmosphere

592
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:05,240
so in this particular Model H and

593
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:08,558
cavalero they they had to go to 4,500

594
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:11,839
ppms of CO2 remember today we are in 402

595
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:15,119
bpms that's the only way you can reach

596
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:18,000
the temperature that we find in the high

597
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:22,479
latitudes but when that happen you see

598
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,839
here in the South America they they uh

599
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,599
propose that you just have a dead zone

600
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:31,199
in the tropics because the temperature

601
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:33,319
will reach Beyond 45° C of minan

602
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,558
temperature so it means that during

603
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:38,200
middle of the day the temperature can go

604
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:42,079
up to 90°

605
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:45,399
C so we have been now because the PTM is

606
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:49,199
only 10,000 years is the beginning and

607
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:51,038
the warming and then 190,000 years for

608
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,759
the cooling so the whole interval is

609
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:56,960
only is only 200,000 years and in rock

610
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:59,158
that could be represented but only 1

611
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,679
meter or 2 meter depend sedimentation

612
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:05,840
rates so we spent many many years almost

613
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:09,080
15 years I I look for many different

614
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:11,639
sections all over Colombia and Venezuela

615
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:14,639
and finally we find three sites where we

616
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,880
were absolutely sure that the PTM was

617
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,120
located we one of those we have to go

618
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,919
with the a helicopter and the Colombian

619
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:25,319
army look likes geology so much that

620
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:28,159
they went with us to collect in this

621
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:31,158
particular site and this is those are

622
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:34,640
are the three sides and here this bar

623
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:37,440
represent this block represent the PM

624
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,080
and in green are the taxa that are

625
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,320
present in both and this is pollen in

626
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:45,079
the three panels and as you can see we

627
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:46,720
we found the opposite to what we were

628
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:50,000
expecting we were expecting a high

629
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,880
levels of Extinction during the PM and

630
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,919
very low levels of origination and what

631
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,120
we saw was just the opposite that the

632
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:58,919
there is a a huge spike in the

633
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:02,158
origination rate

634
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:03,960
in the PTM and the levels of Extinction

635
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,679
are very

636
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,319
low so we when we calculate the per

637
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:11,798
capita origination of exension rate we

638
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:17,038
see that during the PTM the origination

639
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:19,599
went up not an high exension as we we

640
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:21,798
anticipated now when you look at the

641
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:25,278
many different phog of different plant

642
00:29:21,798 --> 00:29:29,000
groups like The Orchids or the ptic

643
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:31,278
firms even the original form of Art our

644
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,440
agriculture but this is very tricky on

645
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:35,798
The Dating itself but many of them seems

646
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,880
to show that during the early in

647
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:38,879
something is really

648
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:47,879
happening now that also beg the question

649
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,079
that probably this cl cl climate model

650
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:54,600
is not correct because would be very

651
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:56,839
hard to to explain how can a plant live

652
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:59,759
at A Min anal temperature of 50 degrees

653
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:02,558
C that's almost at the physical limit of

654
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:04,679
many of those plants so it means that

655
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:07,119
that we don't have a very good way to

656
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:09,399
reproduce the climate during global

657
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:11,599
warming there there's something missing

658
00:30:09,398 --> 00:30:13,839
in the climate system that we don't

659
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:16,359
understand that is amplifying the

660
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:18,879
warming in the poles while maintaining

661
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:20,719
what by and also increasing the

662
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,919
temperature in the PO in the equator but

663
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,960
not at a high degree as we see that in

664
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,559
the post there something something

665
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,558
really missing perhaps the C two

666
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:34,158
sensitivity is larger than 3 de cus that

667
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:39,200
we have been assuming for a long long

668
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:41,360
time now we continue up in time you will

669
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,880
see during the

670
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:47,038
entire paleos eosine osine and

671
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,840
myosin and this is once again the

672
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:51,640
temperature of the bottom of the ocean

673
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:53,759
and if you move in this direction is one

674
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:56,679
you move in the direction is cool and

675
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:59,240
this is the plan diversity of the

676
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:00,798
northern neotropics look through the

677
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,798
Poland record and as you can see there

678
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:05,599
is a good correlation between the

679
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:08,079
long-term trends in warming and

680
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:11,240
increasing diversity and the long-term

681
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:13,759
trends in Cooling and the droing

682
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:16,399
diversity and we see that happen in a

683
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:19,638
very short time scale like the PTM and a

684
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:23,879
long time scale during the

685
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:25,759
senos now it seems like every few weeks

686
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,200
there is a new paper in Nature and

687
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:31,038
Science anticipating the collapse lapse

688
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,759
of all the the ecosystems in the tropics

689
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:36,480
because of the current global

690
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:38,519
warming and well there are many bad

691
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,399
things that happen to plants when you

692
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:44,720
increase the temperature so the the net

693
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:48,319
production decreased due to increased

694
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:51,480
respiration the photosynthesis slow down

695
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:55,720
yeah many bad things a lot of leaf

696
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:58,038
stress so how come this we anticipate

697
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,639
that the plants will not function very

698
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:02,879
well the temperature is very high but

699
00:31:59,638 --> 00:32:04,719
the fossil record show the opposite well

700
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,080
really the temperature of the leaf is

701
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,679
controlled mostly by the temperature of

702
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:13,000
the Earth the CO2 and the moisture in

703
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,720
the soil it's not only temperature and

704
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,119
when we go back to the paleos for

705
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,519
instance we always see high levels of

706
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:22,879
CO2 and high levels of rainfall we can

707
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:25,960
assess rainfall by looking at the leaf

708
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,120
area the bigger the area of the fossil

709
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,038
leaves the bigger the precipitation and

710
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:33,319
so we can assess the precipitation of a

711
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:36,798
given Flora in this case the sah was 3.5

712
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:39,398
3.4 M of rainfall and there are many

713
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:41,079
experiments has shown that The Temper

714
00:32:39,398 --> 00:32:43,278
the photosynthesis of the

715
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:45,480
planting the plant can do a better

716
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:48,638
photosynthesis at a higher temperature

717
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:51,919
when the CO2 are higher especially if

718
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:55,158
the precipitation Elevate the negative

719
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:58,240
effect of the warming in this experiment

720
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:00,360
we do with the Cloud Winter eici ology

721
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,359
at the strike where we put all these

722
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:06,479
plants in enclosure with the CO2 was

723
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,519
double of the amount that we have today

724
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,079
and here then black is the experiment

725
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:13,440
with the elevated CO2 and gray is the

726
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:17,199
experiment with the the CO2 we we have

727
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,840
today in all of the cases the pl plant

728
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,600
water use efficiency increases as the

729
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:24,558
CO2 goes up and this is just the

730
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:27,398
proportion of the water that the plant

731
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:31,879
uses versus the proportion of the water

732
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:34,719
that the plan losses in the in the

733
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:36,480
photosynthesis and evap transpiration so

734
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,200
it means that when you have a lot of CO2

735
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,880
the plants don't need to use as much

736
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:44,000
water as they used before and perhaps

737
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:46,720
even though the temperature goes up as

738
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:52,278
the CO2 goes up they don't need to be

739
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:52,278
exposed to the high temperature as uh as

740
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,599
today now also when you increase the

741
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,880
temperature

742
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:03,480
you may think well perhaps as the

743
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,919
temperature expand toward the temperate

744
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,039
latitude the tropical rainforest here

745
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:11,240
represented here in this green color

746
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:14,800
will expand to higher

747
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:18,078
latitudes if you do that for the

748
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,679
eosine and you use the temperature

749
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,320
gradient we have today and the

750
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,679
temperature gradient we have in the

751
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,679
pelosin you will see by that by

752
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:29,838
increasing the temperature during the

753
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:32,039
early o Waring you will find 18° C so

754
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:33,799
the temperature I I told you was the

755
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:36,000
boundary lower boundar is tropical

756
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,720
rainforest you will find that

757
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,679
temperature down in Patagonia in both

758
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:45,158
cases so you would expect for the

759
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,918
tropical R rainforest to expand to our

760
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:49,358
tropical

761
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:53,158
latitudes now these are many hypothesis

762
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:55,078
on biome Evolution during the early eing

763
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:57,720
the green is the rainforest and as you

764
00:34:55,079 --> 00:35:00,400
see many people has predicted that the

765
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:03,559
Forest will expand to Patagonia high

766
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:08,838
latitudes other say no perhaps you will

767
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:12,199
have a very dry area during this uh Soso

768
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:14,559
warming we did the analysis of comparing

769
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:16,879
many of the fossil record we have here

770
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:21,519
with many of the fossil record in Chile

771
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:23,400
and Argentina and we realize that the

772
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:25,358
the tropics don't really the tropical

773
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,960
rainforest don't expand to our high

774
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:31,358
latitudes during Global warmings but we

775
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:35,480
see is the development of a of a new

776
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:38,039
biome that that a paleontologist in

777
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:41,599
Argentina called The Mix paleoflora

778
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:43,279
Romero and Romero published this about

779
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,559
in 19 I think

780
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,800
1978 and he already gave us the answer

781
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:52,639
40 years ago that really the tropics

782
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,760
don't expand to where to high latitude

783
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:56,879
during global warming but what you see

784
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:59,800
is the evolution of a new biome adapted

785
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:03,160
to temporary areas during winter that

786
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:05,400
are not so cold and you see a very

787
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:07,559
distinctive abundant distribution in the

788
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,519
most important families between the

789
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:13,880
fossil record of the neotropics in the

790
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:17,440
eosin versus the lower latitudes in

791
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,440
South America during the

792
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:24,519
EOS so this Soso fossil record show us

793
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:27,119
that the temperature correlates with

794
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:29,318
diversity at long and short time scale

795
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:32,119
that probably tropical F plant families

796
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:35,199
already have the genetic variability to

797
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:37,119
cope with high temperature and high CO2

798
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,399
and uh there is a strong Niche

799
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,838
conservative the trop as I happened to

800
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,599
me living in New England for during the

801
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:46,119
winter that we don't live you are living

802
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:48,760
in the Tropic is very hard to move to

803
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:52,119
high latitudes and probably that the CO2

804
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:54,640
climate sensitivity is larger than 3 deg

805
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:56,480
C now I'm going to show you the last

806
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:59,519
chapter of this story and it's the bir

807
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,519
of a new ecosystem

808
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,920
the

809
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:07,598
savanas in in Orange is the distribution

810
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,440
of modern savanas today and we really

811
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,119
depend on savanas most of our

812
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,318
Agriculture and most of the people live

813
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,440
in savanas because it's much easier to

814
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:17,759
live in a savan that in a place where

815
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,480
it's raining all the time and you can

816
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,920
explain why we have dry Sons today just

817
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,800
by the atmospheric circulation of our

818
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:28,119
planet you will always find dry sons in

819
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,160
the subtropics

820
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:33,960
because of the the difference along the

821
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:36,318
with the equator and high

822
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:40,159
latitudes and indeed many people I

823
00:37:36,318 --> 00:37:44,159
showed you before has has uh shown that

824
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:47,838
they were savanas or grasslands back in

825
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:50,598
time like in the early

826
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:53,440
years however when you look at the plant

827
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:56,920
phenes or many of the most important

828
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,200
families that live in savanas or citic

829
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,880
environment today you will see that most

830
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:04,639
of them in did show originations back in

831
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:07,318
time but the actual radiation happened

832
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:09,400
within the last 10 million years so

833
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:11,759
that's very interesting know why you

834
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:15,280
will expect to find always dry Z back in

835
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:18,119
time why you only see this big radiation

836
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,319
happening within the last 10 million

837
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:24,358
years now we have been studying the

838
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:25,920
empirical record of these dry areas over

839
00:38:24,358 --> 00:38:28,318
the past few years one of these is

840
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,280
called casettes here in Northern part of

841
00:38:28,318 --> 00:38:34,920
Colombia that today is basically a

842
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,119
desert beautiful place we have been

843
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:41,079
collecting there for many years this is

844
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:45,400
Camila Martinez here collecting years

845
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:47,760
ago beautiful place close you sometime

846
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,318
you will see these huge sand dunes and

847
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,920
there is a massive called the makira

848
00:38:49,318 --> 00:38:53,559
mountain that is in the middle of the

849
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:56,200
desert with cloud forest and and rain

850
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:59,679
forest that is an an island among this

851
00:38:56,199 --> 00:39:03,118
big big desert and in the desert itself

852
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:06,879
we find a lot of fossils like this uh

853
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:10,800
this is the the skull of a

854
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:13,960
gavial or these asoan those are the the

855
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,240
TS of these animal that look like a like

856
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,599
a kind of a

857
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:21,159
hypot but from South American origin

858
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:24,000
once you clean the fossil that will look

859
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:25,960
like sometime you have gavials like this

860
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,358
is

861
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:31,720
called and remember they are coming from

862
00:39:28,358 --> 00:39:34,078
this very dry desert today many species

863
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:36,480
of purussaurus is one of the biggest

864
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,480
crocodile that ever existed was very

865
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,159
common all over the neotropic this

866
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:45,920
animal couldn't fit in this room and was

867
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:49,159
very common in W at that time you find L

868
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,159
giant armados

869
00:39:50,358 --> 00:39:56,799
capivaras this very large

870
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:58,639
freshwater turtles like the stupis see

871
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,359
the size of the this guy so you can get

872
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:04,400
a sense of the size of this fresh water

873
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:06,039
turtles are related to the chapas that

874
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,599
do they live in the Orin but they're

875
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:14,639
about this size or you find these giant

876
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:16,519
guinea pigs about 700 kilos 2 met tall

877
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:19,639
yeah very productive

878
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:24,039
ecosystem so this is how we think the

879
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:27,879
cetes look 3 million years ago permanent

880
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:31,559
Rivers a lot of uh biomass

881
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:34,400
and this is how cetes looks today we

882
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:37,480
also went looking into the Janos of

883
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:41,039
Colombia the savanas and you haven't

884
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:42,880
been in the savanas it's an amazing

885
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,159
beautiful place you see all these

886
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,000
grasslands and you only see trees along

887
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:49,159
the water

888
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Crossways now this is a place difficult

889
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:54,920
to study because there are no out groups

890
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,400
but an oil company drill a core one of

891
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:00,039
these places and we were able to study

892
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:03,000
entire core and this is the Poland

893
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:05,279
record of the grasses and this is the

894
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,838
geological time going from 23 million

895
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:12,160
years to today and as you can see even

896
00:41:08,838 --> 00:41:15,039
over the up to 7 five million years you

897
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:17,480
don't see any evidence of grasslands in

898
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:20,920
the Janos of Colombia today so probably

899
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:24,719
the savanas also evolve or expand during

900
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,720
the last three or four million

901
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:30,119
years now if you think think about the

902
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,519
expansion of all these dry lands here

903
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:34,559
and also all the

904
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:36,280
sados this is a an area that used to be

905
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:38,519
occupied by tropical

906
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:41,119
rainforest now today we know that there

907
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:43,358
is a very good relationship between area

908
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,160
and the number of species the larger the

909
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:48,759
area the number the higher the number of

910
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:50,960
species so if you do the opposite so

911
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,680
instead of increasing the area you

912
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,199
decrease the area of an ecosystem well I

913
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:57,838
will predict a large Extinction across

914
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:59,598
many different CL

915
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:02,358
so I think if you look at the phology of

916
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:04,960
many of plant families today in the in

917
00:42:02,358 --> 00:42:07,719
Amazonia there must be a significant

918
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,880
reduction in diversity over of the past

919
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:13,719
five million years that probably because

920
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,400
in the DNA if you look at phog is very

921
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:18,838
hard to do to look at a phog something

922
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,960
doesn't exist today so probably there's

923
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:24,639
a fundamental bias in the way we analyze

924
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:27,599
philogenetic data to assess the past

925
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:29,719
diversity that we don't understand very

926
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,800
well but I would expect that the

927
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:33,838
diversity in the Amazonia has dropped

928
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,839
over the past 5 million

929
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:36,838
years

930
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:42,960
now I always thought that the plos was

931
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:45,720
really boring that nothing really

932
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,559
happened there but over the last years I

933
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:52,519
realized how really critical the mid

934
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:55,280
plos was and really change the climate

935
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:57,880
state of our planet so if you look at

936
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,079
the the the temperat record for from 60

937
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:03,440
million years to today you see that

938
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:05,920
around 3 to 2.7 you see a fundamental

939
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:09,200
change in the this term of very warm

940
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,880
climate to what we see today this

941
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:13,558
oscillation of warming and cooling

942
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:17,119
during the since the glaciation is start

943
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:19,599
2.7 million years ago and also that the

944
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,680
CO2 has been

945
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:25,160
changing uh over time at least during

946
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:28,318
the glaciation inter glaciation we have

947
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:31,078
been going from 188 0 parts per million

948
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:34,480
to 280 parts per million and we are in

949
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:37,318
402 parts per million so if you could

950
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,760
summarize this climate State what we are

951
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:42,000
now today is a conjunction of four

952
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:45,200
factor that we have not seen at least

953
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,800
for 400 million years the first one is

954
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:51,639
that we have very steep latitudinal

955
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,800
temperate gradient from the equator to

956
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:59,279
the pole that today is about 50° C so

957
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:02,079
you go from 20 7 Cel in the tropics to

958
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:07,079
minus minus 20 in the poles if you go

959
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:09,839
back to the eosin it was 32 to 14 so the

960
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:11,920
increasing the temperature gradient is

961
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:15,239
the strongest we have seen in a long

962
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,440
time the second point is that we have a

963
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:21,199
strong temperature gradient between the

964
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,800
Eastern Pacific and the Western Pacific

965
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:26,039
that's something we haven't had in a

966
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:28,519
very very long time the difference in

967
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:30,679
temperature from the sea here in front

968
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:33,280
of Australia to the temperature of the

969
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:35,679
ocean here in front of

970
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,519
Ecuador the third the first time we have

971
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:41,399
ice in the poles permanent ice in both

972
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:44,239
pole and the first time in a long long

973
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:47,800
time that the CO2 has dropped below 200

974
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:50,279
parts per million and today not a single

975
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,519
climatic model has been able to have

976
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:56,040
these four elements in their modeling to

977
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:58,719
reproduce of the climate of the early

978
00:44:56,039 --> 00:45:02,000
plos so there is something is still

979
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:06,199
missing out of the climate now we know

980
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,519
that what controls a very large degree

981
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:11,399
the different ecosystem within the

982
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:13,880
Tropic is not really the temperature but

983
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,519
precipitation how the amount of rainfall

984
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:19,480
and the lane of the dry seas and you can

985
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:23,000
see that very easy if you go to waita

986
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:25,880
this is during L event in 2011 when a

987
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,679
lot of precipitation was brought here to

988
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:30,519
the northern part of Columbia

989
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:32,558
and this is Elo when precipitation drops

990
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:34,639
and these are changes that happen within

991
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:37,640
three or four month and green is the

992
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:41,759
vegetation you see how you go from a

993
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:43,719
really desert to very low grassland only

994
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,280
by changing the precipitation within a

995
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:49,159
single year now within the tropics what

996
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,760
controls most of the precipitation is

997
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:57,759
the the intertropical Convergence Zone

998
00:45:52,760 --> 00:46:00,440
so this low humid low pressure belt

999
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:03,839
that is moving all the time along the

1000
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:06,760
year so when you have winter in the

1001
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:10,199
southern the the itcc is always moving

1002
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:12,880
away from the from the hemisphere that

1003
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:14,719
is the coldest so during the winter in

1004
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,160
then in the Norther in the southern

1005
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:18,759
hemisphere the itcc move north and

1006
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:21,960
during the winter in North America the

1007
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:24,280
itcc mov South so if you are here for

1008
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:26,358
instance you will always have rain

1009
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:29,200
because the Bell goes up and down but if

1010
00:46:26,358 --> 00:46:30,960
you are here for instance during the

1011
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:33,399
during the winter here you will get the

1012
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,679
rain during the winter here you get the

1013
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:39,119
dry season and that's what brings the

1014
00:46:36,679 --> 00:46:41,679
the rain now but that works when you

1015
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:45,318
have ice in both poles we still don't

1016
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:48,519
know what happened very well if the ice

1017
00:46:45,318 --> 00:46:51,000
is only in one pole in the south in the

1018
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:53,599
North or we don't have ice in any of the

1019
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,199
poles we don't know if for ex if we

1020
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:58,720
don't have ice here or here if the itcc

1021
00:46:56,199 --> 00:47:00,639
gets wider and doesn't move very much or

1022
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:04,239
the precipitation increase all along the

1023
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:06,759
way with very very few empirical data

1024
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:10,719
about precipitation that is really the

1025
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:13,240
the key factor here rather than

1026
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:15,838
temperature

1027
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:18,519
so the final conclusion of this last

1028
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:20,639
chapter is that this is another example

1029
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:22,759
of how morphological Innovation the fact

1030
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:25,719
of you being a

1031
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:28,319
grass lack ecological success by 3

1032
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:31,480
million years so we see all these L

1033
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:34,239
lineages evolving back in the eosin but

1034
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:36,719
you only see large diversification and

1035
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:39,159
the copany of landscape within the last

1036
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:41,000
10 million years we also predict that

1037
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:44,279
large deduction in

1038
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,760
tropical uh Forest coverage and also

1039
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,599
that model most climate models fail to

1040
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:53,280
predict the lack of extensive savanas

1041
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:56,000
during global warming

1042
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:59,200
intervals and I think just to summarize

1043
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:03,239
what everything I told you we produced

1044
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:05,679
this movie of the biomes over the past

1045
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:08,759
five 55 million years so each color

1046
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:11,799
represent a particular biome and we have

1047
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:15,000
been using G plates

1048
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:20,880
to to assess the biomes so we'll start

1049
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,880
in 55 million years and we'll end today

1050
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:41,879
so in Green Forest the black here the

1051
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:43,519
tropical rainforest from the the the

1052
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:47,480
North American

1053
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,480
latitudes it went very fast

1054
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:54,400
no yeah just to end

1055
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,920
sometimes as you see the the funding for

1056
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,400
geological science has been dropping at

1057
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,318
least in NSF in Colombia and many places

1058
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,639
in the

1059
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:08,558
world but when you realize that over the

1060
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:11,879
past 150 years we went from 280 parts

1061
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:13,559
per million to 402 parts per

1062
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,640
million

1063
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:18,760
and if you go back to the last

1064
00:49:15,639 --> 00:49:22,279
glaciation 20,000 years ago we went from

1065
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:25,119
8 180 to 280 so only 100 parts per

1066
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:27,400
million in 20,000 years and here we have

1067
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:32,760
been going up about three parts per

1068
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:36,559
million in in only 150 years and that

1069
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:39,079
402 is very close to the levels of CO2

1070
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:41,680
back in the plyos so the last time we

1071
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:43,960
have a CO2 like we have it today you

1072
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:46,558
have to go back five million years you

1073
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:49,240
realize that we are really in a massive

1074
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:52,760
Global experiment to reproduce a climate

1075
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:55,439
of the past and probably geology and I

1076
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,640
think what we do the the pale climate

1077
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,119
the Reconstruction and ancient ecosystem

1078
00:49:57,639 --> 00:50:02,279
is really critical to understand and

1079
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:04,280
predict what is going to happen because

1080
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:07,599
all the historical records that people

1081
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:10,319
is using to build climatic models or do

1082
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:12,720
experiments are B based on historical

1083
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:15,119
records and none of the historical

1084
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:17,318
records human had by looking at the

1085
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:20,720
temperature precipitation over the past

1086
00:50:17,318 --> 00:50:23,920
200 years has had levels of CO2 similar

1087
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:26,719
to what we have today you really have to

1088
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:29,720
go back to your geological record to

1089
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:33,358
reproduce what is will be happening and

1090
00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:35,039
is already happening over the next uh

1091
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:37,480
decades to

1092
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:38,798
come just to give you a sense of that

1093
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:41,880
this is an experiment that has been

1094
00:50:38,798 --> 00:50:44,318
running in front of my building and so

1095
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:47,119
we have these two green houses and in

1096
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:49,920
this greenhous we have the CO2 as today

1097
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:53,160
so the ambient condition 402 parts per

1098
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:56,358
million in in this one and in here we

1099
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:59,558
are trying to replicate 280 parts per

1100
00:50:56,358 --> 00:51:02,960
million so the CO2 we have 150 million

1101
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:05,960
years ago and has been a lot of work so

1102
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:08,039
we have here a very large column full

1103
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:10,440
with calcium carbonate and we have a

1104
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:14,079
sensor of CO2 here and every time the

1105
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:16,880
CO2 goes above 280 we suck the air

1106
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:19,480
between this capsule and the CO2 combine

1107
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,920
with the carbonate and that drops down

1108
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:26,639
the the CO2 and what we have here is is

1109
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:29,119
corn CM Ma and we are assessing the the

1110
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:31,798
how fast the CM is the corn can grow in

1111
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:35,318
different CO2 condition and you already

1112
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:37,838
see how the CO2 the corn in the high CO2

1113
00:51:35,318 --> 00:51:40,480
in the CO2 of today is growing really

1114
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:44,078
really fast compared to the CO2

1115
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:46,318
150 years ago but we're spending a lot

1116
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:50,680
of funding just to replicate how the

1117
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:52,279
climate was 150 years ago this is just

1118
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:55,798
incredible and I think the one of the

1119
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:58,440
clues is going to the field not to the

1120
00:51:55,798 --> 00:52:01,159
study the f record of the tropics that

1121
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:04,358
is mostly an Explorer and sometime you

1122
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:07,078
find like these big trees at 4,000

1123
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:08,880
meters of elevation in the altiplano in

1124
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:11,240
the Peruvian Andes thank you very much

1125
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,240
for your

1126
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:18,119
[Applause]

1127
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:21,318
attention question I was struck by the

1128
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:23,640
comparison of the models of the Halos

1129
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:26,838
climate maximum that weing these 45 to

1130
00:52:23,639 --> 00:52:28,318
50° centigrade and you comparing it with

1131
00:52:26,838 --> 00:52:30,480
with the what you saw in the fossil

1132
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:32,079
record is it is there a way for you to

1133
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,519
actually to calibrate those models by

1134
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:37,160
telling people how hot it really was and

1135
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:38,960
be wise from the fossil record yeah we

1136
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:41,759
have the tical determination we have

1137
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:44,519
from temperature are about

1138
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,599
32° but this just compound the problem

1139
00:52:44,519 --> 00:52:48,920
because you have to reach the

1140
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:52,318
temperature of the almost close to the

1141
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:56,119
pole to 14° C without increasing the

1142
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:57,199
temperature in the tropies on 32° C and

1143
00:52:56,119 --> 00:52:59,079
that's

1144
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:02,558
impossible yeah no matter what

1145
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:04,960
combination you do of heat ocean

1146
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:07,640
transfer yeah there is a fundamental

1147
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,920
component of the climate that we don't

1148
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:11,879
understand and that reason we are not

1149
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:14,760
able to replicate we don't are able to

1150
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:17,000
replicate even the early pene climate

1151
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:20,480
that is just a small example of the

1152
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,960
climate back in the early so we have a

1153
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:25,719
long way to go and when you see all the

1154
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,000
predictions we do for the future they

1155
00:53:25,719 --> 00:53:29,879
are based on

1156
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,400
on the historical record and we have

1157
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:37,000
this CO2 we don't have data about that

1158
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:41,039
we just don't know there are so many

1159
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:45,719
many models have predicted that around

1160
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:48,920
450 PPS of CO2 there is a you could have

1161
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:50,679
a climate State change so for instance

1162
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:53,240
you could transform a savannah into a

1163
00:53:50,679 --> 00:53:57,199
brain Forest into a canopy Forest

1164
00:53:53,239 --> 00:53:59,279
because of the CO2 is much higher than

1165
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:02,078
but it's not a gr gradual change but a

1166
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,519
threshold change so you have one system

1167
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:06,359
and then you have the next system and

1168
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:09,239
the change is really really fast and we

1169
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:13,719
are approaching to that so I hope before

1170
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:19,199
I I I see the the CO2 at 450 and we be

1171
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:19,199
a I was correct looking forward

1172
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:26,720
to I understand some aspects of

1173
00:54:28,199 --> 00:54:37,519
ecosystem um so the reason that we would

1174
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:40,079
have the Savannah climate situation

1175
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:43,039
develop that's a climate change not it

1176
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,039
wasn't controlled

1177
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:51,079
by biologically available

1178
00:54:47,239 --> 00:54:54,838
grass spread into a new system because

1179
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:57,079
climate change or are you saying that

1180
00:54:54,838 --> 00:55:01,318
the boundaries of

1181
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:05,200
trunk because grass

1182
00:55:01,318 --> 00:55:07,358
itself no I think you need first need to

1183
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:10,318
change the climate like increase the

1184
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:14,199
land of the dry season so you expand the

1185
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:17,239
land escape and then the grasses as the

1186
00:55:14,199 --> 00:55:18,960
the area increases you have a radiation

1187
00:55:17,239 --> 00:55:22,358
but the grasses have been there for a

1188
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:25,440
long time yeah the problem is to explain

1189
00:55:22,358 --> 00:55:28,759
the absence of extensive savanas back in

1190
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:31,079
time why during the a using even though

1191
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:33,720
you have this worker culation why we

1192
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:36,079
don't have extensive saan back in the

1193
00:55:33,719 --> 00:55:36,078
fil

1194
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:41,639
record is is it possible that

1195
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:45,240
the

1196
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:47,118
transation faster turnover precipitation

1197
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:51,279
rainfall

1198
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:54,440
evaporation uh keep the tropics cooler

1199
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:58,960
than otherwise might be yeah I think the

1200
00:55:54,440 --> 00:56:03,280
key is is one so Mo yeah clouds has

1201
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:06,760
experiments of fight growing at 45 de C

1202
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:08,440
but if you put enough water the plant to

1203
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:10,000
okay but this is a control experiment

1204
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:13,318
there is a point

1205
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:18,199
that but not not so much survival of the

1206
00:56:13,318 --> 00:56:21,239
plants but actually increasing the heat

1207
00:56:18,199 --> 00:56:27,519
flux into the upper atmosphere into

1208
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:27,519
space by having a a phase change

1209
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:32,559
yeah at least in the PTM we see we think

1210
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:36,920
that the biomass increase and we don't

1211
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:38,880
see an increase in the in the we see an

1212
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,559
improvement in the water the water use

1213
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,680
efficiency so that's that extra water

1214
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:46,079
that the pl is not using it could be

1215
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:48,318
used to produce more biomass or could go

1216
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:50,680
back to the atmosphere and from clouds

1217
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:52,838
and perhaps depending of the Elation of

1218
00:56:50,679 --> 00:56:55,358
the cloud you can go from cooling to

1219
00:56:52,838 --> 00:56:57,239
warming the clouds are very tricky but

1220
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:59,598
it could be another fact factor that is

1221
00:56:57,239 --> 00:57:01,399
is letting the the tropies cool while

1222
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:04,960
the whole planet is is

1223
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:07,760
Waring but still the difference so there

1224
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:10,480
is a large degree of temperature that

1225
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:13,799
you have to raise the temperature in the

1226
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:16,838
PO but at the same time maintaining the

1227
00:57:13,798 --> 00:57:21,719
temperature just warming 5° and the

1228
00:57:16,838 --> 00:57:26,558
other is like 15 that's that's a

1229
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:29,199
l the um mix P Community looks like was

1230
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:32,319
the historical State when you have

1231
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:35,838
higher temperature high CO2 do are those

1232
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:37,119
tax still extinct and restricted and

1233
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:39,880
like would you predict that they would

1234
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:42,400
expand again in similar regime in the

1235
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:45,400
future or are they all extinct and we

1236
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:48,639
need to start over

1237
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:51,798
plan no I think you go to CH those are

1238
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:53,838
the remant of this mix it's just very

1239
00:57:51,798 --> 00:57:58,119
restricted yeah because we don't have a

1240
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:58,119
temporate area with a decent

1241
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:13,760
do you see a possibility for Rising CO2

1242
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:26,239
again agriculturally or whatever for

1243
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:29,039
theforce to expand

1244
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:29,038
land

1245
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:36,079
practices yeah that's really the

1246
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:38,200
critical plan for part the the

1247
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,839
deforestation because even though we're

1248
00:58:38,199 --> 00:58:43,279
increasing the

1249
00:58:39,838 --> 00:58:45,199
CO2 High very high the amount of forest

1250
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:48,160
cor is has been

1251
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:51,960
decreasing like crazy I've been living

1252
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:56,239
in Van for 10 years and Dian is this

1253
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:59,000
region colia and and 10 years ago you

1254
00:58:56,239 --> 00:59:01,479
could go to the end that is only 2 hours

1255
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,639
away from Pary and the whole thing would

1256
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:07,559
be covered with for and you go today and

1257
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:10,798
it's just just want to cry most of the

1258
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:12,960
forest is gone so there is not really

1259
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:16,239
this cooling effect of about aspiration

1260
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,798
because the forest is not there anymore

1261
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:21,000
I went to Brazil to

1262
00:59:17,798 --> 00:59:24,079
Bonito three years ago they have this

1263
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,480
this is the P beautiful Forest what used

1264
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:28,318
to be a forest and you go there and

1265
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:31,400
because the price has been going up

1266
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:33,239
because a lot of people love soil this

1267
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:35,880
extensive area that used to be this

1268
00:59:33,239 --> 00:59:39,919
pantal Forest now are converted into

1269
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:42,318
soil Fields so fi that you can you

1270
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,599
cannot see the end of the fields and

1271
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:46,880
they are transformed were transforming

1272
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:50,280
within the last 10 years so investors

1273
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:53,559
from all over the world to fund these

1274
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:56,519
hedge funds have been buying F

1275
00:59:53,559 --> 01:00:00,319
soil and transform the landscape at a

1276
00:59:56,519 --> 01:00:02,599
rate that that is just unparal so all

1277
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:06,358
this coolant effect is is G we don't

1278
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:06,359
have that but we have in the extra

1279
01:00:07,159 --> 01:00:13,279
Z2 yeah so it would seem that kind of

1280
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:15,279
the not the only mechanism you have you

1281
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,200
know pretty high CO2 to keep the tropics

1282
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:20,240
cool it's just to have a pretty

1283
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:21,879
permanent cloud cover and and I don't do

1284
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:24,598
you have do you have any paleo indicator

1285
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:27,200
for for for light level um that might

1286
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:29,720
tell you that you know that the the um

1287
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:32,798
if you really had permanent sort of pod

1288
01:00:29,719 --> 01:00:34,318
cover that you could um pick out in some

1289
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:36,559
way I don't I don't know if there's any

1290
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:38,400
physiological characteristic that is

1291
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:39,519
related to that and the canopy leaves

1292
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,559
right obviously the under story is

1293
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:42,679
always going to be dark but is can you

1294
01:00:41,559 --> 01:00:44,880
see anything in the canopy that might

1295
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:46,358
say gez there wasn't as many photons

1296
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,599
well that's I think that's the only

1297
01:00:46,358 --> 01:00:51,719
possibility we have and i' been thinking

1298
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:54,400
about that for a few years now and we

1299
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:58,078
still having find a proxy to to measure

1300
01:00:54,400 --> 01:01:01,079
the but I love to to do that yeah we

1301
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:04,240
have thinking for exploring theum in the

1302
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:06,839
cuticles of the leaves but uh the

1303
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:09,078
signals yeah we still need to do all of

1304
01:01:06,838 --> 01:01:10,920
empirical work in the forest today to

1305
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:14,280
understand the relationship between

1306
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:15,760
theum and the leaves and the cloud cover

1307
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:18,240
because the clouds we don't have many

1308
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:21,359
data on cloud cover that's something

1309
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:24,038
that even today is not not

1310
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:27,920
a yeah but that's a critical component

1311
01:01:24,039 --> 01:01:27,920
to this whole the

1312
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:37,280
uh in in previous uh warming events you

1313
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:39,358
showed there was a pretty uh speciation

1314
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:42,200
outpaced Extinction pretty

1315
01:01:39,358 --> 01:01:44,519
dramatically uh and if this were to

1316
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:47,078
happen again would you kind of predict

1317
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:51,278
the same Ratio or would you kind of

1318
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:54,318
predict a human influence well the the

1319
01:01:51,278 --> 01:01:58,920
problem is the scale of the change so

1320
01:01:54,318 --> 01:02:03,679
here we once again we increased in 150

1321
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:07,159
years what uh took

1322
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:11,000
uh and over the past 20,000 year we only

1323
01:02:07,159 --> 01:02:14,239
increased the CO2 100 parts per million

1324
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,880
so the rates are so we never had such an

1325
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:18,318
incredible rate that it's very hard to

1326
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:21,240
tell what the populations are going

1327
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:23,960
going to especially with high levels of

1328
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:26,798
deforestation so yeah I wouldn't predict

1329
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:30,400
that oration because most of the species

1330
01:02:26,798 --> 01:02:34,318
will be gone but at the end our species

1331
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:37,480
only 140,000 years old and from the fil

1332
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:40,719
record we know that any even species on

1333
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:44,278
a has last 3 million years if you are a

1334
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:47,318
very small animal big animal small PL

1335
01:02:44,278 --> 01:02:50,318
and a 3 million years so we have been

1336
01:02:47,318 --> 01:02:52,759
here only a small fraction 5% of the

1337
01:02:50,318 --> 01:02:56,239
typical duration of a speci and and

1338
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:58,640
don't imagine the humans here in 10 th

1339
01:02:56,239 --> 01:03:01,399
years even a thousand years for me we

1340
01:02:58,639 --> 01:03:04,719
already 7 billion and if you look at the

1341
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:07,039
fossil record over over the past 3.5

1342
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:10,439
million they have been a lot of mass

1343
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:13,200
exting and probably ours will go extin

1344
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:15,599
will take a lot of exp with us and

1345
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:18,399
geologist come from another planet look

1346
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:21,400
our deposit record will just be a blink

1347
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:23,680
in the the geological history and life

1348
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:26,559
will come back again with different

1349
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:28,719
rules but we be G but at least if you

1350
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,760
are a geologist that's a fantastic

1351
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:33,879
experiment because you we are living it

1352
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:36,839
that's soet that geology is so important

1353
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:39,440
that decide to invest 7 million people

1354
01:03:36,838 --> 01:03:41,759
were creating environment that we don't

1355
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,760
have a

1356
01:03:42,278 --> 01:03:46,559
presid have a geological perspective to

1357
01:03:44,838 --> 01:03:49,440
appreciate

1358
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:52,760
that well perhaps on that

1359
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:54,519
though we should thank again Carlos for

1360
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:59,440
really

1361
01:03:54,519 --> 01:04:01,759
