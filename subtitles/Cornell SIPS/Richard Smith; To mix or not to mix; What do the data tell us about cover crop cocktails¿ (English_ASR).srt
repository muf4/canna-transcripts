1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,539
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:11,599
University cool so so I took a I would

3
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:15,230
say a slightly less sophisticated

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:20,969
approach to this general question then

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:24,660
then Charlie took so I don't have to

6
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:27,868
tell you that cover crop mixtures or

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,698
cocktails are a hot topic right now

8
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:32,308
there's a lot of interest they've made

9
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,489
they make the news right so mix and

10
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:37,259
cover crops can help your corn grow

11
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:40,109
mixes are revving up no-till systems

12
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:45,929
mixes in South Dakota Iowa farmers are

13
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:48,149
using mixes but but why why why do we

14
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:51,119
think that mixtures of cover crops are

15
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:56,969
better than planting the best particular

16
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:58,378
cover crop in a monoculture so I was

17
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,210
interested in this question about why

18
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:02,878
we're using cover crops in general and

19
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,609
mixtures in particular and luckily the

20
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,829
national cover crop survey just came out

21
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:09,478
so it's a really nice source of

22
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:12,719
information about why folks are using

23
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:14,879
cover crops and and mixtures as well and

24
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,118
you know if you look at this you know

25
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,949
the the overwhelming or I'd say the

26
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:24,329
primary reason that folks are thinking

27
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:27,150
about cover crops in general is for

28
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:30,328
improvements in soil health right so

29
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,549
eighty six percent of the respondents of

30
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:36,688
this survey of which about two thousand

31
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:38,430
folks or so took it either agreed or

32
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:40,828
strongly agreed with the statement that

33
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,770
using cover crops has improved the

34
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:48,298
health of my soil right so that's far

35
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:53,849
and away the most popular answer to this

36
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:56,960
question and interestingly the

37
00:01:53,849 --> 00:02:00,269
perception is that these cover crops are

38
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:02,728
making substantive improvements in soil

39
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:05,179
health within the first year that these

40
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:10,020
cover crops are being being implemented

41
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:13,340
right so fifty-four percent saw benefits

42
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,340
in the in the first year

43
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:19,119
folks are also using cover crops for

44
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:23,799
weed suppression I don't need to tell

45
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,980
you this necessarily for example you

46
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,500
know 69% of folks indicated that they

47
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:32,679
always or at least sometimes see

48
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:35,560
improved suppression of herbicide

49
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,560
resistant weeds and what I've found

50
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,409
particularly interesting is when asked

51
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:46,598
to list the most weed suppressive cover

52
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:48,609
crop the majority indicated cover crop

53
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:52,959
mixtures even more so than things like

54
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:56,410
like cereal rye so folks are using cover

55
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,449
crop mixtures for weed control they're

56
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:03,509
using them for soil health benefits

57
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:07,268
obviously and a lot of folks are using

58
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:08,949
mixtures right so of the respondents to

59
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:13,180
this question do you use cover crop

60
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:16,419
mixes only 24 percent stated that they

61
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:21,370
are not using cover crop mixtures so a

62
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:23,318
lot of folks are using mixtures and a

63
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,530
lot of folks are using really diverse

64
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:29,409
mixtures right so the divert the the

65
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:32,739
majority of mixtures that are going into

66
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:36,780
the ground contain three or more species

67
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:42,359
and in some cases you know seven eight

68
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:45,629
nine or more species in these mixtures

69
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:48,939
and these mixtures are being planted

70
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:51,969
across a lot of acres right so the

71
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:57,699
three-way and the four plus species

72
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:59,969
mixtures are being planted on a lot of

73
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:59,969
ground

74
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:09,819
and so the question is is there a

75
00:04:07,658 --> 00:04:13,318
benefit is there a benefit to using

76
00:04:09,818 --> 00:04:16,269
these high diversity mixtures right

77
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:18,969
folks are planning them for perceived

78
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:20,889
soil health improvements these

79
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,530
improvements appear to be taking place

80
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:25,810
within the first year of using cover

81
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:27,698
crops a lot of these cover crops are

82
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,819
being planted as mixtures a lot of high

83
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:36,610
diversity mixtures and across a lot of

84
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:37,089
acreage and as Charlie mentioned in his

85
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,550
talk

86
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:42,009
you know the expectations are that more

87
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:44,860
should be better right because we know

88
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:47,469
that species differ they differ in a lot

89
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:51,220
of different ways they differ in route

90
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:53,620
architecture they differ in leaf angles

91
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,440
they differ in how they acquire soil

92
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,959
resources they differ in how they

93
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:00,759
assimilate those resources so the

94
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,180
species differ and we think that by

95
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:07,418
planting more of those different species

96
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:12,280
then we should have some substantive

97
00:05:07,418 --> 00:05:15,609
benefit to the soil biology to resource

98
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:18,819
use efficiency to productivity etc etc

99
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:23,310
and you saw this graphic just a short

100
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:26,889
while ago there is ecological theory and

101
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:30,610
empirical evidence that yeah we do see a

102
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:32,288
benefit in plant communities when we

103
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,180
increase the diversity of those

104
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:35,949
communities right and that there should

105
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,900
be this relationship between the number

106
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:42,939
of species and function in this case

107
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:45,359
biomass should increase as we increase

108
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:47,500
the number of species and resource use

109
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,220
should become more efficient there

110
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:54,220
should be fewer resources left unused as

111
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,410
the number of species increase and I'll

112
00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:00,160
just say that a lot of this work has

113
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:03,099
been done in perennial systems and non

114
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,599
agricultural plant communities right but

115
00:06:03,098 --> 00:06:06,939
we've we've seen evidence in those

116
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:11,168
systems that support these theoretical

117
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:13,870
theoretical predictions so we know that

118
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:14,889
farmers are interested in cover crop

119
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,870
mixtures

120
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:20,889
mainly to improve soil quality soil

121
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:23,959
health weed suppression is another

122
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:26,409
perceived benefit but there's relatively

123
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:31,099
little scientific evidence to support

124
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:33,620
the purported benefits of mixing cover

125
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,689
crops and that's mainly due to a lack of

126
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,550
research with cover crops though I will

127
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:39,649
say that there's been quite a bit of

128
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,300
research very very recently around this

129
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:44,239
question and we know that there are

130
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:47,060
theoretical and empirical support for

131
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,340
this plant diversity ecosystem function

132
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,790
relationship that suggests that

133
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:55,750
productivity and resource use should

134
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:58,040
increase with increasing plant diversity

135
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,709
diverse plant communities should be more

136
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,569
resistant to invasion because resources

137
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:04,759
are being used more efficiently

138
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:09,709
therefore there's fewer resources left

139
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:11,599
for for weeds or invading plants but

140
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:15,319
again there's been a lack of relevant

141
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:21,919
research in the context of annual cover

142
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:24,319
crops and so with that as the context I

143
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:28,879
want to tell you about some research

144
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:31,009
that we conducted in New Hampshire aimed

145
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,810
at getting at some of these questions

146
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:35,149
and so there's some very kind of

147
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:40,009
straightforward questions that we wanted

148
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:43,579
to ask an answer do cover crop mixtures

149
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:46,939
produce more cover crop biomass than

150
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:51,139
monocot cultures do mixtures suppress

151
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:54,829
weeds better than monocultures and then

152
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:57,079
do we see a benefit of the mixtures to

153
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:59,149
the subsequent crop that you plant after

154
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:04,159
those right so that's kind of where the

155
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:05,689
rubber hits the road so those are the

156
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,570
questions we were trying to answer and

157
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:13,939
so the experiment involved three groups

158
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:16,339
of cover crops you can see those groups

159
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:19,639
here I won't go into them too much other

160
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:25,250
than to say that two of the groups

161
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:27,219
included non legume forbs all of the

162
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:31,720
groups included three

163
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:37,810
or for grasses and all of the groups

164
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:42,158
included a legume and these groups were

165
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:44,319
intended to target biomass production at

166
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,809
some point in the growing season so this

167
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,570
first group was targeting high summer

168
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:52,029
biomass the next group was targeting

169
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,640
high fall fall biomass and then we were

170
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:57,789
targeting high spring biomass with the

171
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,679
third group but for all intents and

172
00:08:57,789 --> 00:09:02,649
purposes we can think of these as three

173
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:05,349
separate experiments involving different

174
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:09,399
Suites of cover crops planted at

175
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:14,860
different times of the year and so for

176
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:17,949
each of these experiments we planted all

177
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,789
of those species within a group as a

178
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,070
monoculture

179
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:24,059
so all mono cultures were represented

180
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:27,190
then we had a treatment that was a

181
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:29,529
mixture of all of those species in that

182
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:33,850
group so experiment one we had a six-way

183
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:37,269
mixture and that in that mixture every

184
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:40,360
species was planted at 1/6 of the

185
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:43,750
seeding rate that the monocultures were

186
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:47,740
planted at then we had a 14 way mixture

187
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:51,549
that included all 14 distinct cover crop

188
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:56,049
species and we also included a control

189
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:59,709
where we did not plant a cover crop same

190
00:09:56,049 --> 00:10:02,740
for experiment two and then for

191
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:04,660
experiment three again all monocultures

192
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,909
but we had a five-way mixture because we

193
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:10,059
only had five species therefore that

194
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:12,189
five way mixture I was planted at 1/5 of

195
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:15,039
the seeding rate for each of the the

196
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:22,270
five species in there so those are the

197
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:23,980
three experiments just to see what

198
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:28,559
happens when we do not have a cover crop

199
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:28,560
just a comparison without a cover crop

200
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:34,220
and I should say this was all done at

201
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:36,829
our research farm in New Hampshire seeds

202
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,870
were drilled with a small plot drill and

203
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:42,638
there was no weed control of any sort

204
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:46,730
for the duration of the of the studies

205
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:53,180
so here's the the crop growth period for

206
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:57,528
each of these experiments at the end of

207
00:10:53,179 --> 00:11:01,039
that growth period we measured cover

208
00:10:57,528 --> 00:11:04,278
crop biomass and the biomass of any

209
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:13,188
weeds that were present at the time that

210
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:16,669
we we harvested then we tilled all of

211
00:11:13,188 --> 00:11:20,860
the plots under carefully so

212
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:25,599
incorporated the residues and then

213
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,600
relocated the plots

214
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:37,080
and planted a test crop right so we're

215
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:41,190
basically telling this test crop to tell

216
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:44,820
us how these cover crops influenced the

217
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:47,240
soil right so maybe if they improve soil

218
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:51,360
health and we should see that in the

219
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:55,080
crop performance in this test crop and

220
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:58,289
each test crop was a by culture that

221
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,879
contained two species and those two

222
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:04,519
species differ depending on the

223
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:07,980
experiment and it was always a grass

224
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:11,309
paired with a non legume forb

225
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:14,129
and it was always two species that did

226
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:17,969
not occur in the original experiment

227
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:20,870
plots just to guard against buildup of

228
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:25,560
pathogens or you know anything like that

229
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:27,960
and so the the test crop was grown for a

230
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,819
period of time sometimes through this

231
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,910
winter and then into the subsequent

232
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:38,129
spring at the end of that growth period

233
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:40,079
we again harvested for for the test crop

234
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:45,419
biomass and then any weeds that were

235
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:47,759
present as well and so that's that's

236
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:52,139
basically the setup of the experiment

237
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:54,149
the experiments in this case so to

238
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:57,179
answer these questions do the mixtures

239
00:12:54,149 --> 00:13:00,600
produce more cover crop biomass than the

240
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:03,120
monocultures so here's the results from

241
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,139
experiment one this is just showing the

242
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,500
spread of the data

243
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:09,210
for each of the of the cover crops grown

244
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,610
as monocultures and you can see that

245
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:16,139
some did pretty well and I apologize

246
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:18,419
that these are all in metric units some

247
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:20,309
did not do so well so the in this case

248
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:22,279
the the legume the chickling vetch

249
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:25,709
didn't do so well that's not necessarily

250
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:28,529
surprising in monoculture and so let's

251
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:32,580
take a look at the six-way and the 14

252
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:35,699
Way mixtures how they do relative to the

253
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:39,030
monocultures so you can see that they

254
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:41,820
didn't do too bad right so the six-way

255
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:45,419
in the 14 way they did better than some

256
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:47,100
and they were comparable to our

257
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:49,799
best-performing

258
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,830
species in monoculture so the six-way

259
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:54,750
was actually statistically equivalent to

260
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,790
the millet and the oats and the

261
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,769
buckwheat monocultures but they

262
00:13:56,789 --> 00:14:01,319
certainly didn't do better they didn't

263
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:05,240
produce more biomass than the highest

264
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:08,100
producing species grown as monocultures

265
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,399
here's experiment two again we have

266
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:13,980
quite a spread depending on the species

267
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:16,459
for the mono cultures again the legume

268
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:20,870
had produced the lowest amount of

269
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:24,210
biomass oats and wheat produced the most

270
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:27,929
here's where the mixtures fell out and

271
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:29,840
again they did okay they certainly did

272
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:33,719
better than some of the mono cultures

273
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:36,000
and indeed the six-way was statistically

274
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,430
equivalent to the triticale oats and

275
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,679
wheat mono cultures but again they

276
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:46,439
didn't do better than the best producing

277
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:51,029
mono cultures experiment three basically

278
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:54,270
the same story did better than some just

279
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:56,970
as well as others here the five whey did

280
00:14:54,269 --> 00:15:00,509
just as well as the wheat the cereal rye

281
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:03,810
mature the kale the 14 way usually did

282
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:07,439
less well in terms of biomass production

283
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:10,619
than the five way so just adding more

284
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,140
species doesn't necessarily give you

285
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:17,870
better results right so that's something

286
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:17,870
that Charlie made a really nice point of

287
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:23,399
so looking at total biomass is one way

288
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,769
to do it another way to look at these

289
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,169
the performances is to use something

290
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:30,569
like the the land equivalent ratio I

291
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:33,509
won't go into it other than to say it

292
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:37,080
basically provides a way of assessing

293
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:41,610
whether the mixtures performed better

294
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:44,360
than you would expect based on how the

295
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:47,610
component species in that mixture

296
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,730
performed in the monocultures right and

297
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:53,370
so if this le R value is equal to one

298
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:55,409
it's basically telling you that that

299
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:58,159
mixture did exactly what you would

300
00:15:55,409 --> 00:16:01,740
expect based on how the monocultures did

301
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:03,929
if it's anything less than one that that

302
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,879
mixture actually did worse than you

303
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:08,159
would expect so there's something about

304
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:10,139
that combination of species that that

305
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,120
prevents them from growing as well as

306
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:14,850
they otherwise would and if it's

307
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,560
anything above one then that's telling

308
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,360
you that you're getting better than you

309
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,369
would actually expect based on what is

310
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,470
in that mixture and how each of those

311
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:24,509
components did in the monoculture so

312
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:27,740
there's something good happening in that

313
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:30,930
mixture basically so we calculated that

314
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:34,259
and here's the results indicated by

315
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:36,628
experiment the red dots are for the six

316
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:38,519
and the five way mixtures and the blue

317
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:40,259
dots are for the 14 way mixtures and

318
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:45,028
basically what this is telling us is

319
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:46,860
that those 14 way mixtures are doing

320
00:16:45,028 --> 00:16:50,309
about as well as you would expect based

321
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:52,500
on what's in them but the six and five

322
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:54,088
ways are actually doing better than we

323
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,100
would expect so there's there's some

324
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:58,199
good things happening in those mixtures

325
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,528
that suggest that maybe they're using

326
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:03,088
resources more efficiently and if

327
00:17:01,528 --> 00:17:04,558
they're using resources more efficiently

328
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:07,230
than maybe they're suppressing weeds

329
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:09,149
better than we might expect or a litte

330
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:11,400
better than the monocultures so that

331
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:14,250
leads us into question number two do the

332
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:17,970
mixtures suppress weeds better than the

333
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:20,099
monocultures so here's the results for

334
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,318
experiment one you can see the white bar

335
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:23,969
there is is the weedy fallow so that

336
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,038
tells us how many weeds we had in the

337
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:29,640
absence of any cover crop and you can

338
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:31,650
see the a lot of the cover crops

339
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,250
particularly buckwheat oats and millet

340
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:37,798
really suppress weeds very well as

341
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:40,650
monocultures right chickling vetch not

342
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:42,690
so much but that makes sense given that

343
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:47,190
didn't produce a whole lot of biomass so

344
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:48,840
how did the mixtures do well the

345
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,730
mixtures did pretty well in terms of

346
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:53,158
weed suppression they did just as well

347
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:56,370
statistically as the buckwheat which was

348
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:58,799
our most suppressive cover crop grown as

349
00:17:56,369 --> 00:18:04,408
monoculture and the oats in the millet

350
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:06,019
but they did do better right same with

351
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:08,690
experiment number two in this case

352
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:13,970
forage radish was our most weeds

353
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:17,180
oppressive followed by wheat and the

354
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:21,230
mixtures suppress weeds as well as the

355
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:24,049
forage radish and the wheat it's hard to

356
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:25,279
get better than almost complete

357
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:27,349
suppression right so it's kind of an

358
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:31,539
unfair comparison but they did just as

359
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:35,959
well as our most suppressive cover crops

360
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:38,990
experiment number three in this case all

361
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,450
of the all of the cover crops grown as

362
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:45,500
monocultures or as mixtures were pretty

363
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:47,930
much equally suppressive and they were

364
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,700
marginally suppressive all of them right

365
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:52,130
but they were all pretty comparable but

366
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,350
again the mixtures were not more weed

367
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:58,250
suppressive than our most weed

368
00:18:54,349 --> 00:19:00,500
suppressive monocultures all right so

369
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,910
that brings us to the last one last

370
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,450
question how do mixtures and

371
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:06,890
monocultures affect the growth of a pest

372
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:08,900
crop and this is the question that I was

373
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:11,660
most interested in right this this is

374
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:15,440
this is integrating across a lot of

375
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:17,930
potential functions to influence the

376
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:21,789
next crop how does the next crop respond

377
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:25,000
to these mixtures that's really what we

378
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:29,000
probably care about most particularly

379
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:34,759
farmers right now is this influencing my

380
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:38,750
cash crop potentially so here's the

381
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:41,930
results for the first experiment you can

382
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:46,220
see so this is this is canola and wheat

383
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:47,720
biomass total biomass right so we

384
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:53,589
separated them out but this is just

385
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:57,170
total test crop biomass you can see that

386
00:19:53,589 --> 00:20:00,490
biomass of the test crop was not too bad

387
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:04,550
following the weedy fallow actually

388
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:07,490
really quite low following oats sorghum

389
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:11,000
and it was highest following buck wheat

390
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:16,579
so buckwheat monoculture resulted in the

391
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:21,049
highest test crop biomass and both of

392
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:22,629
our mixtures resulted in lower test crop

393
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:26,230
biomass

394
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:32,669
lower test crop performance compared to

395
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:32,669
when that followed buckwheat yep

396
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:45,670
weed weed weed biomass yep I would say

397
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:54,589
upwards of 8 or 9 but dominated by 2 or

398
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:57,200
3 species and we have those data for

399
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:59,839
sure I can't pull them up off the top of

400
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,500
my head but a lot of lambs quarter and

401
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:06,549
pigweed and maybe some crabgrass as kind

402
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,549
of the dominant species

403
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:14,899
so here's experiment 2 in this case

404
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:19,789
forage radish monoculture resulted in

405
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:26,150
the highest pest crop biomass our

406
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:28,339
six-way was lower than forage radish in

407
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:30,350
terms of the resulting test crop but the

408
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:34,879
14 weigh actually was statistically

409
00:21:30,349 --> 00:21:37,990
similar to that forage radish but again

410
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:43,790
nothing higher than the best-performing

411
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:47,120
monoculture some cases lower but often

412
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:49,909
similar last experiment experiment

413
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:54,109
number three hairy vetch resulted in the

414
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:57,350
highest test crop biomass and in this

415
00:21:54,109 --> 00:22:00,759
case both of the mixtures resulted in

416
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:05,469
pest crop biomass that was lower than

417
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:05,470
when it followed hairy vetch

418
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:14,129
and so I wanted to put this into some

419
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:17,850
context right so this is one expert well

420
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:19,830
three experiments at one site and so I

421
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:22,769
did kind of a I came up with this great

422
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:25,559
idea to do a quick literature review

423
00:22:22,769 --> 00:22:27,000
yesterday or day before yesterday so I

424
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,740
didn't have a whole lot of time so this

425
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,130
is not a this is not an exhaustive

426
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,690
review of the literature but I'd

427
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:35,610
certainly been to enough scientific

428
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:37,380
meetings in the past couple of years

429
00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:40,769
where I was hearing the same kinds of

430
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:45,120
results being presented that that the

431
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:48,569
mixtures not necessarily a whole lot

432
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:50,299
worse than the monocultures but not a

433
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:52,919
whole lot of evidence that they were

434
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:55,230
having a whole lot of benefits beyond

435
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:57,600
what we are seeing in the monocultures

436
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,039
and so I pulled out these sets of

437
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:00,899
studies that I could find you can find

438
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,240
this it's actually been quite a few of

439
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,009
these types of studies reported in the

440
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,539
literature very recently this has been

441
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:09,150
like I said it's been a pretty hot topic

442
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:11,519
and so I kind of went through the three

443
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:13,500
the three functions that I was

444
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,599
interested in this study cover crop

445
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,390
biomass weed suppression and then this

446
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:21,269
kind of carryover effect to the next

447
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:23,550
crop and and kind of ranked the

448
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:25,039
performance of the mixture relative to

449
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:27,000
the best-performing

450
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:31,440
monoculture which is kind of how I was

451
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,420
thinking about our study and you can see

452
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,960
that in most cases not everybody

453
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:39,660
measured everything but usually the

454
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,700
result was that cover crop in terms of

455
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:46,500
biomass it was either equal or less than

456
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:51,980
the best-performing monoculture in that

457
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:55,349
particular study that was by far the

458
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:57,240
overwhelming results in at least this

459
00:23:55,349 --> 00:23:59,429
set of studies that I was able to find

460
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:04,519
and I could really only find one study

461
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:08,009
that reported anything suggestive of a

462
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:10,470
greater benefit in this case in terms of

463
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:12,619
cover crop biomass in the mixture

464
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:15,630
compared to the best-performing

465
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:18,029
monocultures so I think the results that

466
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:20,490
we're reporting here in our study are in

467
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:21,519
line with what a number of other folks

468
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:24,069
are

469
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:27,089
reporting in similar types of studies

470
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:32,649
all across the United States and

471
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:35,169
elsewhere so just to kind of wrap it up

472
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:37,150
and summarize we found no evidence that

473
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:40,870
mixtures were more productive than the

474
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:43,509
most productive cover crop grown in

475
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:45,309
monoculture no evidence that mixtures

476
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:48,160
suppress weeds better than the most

477
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:50,919
suppressive cover crop grown in

478
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:54,550
monoculture we found no evidence that

479
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:56,980
mixtures improved the soil and I put

480
00:24:54,549 --> 00:25:01,299
that in quotes it's not necessarily soil

481
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:04,299
health per se for the growth of a

482
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:07,269
subsequent test crop by culture better

483
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:10,869
than the most effective crop grown in

484
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:14,799
monoculture but we also found little

485
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:16,119
evidence that mixtures hurt right only a

486
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:20,169
few cases where things were

487
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:23,049
substantially lower with the mixtures so

488
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:27,759
mixtures may be a good bet hedging

489
00:25:23,049 --> 00:25:31,200
strategy of course given what Charlie

490
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:34,359
just reported you know it really I think

491
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,750
begs for us to think about a more

492
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:39,839
nuanced views of how we construct these

493
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:45,640
mixtures of a more functional

494
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:47,829
perspective and obviously mixtures may

495
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,500
have other benefits that we did not

496
00:25:47,829 --> 00:25:54,369
measure in this study so I don't want to

497
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:56,319
poopoo mixtures right but we have just

498
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:58,269
the data that we have collected in that

499
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:59,859
and the others of collectives suggest

500
00:25:58,269 --> 00:26:04,509
that we might want to take a more

501
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:06,879
nuanced view of mixtures and obviously

502
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:10,319
more more work in this area as needed

503
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:15,150
and it is being done so which is great

504
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:18,039
and so with that I'll acknowledge the

505
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,960
assistance and our funding and if I have

506
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:22,470
any time for questions I'd be happy to

507
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,470
answer those

508
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:42,399
Brandon I reported one year of data we

509
00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:44,048
actually have three years of data that's

510
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:48,489
part of what I'm going to work on during

511
00:26:44,048 --> 00:26:49,960
my sabbatical and there's there's

512
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:53,079
actually quite a bit of data from this

513
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:56,230
experiment we actually harvested biomass

514
00:26:53,079 --> 00:27:00,069
at three times during that growth period

515
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:02,679
so we have some more fine scale data I

516
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:05,619
presented kind of the last harvest set

517
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:09,149
of data but yeah we have some more data

518
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:09,148
but I don't know what they tell us yet

519
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:23,640
seemed to be conceptually that's why

520
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:23,640
we're planting mixtures in my

521
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:33,089
and then their question I just had was

522
00:27:29,808 --> 00:27:38,069
in one of the studies where fetch your

523
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:43,490
vitality reflectometer did extremely

524
00:27:38,069 --> 00:27:46,669
well after vet bill is late you in that

525
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:51,509
setting cover crops yep yep so it

526
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:55,710
certainly a nitrogen benefit there could

527
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:57,539
be other things happening as well so

528
00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:01,279
that's not that's not unexpected but you

529
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:01,279
know vetch was also in the mixture and

530
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:14,590
anyway

531
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,590
we divide another six

532
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:27,210
so the the the the seating rate for each

533
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:30,509
species was cut by 1/6 or 1/6 the

534
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:34,829
seating rate and so the the proportions

535
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:36,960
of each one would be you know would see

536
00:28:34,829 --> 00:28:40,199
they were seated that way what actually

537
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,210
came up like what Charlie showed what

538
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,730
you plant doesn't necessarily dictate

539
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,590
what what's going to come up and and and

540
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,920
the competition and how that's going to

541
00:28:46,589 --> 00:28:51,959
play out over the growing season we did

542
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:54,360
separate so we did separate out each so

543
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,549
we can look at how much vetch was

544
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:57,990
actually in that mixture

545
00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:00,569
you know how much buckwheat was in the

546
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:02,670
mixture etc etc have not done that yet

547
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:06,809
but that's all things that I want to do

548
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:09,120
over the next couple of months rate each

549
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:12,419
species was sown in the mixture at one

550
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:15,149
sixth of their monoculture rate and the

551
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:18,590
monoculture rate was the you know

552
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:18,590
recommended seeding rate

553
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:32,109
but yes but family you went out to the

554
00:29:29,378 --> 00:29:34,719
field and you was thinking like wow

555
00:29:32,108 --> 00:29:40,658
there are lot of dresses coming up

556
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:44,380
Christmas Eve smaller like you so what

557
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:50,130
were your observations very different

558
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:50,130
the safety inspections are working

559
00:29:53,579 --> 00:30:02,349
I do not know the answer to your second

560
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:05,259
question but I can I will know that as

561
00:30:02,349 --> 00:30:12,298
when I have a chance dad to dig through

562
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:12,298
the data observations looking at them

563
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:18,610
certainly there were species within a

564
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,220
given mixture that seemed to dominate

565
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:27,009
but again without looking at the data

566
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:28,990
the dry weight data it's it's hard it's

567
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:31,089
hard to say I mean when I looked at him

568
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,859
with my eyeballs they look the mixtures

569
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:35,349
look pretty darn diverse to me you know

570
00:30:32,859 --> 00:30:37,689
it wasn't like oh it's alright grass you

571
00:30:35,349 --> 00:30:39,490
know it they think they were each

572
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:41,590
species that we planned was present and

573
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:44,789
it was present you know pretty decently

574
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:47,470
but again until I look at those data

575
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:51,539
can't give you the most informed answer

576
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:51,539
but that's a good question yeah

577
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:04,240
