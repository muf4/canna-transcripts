00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,419
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,419
University

3
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:19,600
thank you guys for all having for having

4
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:23,050
me at your meeting today I'm really

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,520
excited to be here and so excited to

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,750
hear about all the great work that

7
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:31,809
you're doing with youth in your county I

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:36,308
was really great to get the

9
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:38,409
introductions that way so one thing that

10
00:00:36,308 --> 00:00:41,738
we've really been trying to do in the

11
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:44,919
state for each team is to connect our

12
00:00:41,738 --> 00:00:46,659
our 4-h resources across extension

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,850
because we realize there are a lot of

14
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:53,229
people an extension that are working

15
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:55,539
with youth but may not necessarily see

16
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:59,319
their connection to 4h or the value of

17
00:00:55,539 --> 00:01:02,890
the connection to 4h that's happening at

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,478
the level and the local level two so I'm

19
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,489
really excited that you guys are all

20
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:09,069
part of the team and that we're doing

21
00:01:06,489 --> 00:01:10,359
this great work together I should

22
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:14,019
probably start at the beginning by

23
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:16,599
introducing myself I my name is alexa

24
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:20,939
mae lee and i am the state stem

25
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:25,929
specialist here on campus in BB hall and

26
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:28,478
i am i call myself a science nerd all

27
00:01:25,929 --> 00:01:31,118
the time i love doing this kind of stuff

28
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:34,689
and learning stuff but i came to campus

29
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:36,879
by working in the local level mostly in

30
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:40,599
Clinton County and we did a lot of work

31
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:43,899
with local foods there and connecting

32
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:45,939
gardening activities with nutrition and

33
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:47,319
healthy living and those are the kinds

34
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,780
of projects that you guys are talking

35
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:51,759
about I really enjoyed doing at the

36
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,429
local level two and I'm hoping we can

37
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,368
build this up across the state national

38
00:01:54,429 --> 00:02:00,879
council has this sod new brand campaign

39
00:01:57,368 --> 00:02:02,649
all about 4-h growth here and one of the

40
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,958
things National councils really good at

41
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:07,868
it translating our 4-h story into

42
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,610
something that's interesting for youth

43
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:11,709
and their families and isn't just

44
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,130
extension jargon which is good for me

45
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:19,150
because I talk an extension jargon a lot

46
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:21,609
so that's one of the reasons why on the

47
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:24,400
stem plan that I'm working on right now

48
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:27,280
it's framed and the idea of growth here

49
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,260
it's particularly fitting when we talk

50
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,870
about gardening

51
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:34,090
and also we talked about growing young

52
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,370
people this is all kinds of information

53
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,050
about why stem matters things you've

54
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,330
probably heard before there are so many

55
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,130
jobs out there that are related but

56
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,260
there's not enough people going for them

57
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:45,729
or they're all white men there's not

58
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:48,340
enough women there's not enough

59
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:49,989
minorities all that kind of stuff so we

60
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,939
can play with some numbers if you want

61
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:59,080
what I really want to show you is this

62
00:02:51,939 --> 00:03:01,930
which is 4-h growth curiosity and the

63
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,780
reason that I love stem learning so much

64
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:07,210
is because i love question anybody else

65
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,960
like questions like learning something

66
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:14,050
new the challenge of discovery of

67
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,820
achieving based on something you've done

68
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:19,270
with a group or that light bulb moment

69
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:20,680
that a young person is figuring out

70
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,200
something for the first time we're

71
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,230
teaching it to someone else and we do

72
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:29,709
that in 4h all the time in the garden in

73
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:32,019
the classroom in the club setting in the

74
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:35,890
show ring wherever we are and so what

75
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:38,290
I'm trying to do is my stem plan is to

76
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:41,979
take the work that everybody is doing

77
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:44,169
across the counties and connect it with

78
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:48,419
a common thread so that we can have a

79
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:51,489
way to tell our story that's useful for

80
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:54,639
inviting new families and young people

81
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:57,879
to become involved to tell our story to

82
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,769
funders and stakeholders so that our

83
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:02,379
programs can be sustainable and grow

84
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,820
stronger and so we can learn from the

85
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:06,370
programs that we're doing so that we

86
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:09,310
could do them even better I've been

87
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:11,830
doing a lot of talking I've been in this

88
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,150
position for a year or so so I've been

89
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,890
doing a lot of learning about the

90
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:20,108
different programs that are happening

91
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:22,079
across the country and trying to figure

92
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:26,560
out what those common threads are and

93
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:29,109
this is what I've heard from people this

94
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,439
is I'm thinking about it as a learning

95
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:36,270
pathway so there are lots of different

96
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:40,500
projects lots of different approaches

97
00:04:36,269 --> 00:04:42,689
a wave that this pathway might actually

98
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,540
look like for an individual but these

99
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:49,319
are common steps that we take so we

100
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:54,030
start out by sparking curiosity the idea

101
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:55,649
of inviting a young person into the

102
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:59,009
garden for the first time I mean I

103
00:04:55,649 --> 00:05:00,419
remember one can he was maybe a fourth

104
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:04,019
grader or something and we brought him

105
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:07,439
to a master gardeners vegetable garden

106
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:10,049
and he asked us how we got the cucumbers

107
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,660
on the plants like that she thought that

108
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,870
we've gone ahead of time and glued them

109
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,090
all to the plants so they were all there

110
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:21,990
and he was just so curious how it worked

111
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:23,729
and sparking that kind of wonder and let

112
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,400
people letting young people see that

113
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:29,819
there's something new out there we do

114
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,069
that in a lot of different ways and then

115
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:34,680
we're hoping to build on that so that

116
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:36,569
we're providing opportunities for kids

117
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,430
to answer those questions so maybe next

118
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:41,639
time he would grow his own play and see

119
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:43,939
that actually it comes that way first

120
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:48,089
and then we take the cucumber off right

121
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:51,199
and then eventually these experiential

122
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:54,060
learning opportunities can lead to

123
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,399
investigations or engineering design if

124
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,230
the science aspect of their experience

125
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:02,029
is something that they want to do more

126
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:05,310
of so they might do some kind of

127
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:07,799
experiment about a pest that's bothering

128
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,860
their cucumber plant and try to figure

129
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,569
out a way to help it grow stronger to

130
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,319
get rid of the pasture or that kind of

131
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:18,029
thing or design a cage or tool or

132
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,339
whatever it was that would solve the

133
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:23,639
problem for their garden and then not

134
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:25,079
only that we really want to help young

135
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:28,169
people make a difference in the world

136
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:30,959
around them I mean especially with the

137
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:34,259
challenges with climate change and food

138
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:36,839
security and all these really huge

139
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:39,449
things that we're all facing we need as

140
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:41,699
many people as possible to put their

141
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:44,199
brain power in their creativity and

142
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:46,870
their curiosity to solve those kind of

143
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:50,620
and young people have really great ideas

144
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:52,480
for how to make that happen and I've

145
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,360
heard from some of your projects that

146
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,700
you've seen youth doing that too and

147
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,800
ultimately that's our goal in the 4-h

148
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:01,509
program is to have youth and adults

149
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,800
working together to make change for

150
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:07,599
their community so this is what I'm

151
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,620
really excited about trying to help

152
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:15,760
happen for 4h in in New York statement

153
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:18,399
so this is one pathway and then in the

154
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:21,430
bigger picture we have a portfolio of

155
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:23,769
different science and technology and

156
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:27,069
engineering activities and learning

157
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:30,459
opportunities for young people to be

158
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:32,769
able to experience so this is what I

159
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:35,620
think about as our program portfolio or

160
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:38,019
if you like though the logic model idea

161
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:41,050
these are our inputs and our outputs and

162
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:45,069
our outcomes and those kinds of idea the

163
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:49,660
big picture ecosystem of our stem

164
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:52,209
learning experiences so kids can do just

165
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:54,370
about anything and 4-h but it does help

166
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:57,519
us as professionals to be able to focus

167
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:59,019
a little bit so we have certain projects

168
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,359
and activities that are particularly

169
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:04,479
strong in New York State compared to

170
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,100
other states so our plant sides and

171
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:10,379
animal science and those kind of

172
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:14,140
projects are geospatial projects and

173
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:15,909
drones and most kinds of things and then

174
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:20,019
we're working on some emerging

175
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:24,070
technologies new project areas for you

176
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:28,029
so computer coding and sustainable

177
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:30,279
polymers and that kind of thing so some

178
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:32,799
of these project areas you may work in

179
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:35,439
and some of them you may not but the

180
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:38,199
underlying experience in each one of

181
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,590
these topic areas could still follow

182
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:44,220
that grow curiosity pathway with our

183
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:46,810
ultimate goal is that with young people

184
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:49,060
building on that Jerry ah citty to see

185
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:53,729
themselves as science people and maybe

186
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:56,509
want to explore science careers or do

187
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:59,000
service work in their communities

188
00:08:56,509 --> 00:09:01,759
sighs to solve problems for ultimately

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,490
helping them to be good citizens and to

190
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,590
think about information in that way

191
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:09,320
where they're checking their evidence

192
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:12,470
and making good decisions and that kind

193
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:16,400
of idea so the picture that's in the

194
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:19,399
middle of this the circles are based out

195
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,769
of a positive youth development model by

196
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:24,199
richard learner so there are three

197
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:26,419
things that his research shows that

198
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,509
young people really need in order to

199
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:32,029
thrive and three things those three

200
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:34,610
things 4-h really provides so that's a

201
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:37,490
skill building opportunity a long term

202
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:40,399
caring adult and meaningful leadership

203
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:42,950
opportunities so that's why the this

204
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:47,840
particular picture in an ecosystem is

205
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:50,120
shaped in that way so I you leading a

206
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:53,030
community garden program or engaging

207
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,860
with the libraries provide that caring

208
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:57,289
relationship with a young person that is

209
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:01,570
really foundational to everything that

210
00:09:57,289 --> 00:10:03,829
we need to do in youth development and

211
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:06,140
the volunteers that you work with and

212
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:08,900
the master gardeners and the mentors in

213
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:12,019
those spaces are really foundational for

214
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:15,409
making that happen and so it's our job

215
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:18,289
as a system to help each other do that

216
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:21,169
better and help our youth take a

217
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:24,049
leadership role in that way too so it's

218
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:25,819
also a peer mentoring experience and

219
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:28,579
it's building up the social capital of

220
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:32,270
our entire system and then part of that

221
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:34,700
comes from organizational culture change

222
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:37,399
and strengthening and growth as we all

223
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:40,070
practice these science activities more

224
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,809
and practices and learning about how to

225
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:44,780
ask questions that can be answered with

226
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:47,689
evidence and sharing our evidence and

227
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:53,120
learning from our programs together that

228
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:54,950
kind of idea also just mention all the

229
00:10:53,120 --> 00:11:00,679
work that we do through extension that

230
00:10:54,950 --> 00:11:02,840
engages youth is 4-h work so I would

231
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:05,209
would just be curious to see what you

232
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,780
guys think about this idea of growing

233
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:09,870
curiosity and

234
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:12,209
if it fits in with the work that you're

235
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,580
doing in community gardens and school

236
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:17,370
gardens and with master gardeners or if

237
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:19,440
there's anything that's really far off

238
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,450
base or changes you would make or

239
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,080
suggestion any thoughts you have about

240
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:27,180
it I like pictures to explain things I

241
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,850
particularly like this too because it

242
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:32,549
also can provide a framework for some of

243
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,950
our efforts with children and youth

244
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:38,099
audiences when we were doing program

245
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:41,550
with youth how do we fit into this

246
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:44,460
pathway where are we coming coming up so

247
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:47,149
I think that's a nice framework yeah so

248
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,990
I think it's really important to have

249
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:51,360
conversations and to build up

250
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,700
relationships between staff members I

251
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,379
mean when I worked in Clinton County we

252
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:59,310
had the advantage of being really small

253
00:11:55,379 --> 00:12:01,559
so we had to run into each other at the

254
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:03,029
coffee pot in whatever and talk and

255
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:06,899
share and learn about each other's

256
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:09,539
programmed but in a bigger County that's

257
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,769
harder to do and I think that's

258
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:16,949
something we all have to be intentional

259
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:18,509
about so that any time I would want to

260
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:22,020
do a program that would involve

261
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:23,970
gardening or an agriculture kind of

262
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:27,659
angle it would be good to check in with

263
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:29,519
Ag staff to see what they're doing and

264
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:32,639
if there's anything that relates and so

265
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,529
vice versa if you and your horticulture

266
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,220
program are doing something that you'd

267
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:40,049
like to engage young people with it

268
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:43,800
before eh staff in your office need to

269
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:45,359
know about that it's practical for you

270
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:48,419
because they might have some resources

271
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,180
that are helpful already that you know

272
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:54,569
about but maybe you don't and then it's

273
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:56,579
also structural so all of our our youth

274
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:59,460
numbers and reporting and everything has

275
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:01,830
to go through the 4-h system so your

276
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:04,019
staff 4-h staff can help you figure that

277
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:06,000
out so it's really something that we

278
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,610
should be working on as a team and I

279
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,460
prefer a personal approach just you know

280
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:13,470
stopping by or calling up or emailing or

281
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,750
whatever the for each person in your

282
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,319
office to say hey this is what I'm doing

283
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,578
and how can we work together kind of

284
00:13:18,318 --> 00:13:23,338
from my experience it seems like that's

285
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:25,649
happening pretty well in a majority of

286
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:26,899
counties but like any relationship it's

287
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:30,328
definitely something that takes

288
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:33,958
consistent work what you're presenting

289
00:13:30,328 --> 00:13:37,248
to us here about curiosity grows here

290
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:40,469
that is something that 4-h educators

291
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:42,839
across the state would also be

292
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:45,389
introduced so too so there would be a

293
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:48,629
little bit of common language yes yes

294
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:50,789
and this is a relatively new framework I

295
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:53,548
started introducing it to forage staff

296
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:55,469
at State Fair last year and we're also

297
00:13:53,548 --> 00:13:59,100
going to talk about it some more during

298
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:01,290
this spring in service the growth here

299
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,409
language is part of national council

300
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:06,808
stuff that people that 4-h staff see on

301
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:08,399
a regular basis and they have fun

302
00:14:06,808 --> 00:14:10,499
graphics and that kind of thing so if

303
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,938
you're doing recruitment posters and you

304
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:15,959
need those sort that kind of support

305
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:19,980
that it exists so we're all sort of

306
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:22,528
learning through this together and then

307
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,899
you know come reporting time and we are

308
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:27,808
you know it's like who you know where

309
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:32,068
does that come in and I think I noticed

310
00:14:27,808 --> 00:14:34,108
somewhere I down in the 5.8 section you

311
00:14:32,068 --> 00:14:36,599
know that there were there were spots

312
00:14:34,109 --> 00:14:38,429
for you know master gardeners doing

313
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,428
outreach towards you know that the

314
00:14:38,428 --> 00:14:43,759
issues of childhood obesity and I and I

315
00:14:41,428 --> 00:14:46,738
at the same time working with our 4-h

316
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,269
educator here trying to figure out you

317
00:14:46,739 --> 00:14:49,859
know who gets who gets credit for this

318
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:52,188
where does it belong and our reporting

319
00:14:49,859 --> 00:14:55,528
obviously you know it's done and we're

320
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:58,588
doing it together as an organization but

321
00:14:55,528 --> 00:15:00,149
at some point it gets it can get

322
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:01,919
confusing so it is really good I think

323
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:05,818
to kind of work that out ahead of time

324
00:15:01,918 --> 00:15:07,379
figuring out where it belongs it was

325
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:11,399
more of a comment than a question I

326
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:13,769
think and was did that I any sense it

327
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,739
totally does and I think that it's

328
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:19,709
definitely something that we keep

329
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:21,329
wrestling woods and try to find a better

330
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:23,368
answer for because we're all trying to

331
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:25,738
tell the best story we can about the

332
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:28,259
impact that we're doing and so much of

333
00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:30,940
our work is integrated whether it's

334
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:33,250
across program areas or even topics

335
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,560
so within 4 H there are three focus

336
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,870
areas for our programming around stem

337
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:39,939
healthy living and civic engagement and

338
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:42,070
a lot of times the way the system setup

339
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:45,640
you have to choose one or the other when

340
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:49,420
in reality the program is both a end and

341
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:51,610
it's stronger that way so I think as far

342
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:54,189
as the plan of work reporting for

343
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:56,680
Celeste and that kind of thing it mostly

344
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:59,710
matters that there's it's not duplicated

345
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:02,019
so one person is reporting it and and

346
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:04,120
that it's in the system but one we

347
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:08,949
talked about it with the public then we

348
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:10,690
use the both and kind of idea so part of

349
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:13,180
the reason that we're looking at the

350
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:15,730
state team at our plan of work and our

351
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:19,359
strategy moving forward is that we can

352
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:21,370
if we have a more consistent core then

353
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,519
we can develop evaluation and reporting

354
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:26,289
tools to support the system at large so

355
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:29,559
that every person doesn't have to make

356
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:32,949
up an evaluation we could have a few

357
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:37,389
shared questions or tools or a toolbox

358
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:39,700
of choices for people to go to so we're

359
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:42,399
really excited this year for the first

360
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:45,550
time to have a 4-h spring and service

361
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,949
and we're stealing heavily from the for

362
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:51,969
the AG and service title we really liked

363
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:55,090
that so we're copying it and so the idea

364
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:58,269
is that will have a three-day conference

365
00:16:55,090 --> 00:17:00,940
where educators from across the state

366
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:06,430
can come together to focus on youth

367
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:08,410
development needs and this grew out of a

368
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,759
club management conference that we've

369
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:12,279
had for a couple years which really

370
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:16,869
focused on community club delivery model

371
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:19,509
kind of stuff so there will be a strong

372
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:25,000
element in the program this year all

373
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:27,730
about volunteer management so that is a

374
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,730
huge part of our community club work but

375
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:32,289
we're also going to have a section

376
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,870
around building campus County

377
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:36,700
connections work around professional

378
00:17:34,869 --> 00:17:40,229
development for youth development

379
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,680
professionals and another one around

380
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:46,420
communicating

381
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:48,640
impact of our 4-h work on Wednesday the

382
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,230
13th of April which is the first day of

383
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:56,440
the conference we're going to have a

384
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:57,910
special lunch / conversation opportunity

385
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:02,170
where we really want to bring together

386
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:07,060
people from local County programs with

387
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:09,130
campus faculty and extension partners to

388
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:12,399
have conversations and learn about your

389
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:15,340
programs and build connection so I'm

390
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,630
really hoping that that will tie in with

391
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:18,459
the work that you're doing in the

392
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,880
horticulture and service that you'll

393
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:24,490
stay another day and have lunch with us

394
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,170
learn a little bit more about our 4-h

395
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,870
program at the state level what we're

396
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:32,800
trying to do together and you're welcome

397
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:35,139
to come to the entire conference to yes

398
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:44,829
so the youth development and service

399
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:49,600
will be April 13 at ten a.m. until April

400
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:53,649
fifteenth at noon so it's a wednesday

401
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:56,549
through friday this in service is on

402
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:59,259
campus we thought we would have are

403
00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:02,919
contemplating the idea of having tuesday

404
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:07,660
april 12 maybe from ten a.m. in the

405
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:10,900
morning till 5pm and have a horticulture

406
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:12,400
in service what I'm thinking about as we

407
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,610
were talking and looking at all the

408
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,950
faces who were not faces names who

409
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:22,419
showed up today that more and more often

410
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:25,890
we are working with youth and we are you

411
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:29,289
know we're integrating nutrition

412
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:31,870
vegetable gardening concepts into our

413
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:34,569
programs and I don't know speaking from

414
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:37,899
my own perspective we did not use to do

415
00:19:34,569 --> 00:19:39,609
a lot of work with youth and families

416
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,230
but I think that all of us could

417
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:42,879
probably benefit from you know hanging

418
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:48,190
out perhaps an extra day and seeing

419
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:50,110
what's going on so I mean that was one

420
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,570
of the one of the ideas was to you know

421
00:19:50,109 --> 00:19:55,269
have them close together adjacent so

422
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:55,548
that we could get some crossover and

423
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:59,118
both

424
00:19:55,548 --> 00:20:02,569
directions and see what room there is

425
00:19:59,118 --> 00:20:05,589
for collaborative efforts we too would

426
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:08,689
invite them to come the day before

427
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:11,089
anybody who is maybe in the youth

428
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,528
development area or nutrition area who's

429
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:16,278
like I need to know a little bit more

430
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:19,009
about what happens in the gardening or

431
00:20:16,278 --> 00:20:21,230
horticultural area they could an

432
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,849
individual could attend are in service

433
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:24,679
we haven't even planned what we would

434
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:28,969
have at that any service but we think

435
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:32,619
that's a good that's a good day to start

436
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,618
thinking about what we could have there

437
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:40,788
this has been a production of Cornell
