1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,800
University so I always like to have some

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,839
other title rather than just the sort of

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,480
more you know General explaining what it

5
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,440
is I'm talking about creating an app for

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,480
Greenhouse insect pist management and

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,520
maybe I should have called it actually

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,399
bugs in the system but it has been very

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,839
interesting working on that because we

10
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:26,159
find many bugs on my part and then bugs

11
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,879
on the part of the the computer side as

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,118
well and so I'm also glad to see that

13
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:31,239
Miss's here because she's one of my

14
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:34,119
secret weapons um in terms of making

15
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:36,000
sure that things work so when we started

16
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:37,320
looking at at IPM is one of the big

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,520
things about integrated Pest Management

18
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,960
is that we're always looking for new

19
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,320
tools what can we find that makes life

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,679
easier for Growers makes life easier for

21
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,920
us helps people in general manage their

22
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,519
insect and disease and weed and rodent

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,960
and other pests so when we started

24
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,600
talking about talking to Greenhouse

25
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,920
scorers when I first came my control was

26
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,359
was just getting started and especially

27
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,320
with the New York State Greenhouse

28
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,559
Growers the ornamental Growers a lot of

29
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,438
them are small and they had not really

30
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,438
gotten into it yet they were just on the

31
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:09,199
edge so it's like aha we said we can use

32
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:10,719
let's look at bio control no problem for

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,280
a grower you're going to juggle the

34
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,400
plant you're going to juggle the pest

35
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,599
you're going to juggle the environment

36
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,640
and a one SL another biological organism

37
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,319
in there to make it easier for you to

38
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,719
control these it's it's very complicated

39
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:25,438
in terms of what information do you need

40
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,759
and and what uh factors that you have to

41
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:30,118
fit into your production scheme um to

42
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,920
make biological control work now I just

43
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:33,519
had coffee which was probably a bad idea

44
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,599
so if I'm talking faster than human

45
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:39,118
beings can hear please wave your hands

46
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:41,039
I'll try and talk slower so the grower

47
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,799
said when we said that they

48
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,079
said we need help it's too much

49
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,399
information to try and assimilate all at

50
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,879
once we need something to help put all

51
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,079
this information in one place so we can

52
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:54,000
look it up so of course we said oh

53
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,158
University people we need paper let's

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,519
create it with a handbook yeah it's got

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,200
the pest in there the beneficials

56
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,759
identification bi ology monitoring

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,520
application environment effective

58
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,000
pesticides Etc it got to be a pretty big

59
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,159
document it wasn't just a couple of

60
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,800
sheets and you could carry it around

61
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,359
with you so as we know Greenhouse

62
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,879
Growers I mean they're not likely to

63
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,200
carry their manuals into the greenhouse

64
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:17,679
with them at all times they've got too

65
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,000
much other things too many other things

66
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,280
to to worry about so that sort of led us

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,840
to the idea of okay more and more people

68
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,400
are carrying their smartphones they've

69
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,479
got them in their pocket at all times

70
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,800
that's there with them so why not take

71
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,560
that information that was in the bio

72
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,360
control manual and put it into an app

73
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,400
sounds easy and I will tell you I'm not

74
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,040
going to tell you exactly how to create

75
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,719
an app I'm not a programmer um they did

76
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,280
have me doing a little bit of HTML

77
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,719
language at one point wow it's very

78
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,598
exciting and when I get to see the

79
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,318
screens of the guys that are putting

80
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:53,318
this up all together it it is complete

81
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:55,439
galaly book so I'm not doing that piece

82
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:57,598
so that means that step one is find

83
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,959
someone who knows how to make an app and

84
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:02,119
step two is learn how to speak each each

85
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:04,560
other's language at least a little bit

86
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,959
and that was that's a huge thing if you

87
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,439
can't find somebody that understands

88
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,959
what you're talking about and you

89
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,079
understand what they're talking about

90
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,280
I'm not sure you can go forward so we

91
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,120
worked with Gorges uh downtown and

92
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,400
actually we found them because Jenny Cy

93
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,759
niffin had talked to them about doing um

94
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,200
an app and and so we said we were asking

95
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:24,199
around she talked about that so we went

96
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,479
down and and they said okay you know

97
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:27,919
here's how much it's going to cost and

98
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:30,679
we said okay put in a grant for it um

99
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,158
and and got the Grant I suspect um that

100
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,519
I actually think that we both learned

101
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,840
how to make an app together we went

102
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:37,319
through several different people that

103
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,640
worked with them and it took a lot

104
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:41,839
longer than we thought um and we finally

105
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:43,679
now are at a point where the systems

106
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,680
that they're using work for what we want

107
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,719
to do but it really was a discussion it

108
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,959
really was a joint um conversation on

109
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,359
what can an app do so we're used to apps

110
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,560
where you go in and you put but push

111
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,599
buttons and you get information they're

112
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,120
actually the ones who suggested well

113
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:01,719
don't why don't make it Interactive so

114
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,120
that you can enter information that can

115
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:06,680
be then compiled and recorded um through

116
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,400
the app rather than having it just be a

117
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,920
site Just for information so that's

118
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,920
that's what we did again it sounds very

119
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,598
easy and it's not also if you have

120
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,238
questions while I'm talking I deal with

121
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,680
chaos pretty well so feel free to ask um

122
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,719
you may have to borrow the big orange

123
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,478
gloves if you want to ask a question

124
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,080
we'll let you can you can have those

125
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,918
just for yourself so when we start

126
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:28,120
talking about biological control what

127
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:30,439
are the most common questions that

128
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,759
Growers had what pest are we dealing

129
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:34,600
with so we couldn't we couldn't back it

130
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,160
past pest identification we had to

131
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,280
include pest identification in the app

132
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,039
because that was where there many of

133
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:42,439
them were starting and then once you

134
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:44,439
know which pest it is then what bio

135
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,879
controls can you use to control it and

136
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:49,038
how do you do that so that was the basis

137
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,918
for the sort of information side of of

138
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:53,079
the app that we wanted to put

139
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:54,639
together and then on our part is what do

140
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:57,000
we wish Growers would do we wish they'd

141
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,560
keep records and many of them have

142
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,038
records of some things they're required

143
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,240
to keep records of pesticides so they're

144
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,279
used to doing that piece what we really

145
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,680
would have liked is if we could have

146
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,119
this app then put all the information on

147
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,918
their pesticides together so that it

148
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,079
would be able to be printed out and go

149
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:17,359
to DEC it doesn't do that unfortunately

150
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:19,478
New York State IPM does have um

151
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,520
procedures that's called track software

152
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:23,199
that does that for other crops like

153
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,639
apples and turf we don't have it for

154
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,680
green houses or Christmas trees or any

155
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:29,319
one the ornamentals that I work with um

156
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,840
and this unfortunately doesn't do that

157
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:34,240
but it at least as a way to to keep some

158
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,000
of the information and and maybe even

159
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,759
print it out so that you could store it

160
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,959
somewhere be able to go back and look

161
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,600
and say what pests did we see when did

162
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,519
we see them what did we do and did it

163
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,639
work and to be able to then plan better

164
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:48,758
for the next time around and and I will

165
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,639
say working with Growers on biological

166
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,319
control I would say it takes about three

167
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,639
years before they have the system in

168
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,919
place and functioning pretty well so

169
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:00,360
that it's not a constant um oh gosh what

170
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:02,399
do we do now or what's happening with

171
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,800
this it they get takes about that long

172
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,478
to get the populations down low enough

173
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,319
it also takes about that long to have

174
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,159
the bio control fit into your production

175
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,360
scheme so that it is just routine um and

176
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,240
so keeping records actually helps get to

177
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,520
that point

178
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,400
faster so what does this app do then um

179
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:22,079
so it does MO if you look at the list of

180
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,239
what it does it covers most of those

181
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:28,399
things that we had in the the the uh the

182
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,079
the um biocontrol workbook or handbook

183
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,758
FES ID and biology

184
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,959
beneficial ID in biology application

185
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,560
methods so how do you put those

186
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,959
beneficials on pesticide interactions

187
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,598
okay I'm going to ask you guys questions

188
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:41,519
because that keeps everybody awake why

189
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:44,319
do we need pesticide interactions in a

190
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:44,318
biocontrol

191
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:50,959
app good Neil knows he's been around me

192
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:52,918
a long time Neil because the pesticides

193
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:54,478
can also be harmful to the beneficial

194
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:56,839
right so there's information out there

195
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,079
on which pesticides are are better and

196
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:59,679
worse for the beneficials that you're

197
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,318
going to put down and if you've just

198
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,240
spend a lot of money putting beneficials

199
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,720
out which it does cost a fair amount and

200
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,759
then you spray something that kills them

201
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,720
all off it's probably not worth your

202
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,879
while so knowing something about which

203
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,120
ones you can mix also with Growers and

204
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,439
it took a while to I think convince

205
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,319
people of this biological control does

206
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:19,759
not preclude the use of pesticides we

207
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:21,520
see it as a as an integrated system so

208
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,240
maybe you're using biological control

209
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:24,758
through the whole first section of the

210
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,960
production and then before you're going

211
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:28,960
to sell those plants you get an

212
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,799
application of pesticide or perhaps

213
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,878
you're doing most of your bi your pest

214
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,400
control with Biologicals and then you've

215
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,240
got a hot spot of something else that

216
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,878
comes in and you can apply a pesticide

217
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,160
to that so it is not an either or system

218
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,680
it is a both it can be either or but it

219
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,280
is often a both system and in order to

220
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,319
have that system work well you need to

221
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:49,198
have information on the pesticides and

222
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,080
how they interact with the beneficials

223
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,680
you get a point

224
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:55,120
Neil um and then interactive scouting so

225
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,560
this is the concept of of actually

226
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,478
having being able to put information

227
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,038
into the app and have it stored and then

228
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,639
the records record ke keeping for both

229
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,120
The Scouting and then beneficial and

230
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,158
pesticide applications and then a way to

231
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,319
graph this information so you can see

232
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:12,319
what's happening over

233
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:16,039
time we have it available on Android and

234
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:19,680
Apple um and it is uh still only

235
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:21,318
9.99 so um Greenhouse it's if you search

236
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,800
for Greenhouse Scout you'll find it why

237
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:26,560
did we charge for it um Apple actually

238
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:30,280
charges us like charges they get part of

239
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,120
that money um and then um we wanted it

240
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:33,958
to be not very expensive so that people

241
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,519
could get it just to try it out even and

242
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:38,239
then we also wanted we need to have

243
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,320
money to go back into the system to

244
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,399
maintain it and that's one of the big

245
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,640
issues when we started out is that um

246
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,639
you know you can create one but it it

247
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:50,600
has to be maintained and the question

248
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:52,159
then is um how is it maintained and

249
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,879
who's going to maintain it and

250
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,759
maintenance always costs money so that's

251
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:57,639
one reason for charging I think the food

252
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:00,600
is

253
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:02,919
here that's people who developed it

254
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,120
maintaining it they are and that was

255
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:09,000
something that was um unusual and we had

256
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,240
to work with Cornell to allow that so I

257
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
had to go through the intellectual

258
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,039
property office because with it because

259
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,440
of the app and so they're like great you

260
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:19,719
know um so usually when money comes into

261
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,600
the system it gets divided out into

262
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,680
departments per uh pis and the

263
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,159
university and I said that's great

264
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:28,159
except that if the Cornell's going to

265
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,639
maintain it I'm okay with that if

266
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,360
Cornell's not going to maintain it then

267
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:34,078
we have to figure out a way so Gorge has

268
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,480
actually worked with Cornell um to have

269
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:39,319
all the money come back to them and that

270
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,079
that's our maintenance our maintenance

271
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,040
fund um and that's also then why we have

272
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:45,958
to Market it because we need to get

273
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:48,120
people to know about it we need and and

274
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:49,518
you need to do that in a digital world

275
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,440
you need really need to probably be

276
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,360
doing that every 15 seconds I'm not

277
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,000
doing it that often but um we need to

278
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,278
keep talking about it and and get it out

279
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,440
to other populations so that people can

280
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:00,879
will buy it and we can keep it

281
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,040
maintained and it does it does take lot

282
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:05,519
it does take a lot of

283
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:06,958
Maintenance um on both everybody's part

284
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,560
so the way this is set up it's a little

285
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,759
bit unusual there's a there's a um web-

286
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:13,879
based component and then a smart device

287
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,278
based component to this app and the

288
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,000
web-based component in part is

289
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:19,360
Administration so that's the part that I

290
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,600
get to use to add information um it's

291
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,919
also where the information is stored and

292
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,519
then for the user side of it we have

293
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,319
some where they have to create locations

294
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,078
and I'll show you what locations means

295
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,160
as we go along um and then on the smart

296
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,000
device side of it that's where there's

297
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,039
sort of information retrieval from by a

298
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,799
user and then you can also collect

299
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:40,958
information Through The Scouting on that

300
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:43,559
side um and so instead of actually using

301
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:45,439
the real app because scrolling I think

302
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:46,679
might make everyone dizzy and sick to

303
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,800
their stomachs I've actually got

304
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,519
screenshots I brought my iPad if anyone

305
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,958
wants to play with it at the end um you

306
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:56,120
can come up and play with it on my

307
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:58,319
iPad so on this um I want information

308
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,360
side of things and also there's also

309
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,959
regulations by Apple now we learned that

310
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,600
um you cannot require an account be made

311
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:10,399
without giving them some information

312
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,600
that is free it's not free because they

313
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,039
had to pay for the app but they but you

314
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,920
have to give them information that does

315
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:17,480
not require collecting any demographic

316
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:21,599
information or anything all we ask for

317
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,000
is zip code um but so that there's on

318
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,320
the on the smart device there's a whole

319
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,720
lot of it that you can do without

320
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,000
creating an account and that sort of

321
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,000
information so um that's p beneficials

322
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,240
application technology and pesticide

323
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,759
interactions so this is what it looks

324
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,240
like when you get it depending on

325
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:41,078
whether you're on an iPhone or an iPad

326
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,278
bigger or smaller just a set of buttons

327
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:44,838
and um they're we hope they're fairly

328
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,360
clear as to what they do it's

329
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,120
interesting when we've got application

330
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,919
application technology and we're calling

331
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,560
this an app which is an application and

332
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,639
so again sometimes the the computer

333
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:57,039
terminology and the scientific

334
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,480
terminology or the users technology

335
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:01,159
overlaps um so you can get to all of

336
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,159
these things several ways and we wanted

337
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:05,600
to have it be that way so that wherever

338
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:07,600
you are you can find a way to get to the

339
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,839
information you want and I'll show some

340
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,519
of that as we go along too so one of the

341
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,680
easy ways is you start with the buttons

342
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:15,799
see if this is yep so it doesn't show oh

343
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:17,198
I'm showing it on the wrong thing that's

344
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:19,399
what I'm looking at so this is a

345
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:21,278
hamburger see I learned I learned that I

346
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:22,480
never knew about it did you know that's

347
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:23,600
called a hamburger that's a hamburger

348
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,079
and when you click on that you'll also

349
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,800
get a written menu that'll show up on

350
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,198
the side so if the buttons aren't

351
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,759
working for you you can also um get the

352
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:33,519
menu there but that also is where you

353
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:35,319
can log in and out and so forth so um to

354
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,198
use Scout or application you have to be

355
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,920
logged in for the other ones you don't

356
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:41,838
and then from page to page we have it

357
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:43,639
set up so you can go page to page also

358
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,360
so this was set up for Greenhouse

359
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:48,240
ornamentals it's pretty adaptable to

360
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,879
Greenhouse vegetable crops also um and

361
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,320
you'll see Hops at the end and also to

362
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:53,799
some extent to Greenhouse production of

363
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,040
hops but that's where the pest came in

364
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:58,719
and so um for each one of these groups

365
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:00,519
you can click on it and so if you click

366
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,959
on a you'll get green Peach apid and

367
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:05,879
potato apid and Fox Glove apid as a list

368
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:07,559
and then you can go into those pests um

369
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:09,198
as I said one one of the things that's

370
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:10,879
nice is that if you get a request to add

371
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:14,000
a pest we can actually add them pretty

372
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:15,639
easily um and that's I think that to me

373
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,799
is an innovation in that I don't have to

374
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:21,360
go back to the company every time for

375
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:23,000
them to add information I can do it so

376
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,199
here's West the Western Flower thrips

377
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,480
page the beginning of the page um and

378
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:28,838
then these buttons are all live so if

379
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,560
you come in if you're like I think I've

380
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:31,760
got Western Flower thrips so you come

381
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,838
into that page and I'm like oh which

382
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,399
beneficials will work you can click any

383
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,760
of these and go to the beneficials page

384
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,399
directly so um that's we're trying we're

385
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:41,799
always trying to think about how people

386
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,919
think about information and where they

387
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:46,359
go from where um but on this on the on

388
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:49,000
the pest page this is an example of a

389
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,120
pest page there's the beneficials damage

390
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,519
cause biology monitoring methods

391
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,159
photographs life cycle and environment

392
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,879
so it starts like that it's the long

393
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,759
oops hit the mute I hit the mute hit it

394
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:04,919
again all right okay so you can scroll

395
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:07,320
down from those beneficials to biology

396
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:08,599
and identification we've got pictures in

397
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,040
there so that people can look at them

398
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,560
but also some information as much

399
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:15,000
information as we can find in terms of

400
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:17,239
um what kind of damage would you expect

401
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,600
to see from that pest uh what

402
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,039
information from the biological side

403
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,879
would be useful in terms if you're

404
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:24,319
trying to manage it um how do you

405
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,039
monitor

406
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,199
it U and then you know is there some

407
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:32,159
information on environment that affects

408
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:34,479
the the development of the pest

409
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:36,759
also and so for each one of those we can

410
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,480
scroll down so on the this is now on the

411
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:40,399
website that picture all that other

412
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,560
information was on the smart divite side

413
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,240
this is how I would add a new Pest and

414
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,518
the information that would go in so I

415
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,360
would put in the scientific name the

416
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,799
common name and there's pest type

417
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,240
there's a list of different pests that

418
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:54,758
list of pests I showed you aphids spider

419
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,519
or mites so forth um I can actually add

420
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:57,759
more for some reason we get some other

421
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,240
new kind of pest that's a whole

422
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,360
different pest type I can actually just

423
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,959
add a new one and then this is the list

424
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,879
of beneficials that we have in the

425
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,799
system I can add new ones of those if I

426
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,360
need to um and when you're putting up a

427
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,599
new pest you just say okay here's the

428
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,360
ones that are used to control that and

429
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,600
then for each of those segments on the

430
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,278
on the smart device there's a just a

431
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,959
block box to put content in and so it's

432
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:22,879
it's very easy yep Betsy are you as

433
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:26,278
administrator the only individual who

434
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,399
can modify the site um Brian Eau is an

435
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:29,078
administrator and then some of the

436
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:31,039
gorgeous people are are also

437
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:32,838
administrators um but there's not very

438
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:34,679
many of us right so when you right so

439
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:36,240
that when you if you were if you were

440
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:38,000
had an account with it you would see all

441
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,519
of this information up here except from

442
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,278
You' see your own name but you wouldn't

443
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,198
see admin because that's only if you're

444
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:45,639
an administrator yep and it probably

445
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:47,879
helps to have not too many people in

446
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:50,839
there right the gorgeous guys probably

447
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:53,198
are not going in there much um this is

448
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:54,800
the idea then of a beneficials page and

449
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:56,758
again it's the same sort of thing where

450
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,599
you say okay I've got cumus to control

451
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:59,519
Western Flower thrips what else will it

452
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,800
control

453
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,078
and then you can flip back and forth

454
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,240
between beneficials and pests and then

455
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:08,359
the same idea that there I'm going to do

456
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:10,039
that again aren't I U so biology and

457
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,959
identification information and we have

458
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:15,240
it standardized as to what kind of

459
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:18,119
information goes in there are pictures

460
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,039
um life cycle and environment um and

461
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,120
then application methods and you can see

462
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:23,480
here an example of things that we learn

463
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,000
as we go along I don't know where all

464
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,600
the periods went I have to go back in

465
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,879
and make sure all the periods are

466
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,278
actually in there they disappeared when

467
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:33,278
I wrote it there are none in here oh

468
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:36,360
there's one um another one a couple but

469
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:38,559
I don't so they're randomly there or not

470
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,399
there but here's one too where it says

471
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:42,758
you can see the application technology

472
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,759
page for more information another place

473
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:46,639
where we have a bit of information

474
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:48,680
here's the specifics just for this

475
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,799
beneficial but on the application

476
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:52,879
technology page we have more information

477
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:55,000
so it would look like this if you click

478
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,399
this application technology button you

479
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,879
would get places to find information and

480
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:01,360
then you could scroll down through

481
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,078
through the different beneficials to see

482
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,078
if there's more than one way of applying

483
00:17:03,078 --> 00:17:07,480
it sometimes you don't know that when

484
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:09,240
you first find out about it um and so if

485
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,400
you want to just sprinkle it over the

486
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,720
foliage that's one method of applying it

487
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,480
but applying it in a sachche is works

488
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,439
better for certain situations in

489
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,078
ornamentals um longer term management

490
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:21,679
easier to put on if you've got plants

491
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:23,639
that are in hanging baskets all sorts of

492
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,480
things it's nice to know if there's

493
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,559
multiple methods of applying it so you

494
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:31,640
can see for eilus there's only one but

495
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:31,639
for andersa which is a there's more than

496
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,798
one and then ways to check for viability

497
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,679
and this is really important from our

498
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:41,279
point of view if you buy something and

499
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:43,320
it's dead it's not going to work

500
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:45,960
probably uh and so but how do you know

501
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:47,240
if it's alive or dead well you can

502
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,919
sometimes you can see them but sometimes

503
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,919
you're putting pey out you don't know if

504
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:52,400
they're alive or dead so is there a way

505
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:54,720
you can take those pey that you

506
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,640
purchased put them in a jar with a

507
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,519
yellow sticky trap and and watch the

508
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,080
Wasps you can count the number of wasps

509
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:02,158
that Happ hatch so that's something that

510
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,720
would be true for wasps if it's a Mite

511
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:05,640
we want you to mix it in the in the

512
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,679
carrier sprinkle it out or cut open a

513
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,759
sachche and see if you can see the mites

514
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,240
running around um and you need to know

515
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,720
something about them sometimes to know

516
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,000
which mites you're seeing because there

517
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,038
are food mites in there for the for the

518
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,720
predator mites as well so information on

519
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:22,879
how you might know whether what you

520
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,480
purchased is actually alive um and then

521
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,480
there's a button for pesticide

522
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:31,120
interactions um here and when you click

523
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,880
on that you get this kind of a table so

524
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,959
um this information all comes from side

525
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,080
effects lists that are put out by the

526
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,720
companies that sell beneficials but the

527
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:40,759
pesticides are based on the Cornell

528
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,960
guidelines so they're sort of New York

529
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:44,480
oriented um and they are the ones for

530
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,279
the greenhouse and ornamentals so

531
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,640
they're not all the vegetable crops ones

532
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:49,960
also um we could add that if we had a

533
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,360
lot of people saying we want to use this

534
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,440
for vegetable crops we could add that um

535
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:56,240
and some of them overlap but so the

536
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,000
information is usually based on the

537
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,400
stage of the P of the beneficial if they

538
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,359
know you can see there's lots of blanks

539
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,080
they don't know that information and

540
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:06,879
then it's four is very very toxic to the

541
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:09,279
beneficial it goes down to one which is

542
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,159
least tox toxic and then this is a big

543
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:12,918
deal because if you've got something

544
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:14,760
that's very toxic but it only persists

545
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:16,720
two weeks that means you can come back

546
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:18,038
in with beneficials in two weeks if it's

547
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,480
greater than eight weeks you're out

548
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:21,798
you're out of business for ornamental

549
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,519
bedding plants it's too long a time so

550
00:19:21,798 --> 00:19:24,639
once you've put that pesticide on you're

551
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,119
not going to be putting any more of

552
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,038
those beneficials on so that information

553
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:31,558
is really useful in terms of it again as

554
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:33,359
I said for managing those the the sort

555
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:34,759
of interactions between the pesticides

556
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,439
and the the beneficials that you might

557
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:38,960
be

558
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,200
using then on The Scouting side of the

559
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,079
thing of things um that's where you have

560
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,038
to use both the web and the app uh and

561
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:47,319
that you can add information either way

562
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:49,158
which is sometimes useful if you've got

563
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:51,359
a bunch of Scouts and they're all

564
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:53,039
scouting in on clipboards and then they

565
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,519
might send take their sheets to a

566
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,079
central place to have the information

567
00:19:54,519 --> 00:20:00,319
put on um you can actually have multiple

568
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:01,759
Scouts scouting on the same account they

569
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:03,439
each have they have to have each paid to

570
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:04,879
have the app on their smart device but

571
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,279
they can count they can work on the same

572
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,799
account so that all that information

573
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:09,639
would go in so if you've got a

574
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:11,839
greenhouse grower in range one and a

575
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,360
different grower in range two um they

576
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:15,079
can they can scout on the same app so

577
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:18,359
all the information goes into the the

578
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:20,599
head grower um and then it's easier to

579
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:22,599
see charts on the website but you can

580
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:23,918
also see them on the smart device but

581
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:24,839
you just got a small screen it's harder

582
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,038
to see

583
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:29,119
details so if this is where you're if

584
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:31,079
you're going to create a location to

585
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:32,639
where you're going to scout um you'd

586
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:35,038
come in on the website and this is the

587
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,240
page that you would see and we set it up

588
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:40,079
so that there are two levels of um

589
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,960
location and location could be anything

590
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,319
it could be a physical location but it

591
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,600
could also be a crop so it could be

592
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:47,200
patunas because in some green houses the

593
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:48,439
patunas move around while the pests are

594
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,360
going to move around with the patunas

595
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,519
they're not going to stay in the

596
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,798
location so the crop is actually more

597
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:55,400
important than the physical location but

598
00:20:53,798 --> 00:20:57,879
you can put in as much as you want you

599
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,640
could say this is range one Greenhouse 5

600
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:03,039
bench three and then have four cards in

601
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,280
addition to that and the idea is you can

602
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,038
put in anything there you want it

603
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:08,079
doesn't have to be anything set it'll

604
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:10,000
create the greenhouse 1 two 3 four if

605
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:12,240
you just let it do whatever it wants and

606
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,319
card numbers but and cards don't

607
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,640
actually have to be cards we think about

608
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:17,038
cards because we're counting things on

609
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,240
yellow sticky cards but if you're

610
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:20,558
talking about aphids you're not likely

611
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,599
to see them on yellow sticky cards

612
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:23,038
unless you're really not paying

613
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:24,879
attention and now you have alate ones

614
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:26,480
that are flying around and getting stuck

615
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,799
so it might be that you're looking at a

616
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,278
at a plant to count aphids you you can

617
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:31,960
also do it in terms of when you're

618
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:34,159
looking at them you can have an actual

619
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,159
number or you can have something that's

620
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,799
like okay if I put down zero it means

621
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,440
there aren't any if I put down one there

622
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:41,240
are a few if I put down 10 there's kind

623
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,120
of a medium amount if I put down a 100

624
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,919
there's a lot so it'll still graph out

625
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,839
to show you what's going on with the

626
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:48,720
population um but you don't have to have

627
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:50,359
an exact count you don't it's not

628
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,839
specific that it has to have a exact

629
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:53,278
counts so when you're setting up your

630
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:55,038
locations you're also going to choose

631
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:56,839
which pest you're going to Scout and

632
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:59,119
then also down below here if you scroll

633
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:00,359
down you can also choose beneficial why

634
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:02,678
would I have beneficials why am I

635
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:05,158
Scouting For

636
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:06,278
beneficials they're see if they're there

637
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:08,240
so if you've released if you think

638
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:10,519
you've released wasps you might catch

639
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,319
your wasps on your yellow sticky cards

640
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:13,720
and then you know that they're there the

641
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,960
other thing is we find sometimes people

642
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,200
are like well let's be efficient and

643
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,000
we're going to put our Banker plants

644
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,880
with these W we're producing the Wasps

645
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,519
right next to the yellow sticky card

646
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,278
you're going to catch a lot of wasps you

647
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:24,759
should actually separate them if you're

648
00:22:23,278 --> 00:22:25,798
catching too many wasps on your sticky

649
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:27,000
cards you might need to think about

650
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:28,599
where you're putting your sticky cards

651
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,200
so that sort of useful information I I

652
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:32,839
guess

653
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:35,278
too and then once you create a location

654
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:37,839
the system actually creates a QR code

655
00:22:35,278 --> 00:22:39,038
and you can print it out and the idea is

656
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:40,199
um we want to be able to so you can

657
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:41,919
print it out you can maybe shrink it

658
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,400
down print it out um we also made sure

659
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,520
that it actually says where it is

660
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,919
because a bunch of pieces of paper with

661
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:48,679
QR codes that don't tell you where they

662
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:50,600
are is not very useful that we learned

663
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:52,240
that in the middle of it doing all this

664
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:53,918
um and then so then you can come into an

665
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,319
area you can just shoot the QR code with

666
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,400
your smart device and it knows where you

667
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:58,200
are and it will load all that

668
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,919
information that you put there does it

669
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,640
work Missy yeah so Missy is that's why

670
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:04,320
she SEC she's my secret weapon because

671
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,200
she's actually using this and when she

672
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:07,720
finds bugs she tells me and that's great

673
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,840
we need to know what what works and what

674
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,079
doesn't

675
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:13,720
work so that was again we're trying to

676
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:14,759
make it easy when you're going scouting

677
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,400
and then when you're on your smart

678
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:18,200
device this is what it looks like so

679
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,960
it'll it'll automatically you can either

680
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,159
select the location by hand or you can

681
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,000
shoot the QR code um and then it gives

682
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:27,039
you the date the current date but if you

683
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,119
want to change the date you can um

684
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,079
because you might want to go back and

685
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:31,918
add in information to

686
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,319
something and then it's got the

687
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,640
locations and then it whatever you chose

688
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,798
to be that you were going to scout is

689
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,120
here but this is also important because

690
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:42,158
sometimes you said okay we usually it's

691
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,798
Peppers we have aphids and we have uh

692
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,640
White flies but then you're there and

693
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:46,879
suddenly you've got thrips on them so

694
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,600
you want to be able to add that so you

695
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,600
can still count

696
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:53,678
them and then the same thing is true

697
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,440
this is on the website but when you're

698
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,960
creating an application report um it

699
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,480
would look much like the the picture

700
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,798
that I just showed you for the Scouting

701
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,759
Report um same thing in that it it'll

702
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:06,679
dat it'll pull the date up um you tell

703
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:08,278
it where you are and then because in

704
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:10,000
with applications of beneficial

705
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:12,000
pesticides you might apply them over a

706
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,159
larger area so that you don't have to go

707
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,319
in for each one and do The Scouting

708
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,640
Report or the application report you can

709
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,798
tell it okay we're in Greenhouse one and

710
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,440
we're going to put it over the whole

711
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:23,839
area that's covered by all of those

712
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,558
cards so you can add them all in once it

713
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,158
also knows what you're what you're

714
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:28,879
targeting and again you can add a

715
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:30,240
different one if you need to

716
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,240
um and you can put on either a

717
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,880
beneficial or a pesticide you can do

718
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,519
multiple applications on the same day

719
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,200
but you have to do them on different

720
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:38,440
application reports because if you put

721
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,240
in a beneficial and then put in a

722
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,320
pesticide It'll ask it'll say you can't

723
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,319
do both um and then you're going to put

724
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:48,000
in rates and oops rates and

725
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:49,519
units and we have a lot of places for

726
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,919
notes in case there's something that you

727
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:53,000
need to remember when you went in there

728
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:54,278
and you're doing that um and another

729
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,679
thing that's nice is when you're on the

730
00:24:54,278 --> 00:24:58,200
web anyway it shows you all the previous

731
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:00,360
applications so you can see what you've

732
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,038
done done already it doesn't show those

733
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:03,038
on the smart

734
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,640
device so if you this is again is the

735
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,959
web once you've got a location created

736
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,200
you can do lots of different things you

737
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,960
can go back and find the QR code again

738
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,840
you can look you can add a new scoutt

739
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,120
report or new application report you can

740
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:21,359
change data if you need to um and then

741
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:23,479
reports is the part that um is is I

742
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:26,038
think useful in terms of saying okay so

743
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:29,360
we did all these things what's happening

744
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:32,119
so this is a typical graph of fake data

745
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:33,759
but um so the idea being oh look so what

746
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:36,359
what are the fungus each one is each

747
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:38,359
color is a different insect um you know

748
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:40,918
what are the numbers doing over time and

749
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:43,199
then these vertical bars are application

750
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:44,880
so here oh look at that we we had fungus

751
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,600
Nets increasing we put nematodes on and

752
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,159
hooray they drop down but that's what

753
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,278
what we wanted to be able people to be

754
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:53,159
able to say oh look you can see it it's

755
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:54,880
fast you can look at that quickly and

756
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:57,240
say that something is happening or not

757
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,320
happening and then all the it all scroll

758
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,399
down every application or every um

759
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:03,720
scouting report and application report

760
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:04,879
is listed in the so you can scroll down

761
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,960
through them and see what the actual

762
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,679
information is and there are also

763
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,079
filters it doesn't show on this picture

764
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:11,399
but there are filters so I can say okay

765
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,000
I don't want to look at all these pests

766
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:14,319
I just want to look at one or I don't

767
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,119
want to look at all these dates I just

768
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:18,599
want to look at this range or I just

769
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:21,038
want to look at something in particular

770
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:23,558
um and then also you can print these you

771
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:26,759
can print the graphs and all this data

772
00:26:23,558 --> 00:26:26,759
um from this page as

773
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:31,480
well so I've covered some of these pros

774
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:34,080
and cons as I've gone along um it's easy

775
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,480
to add information and or change

776
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,319
information um there's a a direct

777
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,159
contact us button that goes both to me

778
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:41,599
and to gorgees so if I get a question I

779
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,000
know what's going on and sometimes I can

780
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,079
answer them or sometimes I can go to

781
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,640
gorgees and saying okay they're having

782
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:50,000
these problems what do we do um multiple

783
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,840
people can scout into the same account

784
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,278
uh the the cons are I used to say it was

785
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:55,639
like having a baby now I say it's like

786
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,200
having a hormonal teenager cuz

787
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,720
invariably you change one thing and

788
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,080
something else happens over here here

789
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,839
and you have to keep looking at it to

790
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,199
make sure what what happened when you

791
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:06,639
did whatever you did and that so it does

792
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,720
take maintenance and I'm not sure I'm as

793
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,278
good as I should be on maintaining

794
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,558
maintenance on my side where I make need

795
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:13,880
to make sure that all the information

796
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:16,038
stays up to date but I try and then on

797
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:18,278
their side um when things go wrong they

798
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:19,798
have to go in back in and figure it out

799
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:21,759
um and it does require marketing so

800
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:24,879
we've sold about 300 of these so um

801
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:26,319
that's pretty good I think um as a start

802
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,360
and then the next thing is okay what's

803
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:31,119
next so I need to load the updates on

804
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:32,959
Greenhouse but we have two more U well

805
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:35,798
two three two that I'm involved with and

806
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,319
a third one once uh gorgees came up with

807
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:39,519
this system it's like well we might as

808
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:41,558
well use the same framework for

809
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:43,639
additional for additional system so

810
00:27:41,558 --> 00:27:45,278
we've got Conifer Scout in the works

811
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,559
this is a picture of the Conifer Scout

812
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:49,200
and you can see it's got some of the

813
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,759
same um icons and then it's got some

814
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,759
additional things in there in terms of

815
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:55,240
diseases are in the Conifer Scout and

816
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:56,839
weeds um there's a hop Scout for both

817
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,839
field and Greenhouse that we're working

818
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:01,720
on that one and then someone else took

819
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:03,599
the format from IPM and did um a sweet

820
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,519
corn scouting app using the same sort of

821
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:08,439
thing so once you've got that system it

822
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,599
makes it easier to do um that's all that

823
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,240
I have we have time for questions does

824
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:15,558
anyone have any

825
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:18,120
questions question to it probably not

826
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:20,678
the best the most polite question but

827
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:21,959
how much would this cost it cost 15,000

828
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:24,038
I figured somebody would ask that it

829
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,919
cost so when we went in originally with

830
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:28,720
Gorges it cost 15,000 I will lay you

831
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:31,000
odds that they spent more than that in

832
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,558
terms of person people's time on getting

833
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,880
it set up so now when we go in and do

834
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:38,558
another one we still pay 15,000 for the

835
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,200
next one um and I think the idea is okay

836
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:43,839
we're kind of at some point we'll come

837
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,880
out we'll come out even um so yes and as

838
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:48,119
I say I think we all learned how to do

839
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,640
this together whether or not if you went

840
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:51,359
now and said we want to start from

841
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,759
scratch and create an app whether they'

842
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:55,479
say oh yeah it's going to cost you much

843
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:58,440
more I don't know um but the system they

844
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,679
have now seems to be easier to work with

845
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,240
faster either it's the system or the

846
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:05,600
person doing it I'm not sure but I think

847
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,839
it's the system as well um so and and

848
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:09,678
even though we're using the same

849
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:12,119
framework for the next one um there's

850
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,840
still some additional work that has to

851
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:16,278
be done so it's not certainly not free

852
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:18,119
to do it I want to actually translate

853
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:20,798
Greenhouse Scout into Spanish and French

854
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:22,319
I had a request from Quebec in French um

855
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:24,918
and so I don't know I need to ask them

856
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:26,158
if we just if we want to translate it is

857
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:28,679
that going to cost the same amount or

858
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,840
would that be cheaper to do but I don't

859
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:35,640
have y so in the 11 years that you've

860
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:38,199
been doing green pemo DM Betsy have you

861
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:41,240
either seen anecdotally or do you have

862
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:44,519
data on the amount of reduction in

863
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,519
pesticide use we don't have very good

864
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:48,240
information on amount of pesticide use

865
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:49,759
reduction in pesticide use and it is

866
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,200
information that we would love to have

867
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:53,640
and is kind of difficult to collect we

868
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,278
do have information that shows that

869
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:58,038
there's an increasing number of Growers

870
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:59,880
using biological control and and the

871
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:02,319
assumption is if that's true then there

872
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,519
should be a reduction in pesticide use

873
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:07,200
um and we also it's like we'd like to

874
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:09,759
have more efficient pesticide use which

875
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,840
would also then reduce pesticide use but

876
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:14,480
it it is the information we always want

877
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:16,558
and we're not as good at figuring out

878
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,679
how to find it for that we need actually

879
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,440
Growers who will give us all their data

880
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:22,240
on their pesticide applications as well

881
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,000
and it really should be I think we need

882
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,000
to look at it over a threeyear span to

883
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,359
be able to say we've actually reduced

884
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,679
this sorry awesome app considered a

885
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:35,479
maybe like premium model

886
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:37,480
where for free you could maybe just

887
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,440
access some basic information but if you

888
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,480
wanted to set up locations or more

889
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,120
intensive larger scale

890
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,640
things have have to pay for extra

891
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:49,199
services that we can get we did but the

892
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,880
biggest problem is having a maintenance

893
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,399
fund to keep the whole thing going and

894
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,960
so that's why we tried to keep we were

895
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:55,359
trying to keep it down at 5 but then

896
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,798
when we found out that Apple took this

897
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:58,839
much already it's was like well there's

898
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:02,038
nothing so we figured that

899
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:04,439
$10 is low enough that it it hopefully

900
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:06,000
is not keeping anybody out from using it

901
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,679
that but it would be nice to have it

902
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,679
free but I we didn't ever figure out a

903
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,960
way to do that oh I just went like some

904
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,440
of the right cured servfaces right and

905
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,440
so I mean the way it set up now there

906
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,960
are sort of two levels that it's not

907
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,639
changing price but it's whether or not

908
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,319
you create an account so I could see you

909
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:25,038
could you could do that pretty easily

910
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:27,480
but um are you collecting any of the

911
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:30,079
data on the back end so you know you get

912
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,519
an idea say that pesticide usage or

913
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:35,199
other things that may be anonymized a

914
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:37,440
little bit or Regional Checker outbreak

915
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,880
right we have we have the ability to

916
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,639
look at it um we haven't had too many

917
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,240
people using it for scouting or not as

918
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:44,479
many people using it for scouting but

919
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,960
it's one of those things where I need

920
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,759
about a week to go in and there and sit

921
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,840
there and look through it and see if we

922
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:51,398
can see who's using it for scouting even

923
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:54,158
and then yeah what what kind of

924
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:56,439
information are they seeing what and can

925
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,519
we collect information from that side to

926
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,880
be able to use and to be able to say Yep

927
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:03,120
this is here's not sure we could

928
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,080
actually prove a reduction in pesticides

929
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,319
unless we had scouting data from

930
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:10,240
somebody for over multiple years an

931
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:13,558
individual account um but but the

932
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:17,079
potential is there so yeah has questions

933
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:17,079
I can jeva do you have any

934
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:24,079
questions I have a question um

935
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,440
collecting zip code information and I'm

936
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:28,720
curious if the app includes any outlets

937
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,278
for U people in the same region maybe to

938
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,200
connect whether that's just through a

939
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:35,440
discussion forum or um I don't know some

940
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,840
other format but is there any

941
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,320
connectivity between app users right now

942
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:41,638
that's a great question I never thought

943
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:43,398
of it um it's really a good idea and we

944
00:32:41,638 --> 00:32:45,398
should see that that might be something

945
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:47,038
that we could do um because that would

946
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:48,918
also give us information about what

947
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:52,079
kinds of what things people are looking

948
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:55,399
for um so thank you I have to go and see

949
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:58,079
if I can figure out a way to do that we

950
00:32:55,398 --> 00:32:59,638
have um we would have to put it up on

951
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:03,038
the front end

952
00:32:59,638 --> 00:33:05,119
because trying to think if we have email

953
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:06,679
addresses we might have email addresses

954
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:08,239
and so it might be something we could do

955
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:09,720
that way but otherwise we'd have to put

956
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,000
it up on the front end that sort of says

957
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,919
if you'd like to be part of the

958
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,919
discussion group here's how you here's

959
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:18,600
how you join in that's a great question

960
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:21,559
thanks I hadah to do that yeah I know

961
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:24,319
she does she has lots of time I

962
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:27,918
know any other questions

963
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:30,000
TOA not a question D so is there any way

964
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:33,519
you can share this information with like

965
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,759
multiple people like say there's like a

966
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,599
a range of houses and those people don't

967
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:42,038
scbe but you want to share those

968
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:45,240
information with say multiple like users

969
00:33:42,038 --> 00:33:47,398
like any users so if they're if they're

970
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,960
working on the same account they're all

971
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:50,918
putting their information into the same

972
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,558
account they can all see that

973
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:55,880
information so if only one person is

974
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:58,000
doing it and you know you want to share

975
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,360
this or like download this information

976
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,679
and shared with everybody else so

977
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:03,918
there's two ways you could do it someone

978
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,600
else could buy buy the app and then just

979
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,000
use the same account information to log

980
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:08,918
in and they could see the information

981
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,159
even if they weren't adding information

982
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:11,960
and the other thing you could do is

983
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,480
actually print off those graphs and

984
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,599
tables um and and then share it in a

985
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:21,878
hard

986
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:24,119
copy does that make sense y great thanks

987
00:34:21,878 --> 00:34:27,319
any other questions here yeah are you

988
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:28,480
all advertising it that is another

989
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,240
excellent question question it's kind of

990
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,358
tough well now we did uh in 2015 we made

991
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:35,878
the 15 top uh Greenhouse apps that was

992
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:38,279
nice that was information we didn't have

993
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:39,960
to go out and and promote um and we try

994
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,480
and send it out periodically whenever

995
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,000
you do something new you get a chance to

996
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:46,119
advertise it again that's another reason

997
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,079
for actually translating it um and so

998
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:50,720
we've we've done a lot of with um the

999
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:52,519
presentations that we do out to growers

1000
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:54,678
in the state we've done a lot of that I

1001
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:56,480
got invited to Calvary Alberta to talk

1002
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:59,119
to Alberta Growers and present the

1003
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,838
information um um Brian was the other

1004
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,640
half of my team did it down did

1005
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:06,400
presented it for the plant and soil um

1006
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,400
program that they have in January last

1007
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,519
year so that's one of the things you

1008
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,639
have to keep talking about it but you

1009
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:12,119
know we kind of get done with it it's

1010
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:14,118
like oh it's old news do we go out and

1011
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:15,640
talk about it again um but we that's

1012
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:17,200
what we need to do and that's a whole

1013
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:21,118
another it's another

1014
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:23,719
job but um yeah so anytime we can find

1015
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,559
somebody that wants to send out the

1016
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:29,799
information y have your users identified

1017
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:31,119
tests that you had thought yes I had one

1018
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:35,000
that I added in there that I was

1019
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:37,200
requested it was on thrips is that right

1020
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,079
um and so yeah they said we we need this

1021
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:40,519
one and so it's like great if you can

1022
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:42,359
either send me information or if I can

1023
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:43,960
find the information to fill in all

1024
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:46,239
those blanks I'll put it in so I did

1025
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,599
that and so that's as I say that the

1026
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:49,159
fact that I can do that without having

1027
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,000
to go back to the company which would

1028
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:53,519
cost money um is a wonderful thing it

1029
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,880
makes life pretty easy and we do

1030
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:57,880
something get new information on

1031
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,559
beneficials as well yeah yeah so do you

1032
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:03,720
keep track of how many down so far and

1033
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:07,599
do you see a trend that Growers or or

1034
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:08,879
even people watching using yes and you

1035
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,680
can always see where number I've just

1036
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,000
talked about it I think if you track

1037
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:16,639
that you would see oh yes we we did a

1038
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,559
presentation for the aerc organization

1039
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,679
that was here for their meeting last

1040
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,318
year and yep there's a bump there I can

1041
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:25,000
actually go in and see all the names too

1042
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:26,358
but um I think I think that's one of the

1043
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,280
things and again that goes back to the

1044
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:30,598
question about advertising every time we

1045
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,000
advertise it we get a bum um and because

1046
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:34,559
otherwise it's it's not out there you

1047
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,559
know in terms of things that are digital

1048
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,679
you know we're not hitting anybody's top

1049
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:40,920
list of of of the year of the apps of

1050
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:43,118
the year not not you're in competition

1051
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,440
with game apps so I mean if you Googled

1052
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,160
Greenhouse we might be in the top three

1053
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,679
hous but so yeah as I said there's about

1054
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:53,318
300 people on the list um and so that it

1055
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:54,719
comes in in funny little chunks so then

1056
00:36:53,318 --> 00:36:57,639
sometimes people will tell each each

1057
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:59,039
other which is useful so for something

1058
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:03,159
like this that the people who have

1059
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:05,358
bought it should also have an annual fee

1060
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:07,239
to pay for the maintenance it's not just

1061
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:09,279
a one time thing because essentially

1062
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:12,639
your maintenance fees are coming on the

1063
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:15,079
heels of new people who sign up y can

1064
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:18,400
can you go back in and I'm sure there

1065
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:22,359
are apps that do that with apple I mean

1066
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:26,519
can can you Institute a $2 a year

1067
00:37:22,358 --> 00:37:28,318
maintenance fee on is that permissible I

1068
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:30,000
suspect it can be done and there are

1069
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:31,559
probably some apps that do it but I

1070
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,039
don't think there's M does anybody know

1071
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:35,199
of an app that has a maintenance fee

1072
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:37,400
that you have to go in and

1073
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:39,279
pay I can't think of any and so whether

1074
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,240
or not it's it's possible I don't know

1075
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,240
but you're right that is it is you know

1076
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:45,439
we are we are trying to get maintenance

1077
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:49,318
from people that it's a onetime purchase

1078
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:51,720
and so um it's like a subscription right

1079
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:55,239
there are apps that you have to renew

1080
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:58,679
every year so like I have a a family

1081
00:37:55,239 --> 00:38:02,959
calendar app that you can pay $30 but

1082
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:04,639
it's $30 every year right to have that

1083
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,159
so then the question is would people pay

1084
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:08,598
that and it kind of depends on how much

1085
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:10,318
use they're seeing if they you know if

1086
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:12,039
they think it's useful and it's like the

1087
00:38:10,318 --> 00:38:13,759
other problem that too is like oh you

1088
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:16,119
don't pay it one time and now all your

1089
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,720
data unless you have downloaded it all

1090
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:20,720
it's gone and so um but we didn't

1091
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:24,118
actually discuss the concept of having a

1092
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:25,838
recurring payment and um I don't see

1093
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:28,160
with the next two maybe that's something

1094
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:29,759
that we do or we put it up higher price

1095
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:32,279
it's hard to decide too what what's

1096
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,280
cheap anymore um I'm cheap so that I

1097
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,720
think $10 is like okay that's kind of a

1098
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,599
break point maybe 25 isn't easy is a

1099
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:40,759
break point for other people not

1100
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:44,200
considered too expensive to at least try

1101
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:48,319
now so any other questions for

1102
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:48,318
Betsy if not let's
