1
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,120
University thank you all for coming

3
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:15,559
today the title of my talk is

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:18,399
introgressing resistance to hempa mildo

5
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:21,000
into different genetic backgrounds I

6
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:24,278
know that some of you work with father

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,320
melus and there are 10,000 plant species

8
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:30,800
that are host to 650 father me so I'm

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,320
going to introduce the one that we are

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,719
working

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,320
with hemp PO mildo is the most prevalent

12
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:41,399
disease in indoor hemp cultivation and

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,840
it is caused by the biotrophic fungi

14
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:47,280
gisis and brochi it's an ice comis it it

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,239
grows on the leaves but you can also

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,558
find it growing on stems and

17
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:55,799
inflorescences and we also don't have

18
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:57,919
many fungicides that we could use that

19
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:01,919
are available to us mainly because they

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,920
are not on the fungicide lab

21
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:09,118
and now I want to tell you a story I

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:12,159
want us to go back to 2018

23
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:15,599
2019 and at that point farmers in New

24
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,000
York started trying to grow hemp outside

25
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,599
but there was not really like a history

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,519
of growing hemp here so which were the

27
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:27,359
cultiv war that are adapted to this

28
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:30,519
climate to the soil um to the latitude

29
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,920
so what Larry La did was get

30
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:36,078
a lot of cultivars different genetic

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,759
materials and they planted them in New

32
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,719
York in different sites and they

33
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,319
collected a bunch of data growth rate

34
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:48,000
flowering time and one of those rates

35
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:51,039
was disease severity to PO M so what I

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,840
want you to look at in this graph is

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:59,000
this cultiv over here that is f 58 that

38
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:03,118
has a zero% disease rating both in

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,519
Geneva and in itha and that is great we

40
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,879
are trying to breed plants and we see a

41
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,239
plant that doesn't get bother M so it's

42
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:14,598
this not resistance what is going on

43
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:17,480
here so what they did is they grabbed FL

44
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:20,000
58 they crossed it that is our resistant

45
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:23,318
parent they cross it with theal parent

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,080
that is DJ's CBD did the linkage mapping

47
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:30,280
and they ended up finding out that there

48
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,040
is a mutation in an MLL Gene and for

49
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,840
those people that have worked with BOS

50
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:39,039
mlos are a big thing for people that

51
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,759
haven't worked with mlos they stand for

52
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:45,239
mildo resistant Locus o and a mutation

53
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:48,079
or loss of function mutation in these

54
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:51,519
genes confer is durable recessive and

55
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,400
broad spectrum uh resistance durable we

56
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,920
want it because pathogens are mutating

57
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,158
all the time and we don't want it to

58
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,679
break resistant so this is not supposed

59
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:02,679
to happen with the this type of

60
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,239
resistance and then broad spectrum

61
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:09,280
because it's not race specific as it

62
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:12,560
happens with other major R genes but we

63
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,239
also know that it's not great because

64
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,239
there are some biotropic negative

65
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:21,599
effects in other PL species such as

66
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:25,400
reduced yield and quality I included a

67
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:27,000
representation of what this ano proin

68
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,239
would look like it has seven

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,598
transmembrane domains has an end termin

70
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:37,759
that if this is a the plasma membrane it

71
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:40,598
would be in the extracellular part and

72
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,878
the C terminal would be uh towards the

73
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:48,039
cytoplasm we also know that there are

74
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:50,000
many mlo genes in Plants uh genomes and

75
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:54,840
that they participate in different plant

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,360
processes such as reproduction root they

77
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,000
thigmotropism symbiotic fungal

78
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,000
colonization and why we're here today

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,680
father M infections so as there are so

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,479
many of these genes in plant genomes

81
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,319
they are divided in seven clades Glade

82
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,759
five are the ones that are related to

83
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:15,958
powder M

84
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:18,238
infection and you usually need to mutate

85
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,280
all of them to have a resistant

86
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:24,198
phenotype in the plant

87
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,758
so you're going to be thinking now now

88
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:30,400
we know what mlos are and there I said

89
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:34,000
before that FL 58 had a mutation in the

90
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:37,560
mlo so it turns out that it has an

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,639
approximately 6.8 KV insertion between

92
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:46,000
the exons 10 and 11 and that causes uh

93
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,439
improper mRNA spacing and that results

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,038
in a premature stop

95
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:52,839
colon but you're going to say I'm I'm

96
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:55,478
only talking about one and I just said

97
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:58,119
that plants have can have many of them

98
00:04:55,478 --> 00:05:03,279
so how many mls's are in the Cannabis

99
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:05,038
attiva genome okay for us there is a

100
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:08,319
study published in

101
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:10,839
2021 and this is a long graph but I only

102
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:13,120
want you to look at the two clade five

103
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:16,239
mlos in the canis sativa

104
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,519
genome uh csmlo1 is the one I was

105
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,319
talking about that is in chromosome one

106
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:24,839
this uh is where the mutation is

107
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:28,240
insertion and csm4 that we don't really

108
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:31,159
know much about it so with the

109
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,199
information that I just gave you I

110
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:37,000
propose four research questions the

111
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,639
first one is if you are homozygous for

112
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,639
the f508 version of the

113
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,560
csm1 are you always going to be

114
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,199
susceptible what happens in other

115
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,000
backgrounds my second question is are

116
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,960
there other sources of resistance in

117
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,079
other genetic backgrounds and if there

118
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:56,719
are are they going to interact with this

119
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:59,599
Gene third question is

120
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,600
um are we going to start seeing negative

121
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,840
OT Tropic effects in other genetic

122
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,160
backgrounds we're not seeing them in F

123
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,239
58 but it doesn't mean that we're not

124
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,919
going to see them if we introgress this

125
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,079
gene into other

126
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:16,478
backgrounds and my question number four

127
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:19,639
is are we going to see other Al from the

128
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:23,038
other clade 5 csmo Gene that are going

129
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:25,598
to recover a susceptible phenotype in a

130
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:28,560
homoy CSM

131
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:30,879
f58 um

132
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,759
plant for the sake of time I'm not going

133
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,399
to talk about all of them I'm only going

134
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:38,400
to focus on the first one and the

135
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:42,198
hypothesis is that if you're homoy for

136
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:46,000
the AL you're going to be resistant to

137
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:48,840
powder and what am I doing to answer

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,240
this question or test this hypothesis so

139
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:55,439
the first thing that I did was generate

140
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:58,759
a list with genotypes that have the so

141
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:01,240
the first one in this list is f 58 we've

142
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:04,960
been talking about is homoy for that

143
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:10,400
version and then we had two other uh

144
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:13,519
genotypes 1910 1067 and yvg they are

145
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:17,359
both females and high cannabinoid

146
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:19,519
backgrounds they are both hetus and they

147
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,280
are susceptible to powder

148
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:26,279
mildo white CVG I have to say it's very

149
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:28,079
susceptible to hand poow M and it is so

150
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,119
susceptible that that is the genotype

151
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,038
that we use to maintain the single conal

152
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,720
isoline that we

153
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:37,000
have and

154
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,520
then I said that I wanted to introgress

155
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,160
it into different genetic backgrounds so

156
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:47,878
I made a list of uh cultur or genotypes

157
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:51,759
that we had access to that capture

158
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:54,000
genetic variation so there are different

159
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,879
types of materials that belong to

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,439
different Market classes different Sexes

161
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,439
what they have in common is that they

162
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:03,719
are all susceptible to gomis and brocha

163
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:07,519
and that they are homos wild type or

164
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:10,919
almost homos wild type so I have my list

165
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:15,120
one my list two and what do I do I just

166
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:17,439
grw some right how am I approaching this

167
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,038
I put the two plants that I want to

168
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:23,199
cross into one pot then I put a cage on

169
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,680
top of them and on top of the cage I put

170
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,199
a poing

171
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:30,120
exclusion uh bag and then I take those

172
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,158
plants into our room that has the

173
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,918
irrigation system installed and uh that

174
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:37,838
room is in flowering inductive

175
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:40,639
conditions that means like is in short

176
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,320
days and we let them

177
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:46,480
cross so going back to the list that I

178
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:50,560
just showed you I've done most of the

179
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:53,959
crosses at during this winter I had um

180
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:57,278
52 crosses at the same time not all of

181
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:58,039
them worked most of them um the ones

182
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:02,039
that

183
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:04,519
are female M by female a bit more tricky

184
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:06,799
but what I'm planning to do is I'm

185
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:08,278
planning to plant the seeds in the field

186
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,199
this summer and evaluate their

187
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:15,039
susceptibility to handw M then I'm going

188
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,440
to choose plants to self or to cross

189
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,719
then I'm going to with those seeds I'm

190
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,560
going to plant them in the field next

191
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,800
year evaluate their susceptibility and

192
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:28,799
then compare the phenotype and the

193
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:32,879
genotype Bas it just right now in the

194
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:34,319
CSM one Al but we can add things later

195
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,000
as usually

196
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:41,240
happens

197
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,720
um and uh that is my plan for for the

198
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,159
summer with this I want to thank the

199
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,800
Larry smartlav my committee members and

200
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:51,958
the funding support and thank you for

201
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,958
coming and listening to

202
00:09:52,120 --> 00:10:00,120
me that's do you have any questions I

203
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:02,519
hope I was uh I didn't miss things yeah

204
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,240
how do the female by female Cress work

205
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:08,240
or don't work yeah so the question was

206
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,600
uh how do the female by female crosses

207
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,360
work so it

208
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,200
is hemp is quite plastic so you can

209
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,680
spray the female plant that you want uh

210
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,519
to start producing male flowers with SCS

211
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:22,799
silver thyo sulfate and after a couple

212
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,159
applications it's going to start

213
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:28,000
generating m flowers and those uh male

214
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,120
flowers produce

215
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,679
pollen when it

216
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,799
highly the problem with the high

217
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,000
cannabinoid plants is that they are

218
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:39,479
highly inbred and they are starting to

219
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,759
show um some problems when it comes to

220
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,039
generating viable pollen so they can

221
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:46,519
produce a lot of flowers and you're

222
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,679
happy and you think you're going to have

223
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:51,078
a lot of seeds and then you don't really

224
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:51,078
have that

225
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,720
many just to make sure that I got it so

226
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,919
the FL 58 it has a loss of function

227
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,839
mutation and that that leads it to have

228
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:04,639
resistance

229
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:08,000
yeah that's the hypothesis so uh what

230
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:11,399
the linkage mapping that was um George

231
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,240
and Ali paper they identified a marker

232
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:19,039
their most significant marker was close

233
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:21,839
to the csml gene it's in around

234
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:25,240
chromosome in chromosome one around

235
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:28,000
position 21 and that is a closest Gene

236
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,560
that um explains the phenotype that

237
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
we're seeing if it's mutated and it's

238
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:37,039
also being expressed but it is um it is

239
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,639
being transcri transcribed so there is

240
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:44,799
an M an MR

241
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:49,440
RNA but if I go

242
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:54,039
back it will cut the the protein around

243
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:56,680
here and this part the C terminal binds

244
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:59,278
to culin and it's supposed to be

245
00:11:56,679 --> 00:12:03,199
important for its function and it does

246
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:07,480
plus sense calcium um so we think that

247
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:11,278
yes it is a loss of mutation of function

248
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:13,278
mutation yeah I'm great presentation I'm

249
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:15,919
curious when you're going to inoculate

250
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:18,759
your field trials at like what stage and

251
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,799
are you looking to score for like adult

252
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:23,319
plant resistance or in

253
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:26,159
seedings thank you for that

254
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:29,680
question so in which the question was in

255
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:31,759
which state uh do I inoculate and the

256
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,759
yeah and when at what stage you gonna

257
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:38,039
screen for the disease unti and screen

258
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:41,159
so it does depend if I do it just in the

259
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:43,360
field I um I just depend on when we can

260
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:45,120
put the plants in the field and that I

261
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,360
would let them grow a bit and then

262
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,440
inoculate we don't I know that there is

263
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,519
different

264
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,440
susceptibility in um different

265
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,480
developmental stages in other plant

266
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,279
species we don't really know much about

267
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:05,199
it in hemp that is something I want to

268
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:09,439
consider yes um and when I did uh

269
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:11,519
Greenhouse inoculation last month I am

270
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,959
just depending on how much space they

271
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,879
have and uh they grow so fast then that

272
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:19,239
uh when I inoculated them like three

273
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:22,519
weeks after I sewed the seeds were like

274
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,759
this and then um right now they are

275
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:29,360
taller than

276
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:31,559
me so yes

277
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,560
thank

278
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:39,440
you awesome hello everyone um my name is

279
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:42,359
Beal and as Lou said I'm also a member

280
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:46,240
of the Smart Lab um I'm going to be

281
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:49,759
talking today about uh fiber hemp so

282
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,639
towards better fiber quality so we're

283
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:55,639
trying to characterize hemp fiber in

284
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:57,519
diverse germ plasm and one thing to know

285
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:59,879
is what hemp fiber even looks like if

286
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,839
you haven't seen hemp plant after it's

287
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,799
been reded so this is the process where

288
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,480
you let um the natural microbes that

289
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,198
exist in the field kind of break down

290
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,639
all the pectins that are holding

291
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:11,838
everything together and then it becomes

292
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:13,560
very easy to separate the fibers and

293
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,240
you'll get these two types of fibers so

294
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:19,719
you get vast fibers these are these long

295
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,560
fibers here they're high in cellulose

296
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,440
they're low in ligin and they have a

297
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:26,399
very high tensil strength so these vast

298
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,399
fibers are the flum tissue uh and you

299
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,799
also have the inner Woody core of the

300
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,039
hemp plant so that's called The Herd

301
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:34,879
this is short fibers they're higher in

302
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:38,399
ligman and they have a lower tensil

303
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:41,480
strength so this is the xylem of the

304
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,600
plant these fibers have many different

305
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,079
uses um they can be used as bedding for

306
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,759
animals The Herd is very absorbent you

307
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:51,519
can make textiles out of them so this is

308
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,879
an example of something you could go out

309
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,560
and buy now this is patagonia's um line

310
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:58,759
of hemp clothing which is very durable

311
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:01,319
and that's how it's marketed uh you can

312
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:03,079
also so make paper out of it of course

313
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,680
and people have been using hemp for a

314
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:06,599
very long time for these sorts of

315
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:09,198
applications but one of the newer

316
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,920
applications is in Composite Materials

317
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:13,639
so this is an example of BMW who is

318
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:15,679
showing off their car door that they

319
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:18,759
made out of natural fibers including

320
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:21,479
hemp um and fun fact this is actually

321
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:24,480
not a very new thing because Henry Ford

322
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,320
back in the early 1940s had a car that

323
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,639
was nicknamed the soybean car where he

324
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,639
used natural fibers that were rumored to

325
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:34,278
be soy um in a resin to create these

326
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,240
plastic panels on the outside of the car

327
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:38,559
and the goal was to make the car lighter

328
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,159
because back then they were using steel

329
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:43,439
so this isn't a entirely New Concept but

330
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:45,480
there is a renewed interest now in

331
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,360
sustainability and getting away from

332
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,879
petroleum based products and using more

333
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,079
renewable materials so this is an

334
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:56,679
interest in the automotive and

335
00:15:53,078 --> 00:16:00,919
potentially Aerospace um industry to use

336
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:00,919
composite materials using hemp

337
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,399
so some of the objectives of this

338
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:09,639
project are Guided by this um concept

339
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,720
that there are many uses for fibers so

340
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,560
um and also that we we don't exactly

341
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,519
know what um the variability that we

342
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:20,119
have in hempt to work with to try to

343
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:22,720
breed for better fiber quality so we

344
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,919
wanted to characterize a diverse set of

345
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,879
fiber varieties um for fiber quality and

346
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:30,278
also of course fiber yield yield is

347
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:32,240
always very important and identify the

348
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:34,919
variation in these traits among the

349
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,759
different varieties so here um you can

350
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:41,240
see a list of 12 cultivars that we

351
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:43,600
identified as um you know representing a

352
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,318
a broad range of the type of fiber hemp

353
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,920
that is currently being grown in the US

354
00:16:46,318 --> 00:16:51,639
so we have ital um Italian and French

355
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,278
varieties so these are the European

356
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:56,480
varieties that have been bred for a very

357
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:58,919
long time for you know a fiber purposes

358
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,159
um there's a mix of dious and manous

359
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:02,639
varieties almost all the French

360
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:05,759
varieties are manous uh and then you

361
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,279
also have these um Asian Chinese

362
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,759
background um varieties so there are is

363
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:12,279
an increasing interest in the US of

364
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:15,240
growing these they're very vigorous and

365
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:16,199
um perhaps they are better suited to

366
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,880
lower

367
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,480
latitudes and um so we're including

368
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,000
these and you'll notice also that we

369
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,798
have this here Ursa Alta so this is a

370
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,519
new variety that is coming out of the

371
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:30,720
smart program that we're releasing so uh

372
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:34,599
it's uh will be interesting to see how

373
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,079
this Stacks up to other um varieties or

374
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:38,918
some of these Chinese varieties could be

375
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:38,918
considered more land

376
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,759
races so some of the approaches that

377
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,798
we're taking to characterizing these uh

378
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:48,798
the fiber in these plants is a

379
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:51,960
histological approach so taking very

380
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:54,639
thin cross-sections using a microtom and

381
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,200
um looking at the fiber bundles under a

382
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,520
microscope we're also doing cell wall

383
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,600
component analysis so looking at the

384
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:04,639
different um sugars that are in the cell

385
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:05,558
walls like cellulose or Manos or um

386
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,759
different components that could be

387
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:10,879
making up cellulose or hemicellulose or

388
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,519
pectins so we also want to um get a

389
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,159
little bit more uh quantitative and

390
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:16,519
detailed view that's a bit more High

391
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:18,559
throughput than doing microscopy uh so

392
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:20,319
this is the thermog gometric analysis so

393
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:22,960
this can tell you the different

394
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:24,439
components that are in the whole M

395
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,759
tissue so you can do whole stem or you

396
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,798
could do just fibers um that will give

397
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:32,798
you the total amount of cellulose how

398
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:34,519
cellulose lignan Ash content so um that

399
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:37,440
is important for knowing you know what

400
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:40,038
your cellulose yield is in the plant um

401
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,519
we also have fiber strength testing so

402
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:43,200
that's an important you know

403
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,798
specification if you're making Composite

404
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,840
Materials you want to know how strong it

405
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:50,240
is you know hemp is you know has been

406
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:53,119
long time used as a very high tensil

407
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:56,720
strength material for you know ropes in

408
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:58,798
the um for ships and stuff but is there

409
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,839
variation in this or is it correlated to

410
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:04,000
other traits that we can select on we

411
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:06,639
also of course want yield we want high

412
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,599
fiber yield so we have to go through the

413
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,280
process of decortication so that's after

414
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,158
I said you readed the stems you allow

415
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:14,798
the microbes to break down pectins and

416
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:18,720
then you can basically strip off the

417
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:21,359
fibers using a a decortication

418
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,640
machine so um today I'm mainly going to

419
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:26,599
talk about this histological analysis

420
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,360
that I did this is a picture that um I

421
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:31,798
took I don't know if the lights can dim

422
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:31,798
a little bit in here see it

423
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:37,119
better yeah so here you can see this is

424
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:42,120
this is the bass fiber bundle that's

425
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:46,239
primary flum there and um hemp has a lot

426
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:49,918
of flm fibers so uh it for this analysis

427
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,519
um in 2022 there were small plot um

428
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,038
small plots were grown of these 12

429
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:57,599
cultivar by my labmate Luis monserate

430
00:19:55,038 --> 00:20:01,158
and then uh there were four biological

431
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:04,319
replicates of each cultivar and we

432
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:07,320
harvested um a one meter Square plot

433
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:10,240
that those plants were used for will be

434
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:13,279
used for the uh yield analysis and then

435
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,120
also the thermogravimetric analysis and

436
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,720
at the same time we harvested for

437
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,000
individual plants and collected the

438
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,200
middle internodes and those middle

439
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,679
internodes were used for this

440
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,038
histological analysis and also the cell

441
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:28,919
wall component analysis so um this

442
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:31,319
cross-section is 10 microns thick I used

443
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:34,840
a cryomicrotome so these were embedded

444
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:36,119
into um uh a material that if you know

445
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:37,359
you freeze it very quickly you don't

446
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:40,279
have to go through the process of like

447
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:43,479
paraffin embedding is much quicker um

448
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:46,759
and then I imaged three different fiber

449
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,880
bundles uh per replicate and then

450
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:52,720
Quantified some different fiber fiber

451
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:55,840
bundle and fiber cell um

452
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,919
Dimensions so I did this U measuring

453
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:01,199
these dimensions in Fiji uh so so you

454
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:04,038
can you know draw circles around things

455
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,600
and it measures them when you give it a

456
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:08,879
scale so some of the the results that

457
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:10,678
I've gotten so far is that there is

458
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,200
differences in the fiber bundle area

459
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:16,400
this is an example again of a fiber

460
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:19,840
bundle and um we see um significant

461
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:22,640
differences within um the cultivar that

462
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:25,599
we're testing uh the highest being FIB

463
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,120
79 which is you know papora is actually

464
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:30,119
being a very good fiber variety that has

465
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:34,119
very good fiber quality so that's

466
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:35,278
interesting to see um also uh this is

467
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:36,879
this Cult of our is a little bit

468
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:39,798
interesting Han cold you might want to

469
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,880
remember that so that has very low fiber

470
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:44,918
bundle

471
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,760
area but we don't see any significant

472
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:48,679
differences in the number of sell per

473
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:51,038
fiber bundle area although there is a

474
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:52,919
numerical difference in a trend so

475
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:55,919
perhaps I just don't have enough power

476
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:55,919
to see that in this

477
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:03,159
study we also see differences in fiber

478
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:06,158
cell cross-section area so uh again H

479
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:08,080
cold came up small fiber cells so it's

480
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,960
interesting that that Tren holds and

481
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:14,798
fiber 79 larger fiber cells it had

482
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:19,360
larger fiber bundles so interesting um

483
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:22,720
another uh uh thing that is an important

484
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:24,839
aspect of fibers is of natural fibers is

485
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,400
the paracity so if you're using hemp for

486
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:28,519
like insulation or something this can

487
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,519
affect how well of an insulator it is

488
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:35,558
and also is indicative of how um filled

489
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:38,798
the the fiber cells are so um these

490
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:41,440
plants were all harvested at uh 50%

491
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:43,480
flowering which is isn't what a lot of

492
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,759
people use to harvest fireberd as an

493
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:49,038
indication of when the plant is mature

494
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:51,278
but hasn't become too lignified yet um

495
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:53,599
but the paracity is this ratio of the

496
00:22:51,278 --> 00:22:57,000
Lumen that's the empty kind of portion

497
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:59,558
inside the fiber cell to the total cell

498
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,000
surface area so it basically tells you

499
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:08,240
how open and empty that cell is um and

500
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,119
then again uh numerically honold

501
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,400
is down lower so it's interesting to see

502
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:15,038
some of these varieties that have you

503
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,759
know certain Trends towards higher or

504
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:19,278
lower values within the things that I'm

505
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:21,919
measuring here we also saw some

506
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:24,200
differences in cell wall thickness um

507
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,480
which is another um important thing this

508
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,840
may correlate with how strong the fibers

509
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,400
are um I'll tell you a little bit more

510
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:35,079
later about how we're trying to test the

511
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:37,120
fiber strength in these um and then I'm

512
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:39,720
going to move on here and talk a little

513
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:42,678
bit about the cell wall um analysis this

514
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,440
was done by even Sorenson in the Rose

515
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:47,240
lab so this is a diagram here showing

516
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,759
you what a cell wall looks like so

517
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,679
there's primary cell walls there's

518
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:54,079
secondary cell walls one differentiating

519
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,919
thing between them is that primary cells

520
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,199
you can see here have these pectin that

521
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,840
are gluing everything together and then

522
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:04,440
you have um ligin in the secondary cell

523
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:07,639
walls and I said earlier that um the

524
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,000
bass fiber is low in lien because the

525
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,600
the main component of the bass fiber

526
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,200
that we're harvesting is the primary

527
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:16,879
flum not the secondary flum although

528
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,840
it's there so we're we're hopefully

529
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,760
decreasing Ling because for many

530
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:22,759
applications you don't want a lignified

531
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:29,600
fiber so in this analysis um we're using

532
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:32,440
this instrument it's a high performance

533
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:35,278
andon exchange chromatography with pulse

534
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:41,159
Amper metric detection it's a very long

535
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:42,919
name um and um this can measure a number

536
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:46,080
of different sugars that are components

537
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:49,880
of the cell wall some of them are very

538
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:52,398
um Cut and Clear what they are so like

539
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:55,600
cellulose but then all these other you

540
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:56,839
know sugars can be components of

541
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:01,000
multiple things or at least some of them

542
00:24:56,839 --> 00:25:04,879
can be components of multip things so um

543
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,640
I think you can see here that uh xylos

544
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,520
can be a component of hemicellulose or

545
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,038
of pectin so it's you can't always quite

546
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:12,639
tell that if it's high in one sugar then

547
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:14,200
it's definitely oh it has more pectin um

548
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,679
but it gives you an

549
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,720
idea so we did see differences in uh

550
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,679
fiber

551
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,960
cellulose uh which is an important thing

552
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,600
because cellulose is one of the more

553
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,720
important things in fiber yield and

554
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:32,319
hemp and then then we also saw

555
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:37,120
differences in galactonic acid so

556
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:40,038
galactonic acid is uh only in pectin in

557
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:41,398
the an in the um diagram that I showed

558
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,960
you here so it's not one of those that's

559
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:44,759
like oh it could be hemos it could be

560
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,200
pectin this is more an indicative that

561
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:51,079
if it's high in galacturonic acid then

562
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:53,919
it's high in pectin so um that might

563
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:57,319
have implications for how easy it is to

564
00:25:53,919 --> 00:26:00,159
um break up those tissues and how easy

565
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:02,599
it is to decorticate after reading so we

566
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,159
might want to select for a lower pecum

567
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:07,759
we haven't um done the I haven't

568
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:09,600
evaluated the Doric ability yet so we'll

569
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:12,359
see if those

570
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:14,319
correlate we also saw differences in

571
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:17,798
fiber galactose but galactose can be

572
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:21,119
found in hemicellulose or pectin so um

573
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:21,119
that one is a little bit more

574
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:28,919
ambiguous and also um arabos which again

575
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:31,119
can be found in hellos and pectins

576
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:34,200
but interesting again on cold pops up

577
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:36,278
very low in arabos so

578
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,319
interesting so here's a correlation of

579
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:42,720
all of these things that I measured just

580
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:43,918
to see if um they are um cor with each

581
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,839
other and I'm only showing here ones

582
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,480
that were

583
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:49,319
significantly um correlated so

584
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,759
unfortunately all of the correlations

585
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:53,079
with cellus were not significant which

586
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:56,119
is something I'd be interested in

587
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:58,278
although it did have a positive

588
00:26:56,119 --> 00:27:00,959
correlation with the fiber bundle area

589
00:26:58,278 --> 00:27:03,798
area of 0.5 but I don't think we had

590
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,759
enough power here to um maybe see if

591
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:11,278
that was

592
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:13,398
significant um I uh also will want to uh

593
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:15,640
look at the the strength and see if

594
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:17,558
that's correlated with like the cell

595
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,720
wall thickness so we have this

596
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:22,359
instrument called an instron basically

597
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:26,278
you can like clip a fiber to either one

598
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:29,759
of these um little clamps and then it

599
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:31,839
pulls on it until the fiber breaks so

600
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:33,440
you can see a graph that looks like this

601
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:34,879
and where each one of those little

602
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,919
triangles are that's where when the

603
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,880
fiber broke basically so um the trouble

604
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:44,038
is though that it's hard to get a single

605
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:46,240
fiber with him if you just keep pulling

606
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:48,480
the fibers you keep splitting them and

607
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,880
to use a machine like this you want to

608
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,640
kind of use a single fiber and also you

609
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,440
need to standardize by the fiber's

610
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,960
diameter and measuring a fiber's

611
00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:02,640
diameter is actually not that easy so

612
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,960
um some of the the takeaways that I um

613
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,759
found with the work that I've done so

614
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,880
far in this project is that we did see

615
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:12,200
some differences in some of the um fiber

616
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,960
bundle and fiber cell Dimensions um by

617
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:17,038
cultivar uh we didn't see uh different

618
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,519
so I actually forgot to say that the

619
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:22,879
results that I was showing with the cell

620
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:26,038
wall composition those were for um just

621
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,720
the fiber when we looked at the whole

622
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:29,759
stem level there were no significant

623
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,319
differences but when you peeled off just

624
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:33,919
the fiber um and ran that analysis then

625
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:37,558
we saw differences so the isolated

626
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:40,120
fibers did have compositional

627
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:42,240
differences so some of the next steps um

628
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:45,398
I'm want to do the thermogravimetric

629
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,919
analysis um to evaluate the ligo um

630
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:50,000
cellulosic composition we also need to

631
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:53,840
decorticate these reded stems to

632
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,759
evaluate the fiber yield um and then we

633
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:58,599
want to identify more instrumentation

634
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:00,839
that could be used for fiber analysis so

635
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:03,599
is the instron the best instrument to

636
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:07,119
this you know there are some other um

637
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:09,038
you know uh in down in uh North Carolina

638
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:11,278
State I think they have a very big uh

639
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:13,440
fiber and textile college and they have

640
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:16,839
some like scanners that you can use to

641
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,798
get the the diameter of fibers and some

642
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:19,519
other

643
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,839
instrumentation uh I also want to

644
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,278
develop some more High through print

645
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:25,480
methods for characterizing this because

646
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,278
actually doing hystological work is

647
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,278
takes a very long time and there a lot

648
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:32,038
of materials and a lot of work so is it

649
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:35,880
possible that we could in the field just

650
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:38,798
use um like a a 3D printed microtone to

651
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:41,640
take thicker SL sections and then stain

652
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:44,879
them with like a non-fluorescent stain

653
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,038
that stains um lignan and cellulose and

654
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,880
just take a picture with a camera to get

655
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:52,480
a rough idea of the area of the uh fiber

656
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,480
that has been done in some other cops

657
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,919
like switch grass so is that something

658
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,720
we can try and hemp hemp is actually

659
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:00,320
very hard to cut into into the Sim so I

660
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,079
don't know how that would work even

661
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:06,879
using a razor blade When I Was preparing

662
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:08,918
my samples it was very difficult so um

663
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,919
we'll see if that could work in him I

664
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:13,080
want to say um thank you to everyone in

665
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:14,759
my lab the Smart Lab and the rose lab

666
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:17,839
thank you to my special committee uh

667
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:19,720
Jason Londo Moira shean Joselyn Rose and

668
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:21,918
then also our funding sources so we're

669
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,960
funded by New York State a um a and

670
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,679
Market the New York State Office of

671
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,200
cannabis management and then also I was

672
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,320
funded this last year on an EA ship so

673
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,919
extension and Outreach through the

674
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:35,200
Cornell agratech

675
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:36,759
program um also if you want to learn

676
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,200
more about the work that Cornell is

677
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:40,789
doing in help you can go to this link

678
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,038
here any

679
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:44,839
[Music]

680
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:46,720
questions oh

681
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:49,199
yes thank you for that it was really

682
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,880
interesting your first slide around uses

683
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,640
how do you work with industry Partners

684
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,000
or material scientist techology just to

685
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,038
kind of Define what good quality fiber

686
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
is for specific uses just how you

687
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:05,480
interact yeah it is difficult we do have

688
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,880
industry partners and um one of the

689
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,919
things I've learned is that some uses uh

690
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,399
the specifications for the fibers is

691
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:15,639
highly regulated so like in the

692
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:17,479
automobile and Aerospace industry the

693
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:18,599
fibers that they can use have to meet

694
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,558
certain

695
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:23,719
specifications and um they it can be

696
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:26,519
hard to switch new materials because you

697
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,880
know they they have very strict

698
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:31,480
specifications and they also really need

699
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,960
uniformity so not just high quality but

700
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:36,599
they can't have variation in the um the

701
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,480
materials that they're using to create

702
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:41,759
their composits so it it can be um a

703
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,519
little difficult I even heard from one

704
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:47,038
industry member they would rather have a

705
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:49,359
lower fiber quality but consistent and

706
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:53,558
uniform than high fiber quality but if

707
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:57,079
it wasn't uniform so can be

708
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:59,079
tricky yes um in general with fibers

709
00:31:57,079 --> 00:32:01,240
does ttile

710
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:03,398
strength is it proportional to the

711
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:06,038
cross-section and and if so could you

712
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:07,439
use that like could you could you

713
00:32:06,038 --> 00:32:10,119
instead of measuring the cross-section

714
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:13,360
could you just weigh the fibers and and

715
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:16,119
get tensile string by weight uh so the

716
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:18,638
question is um is the weight of the

717
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:21,479
fibers correlated with the tensil

718
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:24,479
strength um the

719
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,798
weight I think that the crosssection

720
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,639
could be but it also depends on the

721
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:31,278
Lumin area

722
00:32:28,638 --> 00:32:33,119
and um the weight I think that would

723
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:36,278
maybe not work because again as I saying

724
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:37,719
it's hard to get an individual fiber so

725
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:38,880
uh I don't have a picture here of what

726
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,600
it looks like when you decorticate

727
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:46,679
although it kind of let's go

728
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:48,719
back oh there all of the the fiber

729
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:50,278
that's um those long fibers that come

730
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,399
out the stem it it kind of basically

731
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:53,919
looks like that when it's coming out of

732
00:32:51,398 --> 00:32:56,719
the decorticator uh without the Herd on

733
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,278
it so to get an individual fiber and

734
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,558
weigh it and then compare that to

735
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:02,119
another individual fiber I don't know if

736
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:04,278
you could really do that although it

737
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:06,278
might be correlated with

738
00:33:04,278 --> 00:33:10,359
strength thank

739
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:14,398
you yes was looking the you had chicken

740
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:15,918
uh vetting down there is that the likely

741
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:18,239
to be a big market for that because

742
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,840
actually I I know they trying to go with

743
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,798
corn Stover and miscanthus are also

744
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:25,319
going for those that market and there

745
00:33:23,798 --> 00:33:28,398
seems like there be a lot more of that

746
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:31,079
line around that

747
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:33,439
yeah so this is more of like using a

748
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:35,839
byproduct so we don't for a lot of

749
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,960
applications you don't use the herd or

750
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:40,000
even if you're growing High canabo hemp

751
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,519
like you don't harvest the stock for

752
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,240
anything usable so is there something

753
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,759
else you can use it for the only problem

754
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,319
with using something like high

755
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:49,519
cannabinoid hemp for application like

756
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:51,759
that is that it can smell like hemp so

757
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,319
if for a farmer maybe they don't care as

758
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:56,919
much but for if you're just a backyard

759
00:33:54,319 --> 00:34:00,119
chicken keeper maybe you don't want your

760
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:02,759
whole coup to smell like hemp I I in my

761
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:04,119
personal experience the the fiber uh

762
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:06,720
varieties and grain varieties don't

763
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:08,918
smell as strongly of that kind of hempy

764
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,918
turpenoid smell but they still have't

765
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:13,559
head

766
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:16,440
smell oh question on Zoom uh let see in

767
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:19,358
the chat um are you familiar with the

768
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:22,519
papers of K asua measuring fiber

769
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:25,319
strength in linam no I am not in fact I

770
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:28,599
don't actually know oh

771
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:31,240
linum that Flex okay

772
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:34,960
uh no I'm not familiar with that exact

773
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:37,519
paper but I will look it

774
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:42,240
up yes

775
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:42,239
yes can imagine

776
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:48,319
compx

777
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,879
soing expore some

778
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:54,599
collaboration science Coles to see how

779
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:59,039
they measure construction material

780
00:34:54,599 --> 00:35:01,920
strength or even the car strength

781
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:04,000
yeah so here um so uh star was asking

782
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,599
about uh different collaborations we can

783
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,519
have with material scientists about um

784
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,119
the material strengths and how to

785
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:13,280
measure it and specifications that are

786
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,680
needed for the different applications um

787
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,640
and we definitely are looking at that so

788
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:20,480
actually the Cornell has the um College

789
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:23,480
of human ecology here and they do a lot

790
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,358
of work with textile fibers and so um we

791
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,679
have been in contact with them about the

792
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:31,880
um some of the methods using and then

793
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:36,598
also with um NC State as I said they

794
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:40,838
have a very large um fiber uh program

795
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:43,119
and then also the um USDA AR they are

796
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:47,400
working on um they just started working

797
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:49,960
on fiber quality um standards for hemp

798
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,519
so they are they have you know um very

799
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,838
robust standards for cotton but no such

800
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:55,759
thing exists for hemp of standardizing

801
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:57,920
what are the what are the things we

802
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,599
measure and how we measure them and um

803
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,358
so that is currently being worked on at

804
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,559
the

805
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:06,799
USDA if there are no more questions

806
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:06,799
thank

807
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,480
you this has been a production of
