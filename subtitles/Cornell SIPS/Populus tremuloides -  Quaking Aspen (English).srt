1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,855
&gt;&gt; Populus tremuloides or quaking aspen.

2
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:06,734
These trees often grow in a group with

3
00:00:06,735 --> 00:00:09,509
root suckers coming up, and the leaves

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,059
are distinctive with flat petioles

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,065
that let them flutter in any kind of breeze.

6
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:20,170
So this is Populus tremuloides or quaking aspen.
