1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:16,539
thank you thank you very much it's

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:18,310
wonderful to be here you know this is my

5
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:20,830
title we'll talk all this stuff further

6
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:23,409
said that you know this propaganda about

7
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:25,479
some Sun based funding we have at Iowa

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,419
State but I have to really congratulate

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,300
a lot of people like I think there is

10
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:33,250
faculties my professors but the route of

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,558
the student under you know scratch

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:38,980
didn't tell postholes a condo is a

13
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:41,678
wonderful place myself I was completely

14
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:45,099
transformed you know I did my master

15
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,960
degree I did plant breeding PhD in

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,899
qualitative genetics plant breeding but

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,378
it's not good enough right I talked with

18
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:56,018
people it is the two-year my post always

19
00:00:53,378 --> 00:00:58,960
ad and with the Cornell really transform

20
00:00:56,018 --> 00:01:01,689
I think it is not a easy to say

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,819
opportunity because you know a lot of

22
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:05,679
things going on here are the leaders a

23
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:07,510
lot of debate your question cannot be

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,580
answered to here you know you can expect

25
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:13,150
the other place anyways right because

26
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:15,938
this is a wonderful place I think I got

27
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:18,368
hired you know we start be able to move

28
00:01:15,938 --> 00:01:20,648
up to my career is because of ads you

29
00:01:18,368 --> 00:01:22,989
know post op training big vision

30
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:25,299
thinking that there's a lot of problems

31
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:27,548
you'll need results right it's not all

32
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:29,500
being solved there's small problem

33
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:31,868
technical there's major large-scale

34
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:35,109
problems and then one thing I have to

35
00:01:31,868 --> 00:01:38,250
mention too is as it was I think it was

36
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:41,319
one of the seminar I gave at the postal

37
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,849
launch seminar I think there was not a

38
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:45,849
professor sitting audience

39
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:48,129
max calles and then we were supposed to

40
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:50,890
collaborate as a post Oh his heir and

41
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:53,108
his mics and I think I gave a

42
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,929
presentation maybe I did okay might

43
00:01:53,108 --> 00:01:59,349
write a mica later on when I went to

44
00:01:55,929 --> 00:02:02,200
k-state mica you know engaged me into

45
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:04,989
his shoot apical meristem NSF project

46
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:08,860
and the first brain we got meat in you

47
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:12,609
then second grant get me professor so

48
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:14,380
that says how how much connection you

49
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,120
can build why or inconel

50
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:18,639
you know it could be two years three

51
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,640
years four years its research but it's a

52
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,689
correct it's a network of scientist it's

53
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:25,000
it for me

54
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:26,129
of a thinking that really can help you

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,009
later on in your career

56
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:31,840
I'll talk about some research my talk

57
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:33,849
typically geared towards graduate

58
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,409
students and post those so the way I

59
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:37,750
talk a little bit like a teacher

60
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:42,099
instructor style or forgive me the

61
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:45,099
professor's my position is quantitative

62
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:48,810
genetics and maize breeding I modify

63
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:50,650
this position title to address

64
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,270
significant questioning in plant

65
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,670
breeding by combining cutting-edge

66
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:57,340
genomic technology and a quantitative

67
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:59,039
genetics theory this type of content of

68
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,509
Jack Theory always give people

69
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,269
statistical genomics you know update

70
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:06,159
variance components but it's really

71
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:09,909
relevant if you talk about the you know

72
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,219
cutting age genomic technology before I

73
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:14,909
left this group IDI

74
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:18,400
insisted me have to sequence some genes

75
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:20,500
and resin gel which I preached a lot

76
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,930
because if you are somebody who just

77
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,879
plain the data you don't understand the

78
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,920
complicated the gene structure of

79
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,120
developmental biology unless you do

80
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:30,009
something you know you don't have to

81
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:34,450
touch papers or do something that really

82
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:36,789
changed I was saying - we have a long

83
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:39,549
history of time breeding this is the

84
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:42,579
George sprague that started synthetic

85
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:45,400
populations Bill Russell developed the

86
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,320
b73 which is you know Steve stocks who

87
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,810
said you know a bill started the

88
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:50,829
population build derived a lot of b73

89
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,890
and Anna Haller

90
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:56,230
a lot of wonderful histories in Iowa

91
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:59,409
State in terms of breeding right

92
00:03:56,229 --> 00:04:03,189
not necessarily genetics there's others

93
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:05,199
this is a the tradition you see ever

94
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:07,599
Hertz and Russell ever heard Russell's

95
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:10,689
there's a you know don't waste Alice's

96
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:15,389
paper on that we have in Kindle on key

97
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:18,040
later on I just started here and then we

98
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,759
believe that the power of 20 bit of

99
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,459
genetics

100
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:25,289
it is not traditional you know I think

101
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:27,490
ed right a lot of breeding 4.0 and annum

102
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,870
quantitative genetics you know make some

103
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,509
of the postal variety and the review

104
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,639
papers really it's still very very the

105
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:35,930
framework to combine what are we alone

106
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:38,209
from genomics the

107
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,370
all tech you know makes Santa sticks

108
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:43,099
into plant breeding is provide the

109
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:46,910
imaging the framework to to push

110
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:49,759
everything forward my research and

111
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:52,100
training of resident really have four

112
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,430
areas complex trade dissection we do do

113
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,289
us try to find clone some genes they are

114
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:00,079
not less very easy you know gene cloning

115
00:04:57,288 --> 00:05:02,689
products really index and then there's a

116
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:05,120
some gene we cloned and in genetics some

117
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:07,788
breeding strategy and then on the side

118
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,819
we do study some genomes and chromosome

119
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:12,889
this some study this is in collaboration

120
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:16,099
with Mike scallop and this actually gave

121
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:18,288
me something to talk with vault-tec so

122
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,960
we talk about recombination methylation

123
00:05:18,288 --> 00:05:23,750
we don't go into details but it's all

124
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:27,228
interested thinking about this thing

125
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:30,560
from the chromosomes and then the genes

126
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:33,769
and chromosomes DNA structure to humans

127
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,288
we can always switch the to the species

128
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:38,240
we like and then so this is actually

129
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:40,610
some time we have this framer to

130
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,918
understand we do not want a student to

131
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:45,710
only stay in one breeding or white from

132
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:47,180
the kinetics one mathematics area we

133
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:51,799
won't have a taste of all different

134
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:54,680
areas the book I liked is share is this

135
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,439
book I think this book maybe some of the

136
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,418
professors who read this book in the

137
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,598
past it's called the triple helix

138
00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:06,769
written by Lee Clemente

139
00:06:02,598 --> 00:06:09,228
this actually really helped us from the

140
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:11,889
way we you know start of doing this

141
00:06:09,228 --> 00:06:16,550
product until we published this paper

142
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:19,960
last year I actually really carry this

143
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:22,658
book with me a my flight to here I

144
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:25,038
promote people especially you're not in

145
00:06:22,658 --> 00:06:28,728
development or biology to read this book

146
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:30,889
triple helix the the title is a you know

147
00:06:28,728 --> 00:06:34,819
really try to understand the genes

148
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:36,620
organism and in this environment because

149
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:40,399
there's not a historical debate about

150
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:43,220
this you know nature and nurture IQ gene

151
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:45,439
control environment social science and

152
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,930
the Natural Science but this this is a

153
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:50,209
wonderful book I do not actually after

154
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:54,259
reading this book a 25 pie

155
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:54,769
I do not necessarily go 25 times for

156
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:58,309
sure

157
00:06:54,769 --> 00:07:00,799
I do not Leslie agree with whatever this

158
00:06:58,309 --> 00:07:04,699
book says but some of the insights we

159
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:08,869
gain really help us understand okay this

160
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:11,149
is the modern summary of the gene from

161
00:07:08,869 --> 00:07:14,719
the team from a genome to the

162
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:17,300
environment to the phenotype in addition

163
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:18,829
to the genotype I in Romney interaction

164
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,800
there's also something called a

165
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:23,658
developmental noise that give you this

166
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,408
final organism or you can call that

167
00:07:23,658 --> 00:07:29,748
phenotype on this label right so most of

168
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:32,118
time if you look at historical textbooks

169
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:35,990
or palm reading we profile the

170
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:38,929
environment affect out before we before

171
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:41,389
we study genetics if we talk about the

172
00:07:38,928 --> 00:07:43,908
increment based heritability calculation

173
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:46,639
we don't even have the environmental

174
00:07:43,908 --> 00:07:48,558
there's classifiable environmental

175
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,240
Barrens in the denominator because we

176
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:52,759
tackle an intra mean based on village

177
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,978
but through this reading this book and

178
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:56,930
it connected me with you know better

179
00:07:54,978 --> 00:07:59,649
appreciation of the develop the biology

180
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:05,329
with the environment what is happening

181
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:07,668
so I this is a joke that tub we say

182
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:09,918
after study genetics we also time I

183
00:08:07,668 --> 00:08:12,378
think most people in the room we talk

184
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,149
about genetics genetics right there's

185
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:18,079
other people think about the management

186
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:19,728
environment we say well the genetics we

187
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:22,369
can study this easily because of we have

188
00:08:19,728 --> 00:08:26,240
maize has ten problems right we'd have

189
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:30,079
three sets of seven 20.5 rice have 12

190
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,418
right and then all this genetic material

191
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:35,810
is organized on the chromosomes why

192
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:37,490
don't we call this up chromosome most of

193
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:41,989
the environment right it looked like a

194
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:44,688
you know centromere and I feel that

195
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:47,000
there was a joke is from star by Jody

196
00:08:44,688 --> 00:08:49,490
Edwards but really help us understand

197
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,759
let's classify everything right let's

198
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,688
say the first chromosome of the

199
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,730
radiation you can think about radiation

200
00:08:53,688 --> 00:08:58,009
let's just send the temperature easier

201
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:00,680
now that radiation is a daylon's

202
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:03,230
de lijn cycle first a temperature

203
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:05,929
rainfall these are three major things

204
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:09,470
and their solo type crop type management

205
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:12,139
but the whole framework is a åkesson is

206
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:14,509
the modeling framework this whole

207
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:16,100
modeling sometime is difficult to

208
00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:18,879
understand right it's difficult to get

209
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:22,850
into that I all my lap members actually

210
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:24,950
took the workshop model episode but it's

211
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:27,139
still hard to understand but at least we

212
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,009
agree that it's the day lens and

213
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:30,529
temperature

214
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:33,080
number two you know top two reasons that

215
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:35,000
affect the plant development this is

216
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:40,009
different from animals this is a plant

217
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,080
specific right this is another classic

218
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:44,720
textbook examples I don't know if you

219
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,750
have taken any class that showing this

220
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,340
picture this is called a yarrow this

221
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,159
yarrow this was done a long time ago

222
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:54,920
this picture supposed to show three

223
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:57,439
turns reaction norm in the typical

224
00:09:54,919 --> 00:10:00,559
assisity and genotype I mean bomb into

225
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,560
action on each x-axis here there are

226
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:05,869
seven different cuttings close they were

227
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:08,329
planted there in low elevation medium

228
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:11,330
elevation and high elevation and then

229
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:14,420
the flowering and they all flowered at a

230
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:17,030
low and based upon height ordered in

231
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:18,500
descending order but you see that this

232
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:21,740
picture was supposed to show that

233
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:24,350
there's so much G by E so that there's

234
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:27,350
no clear pattern you would not be able

235
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:30,110
to predict the performance of a plant

236
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:32,810
just because genetics right cuz the same

237
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:35,029
plant calls here is even got started

238
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:37,399
here is even not flower right is here is

239
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:39,949
here but you go to the high elevation

240
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:42,079
they change again so this is showing

241
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,360
this three turn rack norm phenotypic

242
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,639
plasticity genotype by environment

243
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,820
action if you have a numerical

244
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,649
representation they would show this

245
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:54,950
lines this is the low elevation media of

246
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:57,289
elevation sam-7 segmental lines going up

247
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:59,900
and down this was supposed to use to buy

248
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:01,969
this picture bench and to show that it's

249
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:04,189
difficult to track genetics environment

250
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,500
separate right but there was actually

251
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:09,740
hidden patent behind this whole thing

252
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,360
if you photoshop you know resulting we

253
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,460
will skip that but this is just to show

254
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,639
that context

255
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:19,190
and then this experiment was done in

256
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:22,338
1948 for younger scientists or grad

257
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,940
students look in 1948 when it's

258
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:25,160
published

259
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,800
he says experimental study on the nature

260
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:30,079
of nature of the species environmental

261
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:33,439
responses of the climate races so a

262
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,690
Chilean so that was a dumb long time ago

263
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,440
this live elevation is back in

264
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:41,930
California it's in Timberline and is

265
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,690
this higher elevation manner medium

266
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:46,489
relation lower Stanford is low elevation

267
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,800
you look at this paper title called

268
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,110
evolution in changing environments right

269
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,479
there's mommy loves changing long time

270
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:57,080
ago and then this is a classical book to

271
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,360
show this sweet important terms and then

272
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:02,270
this another picture was used in a

273
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,899
textbook but typically this was taken

274
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:08,208
from one of the early study of Bill

275
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:11,539
Russell bill burr trestle from Iowa

276
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:15,049
State it just to show that as a to maize

277
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:18,199
varieties is the riding wine had the

278
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:20,990
faster response this righted to had a

279
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:23,900
slower response but in general it has

280
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:26,930
less Placidus plasticity and most

281
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:29,838
ability farmers would prefer for IT to

282
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:33,049
over the righty one righty one was a

283
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,060
older variety unless it's under the very

284
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:37,639
favorable condition others I'm most of

285
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:40,069
time farmer would prefer this one and

286
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:43,149
there is also in the breeding genetics

287
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:46,070
there's a abraham Russell model

288
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:48,439
stability parameters regression analysis

289
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:50,690
earlier there's other models publish

290
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,830
Australia but that this picture shows

291
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:58,010
the stability analysis

292
00:12:53,830 --> 00:13:02,720
and then when we actually study this G

293
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:06,110
by E we actually look at the some of the

294
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,540
heat up paper written by historian one

295
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:12,529
of the historian wrote a paper called

296
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:14,480
our official penciled Hagen the origins

297
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:19,069
of genotype environment interaction

298
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:22,879
right it's published in 2008 in this

299
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:25,000
paper he cited that RA Fisher and his

300
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:28,480
nonlinear into actual heritage

301
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,240
environment Fisher at the earliest years

302
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:36,019
he his main goal is to partition a

303
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,720
variation in to genotype environment the

304
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:41,840
left over goes to the G by E or arrow

305
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,810
he studied mainly in the human height

306
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:47,660
variation there are studies where he can

307
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:51,229
partition iris in perfectly in genetics

308
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:53,509
environment almost negligible Fisher

309
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:56,420
also like to do transformation of the

310
00:13:53,509 --> 00:14:00,950
data so that the G by interaction will

311
00:13:56,419 --> 00:14:04,339
be minimized right this length lens law

312
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:07,070
huggabug Ben is in their dependency

313
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:09,470
nature and nurture he is a developmental

314
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:11,300
biologist but he's also a s--

315
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,220
institution right you have to be good

316
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:15,769
strong statistical he actually

317
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,259
communicated with Fisher about this

318
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:21,370
nature nurture debate genotype by

319
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:24,620
environment interaction in one of the

320
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:27,560
classical debate so actually so this two

321
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:30,080
because we traced back to the by matrix

322
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:32,359
concept G by E to Fisher additionally

323
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,600
and we traced back to development about

324
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:40,220
concept of G by E this T the elemental

325
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:42,920
to Lancelot Hogben right well show you

326
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,690
that G when I give talks that has animal

327
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:47,299
scientists sitting all things I was very

328
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:50,660
proud that Fisher actually is also a

329
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:54,949
plant biologist right because Fisher the

330
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:56,839
Fisher 1918 is regarded the funding

331
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,940
paper in quantitative genetics it's

332
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,490
still providing the guidance to human

333
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:04,460
genetics this thing is after this post

334
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:06,830
note arrow but this is the this paper

335
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,389
published in 1923

336
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,389
is

337
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:12,279
easier paper so that is I say easy I

338
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:15,879
said well now we could understand I

339
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:18,309
feature 1989 talking with John look I

340
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:19,870
still couldn't understand some of you

341
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:22,869
people are sitting all things I trust

342
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:24,639
Cornell must understand Fischer 1918 be

343
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:27,159
very proud of you and then you please

344
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:30,699
help your other colleagues to understand

345
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:32,259
Fischer 1918 its I started ten times I

346
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,210
never finished because you only can only

347
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:43,870
understand the first three page then you

348
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:48,790
stuck this feature night 20 Fischer 1923

349
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:51,759
it Fischer 1923 contained the first

350
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:54,219
ANOVA table this is the first NOAA table

351
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,470
ever being published Table three so

352
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:59,080
Fisher was doing experiment with twelve

353
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:01,240
potato varieties I don't know any potato

354
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,610
breeders old scientist sitting no dings

355
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,220
and it was a six different manure

356
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:09,039
treatment for the twelve and six and

357
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:12,250
then any send deviation from summation

358
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:13,509
formula this old Leda see 5 times 11 you

359
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:18,029
know that's the interaction of degree

360
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:20,049
freedom and then because Fischer has the

361
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:21,879
replications you can have the random

362
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:23,649
error residual arrow is the stupid

363
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:25,419
freedom and the sum of squares means

364
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,429
squares and deviations so that's the

365
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:30,370
first up condition right she should be

366
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:35,019
the study but the thing is that she sure

367
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:37,889
did the study well what's he expecting

368
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:40,840
to find a G by E in my new treatment

369
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:42,699
response right but he actually lay out

370
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:45,190
his reasoning because if you want to do

371
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,379
a G by E with de lins with temperature

372
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:50,680
difficult to control he actually did

373
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:53,230
this maneuvering experiment he did not

374
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:55,599
find any because look at this in that

375
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:57,970
time we don't have F test F test was

376
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,790
invented by steady bear but giving the

377
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:03,370
credit to Fisher F you see the standard

378
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:05,859
deviation of this mean square of 4.22

379
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:08,289
they're not much different from 3.5

380
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:09,250
streams so the interaction was not

381
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:11,980
significant

382
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,869
this actually influenced a lot of animal

383
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:17,110
plant breeding in the ant animal

384
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:19,509
breeding typically lush oh this school

385
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:20,799
of breeders we say I'm going to focus on

386
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:22,690
breeding values

387
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,299
and for some genotypes we can ignore

388
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:28,000
that environment in fact ignore that G

389
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:29,559
by E that's actually wine why we made so

390
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,450
much progress in plant breeding we

391
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:33,039
animal breeding which is curved but

392
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:36,220
still we didn't understand the

393
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,990
environmental effect right so this is

394
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,100
the famous picture this experiment was

395
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,039
done by somebody else

396
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:45,219
but this picture was used in the letters

397
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:46,589
between the fish and hold them very easy

398
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,240
to understand this paper this is a

399
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:52,000
Drosophila mutants low bar

400
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:57,519
this is the ultra bar and in this under

401
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,500
16 degree and then 25 degree Hagen was

402
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:02,769
focused on the individual development

403
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:05,349
not the population not a 16 a potato

404
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:08,349
right at hall or 6 manure and treatment

405
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:10,629
he just say look if you say where is the

406
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:13,359
environment effect if you look at the

407
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:16,030
ultra and under the context of the ultra

408
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:19,149
bar this is my environment effect from

409
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:22,539
16 to 25 I get this difference right in

410
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:25,140
this segment but under this low bar my

411
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:28,539
environmental effect is this much right

412
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:31,000
where is my genotype affect my do not

413
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:33,819
have effect under 16 degree is this much

414
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,099
but my genotype effect under 25 degree

415
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:38,859
is shrink to this much so he just asked

416
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:40,809
me the question but Fisher and in an N

417
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:42,729
class the log they have different

418
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:45,669
forests they could not agree on certain

419
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:47,710
things right so the historian samurai

420
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:51,090
this biometric and a developmental

421
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:54,370
origin of G by E says that in that time

422
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:58,000
the biometric tradition is to partition

423
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:59,889
the variation in populations courses of

424
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,990
variation is not developed Longines

425
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,150
courses operation right it's how much

426
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,849
variation Kappa partitioned and a

427
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:08,980
statistical approach and biometric but

428
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:10,509
the developmental biologist we focus on

429
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,259
individual we focus on the video

430
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:14,710
development

431
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:17,579
causal mechanisms acidic genes and how

432
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:19,750
everything has happened right and then

433
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:22,449
interventionist you'd state general the

434
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:24,940
mutants and then this developmental part

435
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,809
of a G by E this tradition is still

436
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,240
being formal

437
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:30,039
but in general we understand this whole

438
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,380
thing is functional it depending on

439
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:34,089
whether you want to go details or you

440
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,260
want to describe the population the

441
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:38,689
whole

442
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:41,480
that listo our study our study is

443
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:44,029
typically not a large skill but that it

444
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:47,870
contains enough essential element fast

445
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:50,799
two cupholders to concept together I was

446
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:53,059
actually I said I was at Kansas State

447
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,509
amazed genetic system for six and a half

448
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:59,240
years and then we were doing the sole

449
00:19:56,509 --> 00:20:01,879
gram TX 430 in the P you remember T and

450
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,819
P this picture taken the same day this

451
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,310
flower tea flower earlier than P right

452
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:10,450
and I've even to nursery try to get more

453
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:12,169
plan you know I think most people have

454
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:15,799
experiencing winter nursery

455
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:17,690
this here P earlier than T we talked to

456
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:18,019
plant breeders they say oh that's easy

457
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,600
right

458
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:23,599
we understand that yeah it's happening

459
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:25,039
everywhere right this T is early here

460
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,619
peas already here that's nothing new

461
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,599
right but I mean that's happened right

462
00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:31,809
we have to ask why right

463
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:36,549
if you calculator this just cross over

464
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:40,039
interactionist yeah then I had a

465
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:43,250
position change I moved to Iowa Iowa the

466
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:46,159
further north of the Kansas I was

467
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:49,279
expecting to see the T first a P second

468
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:52,790
buying one of the Iowa and then this is

469
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:55,039
a 14 peas earlier than T so they

470
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:56,899
switched again but just totally so this

471
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,000
is actually serendipity right I mean

472
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:01,190
sometimes if I think I move a different

473
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,200
place I might have seen this before we

474
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:06,400
might not have the discovery and then

475
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,319
you could plant a summer in Kansas all

476
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,050
Iowa you could have planted into nursery

477
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:14,929
but you cannot plan in venture in Kansas

478
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:17,779
i right but what we talked to the crop

479
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:20,810
modelers pathologist the ask us to say

480
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:22,759
what if you plant the same population

481
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:25,879
these are the two parents we have a real

482
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:28,000
population in Puerto Rico we thought

483
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,830
they're gonna happen the P first right

484
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,829
but what happened in Puerto Rico team

485
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:36,319
first so they just keep changing the two

486
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:38,689
parents keep changing the orders of

487
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:40,399
flowering time a lot of people just a

488
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,080
lot of breed if you're breeding applied

489
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,660
research focus you know that was

490
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:47,029
happening you don't ask why we happen to

491
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:49,220
do some genetics so we ask why that's

492
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:51,440
happened

493
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,720
we also know there's a lot of people

494
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,970
doing the gene regulatory pathways

495
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,579
networks of flowering time there's

496
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:00,980
multiple pathways autonomous possible AG

497
00:21:58,579 --> 00:22:02,990
beryllium passed away this you know this

498
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,069
could appear to pass away you know many

499
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,950
of the pathways

500
00:22:04,069 --> 00:22:09,799
there's ft you have to since I flora G

501
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:12,500
to obtain this vegetative to flower and

502
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:14,359
transition so I'll ask you grew the

503
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,460
topic of material we typically cover

504
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:18,829
them in the trashcan or the black forms

505
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:21,230
to induce a flower right that's early

506
00:22:18,829 --> 00:22:23,659
stage we know that some of the photo

507
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:29,539
period that sings in happening early

508
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:31,310
stage of the development and then so but

509
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:33,319
you know we didn't stop there we say

510
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:35,629
let's lack Chi show this whole picture

511
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:37,970
here they seems like let's try to

512
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:40,910
discover patterns on the line apparently

513
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:44,029
contact G by E that's the sites we have

514
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:46,880
the experiment if we this is a reaction

515
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:49,309
norm plot I think your Joe gage is

516
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,520
expert in graphene over and he probably

517
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:54,799
a good paper on this this is a patrique

518
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:57,680
old 11 12

519
00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:00,379
this T is a is a blue and the red that's

520
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:03,740
the highlighted dots the other is 250

521
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:05,510
reals this is a small mapping population

522
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,819
they're not complicated design anything

523
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:11,629
just mapping population you track the

524
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:14,929
experiment I'm change you know here T's

525
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:17,870
early until here P is early appears or

526
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:20,240
appease late this T is early and then

527
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:23,419
change again right the traditional

528
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,099
analysis you can salt this by instead

529
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:28,039
this was actually arranged by their

530
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:30,649
photo Perce photo period they limbs from

531
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:32,259
Puerto Rico to Iowa but a you if you

532
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,500
have a data you order by our data

533
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:35,629
categorically

534
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:38,750
you say that okay in these three sites

535
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:41,240
that blue which is T is later than P and

536
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:44,359
as things changed right the photo period

537
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:47,150
temperature changed then it's neighing

538
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:49,609
you numerically numerically taking the

539
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:51,640
average we call environmental me its

540
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:54,679
average of the population from time

541
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:58,340
transformed into the x-axis this now

542
00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:00,660
became a regression analysis so the XY

543
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:03,389
axis you in the same data it just

544
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:07,019
x-axis using the environmental mean and

545
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:09,750
then the y-axis flow Explorer depict all

546
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:13,200
individual lines now everything looks

547
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:15,329
nice right it's just saying that if the

548
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,910
whole population fly if the whole

549
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:19,859
population flower the early and they're

550
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:22,259
here it's a whole population flower late

551
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:24,209
they're here right it's going line they

552
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:27,089
actually this figure is actually nothing

553
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:29,370
new because in genetics in plant

554
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:31,980
breeding we all understand it don't

555
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:36,269
genomica don't regression analysis

556
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:38,490
there's nothing new here right now what

557
00:24:36,269 --> 00:24:41,940
is new is that in this general context

558
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:44,099
of prediction phenomics right we want to

559
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:47,039
understand okay I talked about multiple

560
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:49,919
chromosomes of the environment if we

561
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:53,099
have a genotype somehow squeezed out

562
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:55,050
into a one dimensional space we can

563
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:57,269
squeeze the environmental as the

564
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:59,149
fertility or you know richness or

565
00:24:57,269 --> 00:25:01,980
something how let's just squeeze into

566
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:03,930
environment here now our performance is

567
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,299
actually on the z axis so you can

568
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:08,820
actually have a landscape right you have

569
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:13,200
the x y&amp;z going up and going down right

570
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:15,509
so so we say well if we actually can

571
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,670
sample this whole landscape by sample

572
00:25:15,509 --> 00:25:20,099
certain genotype its performance under

573
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:22,170
certain environment we actually will

574
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:24,419
data point you actually to map out this

575
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:27,810
up and down and then we can predict

576
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:29,610
what's in the future right so in plant

577
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:32,579
breeding we also have a term called a

578
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:34,619
target population of genotype target the

579
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:36,629
population of the environment mister

580
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:38,939
turn just say we're we're mapping within

581
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:41,010
something is tractable right you cannot

582
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,080
through a mutants here then it's gonna

583
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:48,269
be this whole thing will be distorted

584
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:51,539
right so the general idea about when we

585
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:54,349
have the data we realized after many

586
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:57,089
years of doing most of time in

587
00:25:54,349 --> 00:25:59,189
scientific studies what we do is a

588
00:25:57,089 --> 00:26:00,720
pattern discovery or just discover

589
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,250
patterns if you want your paper

590
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,980
published you look at figure one figure

591
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:07,230
two figure three it just accumulates you

592
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,870
leave to support your final conclusion

593
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:11,940
because you see patterns it's not random

594
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:14,269
right statistic test is against the

595
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:18,390
randomness right so your pattern

596
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:21,210
whole process so basically you know in

597
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:23,009
this whole area we tried to upon

598
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:25,919
breathing we have the tested environment

599
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:28,470
tested the genotypes right most of time

600
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,419
we do not want to study G by E because

601
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:32,100
we're not like companies we don't have

602
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:34,440
enough funding to have multiple sites

603
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:36,418
everywhere you know with an hour sink in

604
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,909
a size we want to be homogeneous and

605
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:41,490
then we can just get some variety but

606
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:43,830
but if you are in charge for breeding

607
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:46,380
for large geographical regions you do

608
00:26:43,829 --> 00:26:49,500
have to deal with you buy right so and

609
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,390
then this is untested genotype right the

610
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,339
key thing is for our research is the

611
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:55,650
connected a testing environment to the

612
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:57,538
untested environment this untested

613
00:26:55,650 --> 00:27:02,159
environment can exist in future let's

614
00:26:57,538 --> 00:27:04,220
say 20 2019 we haven't planted hey we

615
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:09,179
have problem to get us in so he'll write

616
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:11,250
20 you know 21 and then these connect

617
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,960
the taste of the genotype I'm on Kista

618
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,640
genotype this is relatively easy we have

619
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,919
expert sitting the you know you can

620
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,630
actually you know if you look at one of

621
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:20,340
the paper you know as group public you

622
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:23,309
can connect a tested genotype to the

623
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:25,558
Asian two ways right you can predict its

624
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:28,048
performance right this side is really

625
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:29,759
straight for genomic selection but it's

626
00:27:28,048 --> 00:27:31,788
testing environment on testing

627
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:33,869
environment you can connect with the

628
00:27:31,788 --> 00:27:38,490
models right and I think one of the

629
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:40,649
earlier papers from Hess law Soros group

630
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,569
is a very influential paper published to

631
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:46,038
say hi connect the environment together

632
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:50,250
right what we really want is a future

633
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:52,349
genotype by future inbred cultivars or

634
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:54,000
the future hybrids and their future

635
00:27:52,349 --> 00:27:56,699
environments but we have to establish

636
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,220
all these connections so our our

637
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,048
research anchor is really this was

638
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,880
diagram was our first time showed by I

639
00:28:01,048 --> 00:28:04,349
think afraid of my music we just learn

640
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,130
how to do this thing right

641
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:10,230
so so our our goal is to connect the

642
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:12,210
environment tested and untested so we

643
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:15,120
can do forecasting and do predicting in

644
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:17,519
the future we look at add a lens Iowa

645
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:20,969
kinds of support Rico and look at

646
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:23,429
temperature it turns out that if you

647
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:25,740
plant in the summer or patrique oh it's

648
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:28,160
a long day involved but to recall is

649
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:29,900
long day I thought it was a fruit

650
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:33,140
but you look at the day ours is faulting

651
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:35,540
our 1314 right typically we use twelve

652
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:37,460
and a half of 13 hours and foundational

653
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:40,430
day separation this is a true for

654
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:42,650
solgryn also true for rice I think right

655
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:46,490
and then temperature we couldn't see any

656
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:49,040
patterns we cluster the temperature

657
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,559
there you know something going on here

658
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:54,259
if we use performance of reals do the

659
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:57,379
two way clusters we feel the consul's

660
00:28:54,259 --> 00:29:01,009
together three coal Iowa and then tweak

661
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:03,410
old twelve so I'm a fourteen summer

662
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:05,480
planting is clustered together with

663
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:08,300
prett Oracle eleven or difficult well

664
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:10,460
but Iowa's thirteen was collect stories

665
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:11,990
up what we call 14s there's all

666
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,059
different patterns we can figure out

667
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:16,789
yeah I can almost ignore this slide

668
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:19,210
because we may show you what happened

669
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:23,420
what happened is that we studied the

670
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:27,500
temperature like a lens alone they they

671
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:30,560
lenses this is a 3d correlation plot so

672
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:34,009
valence here daylon's are so here and it

673
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:36,289
is a is this uh this of average the mom

674
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:38,809
to mean of the population so now we're

675
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:41,210
talking about whole population try to

676
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:43,369
correlate that performance with the

677
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:45,259
valence and in temperature the

678
00:29:43,369 --> 00:29:48,319
correlation is not very high the

679
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:50,180
temperature profile is not high but if

680
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:54,529
you do something called the Fertile

681
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:56,360
small-time GDD times valence then you

682
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:59,450
have this beautiful shade pattern of

683
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:01,429
correlations it see these dots going on

684
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:03,650
so basically low temperature is

685
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:06,080
mimicking of short day environment

686
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:08,540
temperature and then the day lens as a

687
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:11,539
compensation between them right this

688
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:14,089
actually is also not new because that in

689
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:15,950
the modeling they know this PC photo

690
00:30:14,089 --> 00:30:18,649
some more time there's thermal time

691
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:20,480
brewed green degree days or daylon's but

692
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:23,690
making them together but the key thing

693
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,269
is next slide we search a window to find

694
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:29,990
this critical window where PTT can

695
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:31,819
predict the population mean here here's

696
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:34,250
actually summarize everything we try to

697
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:36,349
do so we know that is an early growth

698
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:38,450
stage so that's why we all like to talk

699
00:30:36,349 --> 00:30:39,740
philologist these days they tell us

700
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:41,630
what's going on

701
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,109
there's temperature Thing Thing valence

702
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:46,190
in

703
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:48,288
then the determination of tradition from

704
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:50,570
you know meditative the you know to the

705
00:30:48,288 --> 00:30:54,048
free practice stage was determining here

706
00:30:50,569 --> 00:30:56,509
right and then we basically I'll show

707
00:30:54,048 --> 00:30:58,879
you this search process but the here is

708
00:30:56,509 --> 00:31:01,519
a 2d scan the beginning of the search

709
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:05,090
window end of a search window here we

710
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:07,880
basically try to calculate a large

711
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:10,519
number of correlations okay the

712
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,049
correlation here are Biko population

713
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:14,419
meaning you can think about Amanda me is

714
00:31:12,048 --> 00:31:17,599
a population flowered early or late

715
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:20,059
see if I tell you that at the Ricoh 1112

716
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:23,298
they're powered early but it kind sauce

717
00:31:20,058 --> 00:31:25,339
flower late so that that's the dots in

718
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:28,398
the photo some more time basically we

719
00:31:25,339 --> 00:31:32,138
try to find if I start a different stage

720
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:35,388
where do I find the most correlated us

721
00:31:32,138 --> 00:31:38,089
window that can give me the predicted

722
00:31:35,388 --> 00:31:40,819
flowering time in the end okay don't

723
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:44,750
worry we'll show a animation to see how

724
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:47,450
this search come yeah eventually if now

725
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:49,970
remember earlier I have a figure I said

726
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:54,200
this is nothing new because it is really

727
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:57,380
nice in you this is uh okay it's here

728
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:00,019
this is the typical if you have the

729
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,549
population grew out you are done

730
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:03,589
experiment you have an environmental

731
00:32:01,548 --> 00:32:05,808
mean you have the mean right but what if

732
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:08,259
I didn't do the experiment so the key is

733
00:32:05,808 --> 00:32:11,450
to replace this thing bar to mean Huizar

734
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:13,339
environmental parameter right so that's

735
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:15,860
all the struggle we went through try to

736
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:18,349
replace his parameter so after you

737
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:20,178
replaces x-axis now it's called the

738
00:32:18,349 --> 00:32:22,609
fertile some more time it's photo so

739
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:25,190
more time during a spatial you know

740
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:27,439
specific do stage if you have that for

741
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:30,409
the single time I can predict the farm

742
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,429
time so that's we change the x-axis to

743
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:36,620
make it a predictive in the future right

744
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:38,538
let's see how we call this called a

745
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:41,359
critical environmental agressors through

746
00:32:38,538 --> 00:32:44,658
inform search in earlier papers and also

747
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:47,569
they drop modeling papers they just have

748
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:49,190
so many parameters they all get together

749
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:50,778
and they functionally I mean I just

750
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:52,700
don't understand what is being

751
00:32:50,778 --> 00:32:55,799
calculated right but to give a lot of

752
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:59,190
insights to us what we try to take out

753
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:01,710
Mona saying I'm always parameters what

754
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:04,100
are the most sensitive in this case it's

755
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:07,140
probably follow some more time right so

756
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:08,939
we basically have three we have seven

757
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:12,030
numbers these seven numbers is the

758
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:14,549
x-axis this value particular x-axis that

759
00:33:12,029 --> 00:33:17,730
saving environment we have the means we

760
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:20,129
change the search window of the green of

761
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:23,460
the photo so more time to see which one

762
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:25,950
give you high correlations so we we had

763
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,170
we can define a three day window we can

764
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:30,840
do i define a seven-day window right

765
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:32,519
every time we have a window just like if

766
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:35,339
you know how the program is very easy by

767
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:38,190
you start and in right and then we so

768
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:40,159
when I start animation this starts this

769
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:42,600
horizontal position is not gonna change

770
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:46,529
this position will did not change it's

771
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:50,549
changing this x-axis window right that's

772
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:53,399
all started you basically try to build

773
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:55,740
the loss of correlation to find where is

774
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,230
the best correlation can replace the

775
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:00,839
environment of me so that I don't in the

776
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:03,029
future before I do the experiment I know

777
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:06,689
I can predict what's gonna happen right

778
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:09,599
here we got we find out it's of eighteen

779
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:12,150
to forty three days that get calculated

780
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:15,539
the photos photo some more time can be

781
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:18,030
home 996 it's all essentially wine right

782
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:19,650
people ask me how about the rainfall how

783
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:21,960
about others right and people say

784
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:24,450
correlation causation right if you get a

785
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,530
correlation point nine I six you don't

786
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:28,918
care about the correlation causation

787
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:31,710
right that's good enough what else you

788
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:34,289
do right but it makes things to ask why

789
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:36,240
that's a case right because we you have

790
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:40,679
back half of the physiology research or

791
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:43,949
developed apology research right so once

792
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:46,289
we have that done we now we can actually

793
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:48,059
do a jolt genomic regression analysis

794
00:34:46,289 --> 00:34:50,880
through the reaction normal parameter

795
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:55,320
estimation basically because now you

796
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:58,280
have this x axis now if you derive this

797
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,720
x axis from the experiment became

798
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,850
performance free now it's just separate

799
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:05,219
right unless as long as you stay in the

800
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:07,860
typical environment you can do

801
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:09,009
forecasting each genotype

802
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:12,090
its performance

803
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:14,890
along the x-axis became captured by the

804
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:17,170
intercept if dual intercept here and a

805
00:35:14,889 --> 00:35:20,379
slope so everything just intercept the

806
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:22,930
slope right and then if you predict the

807
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:24,849
teste tested that you know type under

808
00:35:22,929 --> 00:35:26,559
testing environment prediction on

809
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:28,868
testing environment that's easy because

810
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:31,539
you can read all right you can predict

811
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:33,640
today under the tested environment you

812
00:35:31,539 --> 00:35:36,219
can have some genotypes some genotype

813
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:38,799
will have this performance intercept

814
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:40,599
slope the other genotypes you use

815
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,519
developed predicts an intercept

816
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:45,368
predicted slope and then you just read

817
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:49,389
off your results you can hide the data

818
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:51,760
to do tested and genotype under tested

819
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:54,909
environment to the untested no time on

820
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,490
testing environment the key fear people

821
00:35:54,909 --> 00:35:59,769
ask why this correlation till nine five

822
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:03,789
nine eight seven eight eight eight six

823
00:35:59,769 --> 00:36:06,190
so high because this reaction norm does

824
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:08,800
not only content G by E but it's also

825
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:11,740
contain the genotype effect but also

826
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,720
contend a location effect look every sin

827
00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:16,629
this location always fly relate to this

828
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:19,329
relation generate flower early right so

829
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:21,519
this this high correlation we predicted

830
00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:24,309
it contains also location prediction

831
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:27,190
romantic prediction plus this specific

832
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:29,730
prediction for each genotype that means

833
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:34,090
if you read this picture it's a the

834
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:37,210
observe the G by E right is a natural

835
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:40,840
process of the plasticity containing

836
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:43,480
genotype classing bomb input is show up

837
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:45,160
right because this is a remember before

838
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,179
we sold everything out it was up and

839
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:47,889
down this is crazy

840
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:51,159
right after you salted that you know you

841
00:36:47,889 --> 00:36:53,049
can do predictions it take time to

842
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:55,719
understand this but let's see another

843
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:58,150
companion thing you can also do a jump

844
00:36:55,719 --> 00:37:01,868
regression analysis with a genome why

845
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:04,510
the marker affected continue this is to

846
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:06,280
say that in in genomic prediction

847
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:08,320
genomic selection we have two terms one

848
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:11,040
called G block that individuals

849
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:14,590
performance was predicted through G blob

850
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:16,449
right the you know they did through the

851
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:18,608
mixed model additive relationship matrix

852
00:37:16,449 --> 00:37:20,529
but you could also print you can also

853
00:37:18,608 --> 00:37:22,670
assign this breeding value to each

854
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:25,490
markers each marker can be given

855
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:28,130
our blood right to have the marker

856
00:37:25,489 --> 00:37:31,250
breeding values here I'll show you that

857
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:34,818
this is a through the marker effect

858
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:36,829
continuum so here earlier that earlier

859
00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:39,949
flies each line is a genotype is

860
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:42,798
individual is inbreds here each line is

861
00:37:39,949 --> 00:37:46,759
a marker you see the marker has its

862
00:37:42,798 --> 00:37:51,409
effect changing down or up depending on

863
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:53,420
the input of the environment here we

864
00:37:51,409 --> 00:37:55,788
change the numerical but we added here

865
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,858
that's where we derive this thing right

866
00:37:55,789 --> 00:38:00,410
those remember these two values are

867
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:02,690
almost one essentially called highly

868
00:38:00,409 --> 00:38:05,149
correlated right so you can through

869
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:07,460
prediction from the marker effect you

870
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:09,559
give me individual I have this I just

871
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:11,630
summarized the market effect I can do

872
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:15,079
the predictions its equivalency between

873
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:18,130
the G Bob and our blood was realized by

874
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:20,619
the you know reaction norm parameters I

875
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:23,028
will have most sites to show that right

876
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:25,519
again in most of our genomic selection

877
00:38:23,028 --> 00:38:26,568
paper I think we do a lot of this jungle

878
00:38:25,518 --> 00:38:28,578
could do lot of this

879
00:38:26,568 --> 00:38:30,619
people always sometime ask empirical

880
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:33,460
validation but the data is empirical but

881
00:38:30,619 --> 00:38:35,480
people always ask what about you do

882
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:38,420
additional experiment like so that's

883
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:41,028
what he did it took a little time so he

884
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:43,909
remember that earlier analysis we have

885
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:46,548
the protocol I'm a full team and then I

886
00:38:43,909 --> 00:38:49,848
was 13 to recall 14 summer planting

887
00:38:46,548 --> 00:38:54,409
Kansas then we planted I about 1516 our

888
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:56,269
model are stopped before Iowa 15 and 16

889
00:38:54,409 --> 00:38:59,480
now we're gonna predict what is

890
00:38:56,268 --> 00:39:01,639
happening I was 15 I was 16 and then to

891
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:04,219
see what happened right so the Iowa

892
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:08,210
really a nice because see Iowa 14 is

893
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:10,009
here our 16 is here is Spanish crossover

894
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:12,528
region right so that means the

895
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:15,230
temperature and a lens has an int action

896
00:39:12,528 --> 00:39:17,659
itself right in bomb the factors hasn't

897
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:20,539
actions and I interacted with the Pope

898
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:22,699
in genetics and give me this G by E into

899
00:39:20,539 --> 00:39:25,009
actions right so we did this

900
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:27,739
implementation the correlation

901
00:39:25,009 --> 00:39:29,869
coefficient is point 8 and n is point

902
00:39:27,739 --> 00:39:32,808
eight eight here what we're a little bit

903
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:35,150
off target data because Linda we

904
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:36,200
selected is somewhat fixed if he could

905
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:38,480
in the future

906
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:40,519
the dynamic window you believe that will

907
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,289
have a better target so that's the

908
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:45,199
empirical experiment we ran in two years

909
00:39:42,289 --> 00:39:48,739
to prove whatever we can do right so

910
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:50,539
this picture also facilitates you to

911
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:52,909
think about in the breeding companies

912
00:39:50,539 --> 00:39:55,429
right if you know the historical average

913
00:39:52,909 --> 00:39:58,129
of each site you can optimize your

914
00:39:55,429 --> 00:40:01,338
site's to generate environmental that

915
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:03,410
optimized cowardly you know how are the

916
00:40:01,338 --> 00:40:05,750
x-axis you don't have a testing the

917
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:07,969
dislocations forever some location might

918
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:10,338
give you redundant data right you may

919
00:40:07,969 --> 00:40:13,429
can optimize the testing sites so we

920
00:40:10,338 --> 00:40:16,400
didn't specify this limit paper but it's

921
00:40:13,429 --> 00:40:19,838
there and then we say a lot of research

922
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:23,900
we do we say to explain or to predict I

923
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:26,179
have to go faster most of time in and

924
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:28,130
the nature explain we can do to explain

925
00:40:26,179 --> 00:40:30,348
that means we do genetic study or

926
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:33,619
developmental studies we generate the

927
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:37,280
mutants we do gene cloning Magni studies

928
00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:39,650
also we do Gy selects ignorant Peaks but

929
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,440
an other side we do the we do the black

930
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:43,789
box approach we do this prediction you

931
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,309
can think about Marshall learning to

932
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:48,588
write but sometimes there's a human

933
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:50,599
nature even sometime you can predict it

934
00:40:48,588 --> 00:40:53,230
we still ask for I can predict right

935
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:55,579
that's why if you pop your paper saying

936
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:57,079
explanatory Marshall learning people

937
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:59,810
have because they can connect means

938
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:03,099
biology right but this to actually it is

939
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:05,239
should it be joined together right so

940
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:09,230
this is the same slide about the

941
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:11,000
regulation networks so we the same set

942
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:12,889
of data we can do basic acute your

943
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,858
mapping if you do two QTL mapping you'll

944
00:41:12,889 --> 00:41:18,920
see this five genes give you the peaks

945
00:41:15,858 --> 00:41:21,170
at different locations but then you can

946
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:24,318
do multi bombed analysis you can get

947
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:26,599
this one single environmentalists and

948
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:29,449
then the pistach is also significant

949
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:31,369
what what I'm saying is here although

950
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:34,129
prediction is based on gene oh my

951
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:36,890
markers there's major genes that affect

952
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:39,260
you know generating this effect allow us

953
00:41:36,889 --> 00:41:42,618
to be predicting will see this slide

954
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:44,660
again right these are the because two

955
00:41:42,619 --> 00:41:47,780
parents have genome sequence we can

956
00:41:44,659 --> 00:41:49,219
actually relate this qto Peaks to the

957
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:52,760
specific gene that other

958
00:41:49,219 --> 00:41:54,858
cloned so these are the different you

959
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,080
know Leo's these are the Jo pick to show

960
00:41:54,858 --> 00:41:59,329
that what are we when we say claim is

961
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:02,809
Jing underline is Peaks we have some

962
00:41:59,329 --> 00:42:05,569
competence say that right this sin is

963
00:42:02,809 --> 00:42:07,519
called up now you can do genetic mapping

964
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:09,380
of reaction known parameters like this

965
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:11,599
was done in other groups too but this

966
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:13,730
reaction norm now is the reaction norm

967
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,830
generated from an environmental index

968
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:17,690
it's not environmental meaning because

969
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:19,759
we believe that when you use this

970
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:23,179
reaction norm generated from memory

971
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:25,700
index any gene you showed up should it

972
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:28,129
be the gene that directly responsive to

973
00:42:25,699 --> 00:42:31,339
this environmental parameters you can

974
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:33,019
find this same thing same Peaks the

975
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,510
interaction also significant for the

976
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:37,340
intercept for the slopes right so the

977
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:39,590
performance across the geographic

978
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:42,980
diverse environment is the phenotype too

979
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:45,950
so you just steal transformation and we

980
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:49,400
read earlier papers by Thomas younger he

981
00:42:45,949 --> 00:42:51,980
did his group did you know investigative

982
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:54,559
for summary to say that sometime you can

983
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:57,679
have gene effect of tag mystic plural P

984
00:42:54,559 --> 00:43:00,650
or conditional neutral a differential

985
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:04,009
sensitivity or no G by E I mean qqt or

986
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:06,800
can be up here down here detected and

987
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:09,830
undetected posted text by different

988
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,589
effect along right so if we actually

989
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:15,230
follow the same same logic we can

990
00:43:12,588 --> 00:43:17,869
actually say this other you know this

991
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:20,179
other seven locations you can see this

992
00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:22,280
cute choice with ami one in certain

993
00:43:20,179 --> 00:43:24,618
locations as a negative effect versus

994
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,750
that allele reference allele sometime

995
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:29,358
has a possibly effect right this is

996
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:31,400
because this we think that differential

997
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:34,489
sensitivity conditional neutral or

998
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:37,130
passing so tropi this all is just

999
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:39,439
depending which segment or which gene

1000
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:42,019
you are looking at right it's because

1001
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:45,019
plant are mathematicians they have to

1002
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:47,480
learn all this time integration or time

1003
00:43:45,019 --> 00:43:48,530
averaging or the rate detection right

1004
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:52,550
you know how to do differential

1005
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:55,339
equations right if you this are the

1006
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:58,910
categorical saving location but if you

1007
00:43:55,338 --> 00:44:01,190
plot this photo some more time now we

1008
00:43:58,909 --> 00:44:03,268
are showing this genetic effect it's not

1009
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:05,489
a constant on crossing

1010
00:44:03,268 --> 00:44:07,768
genetic effect changing the side

1011
00:44:05,489 --> 00:44:10,619
remember the big a big a big a big a

1012
00:44:07,768 --> 00:44:12,778
small a small a I changes sigh change

1013
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:15,479
the size and directions allowing this

1014
00:44:12,778 --> 00:44:18,418
environmental no parameter cover photo

1015
00:44:15,478 --> 00:44:21,088
summertime and then this is the genome I

1016
00:44:18,418 --> 00:44:22,828
marker effect also changing I mean this

1017
00:44:21,088 --> 00:44:25,409
is actually true right because you know

1018
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:26,939
not plants we try to have differently

1019
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:28,768
around the input we try to flower right

1020
00:44:26,938 --> 00:44:33,239
but make a decision to flower so they

1021
00:44:28,768 --> 00:44:35,608
change their effect right so here we say

1022
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:38,039
unify and even and tall and biometric

1023
00:44:35,608 --> 00:44:39,498
aspect of g'bye is named at my joint

1024
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:42,269
analysis because we think that

1025
00:44:39,498 --> 00:44:44,728
developmental GU by yield developmental

1026
00:44:42,268 --> 00:44:47,399
everything was happening here but if we

1027
00:44:44,728 --> 00:44:49,588
just analyze in the final results that's

1028
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,019
the biometric G by partition the

1029
00:44:49,588 --> 00:44:53,608
variance components currently calculate

1030
00:44:52,018 --> 00:44:55,918
heritability right but then what

1031
00:44:53,608 --> 00:45:01,469
happened here is individual right so

1032
00:44:55,918 --> 00:45:04,438
that's go United we make a lot of

1033
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:06,329
statement saying that integrative

1034
00:45:04,438 --> 00:45:08,399
analysis of genes and environment can

1035
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:11,519
reveal the Manics interplay under the

1036
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:15,449
observed phenotype dynamics all these

1037
00:45:11,518 --> 00:45:17,518
are so so this is the mostly for the

1038
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:19,798
breathing company large companies right

1039
00:45:17,518 --> 00:45:23,338
you could actually sometime optimize

1040
00:45:19,798 --> 00:45:25,409
your testing sites you can also think

1041
00:45:23,338 --> 00:45:29,880
about how to use the winter nursery

1042
00:45:25,409 --> 00:45:32,459
observations because it's dynamics right

1043
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:37,650
its environment if you figure out the G

1044
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:40,248
by E you can leverage some in some

1045
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:45,179
information from the internet free data

1046
00:45:40,248 --> 00:45:48,598
I'll skip this so we here we say it's

1047
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:52,528
this prediction is a site-specific it's

1048
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:55,318
a it's on target is whole genome it's

1049
00:45:52,528 --> 00:45:57,869
it's in season this is is in season you

1050
00:45:55,318 --> 00:46:00,088
can actually if you can really think

1051
00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:02,189
about how you design and thinking about

1052
00:46:00,088 --> 00:46:04,139
data mine yeah the data you mind the

1053
00:46:02,188 --> 00:46:06,178
data you see the pattern and then how

1054
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:08,578
you do do this pattern direct your

1055
00:46:06,179 --> 00:46:10,739
future experiment how you decide which

1056
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:12,659
know type to pick you want to pick the

1057
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:14,369
most representative genotypes or the

1058
00:46:12,659 --> 00:46:15,519
whole landscape you want to pick the

1059
00:46:14,369 --> 00:46:17,680
environment

1060
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:22,210
based on historical 15-year average the

1061
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:23,769
testing on you know genotype right so we

1062
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:25,750
get this paper published so we really

1063
00:46:23,769 --> 00:46:28,929
like we happy about this paper this

1064
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:31,090
paper contains tons of stuff he did it's

1065
00:46:28,929 --> 00:46:33,099
not that complicated it's a it's a real

1066
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:36,579
mapping population and a we but we were

1067
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:38,860
able to it is published does this work

1068
00:46:36,579 --> 00:46:40,480
for other traits other crops so fry

1069
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:42,940
working for flowering times on higher

1070
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,250
air height green yield work all this

1071
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:48,460
stuff where all the scraps we have data

1072
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:51,489
to work on and this is a rice study we

1073
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:53,970
did recently it turns out that it's not

1074
00:46:51,489 --> 00:46:57,399
a photo so more time it is a temperature

1075
00:46:53,969 --> 00:47:00,399
profile actually give you this negative

1076
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:03,970
499 predictions so this is ongoing

1077
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:06,579
research and then does this work for

1078
00:47:03,969 --> 00:47:10,179
other traits we really got asked many

1079
00:47:06,579 --> 00:47:15,130
times we say well guess what it just

1080
00:47:10,179 --> 00:47:17,469
Felix right when we have these first two

1081
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:19,210
chromosomes is the radiation you can

1082
00:47:17,469 --> 00:47:20,619
think about de lijn de limbs and a

1083
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:23,079
temperature well

1084
00:47:20,619 --> 00:47:25,690
Earth's being rotating worse being

1085
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:28,150
revolution around the song and rotating

1086
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:30,340
myself is a tool to the axis keep with

1087
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:33,400
us the seasonal changes why whatever

1088
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:35,440
people like modeling why would not work

1089
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:38,200
it would work right you here or the

1090
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,269
plants show up in the planet we have to

1091
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:41,769
adapt to the seasonal changes

1092
00:47:39,269 --> 00:47:44,409
temperature changes right it's just I

1093
00:47:41,769 --> 00:47:46,000
mean this is just say well finally we

1094
00:47:44,409 --> 00:47:49,779
think that some of the biological

1095
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:55,090
reservations have to agree with physics

1096
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:57,640
no physics right because this we also

1097
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:59,470
did something about optimized design of

1098
00:47:57,639 --> 00:48:01,269
genomic ation the section of the hybrids

1099
00:47:59,469 --> 00:48:04,299
because there earlier we showed a

1100
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:06,250
testing environment can be optimized and

1101
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:10,880
then the testing individuals can be

1102
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:13,789
optimized we'll skip that eventually we

1103
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:16,160
instead of the to explain to predict we

1104
00:48:13,789 --> 00:48:19,759
believe that you know you can do to

1105
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:21,949
explain and to predict right so under

1106
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,050
our narrower context we say you can

1107
00:48:21,949 --> 00:48:25,489
accept a unifying framework for genomic

1108
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:27,650
prediction on their own test the

1109
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:30,109
genotype on testing environment but if

1110
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:32,780
you think more right think about a 3d

1111
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:34,519
structure we could say there's a unified

1112
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,350
earth emphasis framework at least

1113
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:38,719
synthesis framework that can combine

1114
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:41,839
genomic selection G 1 and G by you all

1115
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:44,779
together we don't want to say GSG was

1116
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:47,720
under G body we want to say GS us and G

1117
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:49,730
by E because remember that 3d picture of

1118
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:53,059
environment and and genotype and

1119
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:56,659
performance most of time and we do G SOG

1120
00:48:53,059 --> 00:48:59,299
was either we slice through this 3d to

1121
00:48:56,659 --> 00:49:02,839
do our G wasps or GS always squeeze or

1122
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:04,880
summarize this the 3 D - a - D right

1123
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:08,410
these three things actually can be all

1124
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,410
think about together right

1125
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:15,849
I think it's we were counting I learned

1126
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:18,889
genomics I learned quantitative genetics

1127
00:49:15,849 --> 00:49:21,170
mental biologists I really like to talk

1128
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:23,359
to everybody - so because we can

1129
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:27,230
actually help us to explain to predict

1130
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:30,230
right we got funded by different

1131
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:32,510
agencies and Sharon Sharon Lee and

1132
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:35,150
tinting voicing Lee major contributors

1133
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:38,270
of this research and then we have a

1134
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:40,730
Mike's Callen was a nasa-funded Sam

1135
00:49:38,269 --> 00:49:43,820
project we have other collaborations I

1136
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:45,829
think that's all I have to say I have an

1137
00:49:43,820 --> 00:50:15,860
that's all I have to say thank you very

1138
00:49:45,829 --> 00:50:18,230
much when you just discover what the

1139
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:20,860
genes were did it help to understand

1140
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:23,130
both normal time or not I've managed

1141
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:25,570
resolution

1142
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:27,039
that's a great question because after

1143
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:28,450
the study published we keep thinking

1144
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:30,250
keep thinking I think you guys gonna be

1145
00:50:28,449 --> 00:50:32,469
thinking too right they said the middle

1146
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:35,530
the minimum environment the study g'bye

1147
00:50:32,469 --> 00:50:37,709
is three so you can have intercept and

1148
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:40,390
the slope right we say what about

1149
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:43,059
individual two environment can you study

1150
00:50:40,389 --> 00:50:44,829
g-body if you fit your between

1151
00:50:43,059 --> 00:50:48,429
environment under the context of

1152
00:50:44,829 --> 00:50:51,848
reaction norm the answer is yes because

1153
00:50:48,429 --> 00:50:53,589
it's the average and the difference it's

1154
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:55,420
not as good as you have three dots to

1155
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:58,119
have a regression line but it's a good

1156
00:50:55,420 --> 00:51:00,369
approximation then go back to single

1157
00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:02,530
environment keep study g'bye every

1158
00:51:00,369 --> 00:51:04,990
single environment most people know

1159
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:08,880
because you have to have two

1160
00:51:04,989 --> 00:51:12,909
environments right but actually any

1161
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:17,010
major two topics you detect in a single

1162
00:51:12,909 --> 00:51:20,170
environment is somehow pointing to this

1163
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:23,349
process Li Jing's if the single

1164
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:26,108
environment is sitting on the x-axis of

1165
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:29,320
the environment index change your

1166
00:51:26,108 --> 00:51:32,679
question is a great because in single

1167
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:35,230
environment besides the major in bomb

1168
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:37,960
index changing your flour and time

1169
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:40,150
there's some local specific environment

1170
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:42,730
let's say there's a you know Drive spell

1171
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:45,039
or let's say there's some extra nitrogen

1172
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:47,469
change to your environment

1173
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:49,469
now you detect in parallel will be low

1174
00:51:47,469 --> 00:51:52,959
because every Santino's hyper shifted to

1175
00:51:49,469 --> 00:51:54,848
to the whole pathway the network this

1176
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,670
perceptron goes safety to that signal

1177
00:51:54,849 --> 00:52:00,039
but if you feed that signal into the

1178
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:02,980
general framework of the range of the

1179
00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:06,070
Lamb yeah detective I don't think I also

1180
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:08,800
question but it's fast to do this

1181
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:11,800
research we did do this individual and

1182
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,810
together the help has to see why some

1183
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,609
signal persistently be showing up in

1184
00:52:13,809 --> 00:52:17,409
different environment because that's

1185
00:52:15,608 --> 00:52:19,299
capturing the main drivers of the

1186
00:52:17,409 --> 00:52:21,549
environment but other signals will

1187
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:23,740
disappear because other things twisted

1188
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:31,690
it alone yeah thank you for that

1189
00:52:23,739 --> 00:52:35,129
question so obviously like for

1190
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:36,610
photothermal time your day lengths and

1191
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:39,400
he

1192
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:42,130
huge and they control a lot of stuff and

1193
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,420
also they're useful for prediction I

1194
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:44,710
guess because if you know where you're

1195
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:48,070
going to grow some of the make pretty

1196
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:50,650
good guess yes but I'm just kind of

1197
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:52,750
curious how your other like

1198
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:57,309
environmental and chromosomes if you

1199
00:52:52,750 --> 00:53:00,190
will things like precipitation affect

1200
00:52:57,309 --> 00:53:03,009
your your predictions or like do they

1201
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:04,690
improve it if you know them or they just

1202
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:07,590
totally pretty much worthless in this

1203
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:10,750
framework I think they're very useful

1204
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:13,180
but I think about the but you have to we

1205
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:16,119
have to give the data right you give us

1206
00:53:13,179 --> 00:53:17,889
let's say with a relatively fixed the

1207
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:19,389
photo some more time of tailings and the

1208
00:53:17,889 --> 00:53:22,779
temperature and then different rainfall

1209
00:53:19,389 --> 00:53:26,109
patterns so so we the film is that the

1210
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:29,140
pattern discovery predictive power only

1211
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:31,420
if you have the typical patterns in the

1212
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:34,420
data could you then be able to detect

1213
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:37,030
them so far for the flowering time and

1214
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:39,280
also for plant height because the

1215
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:42,490
experimental ran typically we irrigate

1216
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:44,650
them oh-o-oh typically unless there

1217
00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:47,349
became an outlier of the whole other

1218
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:50,650
experiment if we take them out right so

1219
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:53,159
so otherwise we haven't to be able to

1220
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:56,260
use the rainfall pattern to do to

1221
00:53:53,159 --> 00:53:58,839
improve this model but it is possible

1222
00:53:56,260 --> 00:54:01,870
especially for large companies you ran a

1223
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:03,970
lot of irrigated a trial or if you have

1224
00:54:01,869 --> 00:54:06,670
a large data you could improve

1225
00:54:03,969 --> 00:54:10,419
oh it says that because the environment

1226
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:12,820
is a continuous but the developmental

1227
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:14,980
physiology at a certain time it's become

1228
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:16,930
critical if you can capture what is

1229
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:19,240
happening there and then you can have

1230
00:54:16,929 --> 00:54:40,989
some pretty good power that's great

1231
00:54:19,239 --> 00:54:45,339
question thank you I guess flowering for

1232
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:47,709
for yields mathematics breaks down

1233
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:50,380
there's there's many many different

1234
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:52,720
things like you know what if for

1235
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:56,680
have comes now or what if rain comes

1236
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:59,379
later I mean there it's just and so you

1237
00:54:56,679 --> 00:55:01,719
know then I mean the fundamental process

1238
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:05,230
is you take your environmental

1239
00:55:01,719 --> 00:55:08,049
parameters and you figure out some kind

1240
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:10,719
of combination of them that gives you

1241
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:13,210
your your correlation the 0.99 or better

1242
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:17,469
right and then and then you use that for

1243
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:18,699
slope and intercept but you know given

1244
00:55:17,469 --> 00:55:23,619
the number of things that it affects

1245
00:55:18,699 --> 00:55:25,569
yield there's a multiple testing problem

1246
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:27,880
in terms of you know I mean because you

1247
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:33,190
type water if you don't have coming you

1248
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:37,420
shown sorry I'm going on if you should

1249
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:39,639
like you have one interval either one

1250
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:41,440
for when the seven one to ten twenty

1251
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:43,960
seven you know etc but you have one

1252
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,730
interval but you know why just one

1253
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,230
interval maybe maybe there's three

1254
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:49,780
different critical intervals that

1255
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:52,240
determine flowering time and right so it

1256
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:55,750
so then I couldn't I'm sure I can take

1257
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:59,049
just your two numbers of temperature and

1258
00:55:55,750 --> 00:56:01,659
boto period and get a higher R square

1259
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:05,769
than point nine nine six right I think

1260
00:56:01,659 --> 00:56:07,509
you can get the one okay so so then then

1261
00:56:05,769 --> 00:56:10,349
we start thinking about you know all of

1262
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:14,590
the other aspects of fertility and

1263
00:56:10,349 --> 00:56:16,809
moisture and solar radiation and you

1264
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:18,400
know and then spread out across week

1265
00:56:16,809 --> 00:56:20,170
number one week number or not week

1266
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,329
number one day number one day number two

1267
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:24,880
you know so there's a multiple testing

1268
00:56:22,329 --> 00:56:29,710
burden where no matter what if I have if

1269
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:31,510
I had 50 environments yet but remember

1270
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:34,389
that crop model will handle everything

1271
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:37,480
you say but then here were just saying

1272
00:56:34,389 --> 00:56:40,119
that among this larger graph region what

1273
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:42,519
are the most essential controls allow

1274
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:44,529
you have the general predictions if you

1275
00:56:42,519 --> 00:56:47,050
do want to go to that a finer scales

1276
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:50,050
yeah you didn't remote oh yeah he said

1277
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:51,970
a1 access detect that one period you

1278
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:54,370
have motio pop here right you have all

1279
00:56:51,969 --> 00:56:56,529
information right whatever promote only

1280
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:58,989
take carries but the problem with comodo

1281
00:56:56,530 --> 00:57:00,519
is that we as geneticists or plant

1282
00:56:58,989 --> 00:57:03,469
breeders we couldn't understand what has

1283
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:06,380
been the critical essential stay

1284
00:57:03,469 --> 00:57:08,269
because some because the way their

1285
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:09,740
pattern is continuous right the daylon's

1286
00:57:08,269 --> 00:57:11,300
won't change like is yes right a

1287
00:57:09,739 --> 00:57:14,059
temperature might change but the average

1288
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:16,940
temperature you knows can be smooth we

1289
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:19,608
want just show actually the reason why

1290
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:21,920
we could the state to me you made about

1291
00:57:19,608 --> 00:57:24,108
what if we find a multipole windows

1292
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:26,990
that's great because that's what our

1293
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:29,328
study showed right so as long as we can

1294
00:57:26,989 --> 00:57:31,669
find them windows why index to index

1295
00:57:29,329 --> 00:57:33,440
combination index Marshall learning can

1296
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:35,150
find the some sense get the better

1297
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,940
prediction that's great because that's

1298
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:42,619
the purpose of this paper to say we can

1299
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:45,170
make predictions of the pattern exists

1300
00:57:42,619 --> 00:57:48,140
in the data because their data and then

1301
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:50,000
we can do the major ones first yeah well

1302
00:57:48,139 --> 00:57:52,578
you know there's a paper published in

1303
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,338
Nature Genetics just last week they did

1304
00:57:52,579 --> 00:57:57,800
a crab model friend of any vague phase

1305
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:59,750
of the Iran you know they have better

1306
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:15,920
predictions but still you cannot tell

1307
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:18,318
what I was being predicted this has been

1308
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:23,200
a production of Cornell University on

1309
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:23,199
the web at Cornell edu
