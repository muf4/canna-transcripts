1
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,559
to we're

2
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:16,280
gonna person up there I'm sorry we're

3
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:16,280
going to start with Dr Marvin

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:23,080
pritz and Dr pritz is um holds a faculty

5
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,518
position at Cornell uh that has research

6
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:27,159
and teaching and extension

7
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:29,278
responsibilities his primary extension

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,960
he is the primary extension Leon for the

9
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:34,039
New York State producers and he's also

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,320
the chair of the Department of

11
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:40,640
horiculture and let me get his

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,640
talk up

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,719
here before Dr prit starts I do want to

14
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:54,280
let you folks know that I have um

15
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:57,239
enabled you to put the full screen on so

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:00,960
that you can do that if you'd like or

17
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:03,518
you can um keep it as a a shorter

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,920
screen and I'm sorry we seem to have

19
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:07,759
lost the chat box so let me see if I can

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,159
get that back I don't know what happened

21
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:10,159
to

22
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,759
that a few little things

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,079
here

24
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,040
all right so now we have the um ability

25
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:36,118
for you folks to ask questions during

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,040
the

27
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:42,920
presentation you can also just put the

28
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,640
full screen on and just listen and um

29
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,118
okay well happy Halloween everybody

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,920
going to turn it over to you and we want

31
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:49,840
to talk today about weed management and

32
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,680
berries and it's a topic that get lots

33
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,600
and lots of questions about uh we've

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,520
done some work on budgeting and

35
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:58,038
strawberries and we find that managing

36
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:00,000
weeds is the greatest expense that

37
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:01,879
strawberry Growers incur except for

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,200
actually harvesting the fruit and

39
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:06,280
sometimes when we've done uh analysis we

40
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,039
found it up to 70% of the labor cost

41
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:12,080
that Growers spend involves weed

42
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,919
management and part of that is because

43
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,000
we grow our strawberries under matted

44
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,318
row and we have Fields like this that

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,439
are pretty much bare F we put our little

46
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:23,000
strawberry plants in there and then we

47
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,680
hope that they produce Runners during

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,840
the year and fill in but when you look

49
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,000
at that field you find that there's lots

50
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,280
of be ground and lots of opportunities

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,479
for we to come in during that time that

52
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,640
strawberries are trying to grow and

53
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,799
establish themselves most of the

54
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:39,000
problems we have are in that first year

55
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,879
where there's a lot of bare ground in

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,598
the Strawberry Fields and we don't have

57
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,280
a whole lot of very good herbicides

58
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:46,318
although that's changing a little bit

59
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,360
now uh more recently we've gotten some

60
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,479
materials that Dr Blinder is going to

61
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,959
share with you in a few minutes but

62
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:55,000
we're going to talk about matad Rose

63
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,878
first so we have all this bearr uh

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,080
people go and they cut the flowers off

65
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,719
to encourage the runners to fill in the

66
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,040
runners fill in between the rows but

67
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:04,759
again even during this these first

68
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,759
several months there's a lot of bare

69
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:07,359
ground out there and a lot of

70
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,719
opportunities for weeds to establish

71
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,480
themselves particularly when we irrigate

72
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,560
and uh water the ground in between the

73
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:16,039
strawberries and we'll occasionally get

74
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,680
lots of weeds growing between the rows

75
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:19,719
and uh even more weeds growing between

76
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,519
the rows and then this is when we get

77
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:23,239
calls from Growers and I'll say what can

78
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,080
I do I've got weeds in my strawberries

79
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,920
well uh it's often pretty late to do

80
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,360
much about it by then but that's often

81
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,479
times when we get the call so what we

82
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,040
want to do today is sort of think about

83
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:35,000
some ways we might be able to manage our

84
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,759
weeds without waiting till we get to a

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,158
point like that now fumigation is

86
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,598
something that used to be a little bit

87
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:43,719
more popular than it is now part of the

88
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,280
reason for that is that fumigation

89
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:47,519
methyl bromide in particular is being

90
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,878
phased out and it's becoming very

91
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,879
expensive so Growers that used to use it

92
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:53,078
for weed management practice are finding

93
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:55,120
well that's just a little bit too

94
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:58,680
expensive for me to do that plus the

95
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,319
plastic is difficult to dispose

96
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,280
of the black plastic mulches are used in

97
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,719
a lot of annual production systems and

98
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,640
there's a photograph in Florida where

99
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:09,759
they use black plastic and that helps

100
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:11,639
control the weeds too but one of the

101
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,438
problems with that is is a disposal

102
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:15,719
problem and I don't know what it's like

103
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,040
in your state but just this month in New

104
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:20,918
York they passed a law that saying you

105
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,400
can't burn anymore no open burning and a

106
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:24,000
lot of Growers would dispose of their

107
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,000
plastic by open burning so we can't do

108
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,279
that anymore so this material is left to

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,439
accumulate if you don't have a way to

110
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:32,559
recycle it and

111
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:34,560
I did some calculations a couple years

112
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,399
ago for a presentation I was going to

113
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,399
give and I realized that strawberry

114
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:41,359
Growers alone use enough plastic each

115
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,638
year to circle the Earth 13 times so

116
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,600
that's a lot that's a lot of plastic so

117
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:47,720
the question that we're interested in is

118
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,080
are the ways of preventing weeds in

119
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,360
strawberries without using a lot of

120
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:52,719
plastic without using fumigation without

121
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,280
using a lot of

122
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,600
Labor there's really three strategies uh

123
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:00,559
pretty obvious one is deplete the weed

124
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,800
seed bank and prevent seed dispersal to

125
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,639
the field in other words try not to get

126
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,400
weeds into the field before you start

127
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,240
secondly prevent germination and or

128
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:11,839
establishment once you have the berries

129
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,519
in the ground and then thirdly uh remove

130
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,399
weeds that appear and unfortunately most

131
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:17,639
people wait till that third step and

132
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,599
then try to figure out how to remove

133
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:23,000
weeds that appear without putting a lot

134
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,000
of effort into the first

135
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:29,599
two one of the experiments we did a few

136
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,240
years ago was looking at replant disease

137
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,639
in strawberries and we had an old

138
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,199
strawberry field we took it out of

139
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,840
strawberries and then we planted eight

140
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,360
different treatments into that old

141
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,758
strawberry field and then we planted

142
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,639
strawberries after these twoyear

143
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,600
rotations in between the strawberries so

144
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,199
for example we had uh mode weedy

145
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,400
fumigation alphalpha mustard kale sweet

146
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,160
corn raw you can read the treatments up

147
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:57,198
there and we also had continuous

148
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,800
strawberry and then we took these cover

149
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,000
crops out and we planted strawberries

150
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,120
again and have a lot of data here on how

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,439
these plants responded and root

152
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,439
pathogens and everything like that but I

153
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,759
just wanted to show you the data on the

154
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,879
weediness of the treatments after these

155
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,280
cover crops and this would be in the

156
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,800
first year that strawberries were

157
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:18,918
growing so the First Column you see is

158
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,280
sort of a methyl bromide fumigation

159
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:21,918
treatment this is about as good as it

160
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,478
gets when you fumigate and implant your

161
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,279
strawberries very few weeds and some of

162
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:27,758
the treatments had a lot of weeds like

163
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:31,758
when you go right in with strawberries

164
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,680
and follow strawberries again or you mow

165
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,879
you don't do anything except mow the

166
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,000
weeds that doesn't really help a lot but

167
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,560
what I wanted to point out was that some

168
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,598
of these treatments like kale sweet corn

169
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,120
Rye rotation or rotation of mustards did

170
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:46,639
a pretty good job at managing weeds and

171
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,759
suppressing weeds in that first year and

172
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,680
it was certainly a lot less expensive

173
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:53,080
and had a lot less environmental impact

174
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,160
than methyl bromite fumigation so that

175
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:57,639
was a good

176
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,199
thing one of the questions we wanted to

177
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,720
ask ourselves or several questions but

178
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,478
when you have weeds and strawberries

179
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,160
like how much weed growth is acceptable

180
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:08,519
how much can a grower tolerate uh is the

181
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,439
only good weed a dead weed are there

182
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:12,079
times when weed growth can be tolerated

183
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:14,120
and there are times when weeds are very

184
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,159
competitive with strawberry plants so

185
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,959
the way we try to answer that question

186
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,879
was we took a first year strawberry

187
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,359
field and we divided up into plots and

188
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,400
we had uh weeds growing in those plots

189
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,520
for specific lengths of time and for

190
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:31,598
specific months of the year so for

191
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:33,159
example we had weeds growing just during

192
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,319
the month of June and then for the rest

193
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,680
of the season we removed the weeds by

194
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:39,960
hand uh just for the month of July just

195
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,478
for August just for September and then

196
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:45,198
we had combinations of two months and

197
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:48,079
then combinations of three months and

198
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,000
then we had weeds all year long and then

199
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,478
we let the strawberries go through the

200
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,598
winter and in The Following season in

201
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:55,839
the first year we harvested the plants

202
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:58,519
to see what impact the weeds in the

203
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,959
first year had on yields the second year

204
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:03,158
so here are some of the plot

205
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:05,279
see some are weedi and some aren't and

206
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:07,319
these are the data here the way you read

207
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,038
this is that if there's an X that means

208
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,759
weeds were present in each of those

209
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,680
months and so here we have weeds present

210
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,120
June July August and September basically

211
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,000
all year long those plants the following

212
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,038
year those plots produce one Runner and

213
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,800
292 grams of

214
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:26,199
fruit and uh you can see how this was

215
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,879
set up three months two months one month

216
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,079
but what so the first thing I want to do

217
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,200
is look at the one month periods so

218
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,958
these are weeds in June weeds just in

219
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,919
July just in August and just in

220
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:38,399
September let's go over here and look at

221
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,639
Runner production and we can see that

222
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,839
the later the weeds were present the

223
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:45,439
more Runners we had and the same way

224
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,959
with yields yields were higher if the

225
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,560
one month of weed pressure was late in

226
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,639
the season relative to one month early

227
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:52,639
in the

228
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,759
season we can do the same thing when we

229
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:57,480
look at a TW month period of weed so

230
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:59,439
here are weeds in June and July we can

231
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,480
look at our yield a little over th000

232
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,720
grams per plot but if we had the same

233
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,800
two months of weed pressure but later in

234
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,040
the season our yields were two and a

235
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:09,838
half times as much and we can see the

236
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:11,759
same pattern with Runners a lot more

237
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,160
Runners when the weeds were late

238
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,319
compared to when the weed pressure was

239
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:18,000
early and we can do the same thing for

240
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,760
three months of weed pressure uh very

241
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,240
little yield but when the three months

242
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:24,799
of weed pressure was later about three

243
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,320
or four times as much yield and we've

244
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,120
done this experiment for a couple of

245
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,320
different years and it's pretty clear

246
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,799
that in first year plannings early

247
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,519
season weed pressure is much worse than

248
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,639
late season weed pressure so getting the

249
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:39,399
weeds out of those first year plannings

250
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:43,759
early really can make a difference weeds

251
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:43,759
later in the season uh not so much of an

252
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:49,879
impact so how do you keep those weeds

253
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,759
out well we did it by hand but that's a

254
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:53,879
lot of work are there other ways that

255
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:56,200
you can use cultivation to remove weeds

256
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:58,078
early in the season when they're most

257
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,120
problematic well there are lots of

258
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:02,958
different tools out there to manage

259
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,879
weeds and strawberry Growers tend to use

260
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:07,399
a Rota tiller and herbicides but there's

261
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:08,759
some other tools out there that look

262
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,480
like they might have some potential in

263
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:14,200
strawberries so we wanted to see how

264
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,120
those those work so this is a standard

265
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,839
way that Growers cultivate their

266
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,759
strawberries they take a multivator road

267
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,519
tiller get down the rose but the problem

268
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:25,720
with that device is that on the

269
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:28,480
downstroke it compacts the soil and

270
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,480
makes a compacted layer about 6 in down

271
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,600
and on the stroke it just brings wheed

272
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,839
seeds up to the surface and lets them

273
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,440
germinate what would be better is if you

274
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,120
could do some shallow cultivation where

275
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,639
you're only cultivating the first couple

276
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,919
of inches rather than uh all the way

277
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,799
down and bringing wheat seeds to the

278
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:48,159
surface and some of these tools do that

279
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:49,319
these finger weers uh shallowly

280
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:50,838
cultivate around the plants now these

281
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,240
are onions not strawberries but you can

282
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:53,240
see the

283
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:59,199
principle gets right up close to the

284
00:10:55,958 --> 00:11:00,958
plant these Flex T Harrows shallow

285
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,560
cultivate they don't bring weed Seas up

286
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,399
to the

287
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:07,000
surface and you just drive this device

288
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,200
relatively quickly over the field these

289
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,039
times vibrate back and forth and knock

290
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,240
the small weeds

291
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:18,000
out out of the

292
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,360
ground this is something called a Reggie

293
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,039
weeder and the way this works is you sit

294
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:27,519
in the back here and you pull along you

295
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:30,879
straddle the row and the operator pulls

296
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,839
these um Wheels in and out and they spin

297
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,559
and they move uh spin the weeds out from

298
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:36,200
around the plant so you can just move it

299
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,919
in and out as you go down the

300
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,600
row and this device here spins and you

301
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,000
can see it only cultivates real

302
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,759
shallowly and it doesn't bring weed

303
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,759
seeds up to the

304
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:49,559
surface we've had real good luck with

305
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:52,519
that in strawberries and then also this

306
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:53,919
device here which is called a brush ho

307
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:56,360
and the way this thing works it's like a

308
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:59,799
giant street sweeper it mounts on the

309
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,959
back of a tractor and these wheels spin

310
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:04,679
and they spin the weeds out as you go

311
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:06,439
over the row and straddle the row also

312
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:08,439
it kicks up a little bit of dust that

313
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,600
settles back down onto the top of the

314
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,800
row and it almost acts like a mulch

315
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,120
layer of

316
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,958
dust here you see it sweeping through

317
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,799
some uh cabbage and it kicks up some

318
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:21,278
dust it sweeps out the weeds and it

319
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:23,479
makes this layer of dust back on the

320
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:24,919
ground and here is the the brush ho

321
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,480
after it's gone over a young pled into

322
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:27,759
strawberries you can see it's done a

323
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,000
pretty good job of sweeping out the

324
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,838
weeds and that leaves this layer of dust

325
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,360
on the top which seems to prevent

326
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,839
subsequent weeds from germinating so I'm

327
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,959
going to show you some sequence of

328
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,600
photos here that look at some of the

329
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:42,119
different ways that weeds have been

330
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,519
managed in firste strawberries using

331
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,120
these different

332
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,919
tools so here's a a weed management tool

333
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,679
this is Devol after planting so you can

334
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:55,399
see the strawberry rose here and the

335
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:58,879
Devol was applied and then that was it

336
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:00,078
walked away from it couple of uh several

337
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,919
weeks later you come back and you're

338
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,159
getting some weeds going into

339
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,599
strawberries that's if you do nothing at

340
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:08,679
all this is sort of the standard way

341
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,079
that Growers would do it they might use

342
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:12,359
some Devol but then they would come in

343
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,439
with a multiv Vader and go through and

344
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,959
rotor tail between the rows and of

345
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,480
course that knocks down the weeds and

346
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:21,119
you're left with a situation like this

347
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,480
so it's pretty clean but it did use that

348
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,399
multivator and generally this area here

349
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,159
will regrow weeds very quickly after

350
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,639
you're done multiva as soon as it rains

351
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,159
again you'll get weed coming up in this

352
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,000
area

353
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:36,039
here this is a flex time Harrow this is

354
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,600
the one that I showed you that vibrates

355
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:40,879
when you drive over the rose it vibrates

356
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,278
the the small weeds out of the ground

357
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,720
and it does a pretty good job in the

358
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:45,919
first several weeks after strawberries

359
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,839
are planted you can see it keeps the

360
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:49,319
planting really clean here we didn't do

361
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,639
anything here no hand weeding we just

362
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,879
drove over it with the flex T Harrow

363
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:55,639
every few weeks now you can't let the

364
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:57,679
weeds get Too Tall or this won't work

365
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:00,639
the weeds have to stay small almost in

366
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:02,278
the codal stage but it's a good way to

367
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,879
cultivate

368
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:07,958
shallowly the difficulty we found with

369
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:09,480
this Flex Harrow that once the runners

370
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:11,599
start to form in a strawberry you can't

371
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:15,039
use it anymore because the runners get

372
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,240
caught up in the timeses and we get lots

373
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,838
of weeds at the end of the season if

374
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,198
we've used this Flex T Harrow it doesn't

375
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,399
it just stimulates a lot of weed

376
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:25,559
germination we get lots of weeds at the

377
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:27,958
end and we'll contrast that with the

378
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:30,518
brush ho where this is early in the

379
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:33,958
season and again very few weeds between

380
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:35,679
the rows and late in the season the same

381
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,638
thing very few weeds between the rows

382
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:40,319
even though these were not hand uh

383
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:43,198
pulled afterwards this is just a tool

384
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,759
the flex T Harrow stimulates we growth

385
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,958
particular after you're done using it

386
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,039
the brush ho seems to keep the weed

387
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,159
suppressed a little bit longer uh

388
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:53,879
probably because of that layer of of

389
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:57,240
dust that's formed on top of

390
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:58,799
that here's some data on the weed

391
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,399
biomass from these different treat

392
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,799
treatments the

393
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:05,639
multivator you know really knocks down

394
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:08,319
the weeds you don't get many weeds the

395
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:10,399
flex T Harrow uh gave us lots of weeds

396
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,079
and you saw a photo of that before that

397
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,519
even when we use the flex Harrow then

398
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:17,198
add herbicide we still get quite a few

399
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,919
weeds the finger weeder did a pretty

400
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:22,838
good job of reducing weeds same as a

401
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:25,719
brush ho so these were very effective

402
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:28,240
the herbicide alone you know doesn't

403
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,199
give us a whole lot of weed suppression

404
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,039
and but if you use an herbicide and a

405
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:34,000
multivator this is more or less the

406
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:37,399
standard practice that Growers use it

407
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,720
does keep the we down a lot but the

408
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:40,639
question is you know how much does it

409
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,519
cost to do that how many times you have

410
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,759
to go over the field and what are your

411
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:48,399
yields and so impacted by that so here

412
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:51,879
are the yields from the multivator and

413
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:55,159
you know reasonable yields here uh but

414
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:57,480
the yields are even better with a finger

415
00:15:55,159 --> 00:16:00,039
weer and some herbicides even this Flex

416
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,360
T Harrow if we use it early on to keep

417
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:03,559
the weeds out and then use an herbicide

418
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,079
you know the yields are pretty high

419
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:07,399
remember these plots were kind of weedy

420
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,278
but they were weedy at the end of the

421
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,879
season not at the beginning of the

422
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:12,439
Season as long as we keep the weeds out

423
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:13,759
at the beginning of the Season you know

424
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,279
the yields can to be pretty high even if

425
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,720
they're weedier later

426
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:22,240
on if we go down here to the herbicide

427
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,600
you know the herbicide alone doesn't

428
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,399
give you enough weed suppression you

429
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,240
definitely get an impact on yield so we

430
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,759
can't just rely on herbicides to manage

431
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,600
our weeds and strawberries we got use

432
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:36,480
some cultivation too and here's a

433
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,480
standard practice herbicide plus uh the

434
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:41,318
multivator so although the brush ho and

435
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,079
the finger weeder were more expensive to

436
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:46,439
use than a single herbal side

437
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:48,120
application about ,000 each in terms of

438
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,720
all your labor and costs everything

439
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,078
going into that they're much more

440
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,199
effective at controlling weeds and

441
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:57,679
$1,000 worth of strawberries isn't that

442
00:16:54,198 --> 00:17:00,159
much so you can easily make up for that

443
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:02,318
by using one of the these tools the

444
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:05,240
brush ho was also more effective and

445
00:17:02,318 --> 00:17:07,720
cheaper to run $300 for the year than

446
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,400
standard cultivation because it required

447
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,640
far few passes only three passes through

448
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,160
the field and two hand weedings and no

449
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,919
herbicides and we were able to keep the

450
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,919
field really really clean whereas with

451
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:22,120
standard uh Roto tilling we had to go

452
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,839
through more times and we had to do more

453
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:27,399
hand weedings the disadvantage of a

454
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:30,399
brush ho is its initial

455
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
expense

456
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,798
so let's look at another strategy and

457
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,120
that's planting strawberries through

458
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:41,400
killed sods so rather than have a bare

459
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,759
field where you plant your strawberries

460
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,880
and then you wait a whole year for those

461
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:47,798
Runners to establish and you have all

462
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,360
that bare soil the idea here is almost

463
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:53,200
like no till planting establish a cover

464
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:56,359
crop kill the cover crop plant the

465
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,279
strawberries into that cover crop and

466
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:59,839
then see how well your Weis is depressed

467
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:01,918
and and how well the strawberry plants

468
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:04,079
grow so here's the

469
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,120
field you can see different cover crops

470
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,519
growing here here's Harry vet uh this

471
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:10,879
looks like Rye uh there's a bunch of

472
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:13,240
different types of cover crops out here

473
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,039
and so what we did was we grew these in

474
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,279
the fall through the winter the

475
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:22,359
following spring we sprayed them out and

476
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:25,000
then we planted strawberries in a narrow

477
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:27,918
sort of ribbon row into these various

478
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,319
mulches so you can see them going across

479
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,320
here

480
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:35,840
and we looked at what happened after

481
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:38,038
that so here's a planning of uh which

482
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,319
was killed side we added a little bit of

483
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:41,558
straw to the

484
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:44,200
surface and we added some

485
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:46,678
herbicide and pre-emergent herbicide and

486
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,558
it keeps the weeds down really really

487
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,120
well for that first year and you don't

488
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:53,158
have to go in and cultivate you don't

489
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:56,079
have to go in and add additional

490
00:18:53,159 --> 00:19:00,240
herbicide here's a plot that had no

491
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:01,519
herbicide it was just killed rye and the

492
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,558
strawberries are planted into that

493
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,839
killed

494
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:08,200
rye and it's very clean here's another

495
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:10,798
plot very clean relative to some of

496
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,798
these other plots which are more uh

497
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:14,879
treated normally with some cultivation

498
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:17,038
and this is nut sge here a lot of this

499
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,679
is nut sge and it's a pretty bad weed

500
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,279
but you can see with this treatment here

501
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,759
uh it's does a pretty good job of

502
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:23,759
suppressing

503
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:30,120
it so again a closeup of ribbon row and

504
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:34,599
and

505
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:36,439
killed Rye residue and straw malts put

506
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:38,519
on top of that for the first year and

507
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,679
this is a second year planning and you

508
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:43,319
can see the with no hand weeding no

509
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:45,240
cultivation or anything no herbicides

510
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:47,439
the second year the plants look pretty

511
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,839
darn good considering that we didn't do

512
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,558
a whole lot of we didn't have a whole

513
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:53,879
lot of weed input into that so I think

514
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:56,000
that this is something that we can think

515
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,200
about and Growers should consider

516
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,400
particularly as the cost of some of

517
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,240
these materials go up the challenge has

518
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,200
been planting these strawberries into

519
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,200
the killed sod we had to do this by hand

520
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,640
uh we took the times off a rototiller

521
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,840
and left one little Ro one t on there so

522
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,240
we could do a little strip but more

523
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:17,240
recently they have some tools now that

524
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:19,798
actually can cut a Groove into the sod

525
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,120
and then plant noil into these killed

526
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:23,480
sods and it works a lot better than some

527
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:26,119
of the tools we used to have and these

528
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,640
are pretty new pretty expensive but the

529
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:29,479
point is the technology is coming along

530
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,880
that we ought to be able to do this in a

531
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,880
few years without a whole lot of

532
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,919
effort the last strategy I wanted to

533
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,759
mention was interplanted cover crops and

534
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,200
this would be something you do after the

535
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:47,319
strawberries are growing for a couple of

536
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:49,319
years again after harvest you renovate

537
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:51,480
the strawberries you mow off the leaves

538
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:53,000
you cultivate in between the rows and

539
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,519
then again you have this be ground

540
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,440
situation for the rest of the season

541
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:58,319
that you try to keep the weeds out of

542
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,519
and right after renovation you you mow

543
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:02,158
the leaves off you cultivate then the

544
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:05,599
recommendation is to come in and put on

545
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,640
sinbar or Devol or some material to keep

546
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:09,759
the weeds from growing in between the

547
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,600
rows we ask ourselves a question why

548
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,960
can't we plant something between the

549
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:16,918
rows that we'd rather have than a bunch

550
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,558
of weeds and if we plant that crop and

551
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:21,559
it's something that crowds out the weeds

552
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:22,918
but then dies itself it might not be so

553
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:25,440
much of a problem to have something in

554
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:27,559
there that dies off and doesn't allow

555
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,320
weeds to grow so here's a field where we

556
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:33,319
have weat the strawberry plants in an

557
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:35,278
established bed and between the rows of

558
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:37,558
strawberries we planted Sudan

559
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:40,079
grass you plant the Sudan grass after

560
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:43,000
renovation Late July early August it

561
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:45,798
grows up and then in late September

562
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,319
early October it dies because of frosts

563
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:51,440
come so then the following season or

564
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:53,399
actually later on that year you have

565
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,200
these strawberry rows you have a bunch

566
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,798
of dead residue in between them from the

567
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,558
sedan grass but you don't don't have any

568
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:04,400
weeds because the San grass displaced

569
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:07,158
them and in the following spring this

570
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,400
residue disappears over the winter or

571
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:12,520
you mulch the plants anyway with

572
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,320
straw and the following year you have

573
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:17,720
planting that looks just like this you

574
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:21,399
can see the sedan grass residue still

575
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:23,679
here but it's relatively clean from

576
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,519
Weeds so these are some strategies that

577
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,559
we've used to think about managing weeds

578
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:31,599
and strawberries without relying so much

579
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:34,359
on herbicides so just to review uh cover

580
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:36,399
crops or crop rotations to reduce weed

581
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:38,639
pressure before planting we find that

582
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,000
grain crops such as sweet corn are

583
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,000
really good in a rotation because a

584
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,079
couple of reasons one is they have a

585
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
very different growth habitant

586
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,720
strawberries so the weeds that grow

587
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,759
between corn tend to be different than

588
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,159
those that might establish themselves in

589
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:54,839
a perennial broadleaf plant plus you can

590
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,559
use herbicides on corn that aren't

591
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:58,678
labeled for strawberri so you can clean

592
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:00,798
things up pretty well with the corn

593
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,120
before you move into the

594
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:04,278
strawberries so you do a good cover crop

595
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,719
rotation you're ready to plant the

596
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:09,079
strawberries we find that your one or

597
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,839
two applications round up before you

598
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:13,319
plant the strawberries uh works well to

599
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,759
kill the perennial weeds because once

600
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:17,960
you have strawberries established it's

601
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:19,919
very difficult to remove weeds from them

602
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,600
particularly perennial weeds because

603
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,840
strawberries are a broadleaf perennial

604
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,319
plant and most of the weeds we have are

605
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:27,399
broadleaf perennials and there's not a

606
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:28,480
lot of selective products that can

607
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,600
remove

608
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,360
the bad broadleaf weeds and leave the

609
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:35,558
broadleaf plant that you want

610
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:37,158
alone thirdly you know Focus attention

611
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:38,558
early in season if you have limited

612
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:42,440
labor

613
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:44,678
and limited time the best use of that is

614
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,960
to remove those weeds for the first two

615
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:49,120
or three months that the strawberries

616
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,440
have been planted and not later we've

617
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:54,399
also looked at this in the subsequent

618
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,960
years what about managing weeds and

619
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,679
established plantings and we found the

620
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:01,159
same thing that once a plants are

621
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,400
established um you can weeds have very

622
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:06,200
little impact on subsequent yield it

623
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,400
might look bad and it looks like oh

624
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,480
there's lots of weeds in there but the

625
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,798
impact they have on strawberries after

626
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,519
they're established if you can keep the

627
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:14,759
weeds out that first year get the

628
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,639
strawberries in the ground and get them

629
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:19,000
well established you can have weeds come

630
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,000
in and it won't impact your yield unless

631
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,640
you have tremendous weed pressure so

632
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,759
they're really good ones they're

633
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,880
established and then some Alternatives

634
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:27,519
you know planting through those killed

635
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,320
saws I showed you using some of these

636
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:29,839
newer

637
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:31,960
cultivation tools that cultivate

638
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:33,519
shallowly don't compact the soil and

639
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,480
don't bring wheed seeds to the surface

640
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:38,558
they're good and then there's a bunch of

641
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,839
herbicides that work as well and we're

642
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:41,119
going to be talking about those in just

643
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:43,678
one

644
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:46,158
minute also keep the areas mowed around

645
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,240
the plantings don't blow allow weed

646
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,360
seeds to blow into the planting from

647
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,839
Fields uh close by that are producing

648
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:55,000
weed seeds and then this whole concept

649
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:56,759
of using interplanet cover crops

650
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,278
particular with things like Sudan grass

651
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:01,960
or oats things that winter kill I think

652
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:01,960
has a lot of

653
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:07,679
Promise so the question is are you able

654
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,480
to use less straw for winter mulch if

655
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,960
you have Sudan grass inter planted into

656
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:14,038
berries theoretically I think that would

657
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,880
be the case what we found is that the

658
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:20,278
sedan grass actually uh it doesn't hold

659
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,799
up real well uh to the winter and part

660
00:25:20,278 --> 00:25:23,480
of that reason for that is we don't let

661
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:25,839
it get tall so it doesn't get real Woody

662
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,919
and lignified so when you only let it

663
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:30,278
when you plant it in early August and

664
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,278
grows 2 or 3 feet high it's not real

665
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:33,880
Woody so it does break down pretty quick

666
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:37,240
what we found is it really helps hold

667
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:39,559
the straw on the row even though it

668
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,240
might not allow you to get by with less

669
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:43,000
straw it does help hold it on the rose

670
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,069
and keeps it from blowing off when you

671
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,480
do mulch in early

672
00:25:46,069 --> 00:25:51,000
[Music]

673
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,480
December so with that Laura why don't we

674
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,679
put up robins and if anybody else has

675
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,640
any questions for Marvin here while I

676
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:01,798
change things around a bit that would be

677
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,799
this is the time to

678
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,679
ask you're a quiet group today must be

679
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:12,678
Friday

680
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:19,200
okay we got some people typing so okay

681
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,159
hold on I'm doing the same same problem

682
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,159
I had before

683
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,600
I

684
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:29,599
we

685
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:35,158
all right let's get this back where it

686
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:37,798
needs to be uh Robin I'm sorry I don't

687
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:40,640
know why we're in the beginning get you

688
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:44,000
to the beginning there we go all right

689
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,520
um we've got a few people typing uh so

690
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,200
why don't we just give them just a

691
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,000
second and see if there's some questions

692
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,120
for Marvin before I

693
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,960
introduce Robin um I don't know if

694
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:59,599
they're typing a question or if they're

695
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:59,600
talking to each other it's hard to tell

696
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:06,918
okay all right here we go we have a

697
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:09,158
couple of questions um Marvin Jeff Hall

698
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:12,159
asks if renovation would be the same

699
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:12,159
with side ground as

700
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,919
bearr yeah with the sod ground we

701
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:22,038
actually don't have sod between the rose

702
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,559
of strawberries that grass is the Sudan

703
00:27:22,038 --> 00:27:28,319
grass is an annual grass and it's only

704
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:29,720
planted of after July and it's only

705
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,319
growing for a couple of months so it

706
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,399
doesn't really establish the S like you

707
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:35,639
might think of it it actually dies off

708
00:27:33,398 --> 00:27:38,199
and that's why we want it so by the time

709
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,799
fall comes we have you know some residue

710
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,240
on the ground but the sedan grass is not

711
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:45,759
living so it's not the same as saw

712
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,960
ground and uh for small farmers with

713
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:50,000
their crops that would grow well

714
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,480
interspersed within Berry rows I don't

715
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,640
think so for

716
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,759
strawberries uh strawberries are low to

717
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,840
the ground and anytime you uh plant

718
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:01,200
something that PR produces shade

719
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:02,720
strawberries don't like it and you have

720
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,319
the rose planted so close together

721
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,319
anyway at four feet that I don't think

722
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:09,000
it would really make sense to plant

723
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,720
something between strawberry rows now if

724
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,079
you're talking about blueberries and the

725
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,440
blueberries are small uh you might be

726
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:18,439
able to think about that but not for

727
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:23,278
strawberries uh the corn byproduct we

728
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:25,399
used uh a maze uh corn gluten Mill as a

729
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:27,000
pre- merging herbicide we tested that we

730
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:28,079
found out that in strawberries it works

731
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
quite well

732
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:33,278
in a dry year but when it rains a lot

733
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,240
and it's a wet year that corn gluten

734
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:37,079
Mill also has a lot of nitrogen in it

735
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,319
and it actually uh made our weed problem

736
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:41,639
worse so if you can predict the weather

737
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:44,319
you can uh determine if it's good to use

738
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,559
or not but at least um in our situation

739
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:48,839
anytime we had a wet year uh we got more

740
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:51,278
weeds from the fertilizer in the the

741
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:55,480
nitrogen in that product than we did uh

742
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:58,599
when we had a dry year well I could jump

743
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:01,159
in here we do have a link to to Robin's

744
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:03,119
um website that gives sources of those

745
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:05,880
pieces of cultivation equipment and

746
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:08,439
that's on the final portion of this um

747
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,200
webinar so there is a link that Dr

748
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:14,320
belinder has there that you can get some

749
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,319
more information about

750
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:21,079
that uh our experience with different

751
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:23,439
soil types is somewhat limited you know

752
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:26,918
I think stones are more of a problem

753
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,640
than uh soil type in our experience and

754
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:32,519
I will say too that when we were looking

755
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,240
at planting in sort of killed sod uh

756
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:36,640
Sandy soils work a lot better than

757
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:40,720
heavier clay soils Robin do you have any

758
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:44,559
comments on the yeah hold on a

759
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:47,558
sec I can comment on the um brush hose

760
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:47,558
in the different types of

761
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:53,600
soils can you hear me initially when we

762
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:55,398
got the brush hose they came from Europe

763
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,158
and we were told that the guards were

764
00:29:55,398 --> 00:29:59,359
supposed to actually be run one inch in

765
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:01,080
the the soil and you can't do that with

766
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:03,918
Stony soils which we have here at the

767
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:06,079
research farm so we purposely raised the

768
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,038
guards so that they were above the rows

769
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:09,879
by about an inch to an inch and a half

770
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:13,119
which is one of the reasons we get the

771
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,880
dry movement of the dry soil that

772
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:18,000
creates that layer that doesn't let the

773
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,039
weeds emerge through it um so we have

774
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,558
not had any difficulties using this

775
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:26,119
machine on either Stony or eel silt type

776
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:28,558
soils the problem we have run into is

777
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:30,558
that when they're very wet

778
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,639
then the brushes pick up too much of the

779
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:36,000
soil and it's very difficult to clean

780
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,799
them um we have another comment that uh

781
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,200
from Thomas crowy about serum Sudan

782
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:43,960
helps with nematodes and better soil

783
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,798
health and thank you very much Thomas

784
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:50,000
and um there was a question from Brent

785
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:52,398
about of the killed covers are there

786
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
differences in Fruit WRA problems the

787
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:55,000
following

788
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
spring

789
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:07,880
okay uh we the kill covers are their

790
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,159
differences in Fruit rot problems the

791
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,960
following spring not in terms of the

792
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:15,399
fruit rot itself but in the root rots

793
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,519
yeah there's a lot of differences in the

794
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:20,719
pre-plant cover crop how that affects

795
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,038
root pathogens but I'm not aware of we

796
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,278
haven't found anything and I'm not aware

797
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:26,440
of data that show an effect of a

798
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:29,278
pre-plant covered crop on fruit rots the

799
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,960
following spring all right great um

800
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:34,880
we're going to move now into um Dr

801
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:37,399
binder's presentation Dr Robin binder

802
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,159
holds a faculty position with the with

803
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:40,959
Cornell University in the department of

804
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:43,679
horticulture and she focuses her

805
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,840
research and extension programming on WE

806
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:49,159
control in vegetable and fruit and uh

807
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:51,798
we're very happy to have her um she's

808
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:55,440
recently back from a trip to India and

809
00:31:51,798 --> 00:31:55,440
um Dr belinder thank you very

810
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,399
much

811
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:03,319
uh good afternoon I'm pleased to have an

812
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:06,239
opportunity to visit with you

813
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:09,480
um I have to say right up front that I

814
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,278
only picked up fruit in n in

815
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,399
2006 and I have been focusing largely on

816
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:16,839
developing data to support new

817
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:19,439
registrations of herbicides particularly

818
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:21,158
for the planting year of strawberries

819
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,399
and so what I will be showing you today

820
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:24,760
is some of the work that we've been

821
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:26,079
doing and are trying to move into the

822
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:29,079
registration

823
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:29,079
process

824
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:35,759
what you see on the screen is a list of

825
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,038
the ones the herbicides which are pretty

826
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:40,839
much currently registered for

827
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:43,519
strawberries uh prowl H2O was just

828
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:45,240
recently registered in 2007 and so some

829
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,159
of you may not have had much opportunity

830
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,480
to look at that it's currently

831
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,039
registered for a pre-plant

832
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,240
pre-transplant at least one day before

833
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:58,000
transplanting and then subsequently can

834
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:00,558
be used between rows as long as you

835
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,240
leave 35 days before

836
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:05,720
harvest the goal

837
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:08,159
2XL is registered for use in

838
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,600
strawberries but it's a rather strange

839
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:14,080
registration because it only allows use

840
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:16,319
pre-transplant 30 days and only in the

841
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:18,720
very first year it cannot be used

842
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,798
subsequently which makes it somewhat I

843
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,240
think hard to imagine

844
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:25,798
using we are going to as you'll see

845
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,519
later working with the new product gold

846
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:30,839
tender um which is not yet registered in

847
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:32,599
strawberries and that has some other

848
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:34,119
problems associated with registration

849
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:37,158
but we will talk a little bit about that

850
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:39,079
later Chateau is now registered for

851
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:42,159
pre-transplant applications as long as

852
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:44,599
it's going to be done on plastic it can

853
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,000
also be used spring and fall when the

854
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:48,319
plants are

855
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,359
dormant obviously many of you have used

856
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:53,678
de de deanol some of you have used stol

857
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:56,359
and some are i'msure using sinbar it's

858
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,919
been around a long time uh post

859
00:33:56,359 --> 00:34:00,558
emergence 24d has been around forever

860
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:03,480
aim is now registered as a

861
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:07,359
pre-transplant burndown or to row midds

862
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:09,039
using uh protective Shields Stinger is

863
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:11,118
now registered on strawberries which I

864
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:12,679
think presents quite a good combination

865
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,838
of weeds that can be controlled with

866
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:19,559
that and then select also now known as

867
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:21,799
select Max and post can also be used for

868
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:25,279
specifically controlling post emergence

869
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,280
emerged uh grass

870
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:28,878
weeds wrong one

871
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:37,158
we are currently looking at this group

872
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:40,440
of herbicides

873
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:43,039
for applications in new

874
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:46,398
plantings uh dual Magnum any you I'm

875
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:48,320
sure have used in other crops uh reflex

876
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:49,838
has been relatively recently registered

877
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,039
in a number of crops it's a

878
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,599
pre-emergence but it also has resid has

879
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:54,800
residual activity as well as some

880
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,400
postemergence

881
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,880
activity Spartan is a new one which is

882
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,480
currently registered in cabbage uh not

883
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,640
in New York state and I'll talk a little

884
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:08,639
bit more about that later gold tender

885
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:13,358
which is um a flowable formulation as

886
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:16,159
opposed to a EC formulation of the goal

887
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:18,838
and tends to be somewhat less injurious

888
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:20,719
when it's applied post emergence uh it

889
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:22,400
also has somewhat less weed control

890
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,239
because of the same thing but it is

891
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,400
being moved forward

892
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:30,719
slowly caparol is an old product

893
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:33,599
um it's actually labeled on carrots in

894
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:34,959
Canada and we're trying we're awfully

895
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,559
close to getting it registered on

896
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,679
carrots in the US as well it is a

897
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:41,519
triazine and so it has some of the

898
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:44,879
similar type characteristics in terms of

899
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:49,440
weed control as atrazine and as

900
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:52,519
prap Chateau which I have here as a new

901
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,838
evaluation as is already labeled for

902
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:58,358
certain uses uh we're trying to change

903
00:35:54,838 --> 00:36:01,480
the use pattern somewhat on that and

904
00:35:58,358 --> 00:36:02,598
prap is being considered for

905
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,519
registration because it's been

906
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:05,359
registered for many years in Washington

907
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:08,318
and

908
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:10,799
Oregon and now that it's going through a

909
00:36:08,318 --> 00:36:12,519
re-registration process the company has

910
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,318
indicated that we can move forward with

911
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:16,480
trying to get it used in other parts of

912
00:36:14,318 --> 00:36:16,480
the

913
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:22,440
country this will just give you a couple

914
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:25,000
of birds eye views of some of these

915
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,720
things uh this is a trial that we

916
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,920
actually planted in 200

917
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:32,879
eight and the data I'm going to show you

918
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,440
from that are from that trial um you can

919
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,960
tell what our weed pressures are like

920
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,599
you can hardly see the

921
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,000
strawberries and prowl H2O does a pretty

922
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:44,240
nice job at least initially it doesn't

923
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,318
last the full season but it does a very

924
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:49,598
good job initially and it does not hurt

925
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:51,960
the strawberry plants these are applied

926
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:55,079
the day before

927
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:57,639
transplanting here is the Dual Magnum

928
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:59,519
and we've got three separate rates there

929
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:01,799
and I have to say these were applied the

930
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:04,880
day after transplanting and you can see

931
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,440
we have pretty good weed control um we

932
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,800
did see a little bit of injury at the

933
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:12,880
highest rate but it did not last

934
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:15,160
long unfortunately in a year like 2009

935
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,838
when we repeated this but we put it on

936
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:20,318
pre-transplant and had huge rain events

937
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:23,000
very shortly after planting we did see

938
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:24,838
some significant stunting with the duel

939
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,719
and so one has to be a little cautious

940
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:28,400
as we go forward with creating the right

941
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:30,000
information for the companies to put the

942
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,680
information on the labels that there are

943
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,159
certain times and certain occasions when

944
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:35,159
there's likely to be more injury than

945
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:44,119
others um this is PRP however I have a

946
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,720
correction to make on this one I

947
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:49,039
didn't get to this before we sent it to

948
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:51,358
Laura so she couldn't change it the one

949
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:53,800
on the far right where it says PRP three

950
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:57,119
times at 0.1 pounds active ingredient

951
00:37:53,800 --> 00:38:01,519
per acre is in fact not PRP it is sybar

952
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:03,800
bar um the one on the left is the

953
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:06,119
application rate which is currently used

954
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,960
in Washington and Oregon and it's

955
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:11,318
usually put on either 30 days

956
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,920
pre-transplant or some people are

957
00:38:11,318 --> 00:38:16,519
putting it on in the fall again to

958
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,880
dormant in that case we did see a little

959
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:20,000
bit of early injury with this but really

960
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,318
not

961
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,159
significant a colleague of mine um Brad

962
00:38:23,318 --> 00:38:27,318
majek in New Jersey who many of you I'm

963
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:29,759
sure know has suggested Ed that a better

964
00:38:27,318 --> 00:38:32,279
way to do this is to apply PRP at three

965
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,680
separate times roughly two weeks apart

966
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,079
post transplant and as you can see in

967
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,598
this picture there is somewhat less

968
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,039
stunting in this we had almost no

969
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,800
stunting with this particular

970
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:44,159
application the

971
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:47,920
sinbar applied at three separate

972
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:49,719
occasions which I understand from Marvin

973
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,599
is done routinely in

974
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:54,078
Canada in our particular case did not

975
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:57,680
cause as much in the way of injury but

976
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:59,720
we also had grasp control problems and

977
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:02,000
it may be that the rate that that's used

978
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:04,679
at is a little bit marginal with regard

979
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,679
to controlling

980
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,720
grasses this is

981
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:13,078
Chateau on the on the right you have the

982
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:14,559
traditional application of 3 ounces

983
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:18,200
applied 30 days

984
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:19,318
pre-transplant and in 2008 we had quite

985
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:21,919
a bit of

986
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:24,358
rain and I would have to say that that

987
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,880
3o rate even 30 days prior to

988
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:29,239
transplanting caused as you can see

989
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:31,480
there sign ific injury applied one day

990
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:33,919
pre-transplant at onethird of the rate

991
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,920
you can see that we have very little in

992
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,519
the way of crop injury and we have

993
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,519
excellent weed control with both of

994
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:48,078
them here are on the left is reflex

995
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,639
reflex has a lot of potential for both

996
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,640
pre and particularly in strawberri

997
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:54,199
pre-emergence activity on a lot of

998
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:56,598
troublesome broadleaf

999
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:59,399
weeds however it can only be applied

1000
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:01,119
prior to transplanting and subsequent

1001
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,838
years it would have to be applied to

1002
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,838
dormant plants because its postemergence

1003
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:09,039
activity causes too much injury for the

1004
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:12,759
crop the goal tender which is the

1005
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:14,559
slightly safer version of go 2XL did a

1006
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:18,839
pretty nice job and we do see some

1007
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:18,838
injury in this but overall it's not too

1008
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:25,440
bad we also tried some rather strange

1009
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:27,559
off-the-wall new things kicks Sor is a

1010
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,200
product that is being marketed by

1011
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:32,039
BASF and at this point they're not

1012
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:34,239
particularly interested in strawberries

1013
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:36,079
but what we did find is that applied

1014
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:38,838
pre-transplant in strawberries it

1015
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,760
actually does no harm at all to the

1016
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:44,119
berries it unfortunately has actually no

1017
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,359
activity on grasses and that's what you

1018
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:48,119
see there is

1019
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:52,039
grasses bandor in the middle is a

1020
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:54,800
product used in Europe on other

1021
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:57,000
crops and even though kior and bandor

1022
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,000
are of the same mode of action in terms

1023
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,960
of killing weeds you can see that they

1024
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,519
have very different behaviors in terms

1025
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,519
of their sensitivity or their

1026
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:06,679
phytotoxicity because band actually

1027
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:08,599
totally killed the

1028
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:10,159
strawberries and then lastly I

1029
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:12,800
occasionally throw in things that I use

1030
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:17,000
in other crops just for fun and so you

1031
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,960
have lorox on the far right and in 2008

1032
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,480
you can see there's no injury and really

1033
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:26,800
nice weed control um this was applied U

1034
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,800
immediately pre-transplant day before in

1035
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,280
2009 however because as I mentioned

1036
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,359
earlier with the Dual Magnum uh because

1037
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,519
we got a lot of rain shortly after the

1038
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:40,318
transplanting we did see more injury

1039
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:40,318
this year with the lorox than we did in

1040
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,358
2008 now this is one of two data

1041
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:52,000
tables is it on okay what I basically

1042
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:56,679
want to show you with this one is hand

1043
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:00,239
weeding time over here oh this is the

1044
00:41:56,679 --> 00:42:03,279
hand weeding time this whole column and

1045
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:05,479
what you should see here is that for

1046
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,519
example although we had very little in

1047
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:11,519
the way of injury here with the jewel

1048
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:14,119
with the prowl we did have relatively

1049
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:17,000
poor over the Long Haul weed control and

1050
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:20,200
as a result your hand weeding time is

1051
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,679
quite high sbar on the other hand as I

1052
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:24,679
mentioned where we had virtually no

1053
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:26,719
injury at all with those three

1054
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:28,039
applications we didn't also have very

1055
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:29,639
good weed control and so although we

1056
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:32,920
have somewhat better weed control than

1057
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:35,400
with prow by itself um shouldn't do it

1058
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:37,559
that way I should do it out here okay we

1059
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,000
do still have an appreciable amount of

1060
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:43,760
time in terms of hand

1061
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:45,480
weeding the prinet which had

1062
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,640
initial

1063
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:50,159
injury we begin to see better weed

1064
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:52,920
control and now the weeding time comes

1065
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:55,239
down and Chateau which has the absolute

1066
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,039
shortest weeding time very very little

1067
00:42:55,239 --> 00:43:00,838
time it took because it was so good even

1068
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:03,079
the three days application or the the

1069
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:04,358
here it is the three times application

1070
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:07,240
no I'm sorry the one day before

1071
00:43:04,358 --> 00:43:09,558
application here we still have excellent

1072
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:11,279
weed control and very very little and

1073
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:13,880
keeping in mind this is the first year

1074
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,720
so this is a nonfruiting year so we're

1075
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,318
getting extremely good weed control and

1076
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:20,480
the Hand weeding time as I said Has Come

1077
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:23,079
way down you have it it's with the Dual

1078
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,800
Magnum you had again initial injury

1079
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:28,280
relatively slight overall pretty good

1080
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,880
weed control with all of

1081
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,359
these and the weed control hand weeding

1082
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,358
time

1083
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:37,279
is intermediate let's call it that way

1084
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:39,480
but still not too

1085
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,519
bad

1086
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:45,280
reflex again we have very little in the

1087
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:46,880
way of injury good weed control except

1088
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,200
for crab grass because it doesn't

1089
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,599
control the grasses but the hand weeding

1090
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:52,919
time is not

1091
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:55,599
bad and then of

1092
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:58,720
course kicks or which had very little in

1093
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,240
the way of inj iny had relatively poor

1094
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:03,039
weed control and so our hand weeding

1095
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:05,799
time was back up with that

1096
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:09,279
one we move to our next data slide which

1097
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:12,240
is this last one this is yield data that

1098
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:16,040
was collected in 2007 from a trans

1099
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:19,799
planting trial in

1100
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:22,239
2006 and I have to say that it was our

1101
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,559
first time hand harvesting

1102
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:27,719
strawberries and it took

1103
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:30,640
forever I had Meer Marvin for all of the

1104
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:32,919
work he's doing in strawberries you

1105
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:34,639
couldn't oh it was amazing the crew was

1106
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,838
real real concerned about the amount of

1107
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:37,799
time we spent hand weeding or

1108
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:40,159
handpicking the strawberries so the

1109
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,640
yields I felt were relatively

1110
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:46,480
variable both in terms

1111
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:48,118
of numbers of Runners per plant as well

1112
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,599
as the yields they're highly variable

1113
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:52,720
the significance level is not

1114
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:57,440
particularly strong there are some

1115
00:44:52,719 --> 00:45:00,959
Trends in the sense that um here

1116
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,960
Chateau and gender you did see

1117
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,519
particularly with Chateau a slight

1118
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,559
reduction in the number of Runners and

1119
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:09,000
also a reduction in the pounds and this

1120
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:11,960
was with the case of

1121
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,679
Jewel uh we also saw here significant

1122
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:17,480
injury with this and we also saw a

1123
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:18,879
reduction in the number of of the yields

1124
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:22,318
per 20

1125
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:25,920
meters uh with early glow

1126
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:28,838
again overall the trends are not as no

1127
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:32,559
noticeable this one with the gold tender

1128
00:45:28,838 --> 00:45:35,039
you do see a slight reduction in terms

1129
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:35,040
of total

1130
00:45:40,358 --> 00:45:44,759
yields so then looking at the idea of

1131
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:49,358
where some of these might fit into your

1132
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:51,280
current practices uh PRL h2o at the top

1133
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:54,039
is particularly good in controlling the

1134
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,599
annual grasses it does also pick up

1135
00:45:54,039 --> 00:46:00,599
mustards percane and pigweed

1136
00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:02,200
species um if you have I don't see this

1137
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,440
very often in Strawberry Fields but

1138
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:06,759
Velvet Leaf is suppressed by it uh as is

1139
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,960
Lamb's

1140
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:11,280
quarters Spartan which I haven't

1141
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:15,679
mentioned much up until

1142
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:18,880
now is largely a broadleaf

1143
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:21,639
weed um herbicide it's used pre-plant

1144
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:24,838
plant and it can also be used in dormant

1145
00:46:21,639 --> 00:46:26,440
crops um for those of you from other

1146
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:28,318
parts of the country that are not in New

1147
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:31,358
York state you may see this registered

1148
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:33,400
already or it will be registered soon

1149
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:35,960
the New York Department of Environmental

1150
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:37,838
Conservation or the dec has had some

1151
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:41,480
problems with FMC because they're not

1152
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:43,318
happy with water tests and as a result

1153
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:45,280
FMC has not gone forward with

1154
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:49,000
registering it yet in New York state so

1155
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:52,720
that remains a little bit up in the air

1156
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,800
Chateau um we would like to see it its

1157
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:57,558
rate reduced so that we could use it the

1158
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:00,760
the day before transplanting as opposed

1159
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:02,319
to waiting for the 30 days um I also

1160
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,079
would like to go back and revisit with

1161
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:05,480
the company why they've got the plastic

1162
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,440
on there because I think we can do it

1163
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:11,480
with things without

1164
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:14,400
plastic reflex as I mentioned um will be

1165
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:17,000
good pre-transplant and subsequently in

1166
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:20,079
other in later years could be used as a

1167
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,719
dormant application is extremely good in

1168
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,839
controlling several very difficult

1169
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:27,639
broadleaf weeds particularly Ragweed

1170
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:29,039
mustards Pig weeds and then dual Magnum

1171
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:31,960
we've been trying to get that registered

1172
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:34,400
off and on for some time uh particularly

1173
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:37,280
because it controls nutsedge annual

1174
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:40,160
grasses gallon SOA it also does a good

1175
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,760
job on Pig weeds suppresses nightshades

1176
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:42,759
and purc

1177
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:52,400
Lane current registration status we have

1178
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:55,079
done the residues for getting prep

1179
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,920
registered and those will be doing going

1180
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:59,000
through analysis this coming year so we

1181
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:02,119
expect registration on that in

1182
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,318
2012 dual Magnum the 2008 trials are

1183
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:06,680
complete the res residue trials have

1184
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:09,079
been done and we expect registration for

1185
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:09,078
that in

1186
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,599
2011 with that I'd like to conclude if

1187
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:21,799
there are questions even there are a

1188
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:24,480
couple of things Robin um Kristen callow

1189
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:27,640
asks what what is the active ingredient

1190
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,639
and reflex

1191
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:36,119
okay the active ingredient in reflex is

1192
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:39,440
fopen in Canada it's called

1193
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:43,079
Flexar uh it is a poo

1194
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:46,200
inhibitor it's related to Blazer okay

1195
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:48,039
CRA hopefully that answers your question

1196
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:50,199
um there's a question about the hand

1197
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:52,558
weeding times whether or not that is on

1198
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:54,598
a per acre basis but I think it's

1199
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:57,359
actually on a smaller

1200
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:59,240
basis

1201
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:02,279
it's on a it's on a plot basis that's

1202
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:05,318
120 squet is wondering if D Magnum will

1203
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,319
have activity on

1204
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:12,920
henbit I have very little experience

1205
00:49:10,798 --> 00:49:15,880
with henbit my guess is that it will not

1206
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:18,159
have much activity on it okay great now

1207
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:21,599
does anybody else have any questions for

1208
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:21,598
either Marvin or

1209
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,559
Robin it's kind of quiet there's

1210
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:31,119
somebody typing here and I'll wait for

1211
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:33,079
Brent to finish typing and then we'll if

1212
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:37,559
nobody else has any questions we'll move

1213
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:40,039
into the next um phase the final phase

1214
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:40,040
of the

1215
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:48,559
program don't be nervous gr we're

1216
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:58,720
we're um Brent is actually asking me how

1217
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:01,079
does soil organic matter affect activity

1218
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:02,838
of some of these herbicides I know it's

1219
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:08,240
a factor with

1220
00:50:02,838 --> 00:50:08,239
sinbar and can uh Robin can you address

1221
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,838
that

1222
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:15,719
the the higher the amount of organic

1223
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:18,199
matter the more particulates there are

1224
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:20,719
in the soil that the herbicides can bind

1225
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:23,358
to and so that's why frequently you will

1226
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:25,919
see on labels restrictions that if you

1227
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:27,279
have mck soils you can't use certain

1228
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,440
products and the reason is because you

1229
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,760
either have to increase the rate

1230
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,440
significantly or in order to get above

1231
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,960
the level that's being bound up in the

1232
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,559
soil so yes the higher the organic

1233
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:39,679
matter the more the herbicides

1234
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:43,280
particularly this pertains to soil

1235
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:45,399
applied residual herbicides right great

1236
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:48,559
so the more you have the higher the more

1237
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:51,358
that will be bound up yes okay okay then

1238
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:54,440
question about go ahead there's a

1239
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:58,400
question about queenan's

1240
00:50:54,440 --> 00:51:01,920
Lays yes does anybody have any I don't

1241
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:04,920
know actually I'm not sure what would do

1242
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,920
a good job on that

1243
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:10,639
either Marvin's shaking his head too

1244
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:14,440
neither one of us has much background

1245
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:16,598
with that um yeah a it's a a it's a

1246
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:18,760
perennial um Brent also is asking he

1247
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:21,760
says I'm thinking of very low soil

1248
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:23,000
organic matter situations where sinbar

1249
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,000
injures

1250
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:29,599
strawberries so if in in fact there is a

1251
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,358
really low organic matter would you ad

1252
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:34,318
could you adjust the rate of sinbar

1253
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:34,318
appropriately for

1254
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:42,399
that technically yes if you're talking

1255
00:51:39,798 --> 00:51:44,920
very Sandy soils most labels divide up

1256
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,720
their rates on the basis of soils and

1257
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,599
they will have a sandy soil a medium

1258
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:50,919
soil and a mck soil or a high organic

1259
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:52,798
matter soil and those rates are usually

1260
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,920
adjusted to that but yes you could do

1261
00:51:52,798 --> 00:51:57,079
that and then if you can see those other

1262
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:00,639
questions there's a question about um

1263
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:00,640
postemergence control of

1264
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:06,920
chickweed uh my answer on that is

1265
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:09,558
potentially

1266
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:11,639
Stinger actually I think I did talk to a

1267
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:13,559
grower this year that had um very good

1268
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:15,798
luck with stinger on

1269
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:17,319
chickweed I was going to suggest that's

1270
00:52:15,798 --> 00:52:20,280
probably one of the better ones at this

1271
00:52:17,318 --> 00:52:22,599
point and then there's um soil PH

1272
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:26,760
affecting herbicide

1273
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:30,359
activity I don't know about that soil

1274
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:32,280
pH I don't think I know do you do Marvin

1275
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:36,679
do you have any ideas on that I've I

1276
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:36,680
mean the pH of the mix water would

1277
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:41,199
but

1278
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:48,079
answer uh Marvin is suggesting that the

1279
00:52:45,798 --> 00:52:50,000
pH might have an impact on microbial

1280
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:51,880
breakdown activities and that's why it

1281
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,798
might indirectly have an effect on the

1282
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:57,079
herbicides okay um we've got another

1283
00:52:54,798 --> 00:53:00,400
question and we really got them going

1284
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:02,359
here um I am contemplating planting

1285
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,880
strawberries on lamps and sand mixed

1286
00:53:02,358 --> 00:53:08,519
with Palms mck ground that I have grown

1287
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:13,400
sweet corn on for several years W PRP

1288
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:13,400
and arrine herbicide residues affect

1289
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:21,039
this so this is Marvin so on uh if

1290
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:23,679
you're growing corn and you've used

1291
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:24,920
atrazine and Prat before a real good way

1292
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:26,440
to see whether it would be a problem

1293
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:29,318
would be do do a

1294
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:31,200
bioassay and you can use a couple of

1295
00:53:29,318 --> 00:53:33,440
things and but for strawberries you know

1296
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:36,480
bean seeds are a pretty good indicator

1297
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:39,960
if it cucumber seeds uh either one of

1298
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,679
those so you get your soil and you plant

1299
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,480
your cucumber your bean seeds in that

1300
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:44,879
soil and then you get some soil that you

1301
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,519
know you haven't treated that's kind of

1302
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,200
like the same soil type and plant the

1303
00:53:46,519 --> 00:53:51,599
same Bean or cucumber seeds in that and

1304
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:53,318
then uh bring it into your kitchen and

1305
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:55,119
put it in the window SE and let it grow

1306
00:53:53,318 --> 00:53:56,838
and if you see differences between

1307
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,079
between the two that might indicate that

1308
00:53:56,838 --> 00:54:00,798
there's some residue in the soil that

1309
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:03,039
might affect your strawberries but if

1310
00:54:00,798 --> 00:54:05,119
the both grow the same and everything

1311
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:07,239
looks normal you don't see yellowing and

1312
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:10,640
so forth then it's probably safe to

1313
00:54:07,239 --> 00:54:12,919
plant but yeah atrazine uh can carry

1314
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:15,078
over as can prin up so you have to be a

1315
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:17,358
little bit careful about that all right

1316
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:21,640
great Mario has a qu a question about

1317
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:21,639
using prow and dual Magnum for the first

1318
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:30,159
year the current registration effort for

1319
00:54:27,719 --> 00:54:32,558
dual Magnum is not focused on the year

1320
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:34,239
of planting however I don't see us

1321
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,960
having a problem with trying to get that

1322
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:39,439
changed for the registration when we

1323
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:41,480
actually get to it um both prow and dual

1324
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,639
Magnum have good potential in the first

1325
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,838
year in terms of safety on the

1326
00:54:43,639 --> 00:54:47,598
strawberries uh I think you would select

1327
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:49,159
them more on the basis of which weeds

1328
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:50,960
you knew had in the field because they

1329
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:52,920
do behave somewhat

1330
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,400
differently all right great and then

1331
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:58,200
Thomas prowdy has a um comment that soil

1332
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:59,400
PH will affect triazine herbicides and

1333
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:02,719
thank you

1334
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:04,559
Thomas and then Kristen callow um asks

1335
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:06,759
if these presentations will be available

1336
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:09,440
on the Cornell website and yes they will

1337
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:12,839
be and the link to that was on the first

1338
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:15,960
page and um I think I've included that

1339
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:18,239
link as well on all of the login

1340
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:21,920
information and if not I will try to do

1341
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:25,679
that for further uh webinars let's move

1342
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:27,798
into the Final Phase of this which uh

1343
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:32,598
does allow you to look at some of the

1344

00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:48,399
publication from atra on organic

1350
00:55:45,639 --> 00:55:51,879
strawberry production which might be uh

1351
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:54,480
of interest to some folks also there are

1352

question if you've got it right in that

1397
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:11,960
chat box we'd love to hear from

1398
00:58:23,719 --> 00:58:26,719
you

1399
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:35,159
all right we've had uh got about 10 more

1400
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:35,160
people that might want to

1401
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:46,559
vote um while we're having people finish

1402
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:50,039
up we have um a question from Lynette uh

1403
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:52,680
who's looking for control for horse

1404
00:58:50,039 --> 00:58:54,880
metal and I don't know if Marvin or

1405
00:58:52,679 --> 00:58:58,480
Robin if you'd like to CH can you hear

1406
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:00,480
us okay so we're not really sure of a we

1407
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,240
were talking about the horse nle issue

1408
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,119
we're not really sure of a label product

1409
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:05,199
that works well on horse N I think for a

1410
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:09,318
lot of

1411
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:10,519
those like the wild carrot and horse n

1412
00:59:09,318 --> 00:59:13,119
all you really got to clean them up

1413
00:59:10,519 --> 00:59:14,599
before you plant strawberries cuz once

1414
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:16,880
you plant it's really you're really

1415
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:18,440
limited on what you can do after that

1416
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,640
and then in ter uh someone commented

1417
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,000
they can grow strawberries in between

1418
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:23,038
blueberry beds for the first four or

1419
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,719
five years sure and we mentioned that

1420
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:27,319
earlier that on uh with more space in

1421
00:59:25,719 --> 00:59:29,399
between them particularly things like

1422
00:59:27,318 --> 00:59:30,558
blueberries you can't intercrop the only

1423
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:33,200
thing I would say you have to be careful

1424
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:35,798
with there is pH strawberries prefer a

1425
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:37,439
higher pH in blueberry so uh you might

1426
00:59:35,798 --> 00:59:40,639
have to pay close attention to making

1427
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:43,200
sure that the pH isn't too low for those

1428
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:45,598
strawberries and the horse tail

1429
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:48,480
equisetum uh none of us know what you

1430
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:51,599
can do about that even Roundup doesn't

1431
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:53,079
take that out before planting so I think

1432
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:55,119
if you have horse tail you might just

1433
00:59:53,079 --> 00:59:56,720
not want to plant that field to a low

1434
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:58,720
growing crop like strawberries and look

1435
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:00,558
someplace else because you know save

1436
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:02,239
that f for corn or something that grows

1437
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:04,160
taller you're just not going to get the

1438
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:06,318
hsea out with I don't know of anything

1439
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:09,399
that works well on that that would even

1440
01:00:06,318 --> 01:00:09,400
that wouldn't harm the strawberry

1441
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:17,760
plants all right um I've got uh Richard

1442
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:19,838
fars typing in a quick question couple

1443
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:22,640
more things uh if you haven't voted on

1444
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:23,558
our final poll please please give us

1445
01:00:22,639 --> 01:00:26,558
some

1446
01:00:23,559 --> 01:00:29,319
feedback and if you also if you would

1447
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:31,798
like to uh send me a note or give me a

1448
01:00:29,318 --> 01:00:33,719
call email me something if you have

1449
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:36,559
specific comments that you'd rather not

1450
01:00:33,719 --> 01:00:38,480
type into the chat bar uh we're a third

1451
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:40,319
of the way through these webinar series

1452
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:42,880
and I would be really thrilled to hear

1453
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:46,159
from attendees if they have some

1454
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:48,559
suggestions for ways we can approve um

1455
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:50,480
even other topics that in the future

1456
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:53,280
you'd like to see covered in a webinar

1457
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:55,679
type of format or things that you

1458
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:57,599
absolutely hate about it we we need to

1459
01:00:55,679 --> 01:01:00,279
hear them all so don't hesitate to give

1460
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:01,880
usack last question someone asked about

1461
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:04,119
home Gardener suggestions I think a lot

1462
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:06,280
of the things we talked about early on

1463
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:08,358
in a presentation were appropriate for

1464
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:11,400
organic Growers if you were referring to

1465
01:01:08,358 --> 01:01:13,358
herbicides for organic Growers uh

1466
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:15,559
vinegar is going to be labeled pretty

1467
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:17,358
soon as that's going to be labeled on a

1468
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:20,280
lot of different crops that has burned

1469
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:21,798
down action it's an organic product and

1470
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,519
I imagine strawberries will be on that

1471
01:01:21,798 --> 01:01:25,880
label where you can use it between the

1472
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:28,838
rows particularly to burn down uh annual

1473
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:30,960
weed that start to come up it's a a safe

1474
01:01:28,838 --> 01:01:33,519
organic product for use on strawberries

1475
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,519
and a lot of other

1476
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:42,720
crops all right I'm going to close our

1477
01:01:38,838 --> 01:01:45,759
poll um I think shiaka county is still

1478
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:47,879
typing I what can you tell us about

1479
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:50,480
different formulations for 24d is there

1480
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:52,440
such a thing as imen and

1481
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:54,119
formulations around it comes with

1482
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:58,480
different formulations you're referring

1483
01:01:54,119 --> 01:02:01,160
to 24d amine am i n e and that's a salt

1484
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:03,559
product of 24d and it's not nearly as

1485
01:02:01,159 --> 01:02:05,078
volatile as some of the other 24d

1486
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:08,798
products in other words it doesn't

1487
01:02:05,079 --> 01:02:11,359
vaporize and move as much so that's the

1488
01:02:08,798 --> 01:02:13,759
type that's recommended for strawberries

1489
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:16,078
but having said that it can still uh

1490
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,559
volatilize and move so you wouldn't want

1491
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:21,119
to put it on strawberries if you were

1492
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:23,680
near grapes because um even in using 24

1493
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:26,119
damine salt you can smell it shortly

1494
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:29,239
after that and Growers have had problems

1495
01:02:26,119 --> 01:02:32,559
uh that had grapes nearby uh so you want

1496
01:02:29,239 --> 01:02:34,199
to be careful about that in fact out in

1497
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:35,720
the midwest they've had a real hard time

1498
01:02:34,199 --> 01:02:38,159
getting their grape industry started

1499
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:40,719
because they use so much 24d on wheat

1500
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:42,440
fields and and even some corn fields

1501
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:44,759
it's a cheap herbicide and it's really

1502
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:47,200
caused problems with the wine industry

1503
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:48,920
out there so yeah be careful with it but

1504
01:02:47,199 --> 01:02:52,879
if you do use it on strawberries it's

1505
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:54,440
one of the few broadleaf uh herbicides

1506
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,599
that don't affect strawberries which or

1507
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:57,838
a broadleaf

1508
01:02:55,599 --> 01:03:00,798
plant but be careful if you have grapes

1509
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:03,199
or asparagus um uh growing around your

1510
01:03:00,798 --> 01:03:03,199
strawberry

1511
01:03:04,278 --> 01:03:09,519
field

1512
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:11,880

1513
