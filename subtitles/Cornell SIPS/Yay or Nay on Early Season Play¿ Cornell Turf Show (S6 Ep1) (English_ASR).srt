1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,240
This is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:07,278
University.

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:11,039
Welcome everybody to our sixth year, huh

4
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:13,519
Carl, of of Howling at the Moon uh as we

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,599
started out early on uh in the pandemic

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,039
days. And you know, we do it for a very

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,278
short period of time and now it's

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,199
starting to come together in clippings

9
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,039
podcasts. So, if those of you I haven't

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,480
really I'll draw attention to this some

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,240
other time, but uh for those of you that

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,560
uh are interested in listening to some

13
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,479
of the podcasts that we've taken from

14
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,719
the show over the years, we've got an

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,439
ACE undergrad communication specialist,

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,679
Jake Sakowski, who's turning our

17
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,320
previous shows into little snippets or

18
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:44,399
clippings uh of really informative

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,920
stuff. So, hopefully you'll uh pay

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,679
attention to that. And I think Carl

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,679
promoted it through the email just a

22
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,519
couple of weeks ago. Okay, without any

23
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,198
further

24
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,800
ado, I think opening day should be a

25
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,799
national holiday. Carl, what do you

26
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,038
think? And of course, the Yanks and even

27
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,198
the Red Sox are tied for first place.

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,800
Hopefully, it's the last time uh that

29
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,640
happens. I've got to put up with with

30
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,319
Red Sox fans, but you know, the the

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,519
grass is green, the ball's flying

32
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:12,639
around. Uh and now till October, it's

33
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:15,280
every day. I just love it. Carl hates

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,519
this. Okay, so let me get my uh let me

35
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,920
get my cursor. And in in light of that,

36
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,679
Greg Chvervis and the guys at Soerties

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,920
already at it getting those infields

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,439
ready. Big differences between upstate

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,640
and downstate. And we'll talk about the

40
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:30,879
weather uh as we get going. Um but for

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,000
sure, you know, working these infields,

42
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,438
this is why a lot of fields have become

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,118
synthetic because you got to have people

44
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:38,719
who know what they're doing getting the

45
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:41,519
clay ready this time of year. And this

46
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:44,959
is why Greg's facility hosts so many

47
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:47,438
games, so many op so many tournaments is

48
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:49,759
is the envy of communities far and wide

49
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:52,000
and something you just don't see as much

50
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,399
anymore with this deep commitment to

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,239
baseball uh in particular. And of

52
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,879
course, it's a multi-use facility. But

53
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:01,199
big shout out to Greg and the guys in so

54
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,879
at canteen memorial that have been good

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,118
supporters of the show over the years.

56
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,399
And Carl, without any further ado, I

57
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,399
know you're going to take a different

58
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,399
tack today, but as I said earlier, you

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,120
were con you were con you were a

60
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,840
convivial uh pleasant guy hanging out

61
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,759
with Dave Hicks, winning your uh mid-

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,840
amateur championship a number of years

63
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,959
ago, and I know you've got something to

64
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,120
say about people in general today. Yeah,

65
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,878
we're going to talk about golfers. Um,

66
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,200
you know, I I we're going to talk so

67
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,878
much about uh sort of evidence-based

68
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,039
turf management, best management

69
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,399
practices, what the science tells us.

70
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,318
We're going to spend all these these

71
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,840
next 10 weeks talking about that. And I

72
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,280
sort of put this uh you know, it's a

73
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,759
little bit facicious, but does it even

74
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,840
matter that we can produce good grass or

75
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,000
bad grass sometimes? Uh, you know, this

76
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,680
is an example for those watching. If we

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,280
fertilize this, in this case, it's

78
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,719
perennial ryrass in Wisconsin. If we

79
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,318
fertilize it a little bit, we get less

80
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,239
weeds. Great. We know how to do things

81
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,639
really efficiently. Maybe you don't have

82
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,640
to use herbicides as much, but uh the

83
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,439
product or the grass sometimes does not

84
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,279
equal what the person using the grass

85
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,680
feels as their experience, right? And

86
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,280
and this is most known in in golf

87
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,640
courses. A person is going to play a

88
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,519
golf course. It's not just how good the

89
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,799
golf course is, it's the customer

90
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:14,239
experience. And we looked at this a long

91
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,159
time ago with our New York State Park

92
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,000
golf courses. Uh this was not an

93
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,759
efficient way to do this research. I

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,878
went through thousands of online

95
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:25,519
reviews, Google reviews, Facebook, Yelp,

96
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,598
Golf Advisor, and I would manually input

97
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,200
how many stars the review gave it. And

98
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:30,399
if there were comments, I would keep

99
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,399
those comments, and then I would sort of

100
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,680
categorize them, especially poor

101
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,200
reviews. Okay. What were they saying

102
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,680
about the golf course that they didn't

103
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,399
like? And we could basically bucket them

104
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,159
into four categories. I wor conditions.

105
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,599
Yeah. No, you're good. And a pace of

106
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:44,878
play, right? Golfers want to play really

107
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,359
fast. If it's really slow, they don't

108
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,280
like that. amenities, things like is

109
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,799
there water to drink on the golf course,

110
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,239
are there bathrooms, and then customer

111
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:57,280
service, and we did not expect what we

112
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,480
found, uh, which was that over 50% of

113
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,959
the reviews, 51% uh, of poor reviews

114
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,759
mentioned bad customer service as the

115
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,080
reason they had a poor time. And I think

116
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,239
this review just uh, encapsulates it so

117
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,239
well at one of the State Park courses.

118
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,719
When you check in, it's got a DMV feel

119
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,040
with attitudes to match. That's not

120
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:19,600
great. You'll then go to a starter who's

121
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,720
as friendly as shingles. Okay. Where

122
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,160
we're 0 for two. Uh after the TSA like

123
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,479
procedure to begin your round, you'll

124
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,080
have a rectal exam. Once you're on the

125
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:29,599
course, it's great. You'll soon forget

126
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,519
about it all. And this was a poor review

127
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,680
that says, "Hey, the grass was really

128
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,319
good. The product was really good. And I

129
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,478
gave it two out of five stars because I

130
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,800
spent five hours there, but my five

131
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,639
minutes interacting with people somehow

132
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,680
screwed that up." And and that's really

133
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,400
frustrating. I think for the

134
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,840
superintendent listening probably is is

135
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,159
a relatable experience. And and this

136
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,159
isn't just state parks. Th this is

137
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,479
pretty much true. Like whenever we say

138
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,560
this to people or I make this comment,

139
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,879
Carl, in a meeting, everybody's head

140
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,439
starts nodding and they say, here's what

141
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,360
they said to us last week. People in the

142
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,759
front of the house don't start out like

143
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,439
this. Golfers do this to them. This is

144
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,840
what they said. Remember? All right. But

145
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,439
it's not just golfers. It It turns out

146
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,119
this is not just golf. And and I'm going

147
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,399
to highlight Maggie Ryder's blog post

148
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,879
here. Maggie's doing some really cool

149
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,560
blog posts, not just lawn and landscape,

150
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,038
but also some sports turf stuff. I'm

151
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,360
sure she'll do golf stuff. She did a uh

152
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,038
she she built a code that did this all

153
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,840
for her. So she scraped all these

154
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:30,319
reviews from a Austin, Texas landscaping

155
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,839
company, one company. She did sentiment

156
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,279
analysis. So the code looks through all

157
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,679
the words and the comments and sort of

158
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:38,319
groups them into these categories. In

159
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,199
the positive reviews for this company,

160
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:43,439
uh 66% of the time, the most often cited

161
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,038
topic for for a good review was

162
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,959
professionalism. The tech the

163
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,519
technicians were polite, professional,

164
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:52,079
and friendly. That was the number one uh

165
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,000
often cited thing in a review. When you

166
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,918
go to the negative reviews, uh that's

167
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,639
when you start to see the the poor

168
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,079
results showed up. So 64% said, "The

169
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,918
reason I'm giving it a poor review is

170
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,279
because I didn't get results." But if

171
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,680
you look at all the other things on this

172
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,119
list, Frank, 39% of the time missing

173
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,000
appointments, that was why they didn't

174
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,879
have a good experience. Billing 23% of

175
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,120
the time sales price. So this is also

176
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,279
saying like, hey, sometimes good reviews

177
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,639
can be driven by customer service. And

178
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,879
that's the interesting thing here is you

179
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,360
might not pro provide the best product,

180
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:26,319
but if you're nice, thank you, you're

181
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,319
welcome, hey, anything you need, uh,

182
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,400
that can make your customers really

183
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,840
happy and probably get return business.

184
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,359
Uh, and I think it comes back to this,

185
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,519
Frank. I know you've said in the past,

186
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,960
you're not uh you'd rather not be around

187
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,639
people. You'd rather just look at the

188
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,120
grass. We don't need golfers. Can I just

189
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,560
grow the grass? It comes back to it's a

190
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,120
people business. And sometimes how we

191
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,199
treat people is just as important, if

192
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,360
not more important than the product we

193
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,120
produce, the grass we produce. And I'd

194
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,280
say this, Carl, we often say this on the

195
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,360
golf course. It's like, you know, a lot

196
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,439
of people know how to grow grass. Yep.

197
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,639
Right. But, you know, staying at a golf

198
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,319
course, meeting a golf course

199
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,759
superintendent for 30 years is more

200
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,080
about growing grass. There's an

201
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,000
assumption that, you know, how to grow

202
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,918
grass. There's no magic to growing

203
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,839
grass. This is what's been interesting.

204
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,000
The changing climate, the increasing

205
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,038
pressures on the turf, the lack of

206
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,720
investment in infrastructure up until

207
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:18,719
recently, I think, uh, made it harder

208
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,880
just to permit that bare minimum of

209
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,800
having decent grass. And I think your

210
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,399
your your data shows that. Listen, you

211
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,240
got weeds all over. They're going to be

212
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,598
pissed about that. Yeah, you got dead

213
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,560
greens. They're going to be pissed about

214
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,079
that. But if you meet this minimum sort

215
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,639
of bar, right, and you've talked about

216
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:37,839
that, what's an average lawn got to look

217
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,280
like and what do we do? Because we get

218
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,799
paid to do it, especially in the lawn

219
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,559
care business where you're only really

220
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,639
getting paid when you apply something or

221
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,639
mow something and and and you're not

222
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,879
really paid for sort of producing that

223
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,720
landscape as a whole. But I'm going to

224
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,439
continue in the vein, Carl of Grass

225
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,960
being a people business, but deflect it

226
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,038
a little bit. These are these old guys,

227
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:00,079
Piper and Oakley. They wrote this book,

228
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:03,120
Turfer Golf Courses in the 20s. And the

229
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,719
first line on the first page of the

230
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,800
book, ever, first book ever written

231
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,039
about golf courses, this good grass is

232
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,520
conditioned by two great factors,

233
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:14,079
climate and soil. The latter can be

234
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,839
modified. The former must be accepted.

235
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,318
So, let's start with what we've had to

236
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,478
accept. We had a proper winter, as my

237
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:24,080
British friends would say. a proper

238
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:26,639
winter with good cold temperatures, uh,

239
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,878
adequate but still not excessive

240
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,960
snowfall. I mean, even snowfall along

241
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,120
the lakes, uh, you know, they got dumped

242
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:35,360
on. I I think it snowed every day on the

243
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,080
Tug Hill Plateau. Those poor people got

244
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,320
like 12, 13 feet of snow and there's

245
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,879
barely a hill to ski down it. It's just

246
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,959
flat farmland on the plateau that just

247
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:48,360
gets buried in snow. And then you had

248
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:51,838
the cold temperatures and then uh

249
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,639
freezing and then thawing and raining

250
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,880
and freezing again and so and then you

251
00:08:54,639 --> 00:09:00,080
see ground heaving everywhere. So I

252
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:03,278
would just say we had last year uh we

253
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,200
had a proper summer and a proper winter.

254
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:07,120
Now coming out of the proper winter we

255
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,600
got that annual blueg grass in some

256
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,440
places. Not everybody but some places

257
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,600
are definitely showing. Now, this is

258
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,040
good if you know if you're trying to

259
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,440
kill it like we're trying to do it on

260
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:20,559
our sports field and you made a couple

261
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,600
applications of prorass last year uh on

262
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:26,479
your ryrass uh even with a little bit of

263
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,120
bluegrass in there. We we smoked uh

264
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,278
Chris was able to smoke the annual

265
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,560
bluegrass on our on our game field out

266
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:34,320
there and you know you go out it's like

267
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,759
wow is that snow mold? No, it's dead

268
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,200
annual bluegrass. Okay, back to the

269
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:41,439
weather. You can see in this monthly

270
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,519
departures from normal in Ithaca, right?

271
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,760
Uh it was warmer than normal. Look at

272
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,080
January, February, March, April. You're

273
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:50,319
looking at, you know, two to almost

274
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,200
eight degrees above normal month after

275
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,720
month, last winter, right? Last winter,

276
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,399
2024. Then you see as we got through the

277
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,720
summer, June and July was warmer than

278
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,278
normal, a little bit cooler in August,

279
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,440
warmer in the fall. This is the story,

280
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:08,000
right? Warm fall. And then as you can

281
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,360
see at the end of the top chart and the

282
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,360
beginning of the bottom chart where

283
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,800
you're cooler than normal now we've been

284
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,440
on the cold side. A little bit of a

285
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:17,919
roller coaster but certainly warm in the

286
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,640
fall. And the other thing about the fall

287
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:23,039
that persisted was the incredibly dry

288
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,720
weather right annual departure from

289
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,879
normal. You're looking at two inches

290
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,320
below normal October, November and

291
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:33,039
December. This was the story and it has

292
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,560
persisted. We're in the, you know, some

293
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:39,838
people in the 50 to 75% of normal, more

294
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:43,199
in the 75 to 100. So, we're starting out

295
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:46,480
the season on the dry side. Last fall,

296
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,278
it was so dry, sparks were setting off

297
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,879
landscapes. Prospect Park had a a fire

298
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:53,200
that's going to cost a quarter million

299
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,838
dollars or more to replace just the

300
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,600
natural landscape from uh, you know,

301
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,839
homeless people in an area barbecuing.

302
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,480
spark goes into the woods, boom, 10

303
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,880
acres burned up. So, it's a a pretty big

304
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,680
deal. Now, from as far as what got

305
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,439
smoked from last year, I'd say towards

306
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,838
the end of the year, the crab grass came

307
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,399
on and really took over. You know, we

308
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,480
had a dry season. Lawns really started

309
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,120
to suffer. Many of them are not going to

310
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,440
recover well. But if you see crab grass

311
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,679
skeletons out there, my opinion right

312
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,760
now, just go in there, scuff it up, and

313
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,479
throw seed. Don't go for the

314
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:33,039
pre-emergent yet. get some grass growing

315
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,480
there. Right now, as we've learned in a

316
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,120
recent paper, and we're going to talk

317
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,759
about this as we get going, grass alone

318
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,039
there doesn't stop the crab grass from

319
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,720
coming, but it does slow the

320
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:46,078
emergence. Okay, just a note about if

321
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,680
you're heading out to spray your

322
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,599
pre-emergent or you want to go out and

323
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,958
do anything, we've got the runoff risk

324
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,959
tool. And uh again, for the Ithaca area,

325
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,559
we're low, but we're starting to build

326
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,639
up as the rains are going to start

327
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:01,759
coming through next week. And you can

328
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:04,000
see by uh Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday

329
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:06,639
of next week, when when are we getting

330
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
to the 31st? Monday, Tuesday of next

331
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,959
week, you're going to start to have

332
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,320
great runoff uh potentials in certain

333
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,319
areas where the rains are coming

334
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,920
through. So, check the runoff models.

335
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,920
It's a very important time of the year,

336
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,599
and I hate to say, I see a lot of

337
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,439
farmers running around spreading manure

338
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,399
at this time of year, and it's just not

339
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,279
a good thing.

340
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:30,159
Okay, late grub damage still obvious

341
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:32,000
this spring. In fact, Kyle Wickings has

342
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,120
got my head spinning a little bit that

343
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,799
if they're feeding late, maybe it's

344
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,919
cranefly. But this is some damage I saw

345
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,519
in October in Central Park uh with some

346
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,439
grubs there and trying to look at the

347
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,600
anal slit and seeing what it is. Not

348
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,680
everybody's favorite job, but we were

349
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,120
able to see that it was uh I think it

350
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:53,439
was oriental beetle uh at this location.

351
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,039
But you know, the grubs themselves, the

352
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,360
turf's looking fine. The grubs are

353
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,278
everywhere. The only problem with this

354
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,879
area is the vertebrate damage, and that

355
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,958
remains the problem. It isn't

356
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,639
necessarily the grub pressure as much as

357
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:08,000
it's that. All right, let's talk about

358
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,159
getting the season going here. Um, soils

359
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,399
are barely in the 50s. They're still

360
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,399
frozen. Walt Nelson's probably got he's

361
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,320
can't get out his front door. There's

362
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,958
still snow up north. We had a we had

363
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,040
just a dusting yesterday uh of snow when

364
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:23,518
we were having the conversation. So

365
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:26,240
barely creeping into the 50s all the way

366
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,959
down into Delm Marva. So we're a we're a

367
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,079
slow start to the year uh for sure here

368
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:34,799
in March, right? And and this past week

369
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,799
was cooler along the coast. Uh warmer by

370
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,359
the lakes, a little warmer inland, a

371
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,799
little cooler by the coast. Uh and of

372
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,320
course, Carl, I don't have to remind

373
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,399
everybody, but the growth model is

374
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,320
there. And and you know, the grass isn't

375
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,480
growing very much. We're just, you know,

376
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,480
it's Chris has got people playing on the

377
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,480
soccer fields. We got golfers playing on

378
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,159
the golf course, but it's important to

379
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,000
keep in mind the grass isn't growing.

380
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:59,439
And I got a question for you at the end,

381
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,759
pal, about how to reconcile this. Okay,

382
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,079
so what about moisture? Well, in the

383
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,480
last week, uh, we got a good dump along

384
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,399
the coast. Uh, on the left here, you can

385
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,959
see we got a pretty good dump along the

386
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,639
coast, but pretty dry inland, right? The

387
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,719
rest of us have been a bit on the dry

388
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,198
side, but definitely wet along the coast

389
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,240
last week. And it looks like uh it's

390
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:19,919
going to be a little bit of the

391
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,919
opposite. It's going to get dry along

392
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,799
the coast. Uh we're going to start to

393
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:26,240
see some uh drying out. Uh but to the

394
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:29,039
north, we're going to start to see some

395
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,639
rainfall. We are into seed head

396
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,240
suppression right now. Of course, if

397
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,560
you're really serious in the golf

398
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,399
business about suppressing seed heads,

399
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,319
you're making that proxy application

400
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,958
with your snow mold application in the

401
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,040
fall. And so that's become pretty much

402
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,119
the standard since Sean Ascu started

403
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:48,319
doing that work a number of years ago.

404
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,320
and that followup application is due uh

405
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,040
in a lot of places uh which seems hard

406
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,879
to believe. Uh but uh certainly the

407
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,559
models have been pretty consistent about

408
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,480
this, but you want to keep in mind

409
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:59,838
you're spraying a growth regulator at a

410
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,240
time where you want the grass to get

411
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,320
going. So you've got to reconcile that

412
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,079
sort of dissonance in your head that oh

413
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,879
well I want it to grow but I'm spraying

414
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:10,239
a growth regulator. Okay, Carl, I got a

415
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,480
question for you. I'm gonna set you up

416
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,560
here. We got about 15 minutes to have

417
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,039
this chat because I know you're a golfer

418
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:19,359
and I see this bubble up every once in a

419
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,879
while and I want to see uh what you

420
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,159
think about this. Give me I'm going to

421
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,159
make a pitch and then I want to hear

422
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,000
what you have to say. Yeah, it's green

423
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,519
and open early. This is a golf course

424
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,399
superintendent in Morristown, New

425
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:34,078
Jersey. Uh posted uh on on uh

426
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:36,399
Turfet uses covers, gets the greens

427
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,479
going. Here's my question. Green and

428
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,639
open early, good deal, bad deal. All

429
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,039
right, here's the impact covers have,

430
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,360
right? You can see here, you know, when

431
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,799
you put covers on, you warm that system,

432
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,120
right? This is what we're talking about.

433
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:52,799
You get that warmth going, you get soils

434
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,600
activated. Once you heat the soil mass,

435
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:58,000
right, it's it's on. Plants are growing.

436
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,519
Up until then, you're staring at it. You

437
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,519
can see on the left, the arification

438
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,959
holes are filled in. On the right, you

439
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,159
can still see them very clearly,

440
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,719
especially if you're doing late

441
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,958
arification. I'll just make a note that

442
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,040
heavy blankets of sand worked very well

443
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,039
this year. I saw it on our golf course

444
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,120
and a number of other golf courses this

445
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,838
year. Heavy blankets of sand worked

446
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,919
really well for getting things going. Uh

447
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,800
and then capitalizing on maybe using

448
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,000
some coarser particles, maybe even airy

449
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,399
a little bit, getting them into the

450
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,879
profile. All right, Carl plays up. It's

451
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,799
a good time to be in golf. We're record

452
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:33,519
round numbers as we look at annual

453
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:35,599
rounds. You know, we've gone talk about

454
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,759
a roller coaster. We're having a ball

455
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,000
right now. All right. It's the sun is

456
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,440
shining and everybody's happy.

457
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,360
Everybody's spending money on golf

458
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,199
courses. We see a lot of infrastructure

459
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,720
projects. I sit in a room of

460
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:48,000
superintendents that I'm speaking to. I

461
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,160
say, "How many people got projects,

462
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,639
bunker irrigation?" 80% of their hands

463
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:55,120
are up. So, golfers, you know, people

464
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,720
are playing, somebody's got money,

465
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,600
they're spending it back in deferred

466
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,600
maintenance. This is a very good thing.

467
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,519
And a lot of this has to do with remote

468
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,679
work, Carl. This is what the remote

469
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,199
worker looks like nowadays, right? I

470
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,120
talked about this with our state park

471
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,600
guys. You know, the National Golf

472
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,838
Foundation has found a 25% increase in

473
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,240
weekday play since the pandemic. We knew

474
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:18,078
this. Now we got data. There was a

475
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,000
workday study that was done recently

476
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:22,558
that I stumbled onto work from home

477
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,279
study about the it was a really long

478
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:27,678
presentation maybe 80 90 slides. In the

479
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:30,960
middle of it is this golf effect. the

480
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,440
fact that you look at cell phone data in

481
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,919
an in a community, right, where there's

482
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,880
golf courses, right? Cell phone data

483
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:43,840
tracking where people are, right? In

484
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:46,919
2019, on Mondays, uh 12,000 people were

485
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:50,879
heading or at golf courses. In

486
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:54,080
2022, 24,000 people. Look at the

487
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,080
increase in play on Monday through

488
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:58,480
Thursday through Friday and you don't

489
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:00,480
see it as much on Saturday. They're

490
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,720
still playing on Saturday. They're still

491
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,679
at the go, but now they're at the golf

492
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,640
course all week. Uh not just on uh

493
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,759
Saturday and Sunday. In fact, the data

494
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,120
also shows they're taking the early tea

495
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:14,798
times. So now you used to have a little

496
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,239
bit more time in the morning except for

497
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,240
the deuce sweepers. You're never going

498
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,919
to get ahead of those guys, right? So

499
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,359
you let them go and then the rest of the

500
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,520
people are coming. Now you got a whole

501
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,038
pile of people coming early. They want

502
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,400
to fit it in before they start working

503
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:30,000
remotely. They're not working on Mondays

504
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,160
in the office and they're not working on

505
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,519
Fridays in the office anymore, Carl.

506
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,679
They're there. They're only there

507
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:38,079
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. So now

508
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,840
Monday maintenance days might have to be

509
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:42,798
Tuesday maintenance days. And how does

510
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,639
that make it look come Friday, Saturday,

511
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:47,119
Sunday for your weekends? You don't have

512
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,520
four days to recover from a vertic cut

513
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:51,558
in sand. You got three days to recover.

514
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:54,160
All right, Carl. Here's the question,

515
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:56,359
brother. Here's what I hear. We should

516
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,880
open and play whenever we can to

517
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:01,279
maximize. If you got a private club,

518
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,840
Craig Courier never closes Glenn Oaks.

519
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:05,678
The flags are always in. If if if the

520
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,399
grass if you can see the grass, you're

521
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,640
playing out there. Uh access. And if

522
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,120
you're in the business of golf like our

523
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,520
Elm Tree brother, you're you want rounds

524
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,879
and revenue. Okay? So get out there. And

525
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,038
then there's these other people that

526
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,840
say, "Oh, no. We got to stay closed as

527
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:24,240
long as we can to preserve the golf

528
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,918
course for the season. Opening now will

529
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,400
hurt us later in the season." You could

530
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,360
have this same argument for Ben Palmer

531
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,160
could have the same argument in on play.

532
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:36,240
Oh, why can't I use this field? Oh, oh,

533
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,600
you know, you're gonna do damage. Okay,

534
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,440
Carl, where are you? What do you think?

535
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:44,000
I did it to you, didn't I? I did. Yeah,

536
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,640
you've you've put both sides there and

537
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,359
and I am split, too. As a golfer, one of

538
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,880
my favorite things to do is in March and

539
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,038
I keep track of every year my first

540
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,200
round. It's always second, third week in

541
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,119
March, I go up to Elmry and it's just

542
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,798
one of the best experiences of the year

543
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,599
is I get out for the first time. I get

544
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:03,038
to see the ball fly in

545
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:04,719
2025. Uh it's sort of like, you know, it

546
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:05,919
creates this inertia momentum for the

547
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,839
rest of the year. Oh man, I want to

548
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,640
golf. Like, that was so cool. It's 50°

549
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:13,199
out. It was sunny. I'm loving this. Uh,

550
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,080
and from an operator perspective, it's

551
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,558
it's the most money you can make with no

552
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:20,639
cost. You don't have to mow. I don't I I

553
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,000
put I can put temporary TE's out there.

554
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,840
That's a really good option, I think.

555
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,160
Don't don't beat up your tea services.

556
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:28,798
If you got artificial mats for part 3es,

557
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,320
I think that's a really good idea. Um,

558
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:31,599
but you're making basically free money.

559
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:33,918
You just need one person in the pro

560
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,678
shop, take the cash, and go out and

561
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,120
play. I don't have to do anything else.

562
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,200
People will come and play. There will be

563
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:41,599
a 100 rounds in central New York. Okay.

564
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,000
On March 15th. Okay. All right. All

565
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,759
right. Now, and then if I'm a

566
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,599
superintendent, I I'm saying exactly

567
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:49,519
what you put in that slide there, Frank.

568
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,319
There is no growth happening right now.

569
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:55,519
And when I have traffic plus no growth,

570
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:57,678
I'm going to have less turf cover as we

571
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,918
get close to the season that actually

572
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,000
actually matters, you know, in April and

573
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,840
and throughout the growing season. And I

574
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,599
do worry about, okay, does do we get

575
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:06,959
some weed encroachment there? If we're

576
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,558
if we're trying to keep poa out and

577
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,960
we've got ball marks early in the season

578
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,480
on greens that aren't growing, man, are

579
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,679
we going to get some poa infestations

580
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,759
there. Um, I think generally I I

581
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,759
probably worry most about tea surfaces

582
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,359
where there's divoting and you are

583
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:25,200
definitely not growing that grass back

584
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:26,879
for another month probably. Um, that's

585
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,319
where I'd say, hey, like if you're going

586
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,400
to open and you're going to try and make

587
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,480
some money, like mats or just put the

588
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,559
te's off in the rough. I a lot of us

589
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,319
golfers do not care, especially public

590
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:38,319
golf. I'm paying 20 bucks to play 18

591
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:40,079
holes in March. You can put me off in

592
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:42,000
the rough. I'll I can tee it up in the

593
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,158
rough. I don't care. I'll take divots in

594
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,759
the rough. I'm just happy to be outside.

595
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,760
Like, try and keep them off the high

596
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,759
value tea surfaces and preserve that.

597
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,359
That's what I'd say if if I'm a or at

598
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,839
least I'm a superintendent, I'm trying

599
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:56,000
to argue for uh hey, let make less work

600
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:58,000
for me later on in the season. That's

601
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,359
that's maybe one option I' I'd go with.

602
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,798
The other thing I'd say, Frank, is when

603
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:05,119
we look at um we get data from Pollucid

604
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:07,679
uh that looks at capacity, weather

605
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:09,519
adjusted capacity for golf. How many

606
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,280
rounds can you play in March, April,

607
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,038
May, June, July based on the weather. Is

608
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,200
it sunny out? Is it warm out? Is it not

609
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:17,480
raining? Right? uh where we see the most

610
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,759
variation especially in upstate New York

611
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:24,240
is March, April, November, December. And

612
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:27,440
you can make you can get huge increases

613
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,038
in your potential play by 2,000 rounds

614
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,120
sometimes in March and April if you get

615
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,879
a nice March in April. And that means

616
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:36,079
you can really get ahead on your revenue

617
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,000
if you're an operator. Uh and if we look

618
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:39,359
10 20 years in in the future with

619
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,839
climate change, we're going to extend

620
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:44,399
those shoulders of the season. man, it's

621
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:46,959
going to be hard to not open, especially

622
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,320
public golf in those times because

623
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,919
that's where you can make a lot of your

624
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:51,759
money and you can be you can get into

625
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,360
the green as opposed to the red. Right.

626
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:55,440
Okay. So, let me throw a wrench in this

627
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:58,158
and I maybe you listen to the podcast I

628
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,400
did with Stuart and Jim where where

629
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,799
Stuart says that golfers are more like

630
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,240
bears than

631
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:06,400
squirrels, right? They hibernate in the

632
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,279
winter and come out in the spring and

633
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,600
want to play golf like crazy. and they

634
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:14,798
had beautiful weather in the fall and

635
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:17,279
probably nobody was playing uh the way

636
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:20,319
we normally expect them to. Why why

637
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,079
don't you play golf in the fall, Carl?

638
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:24,399
You know, that's that's a great analogy.

639
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,079
It's you're sort of tire yourself out in

640
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,600
the fall. And I think there's also this

641
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:31,119
effect of uh Masters starts in April.

642
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:32,798
For a lot of people, that's like the

643
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,119
first time they'll watch golf on TV. You

644
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:37,200
really get the itch to play. Then once

645
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:38,558
you're in September, October, November,

646
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,840
you've you've played if you're a

647
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:41,759
competitive golfer, you've played all

648
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:43,678
your tournaments, you've been with your

649
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:45,919
buddies, you probably had enough of them

650
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,200
after 20 or 30 rounds to be honest at

651
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,799
the end of the year. That's right. I'm

652
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,798
going to hang up the clubs, take some

653
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:53,599
time off. So So that's a good point,

654
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:56,158
too, by by Stuart is maybe the the

655
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:58,000
springtime is where you can really make

656
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,600
hay and get that momentum for Okay. So

657
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,079
then let's talk about this in other

658
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:03,918
arenas, right? the long thing. Let's

659
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:05,359
leave it to the side because that's

660
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,120
let's just assume you're looking at

661
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:09,519
that. But sports fields are a different

662
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:12,158
animal and right so let's think that

663
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:14,000
same argument that happens here and then

664
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,559
all of a sudden you see the clear

665
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,679
justification in our climate for

666
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:21,918
synthetic turf. So, um, when we get

667
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,720
ourselves into these pickles, how do you

668
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:27,840
reconcile, uh, these issues where now

669
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,038
we're seeing a growing concern, uh, and

670
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,359
this is something we're going to talk

671
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:33,839
about adnauseium this year because it is

672
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:35,839
front of mind for all of us and it is,

673
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:38,319
you know, presenting us big challenges

674
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:41,199
with the, you know, I think some people

675
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:44,798
would say epidemic of synthetic turf

676
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,360
being uh, laid down much like a land

677
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:50,240
going to solar farms. It feels like a

678
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:52,639
waste. Um, it feels like, well, in the

679
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,798
case of synthetic turf, maybe polluting,

680
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,919
but at the same time, Carl, we want the

681
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:59,599
kids out and about and playing on safe

682
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:02,080
surfaces. How do you reconcile sports

683
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:04,240
fields in your mind with with the pickle

684
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:06,399
we're in now? Because again, just like

685
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,038
with golf, there's you could argue both

686
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,798
sides of these things uh effectively.

687
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:12,879
And and and and that's of course the

688
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:16,000
world we live in nowadays. Where do you

689
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,000
fall on how you feel about, you know,

690
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,480
natural grass, synthetic at this time of

691
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,240
year? I I think it's there's there's a

692
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,839
big difference spring versus fall sport.

693
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,519
And we saw this, we have our data for

694
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:27,038
like a 10-year average of Itha, New

695
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:28,960
York, the growth potential. How much do

696
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:31,119
we expect the grass to grow based on an

697
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,440
average temper of 67 67 is about where

698
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:35,918
we want to be in the spring. You don't

699
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,558
get to 50% growth potential until middle

700
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,640
of May on average, which is the end of

701
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:43,200
our division one spring season. So,

702
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,200
we're playing from February through May

703
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,558
when we're getting basically no growth.

704
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,640
That's correct. And I worry about those

705
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,240
sports on natural grass because they're

706
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,600
going to we're getting no growth. We're

707
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,839
going to be using the fields at least

708
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,359
five times a year. We can expect that

709
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,079
field quality to decline and the

710
00:25:55,359 --> 00:26:00,158
fluctuations in soil moisture,

711
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:01,439
compaction. I worry a lot more about the

712
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,520
safety of that field in the spring

713
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,919
versus the fall. Like we have uh our

714
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:07,359
soccer teams both play on natural grass

715
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,679
both on campus and their practice

716
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:12,000
facilities. growth potential stays high

717
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,080
now in the fall basically almost until

718
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,640
December. I mean, we can host we've

719
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:18,158
hosted NCAA Division games when it it

720
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,559
snows in December, but up until then,

721
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,559
the grass is still growing. Uh, so we

722
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:25,599
can support the traffic and we have data

723
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:27,839
on the the firmness readings, traction,

724
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:30,158
how how long the the ball rolls and how

725
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,319
much it bounces. And it maintains these

726
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,360
these standards up until the end of the

727
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:37,599
season because we have enough of of uh

728
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,439
of warmth and growth. So, so we're

729
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:40,798
talking to, you know, you and I are in

730
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,320
this project now where we're working

731
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:44,240
with school districts on trying to

732
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:46,798
figure out how to do synthetic and

733
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,640
natural turf, uh, you know, you know,

734
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,639
governance and stewardship and making

735
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,120
decisions and how they go about it. We

736
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,720
met with Tom Ferrara, the facility,

737
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,199
director of facilities for the city of

738
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,200
Syracuse school district and absolutely

739
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,200
incredible operation and he's quite a

740
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,840
professional that guy, but you know,

741
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,440
he's in a city. I said to him, listen, I

742
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,278
think you need three fields for every

743
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,000
one. You need three natural grass

744
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:13,038
fields, six, seven acres of grass for

745
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,640
every synthetic field you have. Just off

746
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:16,558
the top of my head, where you know

747
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,880
you're going to trash them and you're

748
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,558
going to need recovery. I'd almost say,

749
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,080
you know, if you have three teams and

750
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:25,440
one field, uh, you probably need five,

751
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:28,158
you know, one synthetic field, you

752
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,080
probably need five fields. Three fields,

753
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,400
uh, five fields in the spring, three

754
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:33,678
fields in the summer with two rest. So,

755
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,720
the end of the day, you're gonna need

756
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:39,200
more land. and he was like, "Yeah, I

757
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,240
don't have any more land and I'm

758
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,720
spending millions on storm water

759
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,558
associated with the synthetic turf." So,

760
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,720
for those of you in the sports turf

761
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,119
business, this used to be something that

762
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,960
was relatively straightforward, I would

763
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,839
say. I mean, and natural grass was

764
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,679
losing. I think synthetic turf is now

765
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,519
coming under question, but you start to

766
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,278
see the constraints that made synthetic

767
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:02,720
turf the best option, right? urban

768
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:03,679
areas, Frank, and we've seen it in New

769
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,278
York City. They want to get rid of

770
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,840
synthetic turf in the city and replace

771
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:10,798
it with natural grass. We love that. But

772
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:12,158
when you have millions of people and

773
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,918
probably hundreds of thousands of people

774
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,440
who want to play sports and a confined

775
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:20,559
area, that's just not going to probably

776
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,240
happen with and you know, and since we

777
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:23,678
know it's baseball and we're going to be

778
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,200
the Yanks are off today. I don't know

779
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,480
how the hell they take a Friday off and

780
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,399
then they're playing Saturday. But

781
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,880
nevertheless, I got to go one day

782
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:33,119
without baseball. was very happy to see

783
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,760
Juan Sodto strike out and lose the game

784
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:37,439
last night for the Mets. So, I was very

785
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:39,119
happy about that. But in the baseball

786
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,200
world, Carl, you know, it's the same

787
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,038
thing. We showed Greg knows what he's

788
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,759
doing, taking care of that dirt. But how

789
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:47,839
many school districts have anybody that

790
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,640
has the never mind even if they have the

791
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:52,639
expertise have the time to tend to it?

792
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,360
And that's another reason where you see

793
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,960
synthetic turf having its benefits and

794
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,798
options in those. Matter of fact, I

795
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,640
think I've said it on this program. If

796
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,480
you gave me one synthetic field I could

797
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,240
have, I'd put a baseball field in

798
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,798
because most of these guys don't have

799
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,679
the ability like Greg like Greg does or

800
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:12,079
the expertise capacity to to do the

801
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,000
infield uh the way it can be and man

802
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,759
that's a danger, right? There's this

803
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,599
safety thing from a broader

804
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:19,599
environmental perspective and then

805
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:24,278
there's the safety from a projectile

806
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:24,278
being hit at you at the exit vlog.

807
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:29,519
Somebody said yesterday, it's it's not

808
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,600
how fast, it's how many.

809
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,599
It's not how fast it goes, it's how many

810
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:35,918
go. It's so stupid. Some of this

811
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,918
analytic stuff is over over the top. We

812
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,480
got any questions before we wrap it up?

813
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,240
I I just want to point out uh Greg is on

814
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,679
with us today and he said he limits play

815
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,759
in the spring. So So no cleats, sneakers

816
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,360
only. We've

817
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:50,640
heard said the same thing again. And

818
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:51,918
that's a great example of someone who

819
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,520
knows what they're doing. Hey, if you

820
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,278
want to get out here, we have to limit

821
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,278
the the damage we're doing to the turf.

822
00:29:55,278 --> 00:30:00,000
So, he says he does that. Yeah. And he

823
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:02,398
still closed, too. Or you sacrifice. You

824
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,079
just say, "Here, go use this. You can

825
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:05,678
use it until it's not safe and then you

826
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:07,119
got to go use that one." All right,

827
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,679
Carl. We're at the We're at the end,

828
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:11,678
brother. 30 minutes gone by. First goes,

829
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,720
the first episode always uh goes

830
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,440
quickly. Next week, we'll have Art

831
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,038
Degayano on the the real weather guy.

832
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,798
Good climate. The real weather guy,

833
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:20,480
right? Good climate. Learned. Yeah. And

834
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:22,558
we'll talk a little bit about sort of

835
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,558
the fall and and some of the trends

836
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:27,440
we're seeing with non, you know, how the

837
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:29,519
snow fell and growing degree days and

838
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,440
also soil temperature and model stuff,

839
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,200
right? We Carl's actively you're

840
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,600
building a lot of models, brother. And

841
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,080
Art is certainly Art and Ben are

842
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:40,000
certainly the brains for for you and me.

843
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:41,759
More me than you. You got the brains.

844
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,398
But nevertheless, we'll see everybody

845
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:47,278
next week. This has been a production of

846
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:51,158
Cornell University on the web at

847
