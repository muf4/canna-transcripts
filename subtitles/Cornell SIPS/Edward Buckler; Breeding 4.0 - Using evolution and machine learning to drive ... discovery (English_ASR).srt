1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,669
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:07,470
University but what I want to tell you a

3
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:09,719
little bit about is how we're starting

4
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:11,820
to use some of the concepts of evolution

5
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:14,298
and machine learning and combining those

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,890
together to really figure out and drive

7
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:19,019
functional variant discovery and what we

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,000
hope will eventually become breeding 4.0

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,198
I want to first highlight that the work

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,809
I'll be telling you about today who's

11
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,130
been supported by usda-ars in the

12
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:29,939
National Science Foundation

13
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:31,919
but the real thought and efforts behind

14
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,329
all of this type of work is coming from

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,980
an incredible group of collaborators

16
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:39,030
I've had the pleasure of collaborating

17
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:40,049
with over the years sir Miller was

18
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,579
helping me count up all of our

19
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:43,320
collaborators over the years and we've

20
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:47,160
actually collaborated with like 1,200

21
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:50,189
people now over the last 20 years and

22
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:52,439
that working across that global

23
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:54,659
community it's been such a pleasure to

24
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,159
learn from everybody and to make

25
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:58,648
progress in this and this is some of our

26
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:02,099
current collaborators right now that

27
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:04,890
have helped shape our thinking I want to

28
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,750
give you all a little feel for where

29
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,569
we're driving to and that comes out of

30
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,670
our labs mission and so our labs mission

31
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,889
the very first one element is a very

32
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,930
straightforward one what's the genetic

33
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,650
basis of natural diversity simple to say

34
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:22,320
hard to figure out but essentially how

35
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,390
does it change in DNA get converted into

36
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,539
a change out in the field something we

37
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,400
can see and work with with models of

38
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,700
those we can then apply that knowledge

39
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,100
to help breed crops for the US and for

40
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,900
the world and so I won't be talking a

41
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:38,908
lot about what we're doing there but we

42
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,159
try to use our understanding and the top

43
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,130
part to help people across the world

44
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,290
build an engineering and IT systems to

45
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:49,170
help breed crops the world and then

46
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,630
finally we do all this in the context of

47
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,879
what should we discover in what crops

48
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:57,179
should we breed in order to reduce the

49
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:59,609
environmental impact of agriculture so

50
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,640
I've also in the last couple months been

51
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:05,489
given a number of talks down in

52
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:08,159
Washington DC and so frequently I'm

53
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:09,840
asked what is breeding okay and that

54
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,299
actually is a harder question that I

55
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,680
thought initially because you know we

56
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,840
all around here think we

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,140
breeding is but this is the definition I

58
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,729
came up with and essentially we view

59
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,429
this as the design and selection of

60
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:25,590
organisms for human purposes and so if

61
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,200
you start asking you know what could we

62
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,718
apply breeding to and if you go through

63
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:35,250
the UN sustainable development goals

64
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:36,810
they lay out 17 goals that are critical

65
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,000
across the globe for the next 20 years

66
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,009
and where could breeding contribute to

67
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,959
each one of these and it turns out that

68
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:44,818
breeding can contribute I'm not saying

69
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,459
it's the dominant element or anything it

70
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:50,009
can play a role in 10 out of the 17

71
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,560
sustainable development goals so the

72
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:54,298
reason that I'm interested in taking

73
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,908
quantitative genetics and applied it to

74
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:59,129
breeding is because the leverage of what

75
00:02:56,908 --> 00:03:01,048
we can do and impact the globe is so

76
00:02:59,128 --> 00:03:03,750
great and so I think if each of us is

77
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:07,290
can play a little role in figuring out

78
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,539
how we can solve some of these 17 issues

79
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:11,750
we can have a real impact across the

80
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:11,750
globe

81
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:17,329
[Music]

82
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:27,780
maybe it's 11 of them I think excellent

83
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:30,479
question so in terms of the evolution of

84
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,938
plant breeding though where if we come

85
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,620
from as its mentioned I have this

86
00:03:32,938 --> 00:03:36,568
background in archaeology so I always

87
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,519
think about what reading is and

88
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:42,750
quantitative genetics from this very

89
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:44,759
long time depth and so 10,000 years ago

90
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,310
we I would say we started out was called

91
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:50,429
breeding 1.0 which are using phenotypic

92
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,359
selection to decide what species should

93
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,400
be domesticated

94
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:55,759
there's a quarter-million species plant

95
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,379
species out there about 5000 of them

96
00:03:55,758 --> 00:04:00,089
have been domesticated to some degree

97
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:02,310
and people were really testing out

98
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,348
species level diversity in applying

99
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,329
selection to some of those species to

100
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:08,789
really drive them into new and different

101
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,299
Corrections starting a little over 100

102
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:10,709
years ago

103
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,780
I think the key element was we started

104
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,878
having controlled trials where we

105
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,139
controlled the genetics out of that came

106
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,019
or understanding of quantitative

107
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,639
genetics experimental design but really

108
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:25,139
the key elements and allowing us to make

109
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:27,360
progress and those statistics arises out

110
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,728
of our knowledge of plant breeding

111
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,050
our desire to do plant breeding and of

112
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:33,658
course equipment and tools like

113
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,460
harvesters really help drive our ability

114
00:04:33,658 --> 00:04:39,060
to provide and produce selection

115
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:41,209
effectively then a little over of almost

116
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,740
20 years ago now genomic selection

117
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:45,959
arises where we're essentially using

118
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,668
anonymous markers across the genome to

119
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:54,120
really drive selection and produce crops

120
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:55,978
faster and better now for most

121
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,959
sophisticated breeding programs across

122
00:04:55,978 --> 00:05:00,149
the globe and major companies genomic

123
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,609
selection is now the norm it's being

124
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:04,378
applied in all of our major crops in

125
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,240
each of those companies but I think one

126
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:08,218
of the challenges we have across the

127
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,740
nation and across the globe is to make

128
00:05:08,218 --> 00:05:13,379
sure genomic selection breeding 3.0 gets

129
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,658
applied to those 5,000 other species

130
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:17,218
that have been domesticated or to all

131
00:05:15,658 --> 00:05:19,560
the environments and all the breeding

132
00:05:17,218 --> 00:05:21,028
efforts across the rest of the globe so

133
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,759
although I'll be talking most about

134
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:24,778
bringing 4.0 today we also do spend a

135
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,340
lot of time and I think our whole

136
00:05:24,778 --> 00:05:29,069
community should spend a lot of time

137
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:30,269
making sure that breeding 3.0 gets

138
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:33,479
applied everywhere

139
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:35,939
so finally breeding 4.0 is really about

140
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:38,158
designing genomes and in order to do

141
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:40,158
this you have to identify the causative

142
00:05:38,158 --> 00:05:42,509
nucleotides that are underlined

143
00:05:40,158 --> 00:05:45,329
quantitative and complex trait variation

144
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:47,158
and then we could imagine using an

145
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:50,098
editing technology and our understanding

146
00:05:47,158 --> 00:05:52,050
of physiology and molecular biology it's

147
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:53,968
really drive things forward and I'll

148
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,278
talk about how we're doing some efforts

149
00:05:53,968 --> 00:06:00,478
to help us identify those positive

150
00:05:56,278 --> 00:06:02,639
nucleotides so when I think about where

151
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:05,310
variation comes from I think the first

152
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,400
place we can think about it is you know

153
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:11,009
every generation 90 new mutations occur

154
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,778
and in the case of maize and some of

155
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:14,310
those are adaptive some of those are

156
00:06:12,778 --> 00:06:16,259
deleterious and the most of them were

157
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,110
neutral and fundamentally the question

158
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:21,000
that our group is trying to ask is of

159
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,669
those 90 mutations that arise every

160
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,899
generation and they maybe are of course

161
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:26,878
are passed on generation after

162
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,668
generation for thousands even millions

163
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:32,218
of years which follow into each of these

164
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:33,899
different categories and that's what

165
00:06:32,218 --> 00:06:35,968
we're trying to ask and trying to get

166
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:39,088
and figure that out as easily and fast

167
00:06:35,968 --> 00:06:41,189
as we possibly can and why I care about

168
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:43,170
speed and cost is for

169
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:45,689
there's a lot of genetic variation out

170
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,699
there indicate a small sample of maze

171
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:49,350
lines they capture about 80 million

172
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:53,339
different genetic variants across the

173
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:55,500
genome and we think there's on the order

174
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:57,419
of a few hundred thousand functional

175
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,129
variants that are really contributing to

176
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,439
most of the phenotypic variation out

177
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:03,360
there the question is how do we go from

178
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,029
the top of that funnel to the bottom of

179
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,970
that funnel as cheaply and inexpensively

180
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:11,250
as possible and so it really is a cost

181
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,350
question of efficiency to move from the

182
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,660
top to the bottom so we've worked on a

183
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,310
lot of different methodologies across

184
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,080
here and I'll talk about a couple of

185
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,209
them today with special emphasis on

186
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,219
using conservation expression and

187
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:26,569
machine learning to get from the top to

188
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:29,430
the bottom and I want to start out with

189
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:31,349
highlighting that evolution has turned

190
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,689
out to probably be the most powerful

191
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,100
tool we have for figuring out what our

192
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:36,660
functional variants across the genome

193
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,710
and of course this shouldn't come to

194
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,010
surprise to anybody

195
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:43,469
Jib Jansky 50 or 60 years ago reminded

196
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:45,110
us of this that nothing in biology makes

197
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,100
sense except in the light of evolution

198
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,919
but just to give you a kind of a

199
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,439
quantitative example how powerful

200
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:56,519
evolution is at identifying things let's

201
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:59,579
think about field trials so a decade or

202
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:03,149
so ago we did then create the maze name

203
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:06,060
population it had 5000 inbred lines and

204
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:08,399
through a lot of work we created them we

205
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,230
groom outed for example one experiment

206
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:13,139
eight location lots of clones at each

207
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:16,530
one and effectively we were able to map

208
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:19,319
a five kernel per plant difference down

209
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:20,939
to the level of an individual gene okay

210
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,939
so that in may regard seems like that's

211
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:25,439
a pretty good mapping accuracy and

212
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:30,089
everything but how is that compared to

213
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:32,070
evolution and so well so the key thing

214
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:34,379
to realize about evolution is it's

215
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:37,020
really the integration of billions of

216
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:38,309
years of field trials you know every

217
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:41,038
individual is competing

218
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:43,559
it's either surviving or not or dying to

219
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:46,110
the passions gametes on and so in the

220
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,750
diverse species for example maize if we

221
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:51,600
sample a thousand different maize lines

222
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:54,419
for capturing about three million years

223
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,840
of evolutionary time by a Sam having a

224
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:58,009
sample

225
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00,690
of a thousand lines those thousand

226
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:02,250
extant lines are the product of

227
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,750
populations that had an effective

228
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:07,440
population size of nearly a hundred

229
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:10,230
thousand individuals and the key thing

230
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:16,320
is selection can see a difference of one

231
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:18,120
kernel out out of 250 plants so in

232
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,370
comparison to what we were able to do in

233
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:25,110
a very large field experiment it's about

234
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:26,370
1,200 times more sensitive than than

235
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,860
what we can do in a large build

236
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,379
experiment because it effectively we

237
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,440
have the time and evolution to integrate

238
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:36,120
across all those different events now

239
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,130
what's the problem with using evolution

240
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,080
the big issue is we don't really know

241
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:42,240
what the conditions were under which

242
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,090
selection operated so that's the great

243
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,470
weakness of using evolution but we've

244
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:48,930
also gotten in the last couple decades

245
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,850
getting pretty good at identifying what

246
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:53,250
regions of the genome have been the

247
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,409
product of domestication or the targets

248
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,240
of domestication and in those regions we

249
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:59,309
actually know those are are the regions

250
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,320
where the rules of selection have

251
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:03,419
changed all right when we talk about a

252
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:07,010
domestication locus what that really is

253
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:08,879
is a location in the genome where

254
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:09,659
selection is going in a different

255
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,720
direction

256
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:16,709
today and under human selection and it

257
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,180
was under natural selection and so in

258
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:20,490
the case of maze which is probably our

259
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:22,439
most highly domesticated crop out there

260
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,330
there's about a thousand domestication

261
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,480
or improvement Llosa across the genome

262
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:29,610
which is about 4% of all the genes out

263
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,830
there so from one point of view you know

264
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,930
we can't be sure what's going on there

265
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:36,720
what the we can't use evolution as a

266
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:39,689
guide necessarily to pick out what is

267
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,820
the correct direction to take those loci

268
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:44,760
but what this does suggest is that the

269
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,100
other 96% of the genome essentially the

270
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:48,600
rules that have played for the last few

271
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,450
million years are probably the same

272
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:55,259
rules and important directions that are

273
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:57,360
important today photosynthesis in may

274
00:10:55,259 --> 00:11:00,149
still operates pretty much by the same

275
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:04,590
rules as it did a million years ago five

276
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:06,659
million years ago and so on so if we use

277
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:08,879
that knowledge to try to figure out

278
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:11,698
deleterious variants

279
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:14,129
we've used essentially evolutionary

280
00:11:11,698 --> 00:11:17,870
conservation to work down this trail and

281
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:21,799
so let me explain how we do that well

282
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:24,419
the first thing about in order used

283
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:26,278
conservation we were using it to trying

284
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:28,919
to tackle a question about what's the

285
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:32,730
what produces deleterious mutations and

286
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:34,679
then what produces heterosis and why we

287
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:38,039
care about deleterious mutations is if

288
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:39,208
over 100 years ago geneticists figured

289
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:41,578
out that essentially deleterious

290
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:43,138
mutations are likely the product or what

291
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:45,388
produced had a roast is a hybrid vigor

292
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:47,009
and essentially we complement them and

293
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:49,110
we get it out hybrid vigor out of the

294
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:51,899
system and of course amazed home a seed

295
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,699
industry has grown out of this and so I

296
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:55,620
think the question of what is the basis

297
00:11:53,698 --> 00:11:57,689
of heterosis it's pretty much a solved

298
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,698
question for the last hundred years the

299
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,529
question that has not been solved is

300
00:11:59,698 --> 00:12:03,539
what are the individual nucleotides

301
00:12:01,528 --> 00:12:06,299
across the genome that contribute to

302
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:08,669
heterosis so the basic process we've

303
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:10,439
understood for a century but what are

304
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:12,958
those individual deleterious mutations

305
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,630
and so a former postdoc in the group

306
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:17,609
yeah Eli Rogers Melnick tackled this by

307
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:20,879
asking the question let me take the

308
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:23,278
maize genome and line it up across a

309
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,278
wide range of other species and identify

310
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:28,409
what regions of the genome are conserved

311
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:30,389
across this wide range of species and he

312
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:32,250
lined up maize for everything all the

313
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:34,620
way out to arouser topsis and grapes and

314
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,600
so on and what he found is about 10% of

315
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,578
the genome was Allina belen constrained

316
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,680
I'd highlight the most of what he's

317
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:43,258
talking about are the genes these are

318
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:45,688
the energetic regulatory regions do not

319
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:48,480
align across this range of diversity

320
00:12:45,688 --> 00:12:51,649
it's pretty much just genes that align

321
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,000
at this scale so but he was able

322
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:56,429
base-pair by base-pair able to ask the

323
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,289
question how conserve is every base out

324
00:12:56,429 --> 00:13:00,778
there and then if you see a genetic

325
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:02,849
polymorphism at a base that's incredibly

326
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:05,068
conserved across this entire phylogeny

327
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:07,589
the odds that are deleterious or

328
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:09,328
substantially increased so the same type

329
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:11,399
of process is also now being used by

330
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:14,278
people in human genetics to identify a

331
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:17,068
disease low sigh and so on and so I

332
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:20,159
applied that to our question here in

333
00:13:17,068 --> 00:13:22,229
maize and we have a very strong prior of

334
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:24,419
what we think should happen we

335
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,250
there's mutations we know that the key

336
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:28,439
way to get rid of deleterious mutations

337
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:30,779
is through recombination that breaks

338
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,970
things up and then essentially selection

339
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:34,829
can eliminate them and so we expect to

340
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,540
see a pattern such that in low

341
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,250
recombination regions of the genome we

342
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:40,379
have a buildup of deleterious mutations

343
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:43,139
and in high recombination regions of the

344
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:45,659
genome we have fewer and that's exactly

345
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:46,590
what we saw is that in low recombination

346
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:49,289
we had a buildup of deleterious

347
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:51,090
mutations and in high recombination we

348
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:54,240
had fewer oh I do want to highlight

349
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:55,670
though there are still lots of

350
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,230
deleterious mutations in high

351
00:13:55,669 --> 00:14:01,139
recombination regions of the genome the

352
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:03,269
genome the zig feel about ninety

353
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:05,429
mutations are occurring every generation

354
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:07,319
and they're all across the genome pretty

355
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,789
much evenly across that genome and so

356
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,590
and the genes are in the high

357
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:12,509
recombination region so yes there's a

358
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:14,190
buildup the population genetic

359
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:16,649
prediction that we are able to purge

360
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:18,840
selfish mutations better and high

361
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:20,699
recombination is true but there are

362
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,340
still deleterious mutations everywhere

363
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:27,300
just because the pressure of mutation is

364
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:28,950
so strong and so you know I then lined

365
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,419
up a lot of those deleterious mutations

366
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,400
with a couple different aspects of the

367
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:34,740
genome and the first one he wanted to

368
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,600
test was how did this line up where with

369
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,659
where people had previously mapped

370
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,180
heterosis in maize and in the early

371
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:45,179
1990s Charlie Stuber had identified that

372
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:47,370
the center or para centromeric region of

373
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:51,509
chromosome 5 exhibited the highest level

374
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:53,970
of heterosis in maize and so Eli took

375
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:56,189
his model del judge mutations took them

376
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:59,160
at from across chromosome five and

377
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:00,690
that's exactly what he saw a buildup of

378
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:02,370
deleterious mutations right in the pair

379
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:05,250
of centromeric region of the genome and

380
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:07,379
far less buildup across the rest of it

381
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,639
the green is the recombination rate and

382
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:10,799
as you'll see in maize we have a very

383
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,629
low recombination rate all across that

384
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:14,639
pair of centromeric region and so it's

385
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:16,439
very difficult for the genome to purge

386
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:21,059
these deleterious mutations in those

387
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:23,870
regions but so the pattern in our

388
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:28,379
agreement with heterosis for this

389
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:29,700
analysis made a lot of sense so this but

390
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:31,439
as I mentioned the way we were doing

391
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,320
their conservation analysis we really

392
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,510
could only look at essentially genes and

393
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,970
conserved pretty much protein

394
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:41,069
conserve proteins there and so the

395
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,329
second question we would ask is whether

396
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,269
or not we were seeing the same type of

397
00:15:42,328 --> 00:15:47,219
patterns looking at RNA and expression

398
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:49,289
patterns some other analysis we had done

399
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,450
that suggested about half of phenotypic

400
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:53,278
variation is the product of expression

401
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:56,759
differences half of it's from coding

402
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:58,828
differences and so is the genome able to

403
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:01,828
purge deleterious mutations better in

404
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:04,620
these expression domain or does it do

405
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:05,879
worse at that and so this is where Carl

406
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,448
crumbling a former graduate student

407
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:11,730
worked on this question in the real

408
00:16:08,448 --> 00:16:13,769
element and key from doing this analysis

409
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:16,980
is we need to collect enough expression

410
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:19,350
data to from enough different lines that

411
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:22,680
we could determine what was a rare and

412
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:25,879
aberrant expression pattern and so what

413
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:28,679
he did is he got robot roboticized

414
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:31,350
3 prime RNA seek profiling up and

415
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:33,539
running guide down for about 25 bucks of

416
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:36,019
sample and he was then able to profile

417
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:39,389
nearly 2,000 samples for their RNA

418
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:41,100
levels and with that large data set we

419
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:43,620
then essentially had expression measures

420
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,170
on tens of millions of different genes

421
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,209
and alleles all across this panel that

422
00:16:46,169 --> 00:16:50,549
effectively allowed us start asking

423
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:54,088
questions about what are rare expression

424
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:56,458
patterns and the hypothesis he wanted to

425
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:58,769
test was one that Greg Gibson had laid

426
00:16:56,458 --> 00:17:02,309
out and for Human Genetics and

427
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:05,220
essentially the hypothesis is following

428
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:07,798
and the test is is following so we kind

429
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:11,699
of expect low expression if you've been

430
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:14,548
expression patterns out for each gene if

431
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:16,470
rare alleles and deleterious alleles are

432
00:17:14,548 --> 00:17:18,750
playing an important role what we expect

433
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,370
to see is that essentially low

434
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,588
expression will be the product of lots

435
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:24,178
of rare alleles and high expression will

436
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:24,688
also be the product of lots of rare

437
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:29,009
alleles

438
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:31,200
well intermediate expression well you

439
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:34,019
know won't have an enrichment of rare

440
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,029
alleles and so this is the basic pattern

441
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:37,529
you would expect if you think that rare

442
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:40,798
alleles and deleterious alleles are

443
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:43,168
driving extremes in expression and so

444
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:46,440
what's the alternative hypothesis to

445
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:49,770
this well the alternative is that common

446
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,470
alleles actually get stacked up in a way

447
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:52,629
so it's

448
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,370
the extremes are being are the product

449
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,800
of lots of different common alleles and

450
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:58,959
so is that like they'd be common well

451
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,329
across the whole genome when we see

452
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,090
extremes in phenotype like flowering

453
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:06,099
time it's a is the product of dozens of

454
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:08,859
genes with essentially if relatively

455
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:10,389
common alleles gain stacked up in order

456
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:12,490
to produce those extremes of extreme

457
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,320
early flowering is the product of lots

458
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,450
of common alleles being stacked up the

459
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:18,399
extreme late flowering is deprived again

460
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:21,670
of lots of common alleles being stacked

461
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,560
up so a genome-wide scale that's the

462
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:25,390
pattern we actually do see common

463
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:27,399
alleles in general or what are

464
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:29,590
contributing to a lot of our extremes

465
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,840
and phenotypes but at the level of an

466
00:18:29,589 --> 00:18:33,759
individual gene recombination is of

467
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:36,939
course very limited there's a limited

468
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:39,879
amount of recombination in each from a

469
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:43,059
regulatory region and so this is a type

470
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,280
of area for extremes maybe the product

471
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:48,279
actually of a buildup of deleterious

472
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,930
mutations and so in Greg Gibson's model

473
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:52,720
what we would expect to see is

474
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,980
essentially a u-shape plot here if you

475
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,819
were to apply out the average number of

476
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:59,500
rare alleles on the Y and then on the X

477
00:18:57,819 --> 00:19:01,240
we go from low expression to high

478
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,150
expression we expect to see a u like

479
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:07,690
this if rare alleles are driving things

480
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:09,790
and that's exactly what Karl saw so when

481
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:14,380
he profile using these different maze

482
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:15,909
lines essentially low expression where

483
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,590
we see low expression we see this more

484
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:19,870
than doubling and the number of rare

485
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:22,089
alleles and we do also see an increase

486
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:24,099
in high expression as the product of an

487
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:26,049
increased number of rare alleles so both

488
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:28,119
extremes seem to be pushed by rare

489
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:30,789
alleles asymmetry between these two

490
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:32,559
suggests that rare and deleterious

491
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:35,079
alleles it's easier to knockdown

492
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,659
expression than it is to increase

493
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:40,000
expression so both directions we see

494
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,890
that extreme on both sides and so where

495
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,990
you really want to be is somewhere here

496
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:47,410
in the middle that's the sweet spot

497
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:49,299
where expression is it's somewhere in

498
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:52,480
the middle you don't want to be at

499
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:55,419
either of those two extremes and that

500
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,569
basic hypothesis about extremes and the

501
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:00,910
wind essentially the optimal organism is

502
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:02,769
an organism that essentially has balance

503
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:04,179
expression everywhere is effectively the

504
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:06,398
dosage hypothesis

505
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:08,619
Jim Burt's allure has been advocating

506
00:20:06,398 --> 00:20:12,668
this for a number of years as the basis

507
00:20:08,618 --> 00:20:15,548
of mace heterosis and it works well with

508
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:17,679
a model you're with deleterious mutation

509
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:20,499
since and so on but essentially let me

510
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,730
explain the model essentially and if you

511
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:25,569
have balanced expression into all your

512
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:28,179
genes your protein complexes your

513
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:30,970
metabolism everything else is kind of

514
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:33,700
that goes as expected that produces a

515
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:36,940
healthy plant if you have extremes in

516
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:39,730
expression your protein complexes don't

517
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:41,350
form correctly metabolites you get

518
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:43,149
buildup of the wrong metabolites to the

519
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:45,548
wrong time points you essentially are

520
00:20:43,148 --> 00:20:48,099
wasting energy all over the place if you

521
00:20:45,548 --> 00:20:50,740
are not in the center everywhere and

522
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:53,888
that produces weak and inefficient

523
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:56,079
organisms and so in order to be optimal

524
00:20:53,888 --> 00:21:01,209
you should be average everywhere that's

525
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:04,589
kind of is the key element there and so

526
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:07,360
that's what the basic model in heterosis

527
00:21:04,589 --> 00:21:08,980
works just fine with this type of model

528
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:13,868
that essentially be averaged everywhere

529
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:15,730
and you will be highly vigorous and so

530
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:19,028
what Carl did is he came up with a very

531
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:20,710
simple statistic of just cumulative

532
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:22,808
dysregulation across every gene in the

533
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,519
genome he didn't give any genes greater

534
00:21:22,808 --> 00:21:27,628
weight or a different way from what we

535
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:30,759
know that's very naive but essentially

536
00:21:27,628 --> 00:21:34,178
communitive dysregulation does correlate

537
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:36,519
with see weight or yield he also used an

538
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:39,548
approach where he created a statistic

539
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:43,028
based on the deviations in expression in

540
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:44,558
order to try to predict the amount of

541
00:21:43,028 --> 00:21:46,659
variance explained in seed weight and

542
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:49,450
here he was able to find anywhere from

543
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:53,440
20 to 30 percent of seed whey is being

544
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:55,379
explained by this dysregulation these

545
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,669
patterns of dysregulation so we think

546
00:21:55,378 --> 00:22:00,459
think that maybe about half of

547
00:21:57,669 --> 00:22:03,820
phenotypic variation is coming out of

548
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:05,440
processes that involve these dosage

549
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:07,990
aspects of essentially not having

550
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,360
balanced dosage at each gene the genome

551
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:13,230
is perdu producing a lot of the

552
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:15,849
phenotypic variation that is out there

553
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,569
okay now I told you about those two

554
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:19,759
different approaches that we were using

555
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:21,349
from the top to the bottom but if we

556
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,779
really want to get down to individual

557
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:25,429
nucleotides so that we know we can start

558
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:27,470
talking about editing and so on how do

559
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:29,210
we get there part of the problem with

560
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:32,240
all these deleterious mutations is that

561
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:34,549
they're rare it's very difficult to map

562
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,410
rare things okay and we don't want to

563
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:37,940
spend a whole bunch of time taking every

564
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:40,550
rare allele that's out there and III

565
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:43,460
Singh it's a little frequency and order

566
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:45,859
in order to map it and so this is where

567
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:48,289
machine learning comes in where we're

568
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:51,649
effectively learning the rules of how

569
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:53,869
the genome works so we can spot these

570
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:57,470
rare and deleterious mutations all

571
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:59,000
across the genome and we've been are

572
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,740
starting to think and apply this all

573
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,690
across essentially the central dogma and

574
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,180
beyond but what I'll be talking to you

575
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:07,160
about today is how we're using machine

576
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:10,430
learning to model both chromatin

577
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:13,970
structure and expression patterns in

578
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:16,759
maize and actually amazing sorghum and

579
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:19,850
so you know why are we talking about

580
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:21,410
machine learning well you know obviously

581
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:25,099
it's a it's a hot topic you're hearing

582
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:27,170
about it all the time you know you can

583
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:29,689
be photographing or machine learning

584
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:32,240
models will identify you incredibly

585
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:35,720
quickly you walk underneath the camera

586
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,150
it knows exactly who you are and the

587
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,579
fact that that can be done and could be

588
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,440
done for us you know why can't shouldn't

589
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:46,009
we apply these incredible tools to

590
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,570
understanding molecular biology too and

591
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:49,460
the key reason machine learning does

592
00:23:47,569 --> 00:23:51,769
work though is it allows us to process

593
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:54,289
massive amounts of data it allows us

594
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:56,720
really to generalize rules from one

595
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:58,399
portion of the genome to the rest it

596
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,500
allows us to generalize rules from a

597
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,340
reference genotype so all the other

598
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:06,710
genotypes and finally if the model is

599
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:08,599
robust enough if we can be used to

600
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:11,360
really determine if it given genetic

601
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:13,429
variant matters and I think some of the

602
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,589
pushback on machine learning has been

603
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:18,920
historically that people especially in

604
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:22,429
the basic science world is that it's a

605
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:24,769
black box model okay and absolutely you

606
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:26,630
can treat machine learning entirely in a

607
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:28,639
black as a black box model and not

608
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:31,549
understand the underlying biology that

609
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,960
goes under is underlying it

610
00:24:31,548 --> 00:24:34,819
as I'll show you we've been doing a lot

611
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,919
more work to essentially once you create

612
00:24:34,819 --> 00:24:39,470
the model try to probe the model and ask

613
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:41,179
the question what's going on what did it

614
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:44,499
learn and now can they teach us

615
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:47,389
something about what was going on there

616
00:24:44,499 --> 00:24:49,308
so I'm going to tell you about a series

617
00:24:47,388 --> 00:24:51,048
of models and these were developed by

618
00:24:49,308 --> 00:24:53,178
three great postdocs in the group

619
00:24:51,048 --> 00:24:56,028
Katherine Mejia hi Wong and Jacob

620
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:58,639
Washburn and the models are fairly

621
00:24:56,028 --> 00:25:02,028
straightforward to explain what we

622
00:24:58,638 --> 00:25:04,579
wanted to do was take sequence and in

623
00:25:02,028 --> 00:25:07,849
just sequence so no other annotation on

624
00:25:04,579 --> 00:25:10,638
the sequence we don't want to know what

625
00:25:07,849 --> 00:25:12,709
methylation SAS is we don't want to know

626
00:25:10,638 --> 00:25:14,599
what the chrome any of the chromatin

627
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:17,778
structure I just want to take sequence

628
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:20,658
and from that be able to predict the

629
00:25:17,778 --> 00:25:23,089
following is the chromatin open what

630
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:25,249
transcription factor binds there is it a

631
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:28,278
pseudo gene and what is the expression

632
00:25:25,249 --> 00:25:30,288
level of The Associated gene next to

633
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:32,388
that sequence and the second class of

634
00:25:30,288 --> 00:25:35,749
models is if I have two homologous

635
00:25:32,388 --> 00:25:38,329
sequences and I differ differentiate the

636
00:25:35,749 --> 00:25:40,278
expression of allele a versus a lil B

637
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:42,378
and figure out which one has the greater

638
00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:44,569
level of expression so those are the

639
00:25:42,378 --> 00:25:47,298
five models we've been exploring last

640
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:49,778
year and essentially we're using a

641
00:25:47,298 --> 00:25:51,819
couple different approaches the first is

642
00:25:49,778 --> 00:25:54,048
coming from natural language processing

643
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:56,298
very similar to when you type something

644
00:25:54,048 --> 00:25:58,128
into Google and it's trying to process

645
00:25:56,298 --> 00:26:01,038
your language and figure out what you're

646
00:25:58,128 --> 00:26:03,378
after and what we've done here

647
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:05,089
Catherines work on these Kaymer language

648
00:26:03,378 --> 00:26:07,459
based approaches you're breaking a

649
00:26:05,089 --> 00:26:09,168
sequence into k-mers and then as I'll

650
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,419
show you your tree is essentially a bag

651
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:12,710
of words that we're modeling and then

652
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:15,499
the second class of models are these

653
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:17,600
convolutional neural Nets historically

654
00:26:15,499 --> 00:26:22,129
they've been used to essentially do

655
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:24,618
image processing and we're essentially

656
00:26:22,128 --> 00:26:27,769
converting sequences and ordered images

657
00:26:24,618 --> 00:26:29,839
and then we're using the CNN's processed

658
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:31,909
them at different scales and then using

659
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:34,939
neural nets to integrate these processed

660
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:37,759
sequences so a little bit more detail on

661
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:40,429
what the camer bag of word type models

662
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:43,069
are so let's take DNA and effectively

663
00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:45,769
it's a bet could be treated as a bag of

664
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:49,279
words very short sequences or the came

665
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:52,879
we take those we count them up and then

666
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:54,379
we can essentially fit them in a

667
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,679
regression model to make a prediction

668
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:59,870
and a bag of words model is no more

669
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:03,320
complicated than that the vector based

670
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:05,899
ones which rely on the ordering of the

671
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:07,639
words is more complicated and some more

672
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,350
powerful but essentially the bag of

673
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,630
words one is as simple it's just

674
00:27:09,349 --> 00:27:16,279
counting up Kaymer's and fitting it to a

675
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:17,690
regression model okay when we need to

676
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:19,730
talk about the convolutional neural nets

677
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:22,610
we're essentially taking a sequence and

678
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:24,920
each base pair is getting Rhian coded

679
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:26,419
and so what you're seeing is essentially

680
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,090
we're making a black and white picture

681
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:32,090
where A's are encoded here Caesar

682
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:34,279
encoded there and then from that we take

683
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:36,379
convolutions and what convolutions are

684
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:38,420
doing is that they're looking across

685
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,880
that image and trying to highlight

686
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:42,679
various features at certain scales that

687
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,400
then can be passed on to the neural nets

688
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:50,120
and so those convolutions that you probe

689
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,620
the regions summarize that information

690
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:54,049
there and then once we have those

691
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:57,169
convolutions with neural nets we can

692
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:59,389
relate those convolutions to any trait

693
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:01,640
or attribute in our case we want to

694
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:05,390
relate that sequence to expression

695
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,710
levels and so a little bit more about

696
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,970
how we measure whether or not we've been

697
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:10,700
able to create machine learning mouths

698
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:13,670
or have any good already and use we use

699
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:15,799
whatever known as the ROC curves or

700
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:17,509
receiver operating characteristic curves

701
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:19,039
and essentially these are just ways to

702
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:21,890
count how well you're doing and

703
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:24,409
measuring comparing your truths and

704
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:26,690
false positive rates and essentially the

705
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:28,970
way we've set them up for the this talk

706
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:31,759
here our random expectation is along the

707
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:33,679
diagonal and we expect that to

708
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:37,670
essentially produce an area under the

709
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:39,470
curve or a ROC curve of about 0.5 if we

710
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:41,690
have a perfect classifier the table it

711
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:44,600
of completely differentiate to two

712
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:46,910
separate classes with no errors we it'll

713
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:49,399
follow along there and essentially its

714
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:51,440
area under the curve would be 100% and

715
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,970
so this is one way we measure whether or

716
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,259
not we've been able to create a machine

717
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:59,480
learning model that is of value and so

718
00:28:57,259 --> 00:29:01,910
Katherine took this type of model

719
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,309
was using the chip seek data from the

720
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:07,640
transcription factor fee of for to train

721
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:09,529
on and she was able to using that bag of

722
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,690
words model be able to create a model

723
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:15,889
that had very high levels of accuracy at

724
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:18,230
0.99 and ascend she was almost perfectly

725
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:20,030
classified where each of those

726
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:21,980
transcription factors were binding all

727
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:25,420
across the genome and it wasn't just

728
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:28,490
that transcription factor she's used the

729
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:30,710
chip seek data from not at one also very

730
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:33,920
high levels of accuracy we had emanation

731
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:35,750
open chromatin data that she was able to

732
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,480
use and again it was able to Train very

733
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:40,640
good models there and then she also was

734
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,370
able to classify core promoter sequences

735
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,710
with high levels of accuracy so

736
00:29:43,369 --> 00:29:47,419
essentially we and she's been able to

737
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:49,970
now repeat this for about a hundred

738
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:53,420
other transcription factors with other

739
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:55,549
collaborators and effectively we can now

740
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,440
create machine learning models that

741
00:29:55,549 --> 00:30:00,250
model where transcription factors going

742
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,450
to bind with high levels of accuracy and

743
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:03,890
essentially start annotating all sorts

744
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:06,470
of other genomes with it especially

745
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:08,750
within maize but one of the questions we

746
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:11,059
did want to ask is how good are these

747
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:13,220
models transferable from maize to say

748
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,909
other species and so Katherine asked

749
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,850
that question

750
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:18,920
she took her core promoter model and so

751
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:22,579
it was great in maize but then she took

752
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:24,320
it to sorghum yeah it was okay it's not

753
00:30:22,579 --> 00:30:26,359
you know the transferability from mesa

754
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:28,669
sorghum wasn't as great as we would have

755
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:30,139
hoped there now we know strategies about

756
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,820
how we could make a model that work

757
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,800
across both of them the key element is

758
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:35,779
we would probably train across both

759
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:37,909
maize and sorghum simultaneously rather

760
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:40,579
than just training on one species at a

761
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:44,540
time but some of the models for example

762
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:46,669
her not at one model for maize it

763
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:48,649
actually had superb transfer ability all

764
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:51,590
the way to rice so that when transferred

765
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:54,410
65 million years without a problem so

766
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:55,939
each of these models some have high

767
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:57,740
levels of transfer ability some don't

768
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:01,160
but there are strategies for figuring

769
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:04,849
out and improving the transfer ability

770
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:07,040
across species these camera models are

771
00:31:04,849 --> 00:31:09,379
also really we talked about the black

772
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:13,220
box aspect all of that was pretty much

773
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:15,830
black box you can open up the models

774
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:18,829
okay how did the model figure out that

775
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:20,839
this is a core promotor and so of course

776
00:31:18,829 --> 00:31:22,849
we know the Tata box should play an

777
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:24,649
important role in defining a core

778
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:26,808
promoter sequence and so what she's

779
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:29,298
plotted out here is essentially the

780
00:31:26,808 --> 00:31:30,859
weight of each Kaymer and there's

781
00:31:29,298 --> 00:31:32,720
thousands of Kaymer she was looking at

782
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:35,178
but these are the Tata light cameras and

783
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,669
the most important ones for defining a

784
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:39,350
core promoter are listed here as you see

785
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:40,788
they line up right next to where the

786
00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:43,788
transcriptional start site is so

787
00:31:40,788 --> 00:31:45,769
essentially this black box model the way

788
00:31:43,788 --> 00:31:48,920
it learned how transcription starts and

789
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:50,529
in maize was finding the tata box and

790
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,669
[Music]

791
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:54,168
learning essentially the rules that of

792
00:31:52,669 --> 00:31:56,900
course obviously everybody's known this

793
00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:59,960
for years but it was able to learn

794
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:04,100
effectively the right rules on how this

795
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:08,259
worked ok we've also though found that

796
00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:10,788
training models can be tricky and

797
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:12,829
machine learning models they're

798
00:32:10,788 --> 00:32:16,129
incredibly proud they can learn and

799
00:32:12,829 --> 00:32:17,569
memorize virtually anything the question

800
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:20,690
is whether or not it's letting what you

801
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:23,240
wanted to learn and this is where the

802
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:26,210
last six months or so we've been really

803
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,400
doing a lot more work to make sure we're

804
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:31,340
training on the attributes of the models

805
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:33,110
that we really care about and turned out

806
00:32:31,339 --> 00:32:34,699
that a lot of our models especially when

807
00:32:33,109 --> 00:32:37,308
we went across lots of different genes

808
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:40,069
our models were effectively able to

809
00:32:37,308 --> 00:32:41,960
memorize the evolutionary history of how

810
00:32:40,069 --> 00:32:44,240
every genes relate to every other team

811
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,038
okay which isn't you know that's an

812
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,509
interesting evolutionary story but

813
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:49,759
doesn't teach you the rules of how

814
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:51,769
malleco biology works and exactly how a

815
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:54,650
promoter works we didn't want to just

816
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:56,480
memorize evolution so what we've done is

817
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:58,880
we've started to think through how can

818
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,730
we use evolution as our aid not

819
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,650
something we just memorize and so we've

820
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,538
set up two different ways of setting up

821
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:07,940
our training versus our testing the

822
00:33:05,538 --> 00:33:09,829
first one I want a group set up was

823
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,929
essentially gene family guided training

824
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:13,668
where you train on one set of gene

825
00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:15,919
families so you take half the gene

826
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:17,780
families across mate and you train on

827
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,179
them but you hide all the other gene

828
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:22,668
families but you test if your model is

829
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:24,350
doing very well with a group of gene

830
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:26,720
families the model has never seen before

831
00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:28,548
if you are learning things

832
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,140
that are transferable to gene families

833
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:32,329
you've never seen before then it's

834
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,909
likely a good model it just hasn't just

835
00:33:32,329 --> 00:33:37,730
memorized recent evolution in order to

836
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:39,860
figure things out and the second way to

837
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:42,650
do it is to essentially take a couple

838
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:45,019
related species to one another and

839
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:48,288
essentially compare the orthologs

840
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:49,639
against one another in order to do the

841
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:51,230
cassette of the contrast there and

842
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,480
that's what we call the ortholog

843
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:57,019
contrast training model I'll go into

844
00:33:53,480 --> 00:34:00,140
that and Jacob Washburn has been leading

845
00:33:57,019 --> 00:34:01,490
the effort in those types of analyses so

846
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,799
in that first one

847
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:05,599
hi everyone to ask the question can he

848
00:34:03,798 --> 00:34:07,519
train a model to identify what are the

849
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:09,199
pseudo genes across the genome and which

850
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,050
are the genes that are highly expressed

851
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:14,809
and so normally he's taking the promoter

852
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:17,769
sequence the utrs about 50 and her base

853
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:21,259
pairs up there 1,500 base pairs on the

854
00:34:17,769 --> 00:34:23,269
3-prime utr and beyond beyond the

855
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,980
terminator throwing that into a model

856
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:28,009
letting the convolutional neural net

857
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:30,800
then predict expression levels and what

858
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:32,629
he did is he took a data set where we

859
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,879
had expression across 66 different

860
00:34:32,628 --> 00:34:36,829
tissues and took the maximal expression

861
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:40,159
level and he asked the question kenny

862
00:34:36,829 --> 00:34:42,079
differentiate between the genes that are

863
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,329
never expressed versus the genes that

864
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,128
are expressed that's the combination of

865
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:50,210
these two or just the really highly

866
00:34:46,128 --> 00:34:51,829
expressed genes and i preempt this next

867
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:54,139
slide we're a lot better at

868
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:56,148
differentiating between this group

869
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:58,220
versus that group and differentiating

870
00:34:56,148 --> 00:35:01,809
between here and all of these but the

871
00:34:58,219 --> 00:35:03,588
model is still quite good and

872
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:06,858
essentially when you try to

873
00:35:03,588 --> 00:35:10,429
differentiate between off versus high he

874
00:35:06,858 --> 00:35:12,108
has about an 80% accuracy there and if

875
00:35:10,429 --> 00:35:13,639
you just use either the promoter or the

876
00:35:12,108 --> 00:35:15,469
terminator sequence and if you combine

877
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:15,858
the two together we get a substantial

878
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:18,199
boost

879
00:35:15,858 --> 00:35:21,409
so essentially signal for whether or not

880
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:23,719
the gene is on or a high is coming from

881
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:26,329
both the 5 Prime and 3 prime end of the

882
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:32,179
gene and we can create a pretty good

883
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:33,829
model classify each of those the the

884
00:35:32,179 --> 00:35:35,358
second question that we were interested

885
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:36,920
in is which allele is more highly

886
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:40,610
expressed here we're taking two

887
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:42,680
homologous sequences and from a person

888
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:44,300
quantitative genetics background this is

889
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:46,909
really kind of the fundamental question

890
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:49,850
I have of molecular biology I want to

891
00:35:46,909 --> 00:35:52,039
know a given variant does it change does

892
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:54,619
it make something go up does it make it

893
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:56,509
go down or does it have no effect those

894
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:58,219
are the once I have to get down to the

895
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:59,570
right side of those then I can throw it

896
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:00,980
into a more complex model of

897
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:04,010
quantitative genetics and parameterize

898
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:06,969
everything so this is the salah' model I

899
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:10,700
really want to use in order to

900
00:36:06,969 --> 00:36:13,159
parameterize the entire genome and the

901
00:36:10,699 --> 00:36:15,349
way Jacob has gone about this is

902
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:17,359
essentially reframing it using these

903
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:19,279
orthologs and I mentioned we're

904
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,110
essentially comparing the orthologs in

905
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,240
two different portions or two different

906
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:24,740
species training on them and then

907
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:27,079
testing on a different set there so

908
00:36:24,739 --> 00:36:28,579
instead of just having one sequence and

909
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:30,860
fruit making a prediction of phenotype

910
00:36:28,579 --> 00:36:33,380
we're taking two sequences and comparing

911
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,360
them and what we found is that rather

912
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:37,369
than actually predicting exactly the

913
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,930
difference in expression we're most

914
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:41,539
interested in really predicting whether

915
00:36:38,929 --> 00:36:43,789
or not it went up or went down and I'll

916
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:45,380
also highlight that we found out that

917
00:36:43,789 --> 00:36:47,739
there's a lot of genes especially when

918
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,789
we have to compare between species that

919
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:51,559
very subtle differences in the

920
00:36:49,789 --> 00:36:53,480
expression we're not very good at

921
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:55,699
predicting whether or not a gene went up

922
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,829
or down slightly between major sorghum

923
00:36:55,699 --> 00:36:59,869
but if we take a look at the top twenty

924
00:36:57,829 --> 00:37:01,909
or twenty percent of the genes that

925
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:03,710
really moved up and down in an

926
00:37:01,909 --> 00:37:06,049
expression between maize and sorghum or

927
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:08,659
logs then we have a very good prediction

928
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:11,060
accuracy okay and some of this is maybe

929
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:12,230
our ability to be able to really tell

930
00:37:11,059 --> 00:37:14,269
whether or not something went up or down

931
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:19,219
isn't great if the expression

932
00:37:14,269 --> 00:37:21,320
differences are really slight so Jacob

933
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:24,859
took this model very similar to what

934
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:27,080
high exactly the same way that I broke

935
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:28,550
up the sequences here but he's

936
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:30,349
essentially taking two genes in the

937
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:33,380
model and then letting the convolutional

938
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:36,650
neural ad pick out which hot ortholog is

939
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:40,280
more highly expressed and so the pattern

940
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:42,860
here was was somewhat different so the

941
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:45,740
first thing to highlight is that the

942
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:47,570
promoter five prime end versus three

943
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:48,649
prime end it was really the three prime

944
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,840
end that was giving us much more

945
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:52,910
information than the promoter was and we

946
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,470
didn't get much improvement by combining

947
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:56,838
the two of them together

948
00:37:54,469 --> 00:37:59,629
and as I mentioned we if we only look at

949
00:37:56,838 --> 00:38:01,578
the 20% of the genes and really a big

950
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:03,380
expression differences then we have a

951
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,700
really accurate model there's real

952
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:07,700
subtle differences between maize and

953
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:09,679
sorghum we're not able to pick those out

954
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:11,929
particularly well but if there's a big

955
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:14,029
difference we can create a classifier

956
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:15,649
that's actually really accurate but the

957
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:18,800
interesting thing is most of the signal

958
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:21,108
was coming from the Terminator and of

959
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,150
the sequences and to plot that out again

960
00:38:21,108 --> 00:38:25,219
we can once we've created these models

961
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:27,588
we can go through base pair by base pair

962
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:29,539
and ask what did the model learn what

963
00:38:27,588 --> 00:38:32,029
base pairs were most important for

964
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:33,679
making that prediction and so that's

965
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:35,930
what you're seeing here is essentially

966
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:37,759
these are called saliency Maps and what

967
00:38:35,929 --> 00:38:39,588
they're doing is they're telling us what

968
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,740
base pair by base pair is providing the

969
00:38:39,588 --> 00:38:44,838
most information and high expression and

970
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:47,449
it turned out when we do that ortholog

971
00:38:44,838 --> 00:38:49,909
contrast model the the sequence is right

972
00:38:47,449 --> 00:38:52,429
before the Terminator sequence were the

973
00:38:49,909 --> 00:38:55,909
most important for determining the

974
00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:57,980
expression levels Wow if we look at

975
00:38:55,909 --> 00:39:00,289
pseudogenes five prime utrs were most

976
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,639
important and so on so we are learning

977
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:03,349
that you know for each of these

978
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:05,118
different models to proportion to the

979
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:06,559
gene seem to be most important for

980
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,760
explaining this so what this is

981
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:13,400
suggesting is the model that I was

982
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,400
working on was really asking questions

983
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,349
about how different classes of genes

984
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,818
control their regulation that seems to

985
00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:22,250
be an issue that's substantially

986
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:25,750
regulated by the five prime UTR the

987
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:30,588
promoter sequence and so on how to

988
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:32,929
define tuning of how one gene changes

989
00:39:30,588 --> 00:39:34,789
its expression through evolutionary time

990
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:37,818
seems to be coming more from the three

991
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:41,210
prime UTR side so whether the gene is on

992
00:39:37,818 --> 00:39:43,429
or off by prime whether that exact

993
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:45,619
amount of expression that's left on and

994
00:39:43,429 --> 00:39:47,358
the fine-tuning of it and what makes the

995
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:49,180
difference between maize and sorghum may

996
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:52,940
well be coming from the three prime UTR

997
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:57,169
side of things so at least that's our

998
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:59,510
current hypothesis so I want to end up

999
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:01,400
here though is can we also probe these

1000
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,839
models and get down to that level we're

1001
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:06,079
really starting to ask the question can

1002
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:08,449
we edit and Kathryn took one of her

1003
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,609
models she lined up her day

1004
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:12,828
and her models nodded one against

1005
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:15,858
empirical data the sir Hakes group

1006
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:17,480
produced a decade ago and where they

1007
00:40:15,858 --> 00:40:20,059
tweaked individual base pairs and then

1008
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,980
did a competition assay to ask do these

1009
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:23,570
individual base pairs matter and what

1010
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,608
you'll see is that where she predicts

1011
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:28,088
high regulatory probabilities that's

1012
00:40:25,608 --> 00:40:30,670
what we see and where she predicts lo

1013
00:40:28,088 --> 00:40:33,380
and these individual base pair changes

1014
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:36,079
they line up with the competition assays

1015
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:38,088
so I think we've gotten to a level where

1016
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,519
these machine learning models can be

1017
00:40:38,088 --> 00:40:42,380
trained that they have the sensitivity

1018
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:44,719
to ask a question if one or two bases

1019
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:48,588
are changed here that that's likely to

1020
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:51,858
produce an effect so what are the limits

1021
00:40:48,588 --> 00:40:53,358
of our current models so if there's

1022
00:40:51,858 --> 00:40:55,848
deleterious models I was telling you

1023
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:57,679
about they're good at splitting neutral

1024
00:40:55,849 --> 00:40:59,180
from functional and what do I mean by

1025
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:01,309
that let's say there's 80 million

1026
00:40:59,179 --> 00:41:03,529
variants out there I think we're at a

1027
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:05,630
stage we're at least four amino acids I

1028
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:08,510
can tell you these are the 2,000 or

1029
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:10,519
3,000 bad amino acids out there so from

1030
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:12,260
one point of view we separated 3,000

1031
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:15,139
away from 80 million that seems really

1032
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:17,329
good we're not very good at telling you

1033
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:19,909
among those last 3,000 which is the

1034
00:41:17,329 --> 00:41:23,140
worst one okay we're not very good at

1035
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:25,879
ranking within those last three thousand

1036
00:41:23,139 --> 00:41:27,710
we're also when we go across this much

1037
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:31,160
diversity we're missing the regulatory

1038
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:33,829
landscape how maze is controlling this

1039
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:36,170
expression versus rabbitov sis things

1040
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:37,700
have changed so dramatically that the

1041
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:41,329
rule we can't learn all the rules from

1042
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:43,730
rabbitov sis how each individual gene is

1043
00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:45,920
being expressed and made and of course

1044
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:48,349
we have very diverse physiology so how

1045
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,420
are we working to get around that well

1046
00:41:48,349 --> 00:41:52,700
initially we only had four species of

1047
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:55,099
Andrew pagana and so what we're doing

1048
00:41:52,699 --> 00:41:56,838
now is we've just got started in our

1049
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:58,550
project that's been funded by the

1050
00:41:56,838 --> 00:42:00,769
National Science Foundation with my

1051
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,430
colleagues toby kellogg matt Huffer jeff

1052
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:03,380
ross abara

1053
00:42:01,429 --> 00:42:05,809
adam steeple and cheese son and we're

1054
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:09,289
gonna focus on one clade and so why do

1055
00:42:05,809 --> 00:42:11,929
we care about focusing on a clade well I

1056
00:42:09,289 --> 00:42:13,909
mentioned initially that Mays we've

1057
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:15,618
learned a lot from Ace but we with a

1058
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:17,000
thousand genomes for the sequencing we

1059
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:19,550
only capture about three million years

1060
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,340
of evolution if we were to apply that

1061
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:26,030
same thousand GM's worth of information

1062
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:27,890
across this entire plate from say 900

1063
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:30,860
different Andrew pagana we would capture

1064
00:42:27,889 --> 00:42:34,099
1.5 billion years of evolutionary time

1065
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:36,410
okay so we've dramatically increased the

1066
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:38,119
total amount of time by 300 fold that

1067
00:42:36,409 --> 00:42:40,670
we're now sampling I was telling you how

1068
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:42,739
sensitive evolution is at detecting

1069
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:46,909
Fitness differences but now we've

1070
00:42:42,739 --> 00:42:49,519
turbocharged it now we have 300 times

1071
00:42:46,909 --> 00:42:53,029
more information and the key thing is

1072
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:54,650
within this clade they all share nad PC

1073
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:56,660
for photosynthesis they're all the same

1074
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:59,360
roughly and the big scheme of things the

1075
00:42:56,659 --> 00:43:01,909
same physiology and similar

1076
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:03,680
developmental patterns so we're not

1077
00:43:01,909 --> 00:43:05,239
trying to make models that work all the

1078
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:07,669
way out to arrive at ops we're working

1079
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:09,379
with a group of grasses that untrain

1080
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:13,789
system says many of them all look very

1081
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:17,150
similar to one another okay but they've

1082
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:18,710
adapted all over the planet so one way

1083
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:22,250
to view this is this is really

1084
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:24,349
saturation evolutionary analysis every

1085
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:27,050
ancestral base pair here has actually

1086
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:28,789
been mutated 50 times somewhere coming

1087
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:31,160
out here into those 900 different

1088
00:43:28,789 --> 00:43:34,610
species so every base pair has been

1089
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:36,139
whacked by evolution and mutations all

1090
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:38,150
over the place and so we can actually

1091
00:43:36,139 --> 00:43:39,949
start measuring and constraint directly

1092
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:43,160
these species although they

1093
00:43:39,949 --> 00:43:44,929
developmentally look very similar i've

1094
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:48,199
actually adapted to an incredible range

1095
00:43:44,929 --> 00:43:51,259
of also environmental adaptations from

1096
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:54,710
ross to very hot temperatures throughout

1097
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:57,890
the environments to essentially in

1098
00:43:54,710 --> 00:44:00,019
swamps and so from across this entire

1099
00:43:57,889 --> 00:44:01,819
species we can learn how these species

1100
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:05,570
have adapted to some Ahlers diverse

1101
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:08,780
environmental adaptations and so we're

1102
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:11,269
working to essentially sample sequence

1103
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:13,400
analyze all 900 of those species genomes

1104
00:44:11,269 --> 00:44:14,989
in the next several years and we really

1105
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,720
see that evolution and machine learning

1106
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:19,489
we will be bringing those together where

1107
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:22,069
we see that evolution provides us this

1108
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:24,529
nearly infinite level of mutagenesis it

1109
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:26,210
provides us an ability to see Fitness

1110
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:29,210
effects that are a thousandfold more

1111
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:30,769
powerful than field experiments and it

1112
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:32,780
provides this incredible range of

1113
00:44:30,769 --> 00:44:34,400
environmental histories well machine

1114
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:36,200
learning is allowing us to scale to

1115
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,088
genome sizes learning can

1116
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:39,588
generalized and we can throw virtually

1117
00:44:38,088 --> 00:44:42,469
anything into a machine learning model

1118
00:44:39,588 --> 00:44:46,250
so heterogeneous inputs can go in and we

1119
00:44:42,469 --> 00:44:48,348
can still make sense of it so these are

1120
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:50,480
the may the tools we have handed here

1121
00:44:48,349 --> 00:44:52,579
here and this is where we're working a

1122
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,409
lot now is to figure out what are the

1123
00:44:52,579 --> 00:44:57,010
most intelligent ways to combine all

1124
00:44:54,409 --> 00:44:59,779
these together so we can identify

1125
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:01,400
prioritize those individual snips so

1126
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:03,530
that we can go from a place where we

1127
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,900
have models of how each of the various

1128
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:08,000
steps and that central dog will work all

1129
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:10,309
the way out to physiology we can then

1130
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,380
test those hypotheses based on how they

1131
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:14,539
work in standing variation if they work

1132
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:17,690
well we go ahead and we start editing

1133
00:45:14,539 --> 00:45:19,369
and selecting away so I want to end here

1134
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:21,920
that a lot of folks my group have

1135
00:45:19,369 --> 00:45:23,539
contributed to these ideas I highlighted

1136
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,119
many of the people the postdocs and

1137
00:45:23,539 --> 00:45:29,088
students who produce a lot of exact data

1138
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:30,800
sets I was talking about but my group

1139
00:45:29,088 --> 00:45:34,429
and all those great collaborations and

1140
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,780
Babli we've been probably really three

1141
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:37,730
people in the group really helped bring

1142
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:39,829
everything together and that Center for

1143
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:43,170
May Peter Bradbury and Sarah Miller and

1144
00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:50,050
I'd be happy to take some questions

1145
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:50,050
[Applause]

1146
00:45:52,300 --> 00:46:05,089
seems like a moving car right so I mean

1147
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,980
yeah so the question is how do you

1148
00:46:05,088 --> 00:46:10,549
change four different developmental time

1149
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:12,800
points and everything so it's you've a

1150
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:17,269
venturi right now everything is at the

1151
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:20,200
same developmental stage okay and so the

1152
00:46:17,269 --> 00:46:23,630
models we've created are at it for a

1153
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:25,699
developmental state okay or stage and so

1154
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:27,740
amazing sorghum we can still grow those

1155
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:29,659
two plants side-by-side one another we

1156
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:32,379
can collect expression data side-by-side

1157
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:34,279
for one another and make sense of them

1158
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:36,740
one of the good things though about

1159
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,960
expression the data sets are so rich you

1160
00:46:36,739 --> 00:46:41,029
can stage one another against yeah

1161
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,400
there's so many orthologs so it is

1162
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:44,869
possible to stage models against one

1163
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,940
another and just from the empirical data

1164
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:49,160
you can frequently figure out where you

1165
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:50,240
are in development where you are in

1166
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:52,190
various stages so I think

1167
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:53,750
long term though the models absolutely

1168
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:56,360
need to be generalized through the

1169
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:58,340
dynamic you know time changes and that's

1170
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:08,869
not something we've were interested in

1171
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:10,670
we have not I'm sure there will be

1172
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:12,460
situations where the models will not

1173
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:16,400
work as well for certain developmental

1174
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:18,019
aspects but you know I think a lot of

1175
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,300
them you know a lot of the development

1176
00:47:18,019 --> 00:47:22,460
is you know it's it is timing here

1177
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:24,050
they're stretched out or extended a

1178
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,429
little bit more and that produces the

1179
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:28,039
phenotypic effect that you were seeing

1180
00:47:25,429 --> 00:47:31,279
but some of the basic patterns and

1181
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:32,840
regulation are pretty similar I mean the

1182
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,670
fact that a lot of our maize and sorghum

1183
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:36,559
models the fact that we can even train a

1184
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:38,570
model and expression that's between

1185
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:57,590
maize and photographs really well says

1186
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:59,059
the rules are pretty much the same we're

1187
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:00,710
beneficial alleles much much more

1188
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:05,299
valuable than a gene that everyone

1189
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:08,320
already has right okay yeah so I think

1190
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:11,269
you know the the question is about rare

1191
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:14,510
rare advantageous or adaptive alleles

1192
00:48:11,269 --> 00:48:16,340
well so first off there's a certain

1193
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:18,880
level we're never going to capture every

1194
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:22,160
adaptive mutation that's out there but

1195
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,780
most adaptive mutations are if they're

1196
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:25,699
really truly our adapter for that

1197
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:28,400
population they will be common there

1198
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:31,279
well but like if you have like a manic

1199
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,660
stress like a new one you know a gene

1200
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,640
which functions like formerly worked

1201
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:36,639
really great against this nematode

1202
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:44,480
change oh yeah and I agree it's

1203
00:48:41,929 --> 00:48:47,179
situations where you have very rapidly

1204
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:51,559
changing you know a Red Queen situation

1205
00:48:47,179 --> 00:48:54,769
like biotic stress I think the different

1206
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:56,210
approaches really need to be used figure

1207
00:48:54,769 --> 00:48:57,320
out what are the useful alleles they're

1208
00:48:56,210 --> 00:49:01,460
Red Queen

1209
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:03,950
I would say is not yeah is this is not

1210
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:05,960
the approach to go find those alleles

1211
00:49:03,949 --> 00:49:07,579
I think there are other approaches that

1212
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:09,769
would be far more advantageous for

1213
00:49:07,579 --> 00:49:11,449
figuring out disease less items than

1214
00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:16,009
this but I would say most of the abiotic

1215
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:20,119
stresses they are yes they may fluctuate

1216
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:22,340
from year to year but over deep time all

1217
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:24,469
the organisms have seen drought they've

1218
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:26,450
seen flooding and things like that so a

1219
00:49:24,469 --> 00:49:28,699
lot of those alleles are maintained at

1220
00:49:26,449 --> 00:49:30,829
reasonable frequencies and over a

1221
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:33,559
wide-enough panel you'll be able to find

1222
00:49:30,829 --> 00:49:37,340
that that allele is adaptive it's common

1223
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:39,619
somewhere and it isn't truly R it may be

1224
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:42,140
rare in your little panel but if it

1225
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:43,429
really is adaptive and you are sampling

1226
00:49:42,139 --> 00:49:46,190
as much diversity to say the entire

1227
00:49:43,429 --> 00:49:55,639
range of pagani it'll become in a number

1228
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:58,700
of places yeah binding sites so since

1229
00:49:55,639 --> 00:50:03,409
the AUC is so high nine nine eight that

1230
00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:07,549
must be some features of that or the

1231
00:50:03,409 --> 00:50:13,099
connection between the binding sites

1232
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:16,070
sure friends or common features that's

1233
00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:19,130
it I don't know if Kathryn is here the

1234
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:19,610
ones that I know were Kathryn here no

1235
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:22,280
okay

1236
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:23,510
the ones that were not very high anybody

1237
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,100
else in lab wants to correct me feel

1238
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:27,170
free the ones that were not high

1239
00:50:25,099 --> 00:50:30,259
generally the chip seek experiments were

1240
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:33,680
pretty bad okay so the biggest thing

1241
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:37,300
we've seen for the improvement of the

1242
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:40,099
quality of the models is replication of

1243
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:42,350
numerous chip seek experiments and when

1244
00:50:40,099 --> 00:50:44,150
they are replicated and you line up the

1245
00:50:42,349 --> 00:50:47,210
experiment over and over again those

1246
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:48,740
sites can be modeled really well so the

1247
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:51,490
neat thing also Kathryn has done is

1248
00:50:48,739 --> 00:50:53,869
she's been able to take those models and

1249
00:50:51,489 --> 00:50:55,459
compare you know for these hundreds

1250
00:50:53,869 --> 00:50:57,319
transcription factors compare how what

1251
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:59,210
the model looks like against each one

1252
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,740
for each transcription factor and the

1253
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:01,340
families of transcription factors fall

1254
00:51:00,739 --> 00:51:05,179
out of it

1255
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:07,610
so suggesting that essentially it really

1256
00:51:05,179 --> 00:51:15,049
is learning the basic processes by which

1257
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:17,480
these TX are binding yep yes thank you

1258
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:20,210
so much I'm just looking at

1259
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:22,969
do you think there's a change across the

1260
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:25,699
time future mutations and other factors

1261
00:51:22,969 --> 00:51:28,519
so does it mean the product that we have

1262
00:51:25,699 --> 00:51:31,669
today even their existence for diseases

1263
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:33,500
for us the same we'll also have a change

1264
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:37,579
for tomorrow a that the was--or it's a

1265
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:41,150
beta and then is that way of stopping or

1266
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:49,250
minimizing this changes across time and

1267
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:51,289
then looking for this so I think the

1268
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:54,980
question of whether or not you know we

1269
00:51:51,289 --> 00:51:56,690
reduced her own mutation rate higher

1270
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,920
eukaryotes have you know there is

1271
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:59,900
actually probably a fairly strong

1272
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:03,200
selection to keep down that mutation

1273
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:05,780
rate as low as it possibly can and it's

1274
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:08,089
probably about of what at least this

1275
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:12,380
type of flim erase biology can pull off

1276
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:13,970
so I don't know that knocking that I

1277
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:17,240
mean selection has tried to do that

1278
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:21,019
really hard to make incredibly high

1279
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:23,089
fidelity glimmer aces and so I'm not

1280
00:52:21,019 --> 00:52:24,739
convinced that that's an easy target to

1281
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:27,410
do is to reduce the total mutation rate

1282
00:52:24,739 --> 00:52:29,809
we can screen DNA sequencing that was so

1283
00:52:27,409 --> 00:52:32,089
cheap you can essentially screen through

1284
00:52:29,809 --> 00:52:33,679
things and just throw out novel me to

1285
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:34,850
any novel mutation though it looks kind

1286
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:37,608
of bad so if you're working in a large

1287
00:52:34,849 --> 00:52:40,900
breeding company that you know that is

1288
00:52:37,608 --> 00:52:46,569
not a crazy idea that that's how you

1289
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:50,450
things out okay so it was the over the

1290
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:51,800
yeah evolution is I think this kind of

1291
00:52:50,449 --> 00:52:55,009
goes back to that the same type of

1292
00:52:51,800 --> 00:53:00,769
question that evolution is not always a

1293
00:52:55,010 --> 00:53:03,200
great guide for picking out these

1294
00:53:00,769 --> 00:53:05,349
abiotic red queen type disease issues

1295
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:07,969
okay that doesn't mean machine learning

1296
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:11,000
couldn't be incredibly powerful for

1297
00:53:07,969 --> 00:53:14,029
predicting what ligands are gonna come

1298
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,500
together and what you're gonna do that

1299
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:18,200
so I think there's all sorts of black

1300
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:20,900
box types of things or you could have

1301
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:22,730
machine learning you know predicting you

1302
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:24,440
know how to deal with disease resistance

1303
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:25,969
but it's not using exactly the same

1304
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,010
evolution that you may use evolutionary

1305
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:31,000
time they're generate the diversity but

1306
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:31,000
it becomes a different question

1307
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:53,088
like essentially the region well that's

1308
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:55,739
why Pioneer hired Eli Rodgers Melnick so

1309
00:53:53,088 --> 00:53:59,338
whether or not we could fix heterosis in

1310
00:53:55,739 --> 00:54:00,719
the so I mean I think the first question

1311
00:53:59,338 --> 00:54:07,619
is whether or not we'll be allowed to

1312
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:11,699
edit okay so there are those issues and

1313
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:16,220
I think that's you know how yeah that

1314
00:54:11,699 --> 00:54:16,219
how society will allow that but then

1315
00:54:16,309 --> 00:54:20,970
there are going to be I mean you'll

1316
00:54:19,349 --> 00:54:22,829
always be able to make a hybrid that is

1317
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:25,679
better and whatever in Bret you've just

1318
00:54:22,829 --> 00:54:27,869
made so just because of distributions so

1319
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:30,058
and there are a few low side across the

1320
00:54:27,869 --> 00:54:32,880
genome I have no doubt that are truly

1321
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:35,510
over dominant rather than being the

1322
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:38,160
product of dosage pattern or dominance

1323
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:39,960
type point so I think hybrids will

1324
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:43,618
always be better whether or not though

1325
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:46,108
it looks right now amazed hybrid has two

1326
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:47,940
times the yield of its inbreds or three

1327
00:54:46,108 --> 00:54:57,029
times those yields of its inbred whether

1328
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:58,349
or not they're I don't you know I think

1329
00:54:57,030 --> 00:55:24,900
we can get there I don't know how

1330
00:54:58,349 --> 00:55:27,240
quickly will get their genome

1331
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:32,568
rearranging so you don't actually have

1332
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:40,919
genes in all the more accessible

1333
00:55:32,568 --> 00:55:43,679
combination no no and I think this is

1334
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:46,769
where maybe didn't emphasize this enough

1335
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:49,409
that a the pair centromeric increase we

1336
00:55:46,769 --> 00:55:51,239
see it and it's absolutely the there of

1337
00:55:49,409 --> 00:55:53,250
these delatour's mutations but there are

1338
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:56,699
deleterious mutations everywhere okay

1339
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:59,579
and they are enriched in the pair

1340
00:55:56,699 --> 00:56:01,259
centromeric regions but most the genes

1341
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:03,300
are still out at the arms and they are

1342
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:05,460
still having lots of deleterious

1343
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:08,068
mutations another thing that Eli figured

1344
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:10,108
out was there's a process bias gene

1345
00:56:08,068 --> 00:56:11,789
conversion is actually maintaining

1346
00:56:10,108 --> 00:56:13,858
deleterious mutations at high

1347
00:56:11,789 --> 00:56:16,800
recombination regions of the genome at

1348
00:56:13,858 --> 00:56:19,139
fairly moderate frequencies so there are

1349
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:21,809
other processes that are out there that

1350
00:56:19,139 --> 00:56:23,789
are deleterious mutations are everywhere

1351
00:56:21,809 --> 00:56:25,079
there just happen to be enriched in a

1352
00:56:23,789 --> 00:56:27,389
pair of centromere agreed and so you

1353
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:29,849
would still I mean we see heterosis it's

1354
00:56:27,389 --> 00:56:31,348
enriched in the that chromosome five but

1355
00:56:29,849 --> 00:56:36,240
we see the evidence of how two roses

1356
00:56:31,349 --> 00:56:38,280
everywhere so it's not yeah one so my

1357
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:43,558
question do you think that hybrids would

1358
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:54,000
be a natural situation then you wouldn't

1359
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:55,559
see expect Richmond I mean I mean I mean

1360
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,568
I think you know because of Dodgers

1361
00:56:55,559 --> 00:57:00,630
mutation for example most polyploidy

1362
00:56:57,568 --> 00:57:02,369
okay I think that's an extant is the

1363
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:06,630
product of escaping from deleterious

1364
00:57:02,369 --> 00:57:10,588
mutations okay so that's a that's a way

1365
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:12,720
to temporarily get away from deleterious

1366
00:57:10,588 --> 00:57:14,699
mutation build-up now over deep time

1367
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:16,558
this is where you you look at the total

1368
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:18,000
number of polyploid that have been

1369
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,819
successful in evolutionary time in

1370
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,088
plants you know in deep evolution adds

1371
00:57:20,818 --> 00:57:25,409
50 different events but at any one time

1372
00:57:23,088 --> 00:57:27,599
there's tens of thousands of poly

1373
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:29,338
players that are evolving it allows you

1374
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:33,859
to short-term escape from deleterious

1375
00:57:29,338 --> 00:57:33,858
mutations for a few thousand years but

1376
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:52,470
[Laughter]

1377
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:57,480
are you against it yeah okay we can

1378
00:57:52,469 --> 00:58:05,519
swing talk later okay

1379
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:09,240
thank you this has been a production of
