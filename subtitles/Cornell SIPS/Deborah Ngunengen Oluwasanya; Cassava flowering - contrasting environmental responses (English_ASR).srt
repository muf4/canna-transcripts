1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,530
thank you very much for the generous

4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:16,550
introduction and good afternoon everyone

5
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:21,849
thank you music so today I'm going to be

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:29,570
talking about my part of my PhD thesis I

7
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:31,429
call this and we're going to be looking

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,070
at contrasting environments so by way of

9
00:00:31,428 --> 00:00:37,219
outline I'm going to be talking about um

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,990
cassava hopefully by now cassava is a

11
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:41,239
very familiar crop because there's a lot

12
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:43,100
of research on going in at Cornell I'll

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,020
be talking about Kosovo flowering I'll

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:48,679
give you an overview of my thesis and

15
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,960
then I'll talk about the main results

16
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:52,460
from my experiment from the part of my

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,910
work I'm sharing today and then we'll

18
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:59,840
summarize that so first of all cassava

19
00:00:55,909 --> 00:01:02,989
is a big food security crop particularly

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,810
in Africa and also its use as sweets and

21
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:08,570
this is in Thailand and the export most

22
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:11,780
of this to Europe and then because the

23
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:14,178
the tuber is almost a hundred percent

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,710
starch you can see this in the

25
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:17,689
backgrounds almost 100 percent starch

26
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:20,209
it's just it has a lot of industrial

27
00:01:17,688 --> 00:01:23,209
applications so this is like a sound

28
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:25,368
wave a very important curve but in

29
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:27,259
addition to this are just a little bit

30
00:01:25,368 --> 00:01:30,890
about biology of cassava cassava is a

31
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:32,810
part of the e4v CIF family and it's a

32
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,689
perennial shrub the center of origin is

33
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:38,149
in the Amazon so that's South America I

34
00:01:35,688 --> 00:01:40,489
showed you and I think it's just a fun

35
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:42,739
side of the numerous kind of things that

36
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:46,688
we can get from cassava by way of food

37
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:49,188
so this is fufu if Sabah this is very

38
00:01:46,688 --> 00:01:51,468
fermented sauce we said a server and

39
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:54,228
then we can also some parts of Africa

40
00:01:51,468 --> 00:01:59,118
the leaves are also used as a vegetable

41
00:01:54,228 --> 00:02:01,368
like spinach cassava grows in the

42
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:04,578
tropical regions of the world and so you

43
00:02:01,368 --> 00:02:07,399
see this distributed nicely the latitude

44
00:02:04,578 --> 00:02:10,159
represented here and a large proportion

45
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:12,919
of that production takes place in

46
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:15,348
sub-saharan Africa and this kind of

47
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:17,688
gives you a reason why it's a huge food

48
00:02:15,348 --> 00:02:20,209
security from traditionally in

49
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:22,250
sub-saharan Africa cassava is

50
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:24,680
groan as insurance against you to crop

51
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,650
failure because it can survive imagine

52
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,270
on soil so if all else fails if other

53
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:33,110
will survive so you have a green and

54
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:35,330
deciding many farmers lot this what a

55
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:39,800
plant looks like on the field I'm going

56
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:42,950
to talk some more about the pathology as

57
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,290
as I progress in the slides so why

58
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:47,299
cassava flowers the habitable part of

59
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:51,739
the saga is the tubers so the flowers

60
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:54,080
are not and goes as it's I said where

61
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,240
the reason why we leave flowers is

62
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,940
because of breeding so you can

63
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,520
well now many ways to breed right now

64
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:03,500
but flowers are important instruments so

65
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,900
your breeding cycle or the president

66
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,969
reading program rises and falls on the

67
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,219
availability or the success of flower so

68
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:13,819
this is why flowers are important so

69
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:15,889
it's merely because of breeding here

70
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:18,199
house lining some of the problems we

71
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:20,629
cassava flour in so as you go all

72
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:23,599
through the development of the

73
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:25,639
reproductive phases you have different

74
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,319
kind of program first of all the

75
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,939
flowering time some genotypes but

76
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:32,810
clarity once the breeders would love to

77
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:36,680
walk with is late and then if you do go

78
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:38,420
through eventually inducing flowers

79
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,060
development could be arrested

80
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:43,909
prematurely so an example here way

81
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:47,330
before an theses of course the flowers

82
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:49,129
are aborted well if you if you succeed

83
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,990
at the time and the development of

84
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:53,359
flowers the sex ratio would be another

85
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,790
problem there are 90 percent males

86
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,590
compared to females so we know that

87
00:03:55,789 --> 00:04:00,500
females are going to be the seeds that

88
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:02,210
the breeders who walk with so if you if

89
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,560
you succeed in this too you're going to

90
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:06,680
have a problem here when you don't have

91
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,270
sufficient females to walk with so this

92
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,460
is because Kasab i said i'll cross and

93
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:12,500
species well if you succeed through one

94
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,120
two three you can also have problems in

95
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,860
arm seed said the fact that you have

96
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,160
females to walk we doesn't guarantee

97
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,989
there was set seed so the result of all

98
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,520
of this is your brilliance of optimal

99
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:24,769
actually you end up skill in your

100
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:26,419
brilliant to just the genotype that are

101
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:28,628
able to produce flowers you can work

102
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:31,788
with

103
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:33,500
from our studies here in the satella at

104
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:36,800
Cornell University there a number of

105
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:41,089
streams with many details about each of

106
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:44,389
these definitely that cassava is a long

107
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:46,728
big crops eight long these people are

108
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:49,819
flowering time we've also learnt about

109
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:51,168
the a special type of branch in the ice

110
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:53,479
associated with your productive

111
00:04:51,168 --> 00:04:55,370
development we've also learnt about the

112
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:57,800
temperature it needs moderately cool

113
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:01,038
temperature a lot of my work focuses on

114
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:04,280
this and then we'll talk about the we've

115
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:06,259
also learned that the flourishing in as

116
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:10,189
in other species sorry no cost is

117
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:12,590
involved in regulation of flowering so

118
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:15,500
to describe what forking looks like in

119
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:17,469
cassava I have this model here I'm going

120
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,870
to walk you through it and show you some

121
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:24,800
description of how flowering takes place

122
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:27,019
so first of all on the on the y axis I

123
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,329
have the percent of branch flower this

124
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:33,680
is actually from detail just a bunch of

125
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:35,508
data and midis up with this so the

126
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,509
number of days to the first flowering

127
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:40,370
event could be could vary by genotype so

128
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:43,400
some could be really early some could be

129
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:46,278
very late but after the first fork in

130
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:48,198
event or the first luring event do you

131
00:05:46,278 --> 00:05:50,269
have a period of vegetative growth and

132
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,340
then it was the second and to the toy so

133
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:54,198
I want you to keep this in mind when I

134
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:56,388
talk about here one two or three I'm

135
00:05:54,199 --> 00:06:00,770
talking about flowering events the first

136
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:02,778
event second event and so on my way of

137
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:04,939
the way by way of how the plant grows

138
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:06,918
this is what it looks like so in this

139
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:09,829
particular line this is going to be any

140
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:12,468
example of a good flowering line so you

141
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:14,000
have Anisha vegetative growth and they

142
00:06:12,468 --> 00:06:15,918
have this 4 PI branch in any

143
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,629
fluorescence in the middle so this would

144
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,758
be the first year then have a second

145
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:22,490
year and they can go out and so forth

146
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,830
some genotypes don't have as good

147
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,620
flowering the only succeed in just

148
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:34,158
having one flowering event and some

149
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:36,259
genotypes just never so well for us that

150
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:38,120
is why the biology on sandy biology of

151
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:41,210
cassava flooring is important because in

152
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,728
such genotypes there are a lot of trees

153
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:45,469
instance Ohio to whatever stall is

154
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:47,329
locked up in this kind of genotype I you

155
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:50,240
cannot include it in your breathing

156
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:51,800
cycle because we don't have flowers so

157
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,639
this is one of the reasons why our

158
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,168
studies our studies important still

159
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,470
giving you some details about the

160
00:06:57,168 --> 00:07:02,568
morphology you might I talked about a

161
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,130
special type of branch and I wanted to

162
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:05,930
distinguish this from other types of

163
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:09,319
branches and according to service so you

164
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:10,879
can have lateral branches like so um but

165
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:12,470
this is different from the folk type

166
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,899
branches so the folk type branching is

167
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,060
reproductive branching with lateral

168
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:19,489
branches you can D cup you can

169
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:23,180
decapitate a plant and the buds on the

170
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:25,250
plants are activated and this is you can

171
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,319
get this any at any point in the growth

172
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,899
of casaba but this is different from the

173
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,759
fallpipe branch and it only happens when

174
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:36,168
the plant is transition transitioning

175
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:38,629
from vegetated reproductive phase I told

176
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:43,189
you the cassava is a long day plant from

177
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:45,408
our studies in here in Italy and this is

178
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:49,519
shown because you just support this so

179
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:52,069
you see in all across this table only as

180
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:54,049
long days do you have some flowering a

181
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:57,918
short day she really wouldn't have any

182
00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:02,478
flowering and H to flower also responds

183
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:05,269
with we I told told you also that

184
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:07,699
flourishing ft is involved in Flowery

185
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:10,399
and we can see this response when we go

186
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:15,038
to the plant on the long beep condition

187
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:19,129
parts curly ft 2 is responsive to to the

188
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:21,529
long day for the pleasure so this is

189
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:23,870
where I begin my story my release it

190
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:26,448
before me a previous number of our lab

191
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:30,050
serra da mo she had already she dirty

192
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:32,120
and also in a height here eat a lot of

193
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,250
work on on temperature there long this

194
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,560
still ongoing but i'm connecting some of

195
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,958
my research with this thing you can see

196
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:42,139
here that at cooler temperatures you

197
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,788
have a lot more flowering and it's

198
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:46,809
possible that at warmer temperatures you

199
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:49,519
have no power at all you have slight

200
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:51,469
improvement in the days too flowery in

201
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,799
the age at which flower nor cause when

202
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:57,699
the temperature is cooler

203
00:08:53,799 --> 00:09:00,039
so my PhD thesis this is like a lot of

204
00:08:57,698 --> 00:09:03,248
things to a lot of information to walk

205
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:06,399
with and like I kind of decided that I'm

206
00:09:03,249 --> 00:09:08,470
going to contribute in three phases I'm

207
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,778
going to look at the biotic environments

208
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:14,589
to look at the flows of hormones in this

209
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:17,619
and also and hope that would give us

210
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:19,689
some information anticipatory for today

211
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:21,790
I'm only focusing on the a biotic

212
00:09:19,688 --> 00:09:23,558
environment disordered so I hope you're

213
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:24,548
compromised next time in there and then

214
00:09:23,558 --> 00:09:30,639
we'll give you more information about

215
00:09:24,548 --> 00:09:33,999
them historically in imagine there's

216
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:39,159
been this story that there are two

217
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:42,489
locations in Nigeria and would be Aceh

218
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:46,149
and the dogma is everything they take in

219
00:09:42,489 --> 00:09:50,079
here Jeff flowers so breeding programs

220
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:52,749
both from IIT knee button from DK they

221
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:55,539
come to OPI Jamaica crosses because for

222
00:09:52,749 --> 00:09:57,850
reasons which no uncle to say previously

223
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:59,889
the viatra environments people slurry

224
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:02,170
and this is some of the she circled each

225
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:05,740
I was able to lay my hands on and you

226
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:09,298
can see that VR is earlier and then if I

227
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:11,558
don't in terms of a flurry so my job my

228
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:13,688
interest was to find out what the

229
00:10:11,558 --> 00:10:16,298
underlying biology in the students had

230
00:10:13,688 --> 00:10:18,458
my environment interaction was and also

231
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:20,938
to hopefully that will provide us some

232
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:24,878
insight that we can begin to suggest

233
00:10:20,938 --> 00:10:30,849
ways to intervene and to improve cassava

234
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:34,928
flour what I did was so from IIT a

235
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:36,369
maintains a 700 Jeannette public unified

236
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:39,308
population called the genetic game

237
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:43,089
population and I selected genotypes

238
00:10:39,308 --> 00:10:44,708
based on the data that they had in in

239
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:47,559
three categories so genotypes that were

240
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:50,498
between 30 and 60 days like mitosis by

241
00:10:47,558 --> 00:10:52,480
any category my meat category used was

242
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:54,999
sixty to ninety days and my life

243
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,298
category which unifies are over 90 days

244
00:10:54,999 --> 00:11:00,480
of 100 genotypes so I thought I made a

245
00:10:58,298 --> 00:11:02,828
sub selection I planted these

246
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,899
simultaneously in both location and I

247
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:06,909
observed the physiology of the plant and

248
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:08,850
also I was collecting detail in the

249
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:14,850
environment

250
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:17,470
the first thing is temperature and 17

251
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:21,730
what we learned is if I don't

252
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:24,939
consistently led a piace in temperature

253
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:28,389
so if Adam was a warmer location notice

254
00:11:24,938 --> 00:11:30,490
in month one and in the fourth months

255
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:32,980
you have like this huge difference in

256
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,539
the 10 well maybe not huge but you have

257
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,909
a difference in the temperature maximum

258
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:39,730
temperature so I want you to hold bear

259
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:43,208
that in mind I was also able to collect

260
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:46,180
rainfall data and OPI Chad turns out to

261
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:48,039
be wetter than possibly explaining

262
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:50,828
White's father I wanted to remember that

263
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:53,469
my Jo is a tropical country so day

264
00:11:50,828 --> 00:11:56,049
length is not a factor because Lillian

265
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,629
doesn't change as much so I'm the only

266
00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:04,479
reason why it will be cooler is not also

267
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:07,058
snow but because of rain so from

268
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,808
physiology of the flood the looking at

269
00:12:07,058 --> 00:12:15,250
plant height as a index for plant growth

270
00:12:09,808 --> 00:12:19,600
locations indeed the plants grew better

271
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:21,578
anybody on compared to OB Aceh and I

272
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,959
just wanted to remind you that from the

273
00:12:21,578 --> 00:12:25,838
previous slides we talked about the

274
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,429
weather and he by donors warmer but it's

275
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,559
not drought stress so there's sufficient

276
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:31,479
rainfall - should I snow drought stress

277
00:12:29,558 --> 00:12:33,969
and so it's possible that the growing

278
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,129
conditions in a bedroom c4

279
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,459
photosynthesis so you have more body

280
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:43,509
mass production and like that is why

281
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:46,808
diagnosis as much money in this sub

282
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:49,329
panel was also true for should biomass

283
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:50,169
and good sweet but I'm not trying that

284
00:12:49,328 --> 00:12:53,318
yeah

285
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:54,938
however we don't see any advance

286
00:12:53,318 --> 00:12:57,419
fortunately by environment interaction

287
00:12:54,938 --> 00:13:00,039
because the same rank

288
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:02,229
maintains sort of the same around 20 D

289
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:06,389
and E bada except for the few genotypes

290
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:09,460
is kind of maintained in OB address

291
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:11,740
but in flowering time the story is

292
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:14,830
slightly different so I used number of

293
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:20,980
notes 214 because this is a kind of a

294
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:23,889
developmental time score in our redox is

295
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,720
used number of Rosetta leaves 2 as an

296
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:27,789
inch as an index for the age at which

297
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,769
that flower so I use a number of

298
00:13:27,789 --> 00:13:32,559
Northfork and partly because these

299
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:35,289
doesn't change its kind of the timing so

300
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:38,649
however whenever you come to score it's

301
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:41,079
when when to come it is determined so it

302
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:43,689
was a much more objective I'm trying to

303
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:48,759
use them the chronological age of the

304
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:52,270
plant and so we see the genotype by

305
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:54,189
environment interaction being how it

306
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:57,579
plays out here for some is strong for

307
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:59,830
some it's not so much and all genotypes

308
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,930
were earlier they would be a joke that

309
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:05,230
even bother on supporting historical

310
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:10,359
data that we had that OVR genotypes are

311
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:12,700
usually earlier in the area but like I

312
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,620
said some of them the way there was

313
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:18,190
almost no difference like they were

314
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:20,620
almost on top of each other so it's was

315
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,960
almost identical in the two location in

316
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,820
turns out that these this genotypes that

317
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,009
were that behave this way happen to the

318
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:31,960
G to be the genotypes I have selected to

319
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:34,600
be in my any category looking at this I

320
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:37,060
either I compared the two locations and

321
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,399
I was asking the question whether some

322
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:42,459
genotype whether this change was really

323
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:47,350
significant or not and this place the

324
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:49,660
genotypes in two categories a category

325
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:51,460
which I'll describe as plastic and these

326
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:55,179
genotypes was in current difference and

327
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:57,490
we need the change and time to flowery

328
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:58,779
notes the location was significant where

329
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:02,200
I stood that I would describe as

330
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:05,049
non-plastic which the change was not a

331
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:07,360
significant I want to pause here to

332
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:09,669
define the system just in the interest

333
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,300
of those who may not be biologists as

334
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:15,969
the response of the offer of living

335
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:17,079
organism to the environment and so the

336
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:19,180
plastic genotype

337
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,850
means that they are responding

338
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:24,939
it's the environment while the non-toxic

339
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:30,159
genotype so may be insensitive to the

340
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:32,500
environment the result I saw from my own

341
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:35,709
study made me to go back to the

342
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,889
historical data I had access to from

343
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:41,050
evidence so this was data collected in

344
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:45,549
between 2013 and 2015 and I wanted to

345
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:46,870
see how I didn't have miss 214 because

346
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:49,269
that was something I introduced when I

347
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:51,250
started my own study but instead I had

348
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:55,240
the correct chronological ages of the

349
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:56,830
plants and what we see what I did here

350
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,600
was essentially to take the difference

351
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,129
between the basic flooring of the

352
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,220
ginning days of flowering Al Pacino

353
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:05,740
Tyson if I go piatra and most of the

354
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:08,470
genotypes were later in if I don't some

355
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:11,500
of them were stable and all non-plastic

356
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:14,920
were a few of them where the reverse

357
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:18,610
direction the non stable line I if I

358
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:21,159
defined my threshold for stability as

359
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,259
lines that had no more than three days

360
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:27,939
difference in their flowering silently

361
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:29,710
22 locations so this is like something

362
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,680
like a way for me to begin to think

363
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:35,110
about the biology of what is going on in

364
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:36,939
two locations not just and one location

365
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:40,029
is earlier than the other but to see

366
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,470
that there there is this interaction

367
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:45,929
with the environment at each of the

368
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:49,000
Chilean ties can behave differently so

369
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:50,799
zooming in more detail I took her

370
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,500
representative member of the plastic

371
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:59,379
group and a representative member of the

372
00:16:53,500 --> 00:17:01,899
non plastic group and on the on your on

373
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:03,370
your left hand you have the data from

374
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:06,069
number of notes but what I'm showing

375
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:08,970
here is something a little more advanced

376
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:12,609
beyond just the time to initial flower

377
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:14,640
flower induction we have here what

378
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:17,919
happens over the course of three years

379
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,620
so for the first unit I'd this genotype

380
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,480
which is the same as the non faster

381
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:24,579
genotype you see that the pattern of

382
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,150
flowering is similar and the two

383
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:30,189
locations at the same but in the toxic

384
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,019
genotype the passion of flowering for

385
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:34,410
the three tier so this is Tier one two

386
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:34,410
and three

387
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:42,059
you have this different at the same time

388
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:44,159
if you compare each of the genotypes in

389
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:47,190
vertically so like we can add each

390
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,480
location separately you see that it's

391
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:52,029
Ruby Aceh in which is a favorite

392
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:55,779
favourable environment has a similar

393
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:57,759
pattern in the plastic and sorry in the

394
00:17:55,779 --> 00:18:00,369
non elastic and the plastic genotype

395
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,049
suit I'm taking that to sort of reflect

396
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:05,919
what is going on here that there's a

397
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:08,079
sort of a core vengeance or similarity

398
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,440
between the two genotypes in viata

399
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:13,809
but if you look at the other direction

400
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:17,559
the unfavorable location you can see a

401
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:21,480
huge difference um if I should talk say

402
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:24,730
more about this moving the the time to

403
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:27,190
move from one flowering event or like

404
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:30,190
one tier to the other in the unfavorable

405
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:32,259
environment expands and also the

406
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:38,590
proportion of plants that came from her

407
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:41,589
from that are able to have subsequent on

408
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:44,049
reproduction reproductive phases is gets

409
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:46,889
the one eventually completely shut down

410
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:50,919
in a plastic genotype so this was a

411
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:53,470
interesting thing that excited to dig a

412
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,810
little more into the biology of this but

413
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:58,420
before this out from the genotypes I had

414
00:18:55,809 --> 00:19:00,309
on the field I sheep the number of them

415
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:03,490
to eat the cup so that we could do

416
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:08,669
control studies on those and with Peters

417
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:12,190
help I was able to get this running so

418
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:14,140
this on the few days these are genotypes

419
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:16,420
from the field silk and walk you through

420
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:19,600
slowly so you have the plastic the blue

421
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:21,519
and orange line represents our plastic

422
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:23,709
genotypes those that respond to the

423
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:24,849
environment while the Green Line is

424
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:28,660
representative

425
00:19:24,849 --> 00:19:31,089
non-plastic genotype under growth

426
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:35,860
chamber or under control conditions we

427
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:38,919
had a three temperatures 20 to 28 and 34

428
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:41,119
degrees daytime temperature and you see

429
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:44,029
us

430
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:46,219
as well this resembles the field a lot

431
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:49,339
that the plastic genotypes and the field

432
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:52,130
were very very temperature responsive so

433
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:55,129
meaning that as the temperature got

434
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:57,530
higher the we had aced the flowering the

435
00:19:55,130 --> 00:20:00,320
time to flowering also increased for

436
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:02,450
Anton non-plastic genotype was almost

437
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:04,039
temperature and sensitive of course you

438
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,110
I know you might say oh they didn't fall

439
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:10,549
it well exactly the same pattern the

440
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:12,919
blue is not quite as because the orange

441
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:16,099
in both location but it's just when I

442
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,960
get to begin to like how questions think

443
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:21,019
about what is happening on the field so

444
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,759
remember the field is not just one you

445
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:25,609
cannot reduce the field conditions to be

446
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:27,379
just temperature but this there's there

447
00:20:25,609 --> 00:20:29,359
this is kind of showing evidence that

448
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:32,390
the thing going on and the field might

449
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:35,199
be temperature related in addition to

450
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:38,210
this previously from our lab we had also

451
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,250
done a previous number of our lab Sarah

452
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:44,029
de Meaux she had over expressed our

453
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:46,970
adaxes ft in cassava and she we found

454
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:49,279
out that improved flowering so I took

455
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:52,039
the which of the two genotypes in

456
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,470
question so the wild-type 6:04 four

457
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:59,059
points south american line and it's a

458
00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:01,009
late flowering genotype well in this i

459
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:03,049
hope after this presentation we would

460
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,579
redefine what late means the late would

461
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:07,899
be in reference to a particular

462
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:10,669
environment and also the while the

463
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:14,420
transgenic plant which is the which

464
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:17,300
carries the expression of ft and just

465
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:20,509
like before the later like oh the

466
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:22,819
wild-type had a lot of that's the city i

467
00:21:20,509 --> 00:21:25,700
want to draw your attention to fact that

468
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:28,490
this horizontal line here doesn't mean

469
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,710
that it no longer responded to

470
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:32,269
temperature it's just because in the

471
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,870
growth chamber we couldn't grow beyond

472
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:36,650
180 days so we have to truncate the

473
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:38,419
experiment so that's why so it's

474
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:40,340
possible if we have enough space and

475
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:43,670
kept it going we could have seen this

476
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:47,269
line further than these whereas the

477
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:51,340
overexpression line was sort of

478
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:54,579
insensitive to the temperature

479
00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:57,459
so based on this information I propose

480
00:21:54,579 --> 00:22:01,720
two models of what is going on in Java

481
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:04,298
which respects it that's the city my

482
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:08,139
first module I'm suggesting that in a

483
00:22:04,298 --> 00:22:10,240
non-plastic genotype a lot depends on

484
00:22:08,138 --> 00:22:12,038
the genetics of the plant itself while

485
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:16,210
the environment contributes very little

486
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:18,339
rice hypothesis is that in the non

487
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,740
classic genotype sufficient flora gene

488
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:22,778
or flowering stimulus is produced such

489
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:26,589
that the environment wasn't affected

490
00:22:22,778 --> 00:22:28,538
much so if in the the quantity of

491
00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:31,808
fluorine that it produces able to

492
00:22:28,538 --> 00:22:33,700
counteract the anti flaw region so it's

493
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:35,678
able to progress to develop a to

494
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,080
flowering time independent of the

495
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,409
environment paradoxes there is a the

496
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:43,178
autonomous flowering pathway and I can't

497
00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:47,259
begin conversations about how this my

498
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:50,048
collectibles whereas in the plastic

499
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:54,548
genotype flowering time depends heavily

500
00:22:50,048 --> 00:22:57,308
on the environment to facilitate the one

501
00:22:54,548 --> 00:23:00,700
of three things the environment can

502
00:22:57,308 --> 00:23:02,829
either increase the floor region such as

503
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:05,319
in the favorable environments increases

504
00:23:02,829 --> 00:23:07,089
law region so that is able to counteract

505
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:10,359
the entire origin and then have

506
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:12,788
flowering time whereas the on paper

507
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:14,439
environment may not do that we can also

508
00:23:12,788 --> 00:23:16,028
do the reverse it might be that it's not

509
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,460
just a flourishing to the flowering

510
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:21,009
stimulus that is changing but the

511
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:22,778
suppressant does the surprise Center

512
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:27,220
flowering so that's the anti flow region

513
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:29,288
and also we can also propose that the

514
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:31,240
two are changes so we provide a

515
00:23:29,288 --> 00:23:36,579
favorable environment a lot of storage

516
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:38,378
units produced flourishing but in the

517
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:41,230
reverse happens so this is sort of my

518
00:23:38,378 --> 00:23:43,808
what I'm proposing to that is

519
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:47,069
potentially going on in the plastic and

520
00:23:43,808 --> 00:23:47,069
plastic genotype

521
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:53,259
but Sara also in a lot of had already

522
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:57,750
done some studies on temperature and she

523
00:23:53,259 --> 00:24:01,210
was previously I showed you that ft was

524
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:03,849
the ft 2 in particular what particular

525
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:05,710
was a responsive to for a few years who

526
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:08,109
have long days you've had more ft

527
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:11,049
production so she was also interested to

528
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:13,689
see how temperature affected this ft and

529
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:17,289
I want to connect what she eat to some

530
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:19,120
of what I'm finding and in the stable

531
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:23,159
line we don't have any evidence that the

532
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:25,079
temperature is affecting the ft

533
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:28,029
expression in the correct direction

534
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:32,699
because at lower temperature you should

535
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:36,539
expect higher ft to warmer temperatures

536
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:39,880
it's possible that I'm speculating that

537
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:42,069
because this line is a as a non-plastic

538
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,320
line it doesn't depend on the

539
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:46,419
environment and sodium the body

540
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:48,399
environments is doing to the energy

541
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:51,490
expression you may or may not have any

542
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:56,950
bearing on the phenotype which is

543
00:24:51,490 --> 00:25:01,000
flowering time whereas in the plastic

544
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:06,850
genotype in well TM the ft one there is

545
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:09,039
no evidence for flow for the for the

546
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:12,189
there's no evidence that this is some

547
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:16,359
temperature responsive but ft2 shows

548
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:17,920
some we can argue about how strong this

549
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:20,109
evidence is but at least there is some

550
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:23,410
evidence that at cooler temperatures

551
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:27,579
there a higher FG ft2 expression

552
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:29,830
compared to one more temperature this is

553
00:25:27,579 --> 00:25:31,839
just the aspect we have for chlorogene

554
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:34,899
but we don't have any information on the

555
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:38,678
anti flora Jane so I was interested in

556
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:40,450
doing a more global study usually to

557
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:42,790
genotype so that we could get some

558
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:48,269
information and the authorities as well

559
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:49,808
as the origin so just quickly what I do

560
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:53,259
when people are

561
00:25:49,808 --> 00:25:55,719
I see what I really suggest is a whole

562
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:58,118
Expo genome expression profile and also

563
00:25:55,719 --> 00:26:00,940
communication and education of the vote

564
00:25:58,118 --> 00:26:03,038
transcript we used our three primary six

565
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:04,528
method which was cost effective and

566
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:07,808
irony is

567
00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:10,239
those two is a reverse transcribe to

568
00:26:07,808 --> 00:26:12,878
cDNA and then we sequestered refine and

569
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:15,129
I also want to remind you quickly that

570
00:26:12,878 --> 00:26:18,128
Ibadan was in February location and

571
00:26:15,128 --> 00:26:21,098
earlier the the temperatures in weather

572
00:26:18,128 --> 00:26:23,439
is warmer than the air check and this is

573
00:26:21,098 --> 00:26:25,569
what I did I had two genotypes a plastic

574
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,179
representative plastic and non plastic I

575
00:26:25,569 --> 00:26:31,239
had an unfavorable occasion I favored

576
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:34,659
location I took two time points so one

577
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:37,210
was my representative juvenile face

578
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:39,639
thirty days after planting and then I

579
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:40,869
took seven days after fourth and so at

580
00:26:39,638 --> 00:26:43,478
this stage where I will show that

581
00:26:40,868 --> 00:26:46,959
flowering or transition to production to

582
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:49,598
productivity or extra tonight RNA

583
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,450
Nigeria ship it if the cup needs some

584
00:26:49,598 --> 00:26:55,778
more processing like purification and so

585
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:59,469
on a sequence that biotech with the help

586
00:26:55,778 --> 00:27:02,919
of year how and hue I would say we got

587
00:26:59,469 --> 00:27:06,058
some of the statistics ongoing and this

588
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:08,950
is double centered PCA methodology which

589
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:11,918
you can get more information about how

590
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:16,169
that is done but basically on the on the

591
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:20,200
main contrast is shown on the abscissa

592
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:22,710
on the x-axis and we see the suppress

593
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:26,950
socially now between the two genotype in

594
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:31,239
the blue genotype we see that the tulipe

595
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:33,969
the open versus the closed open vessels

596
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:37,239
the closest separated into two different

597
00:27:33,969 --> 00:27:39,070
segments of the of the TCA how about the

598
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:40,538
well she mention that the double

599
00:27:39,069 --> 00:27:44,048
centered PCL walked through the

600
00:27:40,538 --> 00:27:46,329
interactions not just in the individual

601
00:27:44,048 --> 00:27:48,638
and I so the interaction of the samples

602
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:50,888
and the chains and other expression

603
00:27:48,638 --> 00:27:52,718
values and we see that is a clear

604
00:27:50,888 --> 00:27:54,728
sorting so meaning that in this genotype

605
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:58,830
us as we've seen and in the phenotype of

606
00:27:54,729 --> 00:28:00,538
the question into the links clear

607
00:27:58,829 --> 00:28:03,279
distinct

608
00:28:00,538 --> 00:28:05,289
behavior of the location so

609
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,119
on all of the Bajorans and all of the

610
00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:11,349
theaters we need two different

611
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:13,809
components whereas the non-plastic

612
00:28:11,349 --> 00:28:22,089
genotype we didn't have that clearly

613
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:23,889
socket but what is seen is that non

614
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:25,990
facit genotype which makes sense because

615
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:30,880
if you sample up to different ages you

616
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:40,059
expect to be different you can also add

617
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:42,790
the food change I took to illustrate

618
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:45,819
what is going on just for the purpose of

619
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:48,099
the seminar at seven days was 14 which

620
00:28:45,819 --> 00:28:51,970
is when the trend had transitioned to

621
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:53,559
productive says you can see that in the

622
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:56,589
non plastic ties between the two

623
00:28:53,559 --> 00:29:05,980
location there's very need to change in

624
00:28:56,589 --> 00:29:08,859
the expression the the two whereas a lot

625
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:10,420
of difference in signal so this is these

626
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:12,729
are things that we can even begin to

627
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:15,100
begin further to look at what is

628
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:19,180
happening what pathways are involved and

629
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:25,209
so on so I'm going summarize right now

630
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:28,210
and I saying that on the field the the

631
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:30,430
plasticity and the response agenda by

632
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:34,240
Vera interruption we see on the field is

633
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:36,940
related to cool temperature and actually

634
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:40,359
favoring flowering is related to cooler

635
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:42,070
temperature and we've also seen that at

636
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:44,289
cooler temperatures of sorry time on

637
00:29:42,069 --> 00:29:46,809
pages irrespective of the genotype a

638
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:50,349
classic didn't like warmer temperatures

639
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:52,720
delayed flowering and when there's high

640
00:29:50,349 --> 00:29:56,139
expression of F T we are able to reverse

641
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,569
this buses plasticity our gene

642
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:00,400
expression profile shows is able to

643
00:29:58,569 --> 00:30:04,000
distinguish the plastic from the non

644
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:06,190
toxic and this is something I'm still

645
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,930
going to looking more details are warmer

646
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,360
temperature might stimulate the

647
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:13,289
expression of the anti Floridian which

648
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:15,719
might explain to us the spiritual saying

649
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:17,339
it's not the end of my PhD

650
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,038
I talked about I told you that I'm doing

651
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:21,779
the today I'm focusing on them but a

652
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:25,829
biotic environment and I'm going to do

653
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:28,940
much more work on this in the days

654
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:31,439
coming and then I'm going to complete um

655
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:33,659
another scientific interpretation of

656
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,929
this on the site a tiny and sugar status

657
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:39,030
I want to acknowledge the many people

658
00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:40,798
who have helped in India this slide does

659
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:42,329
not do justice to all the people who

660
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:44,579
have helped me at the cost of my journey

661
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:47,308
and I want to acknowledge my peer to

662
00:30:44,579 --> 00:30:49,980
comity the members of our lab both

663
00:30:47,308 --> 00:30:53,460
present and past I had a lot of help

664
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:56,700
from Li Hao and here on the RAC data

665
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:58,950
analysis my collaborators in Nigeria I

666
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,558
had a wonderful field team particularly

667
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:03,779
yemassee my healer system was become

668
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:05,700
more than just an assistant who is much

669
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:08,279
more like a friend and a lot of

670
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:10,350
undergrads helped me with my big scoring

671
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:13,408
well this doesn't catch all of them I

672
00:31:10,349 --> 00:31:16,529
had several rounds of awakening I had a

673
00:31:13,409 --> 00:31:18,450
small grants welcome don't underestimate

674
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:21,029
what small grants can do to your

675
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:25,860
research and then fund enough received

676
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:27,450
from IITs support by field spaces next

677
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:29,339
gen to the build I'm in the Gates

678
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:32,159
Foundation and of course the Government

679
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:49,769
of Nigeria so actually going is how we

680
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:52,350
say thank you indicated that the

681
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:55,168
flowering even says that the flowering

682
00:31:52,349 --> 00:32:05,428
Sparrow is learn you have any sub

683
00:31:55,169 --> 00:32:10,740
positions as to why my pictures there's

684
00:32:05,429 --> 00:32:19,230
more inductive being produced and this

685
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:22,079
is able to counteract my permit from an

686
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:24,720
evolutionary perspective while how would

687
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:28,079
something like that know about all this

688
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,329
what do you think the thing is that's in

689
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:34,978
the environment that encouraged that

690
00:32:30,329 --> 00:32:46,829
siloed that's striking you know asking a

691
00:32:34,979 --> 00:32:47,460
lot so I'm looking at a tropical sea she

692
00:32:46,829 --> 00:32:51,138
yeah

693
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:54,569
one way you could think about it is that

694
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:57,538
the cooler temperature is not favorable

695
00:32:54,569 --> 00:33:00,168
for the plant and so it means

696
00:32:57,538 --> 00:33:03,960
facilitates the production so that it's

697
00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:06,179
life is well it continues succeeded in

698
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,278
the environment so like 20 cents is that

699
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:11,548
it's nothing like let's quickly produce

700
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:12,960
so that we can continue our lineage but

701
00:33:11,548 --> 00:33:15,358
that's what tropical plants in our

702
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:20,669
temperate species you have the

703
00:33:15,358 --> 00:33:23,878
realization which is sensing when winter

704
00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:26,549
is going to end so that reproduction can

705
00:33:23,878 --> 00:33:29,009
take place so that's the way I think

706
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:31,440
about it that it's everything a plant

707
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:34,558
would do is to save all its reproduction

708
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:38,070
and so if it noted that something is

709
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:42,388
going to affect its succession it would

710
00:33:38,069 --> 00:33:45,960
quickly reproduce before stress response

711
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:50,098
I don't like we have masters of eight

712
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:53,848
lines there's a bad year year after they

713
00:33:50,098 --> 00:33:59,928
have no findings of seed so you think

714
00:33:53,848 --> 00:34:04,319
it's not something long not maybe just

715
00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:06,960
if you look at winter versus spring it's

716
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:09,269
just that the resources that are going

717
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,519
to be available in spring is going to be

718
00:34:09,269 --> 00:34:13,019
our border so we need to start so we can

719
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:16,168
make the most of the resources available

720
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:18,960
not really that we are scared that we

721
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:21,118
realize that's the way I'll think about

722
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:25,318
it maybe no such a sovereign manage

723
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:28,980
rather than avoiding problem well you

724
00:34:25,318 --> 00:34:31,199
know yes I have this thought that it's a

725
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:34,409
win rings when wings about

726
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:36,719
when brain begins my thought is also

727
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:38,550
somewhere along the line that there's

728
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,980
more abundance of water

729
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:45,899
so we can with the floods can't

730
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:49,969
distribute : or growth is going to be

731
00:34:45,898 --> 00:34:49,969
improved and so on so goes up my

732
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:11,550
differential between I'm trying to think

733
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:13,980
about what that would yeah with all of

734
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:20,360
these genotypes have been in the

735
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:22,530
sequence for kids I kind of detail

736
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:29,250
well the days of flowering is not

737
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:31,190
something that the readers next-gen you

738
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:33,750
probably knew there was a G was of

739
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:42,630
flowering thing that was done at some

740
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:44,670
point soon some of that they did they

741
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:48,420
look or low-sided specifically

742
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:58,920
interacted with location I got were

743
00:35:48,420 --> 00:36:03,320
affected by this from a study we had a

744
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:08,130
lot of small effect details and we

745
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:12,170
spread out so much flowering is the

746
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:14,539
environmental traits like everybody's

747
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:53,420
[Music]

748
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:53,420
the foundation and see

749
00:37:34,568 --> 00:37:51,940
okay so I actually have one experiment

750
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:56,119
in which I looked at that study and I

751
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:59,329
have my speculation based on my result

752
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:01,298
is that it's sort of independent I know

753
00:37:59,329 --> 00:38:04,609
you're thinking about potatoes because

754
00:38:01,298 --> 00:38:07,039
the florigen signal influences

755
00:38:04,608 --> 00:38:10,730
civilization as well as our induction

756
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:13,250
but remember that potatoes is a modified

757
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:16,849
stem or as cassava is our true root and

758
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:20,510
also the phloem the way the film is

759
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:22,910
arranged in the and the stem is not

760
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:25,220
quite the same as in the roots FG

761
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:28,068
produced and transported through the

762
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:30,858
floor and so those are kind of where my

763
00:38:28,068 --> 00:38:37,298
thoughts are going but my Alicia kind of

764
00:38:30,858 --> 00:38:37,298
suggests this but not conclusive

765
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,139
questions

766
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:50,290
