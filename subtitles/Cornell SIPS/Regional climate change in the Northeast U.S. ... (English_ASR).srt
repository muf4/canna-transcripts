1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,359
University so basically I like to set

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,080
the stage first um so kind of a a very

4
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:17,358
colorful kind of Technic graph um but

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,000
basically what this is showing is global

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,480
carbon dioxide emissions this is time

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,439
across the bottom um think you can all

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,039
see by the Pink Arrow this is where we

9
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:30,039
are in kind of the spaghetti of all

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,800
these lighter lines these are possible

11
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:35,079
Pathways that people came up with that

12
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,238
Society is going to evolve in terms of

13
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,920
their carbon dioxide emissions so

14
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:42,199
basically the point that I want to make

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,559
is the red line here is essentially the

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,840
path that we're on it's sometimes called

17
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:49,919
the business as usual scenario and

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,879
really what it's saying is here we are

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,719
we're emitting about nine um gigatons of

20
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:58,878
carbon per year uh in

21
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:02,480
2014 and as we move out actually not too

22
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:04,679
far this is not even midcentury uh we're

23
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,679
basically doubling that so we're

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,960
basically set to double our carbon

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:13,360
dioxide emissions in a very very short

26
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:16,559
period of time 30 years um also notice

27
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:19,079
that this dash line that I put across is

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,439
basically I guess I was off a little bit

29
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:24,039
that's basically um current day

30
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:26,158
emissions and really all of these other

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,799
lines are above that there's only a few

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,118
cases that Dro below that so really no

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,200
matter what scenario you pick we're

34
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:36,640
basically in the next 30 or 40 years uh

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,118
destined to emit more carbon dioxide

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,719
than we do today it's only these very

37
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,759
very uh unlikely scenarios that drop us

38
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,399
down you know we're going to have to

39
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,118
have some major technological

40
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:49,960
breakthrough um Society the world in

41
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:51,959
general including not only the United

42
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:54,199
States but China and India are going to

43
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,639
have to drastically reduce their carbon

44
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,280
dioxide emissions if we hope to be on

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,000
this line um and if your eyes are really

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,920
good basically even though this is the

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,118
ipcc estimated business as usual we're

48
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,840
actually above that trajectory so we

49
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:10,560
have a higher spe than that so uh not

50
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,680
really a good picture here uh for

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,959
setting the

52
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,920
stage what does that mean basically what

53
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,680
that means is if we look at a Global

54
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,759
Perspective we're on the road to a world

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,080
that looks like this by the end of the

56
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,639
century looks really really red what

57
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,080
this is indicating here um I'm in degree

58
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:33,518
C across the Arctic average temperatures

59
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:36,000
that are 11 12 13° uh warmer SE warmer

60
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,680
than they are today and if we're maybe

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,439
more interested in our neck of the woods

62
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:45,400
we're in the area here of 8 or 9 or 10°

63
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:48,039
C warmer than we are today uh notice if

64
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,599
you look at this map uh everybody is

65
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:54,840
orange or red uh nobody is blue the

66
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:58,079
whole world warms um if I look at this

67
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:01,039
map over here this is actually that see

68
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,040
if I can go back um that's actually more

69
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:07,120
or less this scenario here in blue okay

70
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:10,039
so this is kind of a pie in the sky boy

71
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,879
I wish we could get here type scenario

72
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:14,719
and whoops wrong way even if we do that

73
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:17,039
this map is particularly you know it's

74
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,680
mostly red so even if we reduce the

75
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,400
emissions to that extent um the Artic

76
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,840
here is going to be warming about four

77
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,120
or 5 Dees uh C uh New York is on the

78
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,759
order of one or two deg SE so we're

79
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,360
locked into a certain amount of warming

80
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:33,359
even if we stop carbon dioxide today the

81
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,959
climate system has such inertia the

82
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,680
warming of the oceans and things like

83
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,319
that the residual carbon dioxide in the

84
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,239
atmosphere were locked into a certain

85
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,798
amount of

86
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:45,120
War all right know I find this to be a

87
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,120
particularly kind of compelling graph to

88
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,920
kind of just say oh my God we're we're

89
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,360
in trouble here we have to we have to do

90
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:54,518
something we have to adapt we have to

91
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:56,599
mitigate we have to modify our ways um

92
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,158
the blue line here is the observational

93
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:01,238
record of temperature uh for Central New

94
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:05,039
York basically a grid box from a climate

95
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:06,680
model and the red and the yellow graphs

96
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,359
are two carbon dioxide emission

97
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,680
scenarios so basically the red is the

98
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,720
higher emission scenario basically again

99
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,439
doubling CO2 by mid-century almost

100
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:18,639
quadrupling it by the end of the century

101
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:20,519
and the yellow um isn't quite that Pie

102
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,960
in the Sky really low scenario it's more

103
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,879
of a modest scenario it basically puts

104
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:28,719
us where we end up to you know basically

105
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:30,918
same CO2 emissions uh today in a 100

106
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,320
years as we are today goes up a little

107
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:34,918
bit mid-century but then pops back down

108
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:38,079
okay so in the net we're accumulating

109
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:41,240
more carbon dioxide so we see that over

110
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,918
the next yeah 40 or 50 years these two

111
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,720
lines are right on top of one another

112
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:46,959
again an idea of the inertia in the

113
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,479
climate system what we do right away

114
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,359
doesn't really affect the climate until

115
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:54,839
you know basically 50 years out that's

116
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,479
when those lines start to diverge um so

117
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,439
again we're locked into a certain amount

118
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:01,199
of climate change regardless of what

119
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:03,360
Society does but more importantly these

120
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,840
two arrows that come down kind of

121
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,160
hovering around

122
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:12,758
2050 represent the time when the new

123
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:15,240
record with climate change um basically

124
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,160
exceeds anything we've seen in the past

125
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,038
so what I mean these points if you look

126
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,880
at this point here and I guess this

127
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:25,038
point here these years are the coldest

128
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:27,319
years in this future record but these

129
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:30,439
years are warmer than any year we've

130
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:32,199
seen in the past so B basically

131
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:34,240
essentially we're in a new climate

132
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,199
regime the year that we would say is the

133
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,319
coldest oh my God it's cold here in New

134
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:41,478
York is actually warmer than any year

135
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:43,600
we've seen in the past based on these

136
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:46,519
projections from from two climate models

137
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,639
under two greenhouse gas CS so that's

138
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:50,000
not

139
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,199
again not something that we want to see

140
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,478
oops I forgot I

141
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,240
hadig um I'd also like to set the stage

142
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:59,079
you know I I work with a number of

143
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,199
people that are looking at climate

144
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:03,839
impact and things like that I end up

145
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,360
getting a a lot of questions like I mean

146
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,439
I know not too actually whenever I talk

147
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,560
to a fruit Grower's group or something

148
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:13,079
like that they say how is climate change

149
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,839
going to affect hail hail is the thing

150
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:16,800
that really you know does in my Apple

151
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:18,799
crop does in my peach crop we can put up

152
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,520
these hail Nets should that be the type

153
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,360
of thing um that we use for adaptation

154
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:27,399
so um spend a little bit of time to to

155
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,720
kind of describe this this is out of a

156
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:31,198
paper that uh myself and a few

157
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,520
colleagues put together in the Buon of

158
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:38,598
the AMS about a year ago uh what we did

159
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:41,159
was basically assessed um the ability to

160
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:43,598
detect different changes in the climate

161
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:47,680
system so really you can kind of view

162
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:50,598
this horizontal axis is how good are our

163
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,598
observations of these phenomena how well

164
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:54,719
can we look at the historical record and

165
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:57,639
say yeah there's been a trend in

166
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,080
temperature yeah there's been a trend in

167
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:02,918
precipitation and then the vertical axis

168
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:05,159
is really our understanding of the

169
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:07,758
knowledge you know kind of the cause and

170
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,120
effect type of thing so if I look up

171
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,240
here and I look at something like

172
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,319
precipitation or heat waves and cold

173
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,400
waves prolonged periods of hot and cold

174
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,680
our observational record of temperature

175
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:22,038
and precipitation is actually pretty

176
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,918
good so it falls up here and also our

177
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:26,038
understanding of the causes why an

178
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:27,878
increase in greenhouse gases would cause

179
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:30,000
temperature to go up precipitation to go

180
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:32,400
up is fairly good

181
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,759
um but yet I might contrast that to

182
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,038
these things that kind of fall on this

183
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:40,639
end of the scale things like hail or

184
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:43,560
tornadoes or ice storms um here we don't

185
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,639
have a very good OB obser observational

186
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,759
record you know basically ice storms are

187
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,759
events we have to you know the newspaper

188
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,759
has to report it somebody has to call

189
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,360
that in to the Weather Service before it

190
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,000
gets into the record so our historical

191
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,960
record of something like that is not

192
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,079
very good and likewise our understanding

193
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,839
how is climate change going to affect

194
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:05,918
something like that very very very very

195
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,719
poor in this case so I pick on Ice

196
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,000
storms because you know you can imagine

197
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,240
an ice storm you know even from your

198
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,319
experience of ice storms around here

199
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,079
it's really a narrow narrow band of

200
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,319
meteorological conditions that have to

201
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,079
come together just at the right time

202
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,039
just at the right levels of the

203
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:25,359
atmosphere to cause an ice storm so kind

204
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,240
of using a climate model to project

205
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,759
what's going to happen in that very very

206
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,000
narrow range of of condition

207
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,639
is very very hard so I would say well

208
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,120
you're out of luck if you really care

209
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:37,918
about this I mean I might as well take

210
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,240
again I'll pick on steuart Stuarts leads

211
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,399
where I don't know I'll throw the dart

212
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,440
at the dart board for things like this

213
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,240
but when we move up here to things like

214
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,920
temperature precipitation floods uh

215
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,399
droughts Cyclones know we have a better

216
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:51,799
understanding of why those are occurring

217
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,799
and and a good historical record of

218
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:57,159
seeing what those changes are um so

219
00:08:54,799 --> 00:09:00,559
let's quickly look back at at what we've

220
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:03,039
seen in the record um we we've seen and

221
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:05,559
basically these the next set of figures

222
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,360
are basically specific to the Northeast

223
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:09,359
they come out of the national assessment

224
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,480
which has a chapter specific on the

225
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,440
northeast so if I look at average

226
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,039
temperatures no matter what season we're

227
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,399
in we have a trend it's a statistically

228
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:21,958
significant Trend in warming if I pick

229
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:24,759
on winter basically what we've seen is

230
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:27,919
um about a about a quarter of a degree

231
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:30,240
Fahrenheit Trend per decade so basically

232
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:32,919
over the 100 over 100 years that we've

233
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,120
had we've seen about 2 and half deg gar

234
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:36,958
warming ready the biggest trend is in

235
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,200
winter so the most warming we've seen

236
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:42,518
over the last 100 or so years has been

237
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,959
in the wayn if we look at extreme heat

238
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:48,360
so this is a metric of 4day average

239
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:50,399
temperature the 5year return period so

240
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,839
like the 98 percentile or something like

241
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,480
that not too interesting stream heat has

242
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:57,360
not changed very much in the Northeast I

243
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,639
can't tell you we have more heat Wings

244
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,560
the observational record doesn't support

245
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:04,639
that if I look at the opposite side same

246
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,319
type of metric but for cold spells in

247
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:09,399
Winter and here again a fairly

248
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,240
substantial a statistically significant

249
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:13,958
downward Trend so this idea of winter

250
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,600
warming um being more pronounced than

251
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:19,199
summer warming we look at the frostfree

252
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,639
season again a statistically significant

253
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,720
Trend um almost over this period of time

254
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,000
at least a week of lengthening of the

255
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,759
growing season and we'll see in those

256
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,399
projections that this is going to even

257
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:34,439
get longer than that you know we can

258
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:36,159
have a quite a nice growing season if if

259
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,000
climate change plays out or when climate

260
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:41,719
change plays out we look at total annual

261
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,480
precipitation again a statistically

262
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,480
significant upward Trend kind of looking

263
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,079
at this you know kind of again it's a

264
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,879
precipitation anomaly in inches so we've

265
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:52,838
increased over this 100 years on the

266
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,200
order of four or five inches that's

267
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,279
about 10% if we figure H against about

268
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,120
40 in of rain

269
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:02,679
here um where it really gets interesting

270
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,200
at least in my mind and a lot of my

271
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:07,559
research has focused on this is Extreme

272
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,560
rainfall okay so even though we have a

273
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:11,919
subtle increase in rainfall but what

274
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:14,599
really changes is the character of how

275
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:17,559
that rainfall comes so again kind of an

276
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,680
index so don't get too upset by the by

277
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:24,078
the seemingly small numbers here um this

278
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:25,919
is a derived value but we have a a very

279
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,958
significant actually almost if you look

280
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,559
at the numbers just in their magnitude

281
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:32,159
almost a doubling

282
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:34,239
of extreme precipitation events across

283
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,240
the Northeast so this is you know this

284
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,720
is the 5year return period daily

285
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,839
precipitation it's about 3-in rainfall

286
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,120
so basically we can expect the frequency

287
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,639
or we've seen the frequency of 2 3 4 in

288
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,120
rainfall events nearly double over the

289
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,600
last 100

290
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,440
years um I work with Bill fry a little

291
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,879
bit and I know Bill is always interested

292
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,160
in humidity so um again not the greatest

293
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:02,278
graph but from some work of post off and

294
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:03,838
I have done uh basically if we look this

295
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:06,720
is

296
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,800
spring um this is daytime hours this is

297
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,879
night time hours this set of graphs are

298
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:14,639
temperature so temperature goes up

299
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:16,559
everywhere basically and the big dots

300
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,879
that kind of have the the black borders

301
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,198
around them are statistically

302
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:22,278
significant Trends so kind of the size

303
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:24,319
of the dots represent the magnitude of

304
00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:26,078
the trend but you look at the ones that

305
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,879
have kind of the black circles if your

306
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,198
eyes are good enough those are

307
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:32,198
statistically so pretty much red dots

308
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:34,519
over the entire country most of the

309
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:37,479
northern here statistically significant

310
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:40,240
spring Day Spring night middle graph is

311
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,920
dupoint so you can think of dupoint as

312
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,278
really a measure of the actual amount of

313
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:47,559
vapor that's in the atmosphere it's

314
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:51,039
essentially grams of water vapor in the

315
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:54,599
atmosphere and even oops going back and

316
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,958
even here primarily red dots everywhere

317
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,240
and most of them at least in the

318
00:12:55,958 --> 00:13:00,319
northern TI statistically significant so

319
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,639
the actual amount of vapor in the

320
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,959
atmosphere has gone up relative

321
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:09,198
humidity in the last column is just that

322
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,759
it's relative it's how much vapor is in

323
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:14,559
the atmosphere relative to what the

324
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:17,799
atmosphere can hold so hopefully most

325
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:19,638
people in class or in class in in here

326
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:21,198
realize and I know Trevor will learn

327
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,680
this very quickly because he's in my

328
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:25,879
thermal class that as we heat the

329
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,879
atmosphere it holds more it can hold

330
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:29,399
more water vapor so it takes more water

331
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:31,120
vapor to saturate

332
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,039
and that's what relative humidity is

333
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,000
measuring it's measuring the ratio of

334
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,919
the amount of water vapor that's in the

335
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,679
atmosphere to the amount that the

336
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:42,000
atmosphere can hold before it saturates

337
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,120
so these two things taken in concert

338
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,519
with one another actually show a

339
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,480
decrease in relative humidity in most

340
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:52,198
places blue dots and actually over the

341
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,320
Northeast here a lot of circle dots

342
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:57,399
significant dos a drop in relative

343
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,680
humidity so basically the atmosphere

344
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:02,600
warms so much and even though the vapor

345
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:04,679
goes up it doesn't go up enough to cause

346
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,278
it to change it's its relative

347
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:10,000
saturation uh in terms of relative

348
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:12,078
humidity um we kind of see the same

349
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,198
thing in Spring maybe as we go to the

350
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,519
relative humidity column a little bit

351
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:19,919
different not much going on at night

352
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:22,679
here um and some spous actually positive

353
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:25,679
Trends across the Northeast so kind of

354
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:28,399
um this observational study don't ask me

355
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,958
why that happens in that case a lot of

356
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,879
EV for what might go on here in the

357
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:35,799
Midwest um in terms of this in terms of

358
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:38,720
the increase in Irrigation in crops so

359
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:40,000
adding another uh source of moisture

360
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,720
perhaps to the

361
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,278
atmosphere um and then last I think my

362
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,839
last slide for looking back is days with

363
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:50,039
snow cover and I know um this is to me

364
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,880
remarkable this is the number of days

365
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:54,278
that have at least an inch of snow on

366
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:57,360
the ground in Winter and if we look at

367
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:59,879
over a kind of an older graph but over a

368
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,480
30e period that that number of days is

369
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:06,240
deined by more than 30 years uh 30 days

370
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,800
so you know 30 days fewer during winter

371
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,600
when we have at least an inch of snow on

372
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:11,120
the

373
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,199
ground all right so what does the future

374
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,600
hold um and to say what the future holds

375
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:18,719
we need to ask a model okay and

376
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,480
unfortunately most meteorologists most

377
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,160
climatologists are more like Sheldon

378
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,240
from Big Bang so our models look more

379
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:27,399
like this than in the previous life so

380
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,240
lots and lots of

381
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:31,879
Ms um

382
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,480
and essentially these equations that go

383
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:37,000
into it's just a smattering of them

384
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,199
really the idea is if we look at the

385
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,318
climate system in this cartoonist

386
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:45,679
climate system all of these things we

387
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:48,479
need to basically depict represent

388
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:51,479
mathematically so not only you know the

389
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,278
amount of wherever it is um you know

390
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:57,959
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere but how

391
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:59,198
do changes in the sun's input vary

392
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,879
what's the chemist chemistry that's

393
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:04,120
going on in the atmosphere not only

394
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:07,039
between not only with CO2 but a whole

395
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,720
range of different gases uh aerosols

396
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,958
when do the volcanoes go off they have

397
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,959
an effect on the climate how does the

398
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,879
biosphere interact with the atmosphere

399
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,758
what happens in the cloud so again you

400
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,278
kind of see lots and lots of math

401
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:22,079
equations to make this happen and a lot

402
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:24,198
lots of kind of Integrated Systems that

403
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:28,239
need to talk to one another things that

404
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:30,120
happen on different scales etc etc um

405
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,360
and then kind of just maybe a history

406
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:37,360
lesson um kind of the evolution of these

407
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,278
models okay so in basically my time from

408
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,039
grad school till I guess I have to

409
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:44,318
extend this graph to today these models

410
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:45,719
that we use to to simulate what the

411
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:48,198
climate's going to look like in the

412
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,680
future have really evolved a lot in

413
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:53,000
terms of their complexity and also the

414
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:55,479
components of the system that factor

415
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,120
into it early on here we had the

416
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,240
atmosphere the model didn't even know

417
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,600
about the ocean basically

418
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,279
it wasn't until you know really we moved

419
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,078
into the early 90s that the ocean was

420
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:09,720
actually part in an interactive part of

421
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:11,438
the model and as we move today you can

422
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,600
see the whole range of things the carbon

423
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,880
cycle is affected so as we warm the

424
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,279
tundra and the meth thing gets released

425
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,199
that's something that the model knows

426
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,678
about it's you know it's interactive

427
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,120
it's dynamic in the model now as opposed

428
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,400
to something I have to specify or guess

429
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:28,318
at the

430
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:31,559
model um so the model works on a bunch

431
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:34,918
of grids basically Global Climate models

432
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:36,839
have um a resolution on the order the

433
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,720
the latest kind of state of the art

434
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:41,079
models as a round number a degree of

435
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,880
latitude by a degree of longitude for

436
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:45,879
these grids the models know about One

437
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,120
value for these boxes right so there's

438
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,000
one value of temperature for a box

439
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:52,918
there's one value of elevation for a box

440
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,558
so basically it's an average over that

441
00:17:52,919 --> 00:18:00,480
one Dee by one Dee um M grids go up into

442
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:02,918
the atmosphere G go down into the ocean

443
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,720
um sometimes the grid size varies so if

444
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:07,520
we want to um if we want to specify

445
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,360
processes maybe near the surface of the

446
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:12,279
ocean that occur in a showerer level the

447
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:13,759
boxes might be a little bit narrower

448
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:15,759
there than they are in the deep ocean

449
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,919
where it really doesn't matter over

450
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,879
hundreds of kilometers of depth you can

451
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,799
say the same thing in the atmosphere you

452
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,159
know some some surface soil layers so

453
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,960
basically working on boxes and you know

454
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,240
maybe even here I'm going to mention

455
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,720
clouds because I mean clouds are clearly

456
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,679
one of the biggest sources of

457
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,519
uncertainty because they fall between

458
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:37,960
the cracks we have these large grid

459
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:41,279
boxes in the gcms the physics are well

460
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:43,720
represented at those scales kilometers

461
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,599
hundreds of kilometers maybe but when we

462
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,558
look at something like clouds to get the

463
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:50,319
physics right we need to be on

464
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:53,200
micrometers you know 10us 6 as opposed

465
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:56,319
to 10 the 3 or something like that so a

466
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,000
very hard mismatching scale to get the

467
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:00,918
physics right and say something like a

468
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,679
cloud in have a top climate mod and also

469
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:06,640
clouds tend to occur on smaller scales

470
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,720
than these grid boxes um so kind of to

471
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,080
put this into perspective in this graph

472
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,038
I think we're going to come back to this

473
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,439
graph but look at the red dots so

474
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:16,759
basically if this is the United States

475
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,480
um in a typical climate model the big

476
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:21,158
red dots are the grid points so there

477
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,079
are there's essentially one maybe you

478
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:27,000
can argue two grid points over the state

479
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:29,119
of New York um if we look at the United

480
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,798
States and a typical State ofthe art

481
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,279
today present day climate model it looks

482
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:36,000
something like this those are its

483
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:37,558
borders whoops missing Florida um most

484
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,038
of the Great Lakes are missing there's

485
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:42,678
one GD there's one grid point over Lake

486
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:44,640
Superior so that's what the Lakes look

487
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:47,759
like to the models so you can see a very

488
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,799
crude representation at the GCM scale

489
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,359
and this is a reflection of topography

490
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:54,359
again if I go back every the model only

491
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:57,319
knows about one value for each of these

492
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:59,119
red dots so it's not surprising that the

493
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:01,439
Rocky Mountains look like a hump as

494
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:03,239
opposed to the Rocky Mountains um and

495
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,360
actually notice very little here over

496
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,798
the appalation GCM

497
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:10,479
scale so um typically what is done

498
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,158
nowadays is something that's called

499
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,919
downs scale so it's nice to have these

500
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,640
Global models it's nice to say boy the

501
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,038
global temperature is going to change by

502
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,880
this much over the next 100 years but

503
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:21,798
when we start to talk about impacts and

504
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,159
adaptations you know people really don't

505
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:25,879
care about these large GCM grid boxes

506
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,559
they want to know well I pick Europe up

507
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,200
here basically what's happening in New

508
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:30,918
York what's happening in the wine

509
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,960
growing region of New York so really

510
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:36,080
kind of really really focused um type

511
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,279
data so the way we do that is

512
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,960
downscaling and there's really two ways

513
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:43,399
that we can downscale climate model data

514
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,440
we can do it statistically basically

515
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,798
using regression of some statistical

516
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,400
model to link the large scale climate

517
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:51,960
model variables to the local scale

518
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,880
climate conditions that we're interested

519
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,640
in or we can do it dynamically we can

520
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,919
use a finer resolution model we can feed

521
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,559
the data from a large scale climate

522
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:06,200
model into a finer scale what we call

523
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:09,720
RCM is a regional climate model um and

524
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,840
let actually the physics do that um both

525
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,480
have their strengths and weaknesses and

526
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,480
really state-of-the-art is I can't tell

527
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,079
you one is better than the other there's

528
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,640
probably some reasons why you'd want to

529
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,918
do it statistically there's other

530
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,960
reasons why youd want to do it

531
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:25,080
dynamically so it really just depends

532
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,159
neither of these value neither of these

533
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:29,839
have really evolved enough to say yep

534
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,278
think maybe doing it dynamically is the

535
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:35,480
better way to do it but in the end you

536
00:21:32,278 --> 00:21:38,599
really don't see that in terms of that

537
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,798
um so again a few words of uncertainty

538
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:42,599
and basically there's a whole Cascade of

539
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:45,200
uncertainty when we're looking at maybe

540
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:48,879
going from what the climate is going to

541
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,400
be like to or what the climate is to uh

542
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,440
what are the impacts going to be or how

543
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,840
should we adapt right we have think of

544
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,558
the graphs that I've showed so far we

545
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:58,959
have uncertainty into how our CO2

546
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:01,000
emissions are going to evolve so

547
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,360
basically what's Society going to look

548
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,720
like and how given that society looks

549
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,359
like something how is our CO2 emissions

550
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,519
going to evolve right we could still be

551
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:12,519
a very economically driven Society very

552
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:14,440
consumeristic Society but maybe we're

553
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:16,720
going to do it with Renewables as

554
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,480
opposed to fossil fuels um or maybe

555
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,038
we're going to become a more sustainable

556
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,720
society and we have a blend of fuels as

557
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:25,679
opposed to going totally to Renewables

558
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,120
and clearly uncertainties in the global

559
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:31,240
models clearly uncertainties in the down

560
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:33,639
scaling techniques um you know if I gave

561
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,558
you a set of downscale data what would

562
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,278
you do with it you probably put it into

563
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:40,359
some model of some plant pathogen or

564
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:44,640
some yield model or something like that

565
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:46,479
and hopefully unless unless I'm mistaken

566
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,320
know your models have uncertainties as

567
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,319
well right so there's another level of

568
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:53,359
uncertainty there and then the

569
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:55,399
adaptation response okay yeah maybe the

570
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:57,000
plant's going to respond this way and

571
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,880
then I have to adapt to it and there's

572
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,839
uncertainties that adaptation model so a

573
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,039
whole Cascade of uncertainties from you

574
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:06,278
know you think this is uncertain by the

575
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:09,200
time you get down to year might say I

576
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:12,640
forget about it but that's not the case

577
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:15,679
um all right so real quickly how is this

578
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,679
downscaling done and there's a number of

579
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,519
different ways to do it perhaps the most

580
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:23,440
simple is called the Delta method and

581
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:25,200
really this is what we used in the in

582
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,360
the New York State climate assessment

583
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,640
the climate report um it's really based

584
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:32,719
on the mean and really what it does is

585
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,000
it takes the climate model temperature

586
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,159
for some historical period so these

587
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,519
climate models aren't only run into the

588
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:41,200
future they're also run into the past

589
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,798
all right they run backwards all right

590
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,400
so the physics are allowed to run

591
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:47,960
backwards so the climate model has some

592
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,759
estimate of what the climate looked like

593
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,880
say in this base period and then it also

594
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:55,278
has a projection for what it looks like

595
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,960
say at the end of the century and all

596
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:59,679
the Delta is very simple it's the mean

597
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,759
it's the difference in the mean of those

598
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,880
two distributions the historical model

599
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:10,400
distribution and the future and then to

600
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:12,760
downscale the data um I maybe uh find

601
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,400
the station I'm interested in or the

602
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:16,919
grid I'm interested in if I have an

603
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,159
observed grided database and I say all

604
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:22,038
right here's where I am in this base

605
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:23,919
period I add the Delta to it and that's

606
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:26,119
what I have in the future so again not

607
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,159
rocket science here so basically all it

608
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:30,000
is is saying the climate model Chang by

609
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,520
this much in the mean through time I'm

610
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,558
going to add that to the current value

611
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:36,359
um this is what we used in the New York

612
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,200
State assessment you can do this monthly

613
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:40,918
you can use it daily if you use this

614
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:44,000
daily I might say well the climate model

615
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:46,880
in July increased its bean temperature

616
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,960
by 5 Dees and if I want to get a daily

617
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,919
series of the future I might go back to

618
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,159
July's at a station in the future and

619
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,880
every day add 5 Dees to that temperature

620
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,760
so I don't change the variance at all I

621
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,039
don't change the day-to-day change I

622
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,879
just make everything

623
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:05,158
former this is what's done

624
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,880
sometimes um obviously that's not

625
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,679
state-of-the-art and pretty much most of

626
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,159
the statistical

627
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,120
downscaling kind of a busy graph here

628
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,559
but it you know what you might expect it

629
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:19,719
takes some set of predictor variables it

630
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:22,240
may be temperature at that large GCM

631
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,278
scale then it develops some type of a

632
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,839
relationship using a statistical model

633
00:25:24,278 --> 00:25:29,919
either a regression an analog approach a

634
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:31,918
neural network or something like that to

635
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,120
derive a statistical relationship a

636
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,080
statistical model to get you the down

637
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:38,558
scale value so you might start off with

638
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:40,519
temperature at the GCM scale do your

639
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:44,639
statistics and end up at with

640
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:46,359
temperature in IA let's say or um maybe

641
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,600
instead of temperature I take the bigger

642
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:50,158
picture I I I become a meteorologist and

643
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:52,319
I say okay this is what the weather map

644
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,200
look like this is what the heights are

645
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:57,158
this is what the amount of moisture in

646
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,240
the atmosphere is and I use those as

647
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:00,960
predictors through some statistical

648
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,679
technique and I get temperature or

649
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:09,159
snowfall or precipitation or

650
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:11,159
humidity that you know for for that

651
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:13,720
everyone get that basic concept there I

652
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:16,799
guess all right and then the last way to

653
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:20,120
do this is dynamically so really here we

654
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:22,398
have our model at the GCM scale we have

655
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:24,398
our finer resolution Regional climate

656
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:27,199
model it has some

657
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:29,239
boundary and really it's the GCM that

658
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,798
feeds in and gives this model its

659
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,960
boundary conditions okay so the data

660
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:36,879
that's input to this finer scale which

661
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,880
might know at least in my picture hear

662
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,600
about the Alps or the United States

663
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,120
about the Rockies or the Adera or the

664
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,839
Great Lakes right because remember the

665
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:47,879
Great Lakes really aren't the climate

666
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:50,759
model um this Regional model is able to

667
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,399
resolve that scale the boundary

668
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:55,398
conditions feed into the edges kind of

669
00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:57,278
keeps it you know is the Northeast in a

670
00:26:55,398 --> 00:26:59,719
trough is the Northeast in a ridge on a

671
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:02,200
given day day at the large scale and

672
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:05,720
then how does that play out at the finer

673
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:08,720
scale so we look at it this way here's

674
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,519
the typical us boundary in a regional

675
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,720
climate model so again you can see that

676
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,519
increase in resolution we kind of have

677
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,399
Florida um kind of see most of the Great

678
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:20,918
Lakes although I would argue Ontario and

679
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:23,639
Eerie aren't really represented no

680
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:26,440
Finger Lakes okay so again not kind of

681
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,600
keeping the scale there and you can

682
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,840
obviously see a lot more more uh

683
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:32,678
definition of the Rocky Mountains and

684
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:35,319
kind of hard to see here but also an

685
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:37,200
indication of the appalachi so again

686
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:38,798
it's getting that physics right right we

687
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,480
can solve the physics of what's going to

688
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:42,440
happen with changes in elevation and

689
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,399
things like that much better on a much

690
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,558
finer scale here than we might have in

691
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:50,479
the global

692
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:52,398
sense um all right so no matter what we

693
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,278
do in terms of

694
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:57,000
downscaling we're not going to get it

695
00:27:54,278 --> 00:28:00,440
perfect so there's there's bias um so

696
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,880
this is an example of um bias and

697
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,759
actually some downscale extreme rainfall

698
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,519
that we're working on so this is

699
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:11,240
dynamically downscaled each of the

700
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:13,399
colored box plots represent um a

701
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,240
different combination of a global model

702
00:28:13,398 --> 00:28:18,079
and a different Regional model and

703
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,440
basically what I'm trying to predict

704
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,759
here I think it is the I think it's the

705
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,399
100-year storm actually in terms

706
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:28,158
of and you can see some

707
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:31,439
combinations do pretty pathetic you know

708
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:34,240
they're they're 25 or% lower than they

709
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,600
should be um some combinations are spot

710
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,399
on okay in the mean the width of the box

711
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:43,359
plot represents how well do these models

712
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:45,319
work for about 150 stations in New York

713
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:48,000
so the scale of these box plots are New

714
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:49,359
York and basically the spread represents

715
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,240
how well can these downscaling

716
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:53,759
techniques represent the the changes in

717
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,640
extreme rainfall at all of these

718
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,640
stations so again even though these

719
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,200
might look pretty good in Median on

720
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,320
average no bias um you know there is a

721
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,919
fair amount of spread in the Box CL you

722
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:07,639
know on the order of maybe

723
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,240
10%

724
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,080
um here's a different approach same type

725
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,359
of thing but with an analog approach a

726
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,798
statistical approach and you can see

727
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:17,678
here is might be an example where you

728
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:19,398
might argue boy those look a lot better

729
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,080
in this case they're a lot more closed

730
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:23,798
the bias tends to be less the spread of

731
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:25,960
the box plots particularly with this

732
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:28,200
statistical method seems to be a little

733
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,960
bit less kind of gives an idea of I

734
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,480
think not only the uncertainty in doing

735
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,278
this but also that really no one way is

736
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,480
better than the other in this case and

737
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:38,558
we have to look at a number of different

738
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,278
ways to kind of come up to say what kind

739
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:45,960
of down scale am I get use for

740
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:48,839
this um so here is the latest

741
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:51,360
state-of-the-art downscale temperature

742
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:54,798
projection for the Northeast it's a NASA

743
00:29:51,359 --> 00:30:00,639
product it downscales the climate of 2

744
00:29:54,798 --> 00:30:03,038
yeah 2100 in July at 800 M so if I said

745
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,679
boy should I you know you want to use

746
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:07,519
this product in your in your research

747
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,798
what would you say you know is this like

748
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:11,919
state-ofthe-art

749
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:14,359
or I'm going to say or is it you know

750
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,640
fire beware okay so the point that I

751
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:20,119
want to make here yeah it's easy to

752
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,960
downscale to whatever scale you want but

753
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:24,079
you know there's only so much data you

754
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,360
can you know I can slice and dice the

755
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:29,720
current observations down to 100 met if

756
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:32,439
I want are you going to believe you know

757
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,000
that value I worked with Alan Lao a

758
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,880
little bit and his temperature sensors

759
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,599
in the finger LS you know just looking

760
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,278
at Vineyards and slopes down to the

761
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:43,079
lakes and know even with the data how

762
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:45,480
hard it was to try to model that and

763
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:47,798
here okay yeah I can you can you know go

764
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,919
on the web and find this downscale

765
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:53,599
product at you know a resolution of

766
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,919
eight football fields and um you know

767
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:57,918
you can believe it or not and just as an

768
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,960
example again with these downscale

769
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:03,440
products um this is no different from

770
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,679
really what we do in weather forecasting

771
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,798
okay so you know you watch Dave iorn or

772
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,880
Wing Mahar God forbid or something like

773
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:11,918
that and you know essentially you know

774
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,360
when they're looking at what goes on in

775
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,080
the fingerlakes or in the Great Lakes

776
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:17,879
they're really doing a form of this

777
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:20,398
dynamical downscaling they're taking a

778
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,080
large scale weather forecasting model

779
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:23,719
and then they have a regional model that

780
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:26,199
knows about the finger legs knows about

781
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,079
the gra legs and things like that so my

782
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,960
example is um since it rained on

783
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:34,240
Saturday morning I put together my talk

784
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,759
Saturday morning and you know this is a

785
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,720
this is a weather forecasting model for

786
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:40,679
Saturday morning I was thinking how much

787
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,079
did it was you know remember it rained

788
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:44,798
Saturday morning so basically what I did

789
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:47,439
was how much did the model predict was

790
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:51,119
going to fall in IA versus how much it

791
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:55,399
actually did so this example spot on

792
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:59,599
okay spot on but enough oops

793
00:31:55,398 --> 00:32:02,518
ah God darn it M up anyway but if you

794
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:04,278
know it's spot on in itha but if I look

795
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:06,919
say a different spot if I look up at the

796
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:10,798
Cena the model was predicting

797
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:12,559
0.55 it only got 006 so again this idea

798
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:14,119
the finest of the models that you look

799
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:16,440
at you're still going to have you know

800
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:18,239
they're not going to Bea so this this

801
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:21,480
increase in resolution doesn't

802
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,798
necessarily mean higher RS so anyway now

803
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,839
back to the future so um what is the

804
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:28,759
temperature going to look like so a

805
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:32,759
number of slides that come out of the

806
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:34,879
national assessment basically and um a

807
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:38,480
lot of them are laid out sort of like

808
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:41,880
this where the slides on your left um

809
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,720
labeled A2 are a high emission scenario

810
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,200
it's really that business as usual

811
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,798
scenario where we double CO2 over the

812
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:52,960
next 50 years quadruple over the next

813
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:55,158
100 years the B1 scenario is a lower

814
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,798
emission scenario it's one where we kind

815
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:00,720
of peak emissions midcentury and then

816
00:32:57,798 --> 00:33:02,720
come back down so that by 2100 we're

817
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,159
about where we are today about eight or

818
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,519
nine megat tons of carbon per

819
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:10,919
year and then the row across the top is

820
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:14,240
mid-century kind of the the period from

821
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:17,799
from 2040 to 2070 and then the bottom is

822
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,880
the end of the century 2070 to basically

823
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:23,558
2100 so if we look across the Northeast

824
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,720
um you know the big contrast mid-century

825
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:27,798
again doesn't matter really what we do

826
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:30,079
in terms of admissions end of the

827
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:32,240
century matters a lot a lot of red in

828
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:34,798
the high emissions not a lot in the low

829
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,599
emissions this big you know the bright

830
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:39,440
red here essentially um switching back

831
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,918
and forth in units I'm sorry that's a

832
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,679
pitfall of of doing meteorology um

833
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:47,278
you're on the order of 8 or n degrees

834
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:50,000
fahit warmer at the end of the century

835
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:54,200
than we are today on average a average

836
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,038
temperature by midcentury maybe about 4°

837
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,840
warmer than we under the low emiss

838
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:04,278
scenario a little bit better maybe about

839
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:05,638
two versus maybe about five there um now

840
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:08,320
unfortunately when the national

841
00:34:05,638 --> 00:34:10,398
assessment was done it was done on an

842
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,639
older generation of climate models so

843
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:15,000
the newer model runs for the for the

844
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,039
International Panel on climate change

845
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,559
were being run at the time the US did

846
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,679
the national assessment so kind of

847
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:23,838
looking at this and I know this is not a

848
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,240
great graph but what this is intended to

849
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:28,039
show is the difference between the older

850
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,439
generation climate models that the

851
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:32,159
national assessment is based on versus

852
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,720
the early runs of these new models that

853
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,838
are going into the

854
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:38,598
ipcc and if you look at this graph uh

855
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:41,078
especially across the Northeast it's

856
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:43,240
kind of yellow and orange yellow and

857
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:45,359
orange are a number greater than one so

858
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:47,759
what that says the newer models show an

859
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:50,759
increase in the warming as opposed to

860
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,560
the the older models by about a

861
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:57,320
degree um the warming projected occurs

862
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:59,078
across all seasons so this idea a of

863
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,559
looking at the past observations and

864
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:03,160
saying most of the warming has been in

865
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:05,679
the winter doesn't play out as we go

866
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:08,480
into the future as we go into the future

867
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:10,799
the amount of warming in the winter is

868
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,358
really just about the same if not a

869
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:18,400
little bit less than what we see in the

870
00:35:14,358 --> 00:35:20,838
summer um we look at very hot days in

871
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,680
the future they get hotter so these are

872
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:25,279
the number of days that have a maximum

873
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:28,319
temperature greater than

874
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,760
95 so if I kind of here in our neck of

875
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,559
the woods that number goes up by about

876
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,359
four to five days and you know most

877
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:39,920
people who've lived here in Ithaca know

878
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:42,519
that a day above 95 is not unheard of

879
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,480
but but very very rare but what this is

880
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:47,519
saying is that on average by kind of

881
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,760
mid-century we can expect about four or

882
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,800
five of those days you know if you're

883
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,480
down here in mind NE of the woods where

884
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:56,480
I grew up in New Jersey you're talking

885
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:59,240
about you know 14 or 15 more of those

886
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:03,599
days um per

887
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:06,358
year um very cold days become a lot less

888
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,280
so kind of a mnom here in color but if I

889
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:10,799
look up across the North country in the

890
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:14,319
adex these are days with the minimum

891
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:17,839
temperature below 10° F and we see a

892
00:36:14,318 --> 00:36:20,559
decrease of about 20 to 25 of those days

893
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:23,838
so these very very cold days become less

894
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:27,639
again that whole distribution shifting

895
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:30,440
over um free speed period increases by

896
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:32,078
about three weeks by the middle of the

897
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,240
century middle end of the

898
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:39,400
century um relative humidity again sorry

899
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:42,199
for a fuzzy graph but um notice the dots

900
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,440
the blue lines are the zero lines so

901
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:47,279
basically here this is the western North

902
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,240
America this is Central North America um

903
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,519
sorry the study that I swiped and didn't

904
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:54,719
reference for this didn't do anything in

905
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:57,679
the Eastern us but as you can see most

906
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:59,959
of the projections across of changes in

907
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:02,159
temperature are again showing decreases

908
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,880
in relative humidity the idea is the

909
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:07,159
temperature continues to go up and the

910
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,559
absolute level of moisture continues to

911
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:13,679
go up but they don't match up and you

912
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:17,599
end up with relatively lower uh

913
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:21,279
R um these are um average rainfall so

914
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:24,200
rainfall goes up by about 5 6% go

915
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,319
through the century um it gets even

916
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:29,759
worse in the new generation models

917
00:37:27,318 --> 00:37:33,000
actually goes up by about 10% more than

918
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,720
the older generation we showing um

919
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,960
interesting though the majority the line

920
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:41,480
share of that increas is winter we look

921
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,159
at summer in all of the models and all

922
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:46,519
of the scenarios it's basically a wash

923
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,679
saying you know it can easily go it can

924
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:50,719
easily get higher or lower in the

925
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:52,960
summertime so essentially you can say

926
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:55,159
summer States about like it is but all

927
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,559
of this increase in rainfall is really a

928
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:59,960
winter time phenomenon which again

929
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:01,719
meteorologically makes a lot of sense if

930
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,318
you kind of think about the winters

931
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:05,679
getting warmer and being able to hold

932
00:38:03,318 --> 00:38:08,838
more water vapor and and have big

933
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:11,199
rainfall events um we look at these

934
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:13,400
extreme rainfall events like two 3in

935
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:16,399
rainfall events in the frequency of

936
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:18,519
these go up actually tremendously across

937
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,559
New York State we're seeing a you know a

938
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:25,000
percent change on the order of 25 almost

939
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:27,559
30% in some cases I really think this

940
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
this idea of extrem rain fall playing

941
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:33,078
out is a big impact for not only the

942
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,838
Northeast but particularly uh New York

943
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:38,640
in that case um again this is some of

944
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:41,480
our work and it's actually showing the

945
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:43,440
100-year storm um basically the amount

946
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,960
of rainfall you would expect to see in a

947
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:50,200
100-year storm um 100-year storm for IA

948
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,358
is about a 6 in rainfall in the day and

949
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:54,719
what we're projecting kind of by the end

950
00:38:52,358 --> 00:38:59,440
of the century for that to go up on

951
00:38:54,719 --> 00:39:02,000
about 40% so know 100e storm 40% more

952
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,358
rainfall if you do that the other way

953
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,719
around a storm you would expect to occur

954
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:10,598
now every 100 years occurs about every

955
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:12,078
60 or 50 years um so a big change in the

956
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:16,000
frequency of these

957
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:17,960
events um dry period length um kind of

958
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,239
you often hear that we're going to have

959
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:23,119
more shortterm drought and that kind of

960
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:25,078
plays out for the southern part of the

961
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,000
region but as we move across New York

962
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:28,839
This Kind of Blue

963
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,760
um blue to Brown transition is

964
00:39:28,838 --> 00:39:34,679
essentially zero so this idea of shorter

965
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,839
term prolonged dry periods with no rain

966
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:39,078
really doesn't play out but that doesn't

967
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:41,279
necessarily say that the amount of rain

968
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:43,200
you get in these events kind of goes up

969
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,359
it's just that it rains right so the

970
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:47,799
period of time between rainfall events

971
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:50,239
so you can imagine even if this doesn't

972
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,599
change but if your rainfall events are a

973
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:54,078
half an inch versus a tenth of an inch

974
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:55,160
that makes a big difference in terms of

975
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,880
the

976
00:39:55,159 --> 00:40:01,318
a so so I think that was all right so

977
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,480
kind of being almost right on time just

978
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:07,639
some closing thoughts um but the first

979
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,880
thing is um

980
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:12,480
uncertainty downscale projections are

981
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,400
not fact they're a guide they're a gauge

982
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,760
they're the best we have so I'm not

983
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,318
saying don't use them but I'm saying

984
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:21,640
Beware of the uncertainty and then also

985
00:40:19,318 --> 00:40:24,358
kind of my pet peeve finer resolution

986
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:28,039
does not be better um just means we

987
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:31,119
diced it a little biter

988
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:34,519
um basically all of the downscaling

989
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:36,640
represents changes in mean really

990
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:40,000
doesn't talk about changes in the

991
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:42,078
variant and these are actually some runs

992
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,440
from actually the last National

993
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:48,119
assessment that first started to look at

994
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,960
changes in variant and these are an

995
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:52,960
average over a bunch of models and say

996
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,159
basically in some seasons in some

997
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,000
periods of time the variance goes up in

998
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:59,920
others it goes down

999
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,838
maybe you you looked at this and you had

1000
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,159
at least one kind of cohesive message on

1001
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:07,159
this is well maybe summer and fall have

1002
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:09,920
higher variants and maybe winter has

1003
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:12,799
lower variant point that I want to make

1004
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,079
is don't necessarily read into this too

1005
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,519
much because if I had a different graph

1006
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:20,359
and actually showed the variance change

1007
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:21,719
in the different models um you know

1008
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:23,318
basically they're all over the place and

1009
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:25,719
these are just the means that are coming

1010
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:27,239
out that and this is very important I

1011
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:29,759
mean we're actually doing some work on

1012
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:32,838
Frost risk and kind of looking at the

1013
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,680
risk of frost damage to crops as the

1014
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:36,199
average temperature goes up and

1015
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:39,318
essentially as the average temperature

1016
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:41,679
goes up the risk of frost doesn't really

1017
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:43,800
change that much all it does is it

1018
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:45,279
happens at the different time of year so

1019
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,519
there's still I don't know if you know

1020
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,800
if there's a 10% chance that this stage

1021
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:52,759
Gets Zapped by Frost

1022
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,760
currently there's still a 10% chance

1023
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:58,359
that that happens in the future instead

1024
00:41:54,760 --> 00:42:00,119
of happening in May it might happen in

1025
00:41:58,358 --> 00:42:02,759
April in that case so basically the

1026
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:06,519
whole cycle is kind of just earlier and

1027
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:08,440
earlier ear but if you superimpose a

1028
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:10,039
change in variance on that actually a

1029
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,838
very small change in variance something

1030
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:15,519
on the order of five or 10% you get a

1031
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:17,880
huge difference in Frost risk so here's

1032
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:19,719
an example of an potential impact of

1033
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,720
climate change some people say Frost

1034
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:23,879
risk is going to go up under climate

1035
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:26,239
change which I don't necessarily agree

1036
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,400
with in kind of doing this to see that

1037
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:30,159
it's really something that's being

1038
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,160
driven by the V changes in variant as

1039
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:33,879
opposed to changes in mean something

1040
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:37,159
that we don't have a very good handle on

1041
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,960
particularly in our downscale data and

1042
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:41,118
so basically just to leave it you know

1043
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,000
obviously the climate is changing uh we

1044
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,880
have to adapt um again remember our

1045
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,400
emissions are obviously important for

1046
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,440
future Generations in the magnitude of

1047
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,800
the event but regardless of what we're

1048
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:56,480
going to do um we got to ad that to so

1049
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,480
work out pretty well so I think we have

1050
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,480
some time for a few

1051
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:08,759
questions this has been a production of

1052
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:11,759
Cornell University on the web at

1053
