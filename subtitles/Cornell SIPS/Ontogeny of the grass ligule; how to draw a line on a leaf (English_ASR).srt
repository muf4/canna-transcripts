1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,120
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:05,119
University

3
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:14,699
hopefully I won't break into a

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,399
Huron intro bio I used to teach in this

5
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:19,559
room with Bob turchin I'm going to tell

6
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,479
you today about some recent work that

7
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:24,059
was done mostly by Robin Johnson who was

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,699
a former postdoc in our lab this is part

9
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:29,159
of a collaborative Grant with Sarah hake

10
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:33,300
and Ann Sylvester and the bioinformatic

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,820
data was all analyzed by a Chi's son

12
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:37,379
so the question was uh it was the NSF

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,140
funded project which we're now in a

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,640
renewal hopefully on a Proxima distal

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,759
patterning during May's sleep

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,739
development and the focus was on how you

17
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:48,960
basically form a boundary between two

18
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:51,659
different developmental Fields so in

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,120
this case we're working with uh the

20
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:56,339
liguel and the oracle

21
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,859
which are separating in this case on the

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,379
Maize Leaf the distal blade which is

23
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,299
photosynthetic of course and the

24
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:05,280
proximal sheath which is mostly involved

25
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,379
in supporting the plant

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,019
and the Oracle and the legal develop

27
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:12,959
together this is the epidermally derived

28
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:15,060
film a fringe of tissue all epidermally

29
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:18,000
derived and the Oracle is derived from

30
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,219
L1 and L2 layers and it forms a nice

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,680
line that separates these two distinct

32
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:24,298
developmental Fields the blade and the

33
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,340
sheath and they are very much uh

34
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,618
distinct in their differentiation at

35
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,439
adulthood you can easily tell a blade

36
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:33,180
just from epidermal characteristics from

37
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,500
sheath they have different functions

38
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,299
they're very different in their

39
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,819
structures

40
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,799
so you might ask you know okay my family

41
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:41,938
asked me who cares about this little

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,880
flip

43
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:47,399
blepo tissue on a leaf it's a film of

44
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,560
tissue who cares well actually it's a

45
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,640
great system to study how boundaries are

46
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,219
formed

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,140
and how they're organized between very

48
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:57,239
distinct developmental fields we know

49
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,159
from lots of other studies that organ

50
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,978
boundaries are often the case where new

51
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,780
axes of growth are initiated so the

52
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:06,539
question is how do you draw a line on a

53
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,560
leaf to separate these fields what

54
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,959
happens there and what are the

55
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,378
mechanisms that specify these distinct

56
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:17,159
possible distal Fates

57
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:18,780
okay so uh going back to the earliest

58
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:21,299
stages of Proxima distal development it

59
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,580
happens first when the leaf is initiated

60
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,080
in this case there's no legal we can't

61
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,300
really see any difference between the

62
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,920
blade what will be blade and will be

63
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,140
sheath which is really just a really

64
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:33,419
bottom portion of this leaf

65
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,939
primordium fate mapping tells us that

66
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:37,500
clearly most of this Leaf is now going

67
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:39,060
to be blade

68
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,979
but they're initiated from the shade of

69
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,400
glomerostems this is an SCM I did many

70
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:47,098
years ago of a 14 day old seedling

71
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,920
ripped off all but two of the leaves we

72
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:51,539
see two leaf primordia and like in most

73
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,280
other studied organisms I think everyone

74
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:56,340
that's been studied in plants so far

75
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,860
initiation of leaves and Maize

76
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,620
is correlated with a localization of

77
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,540
oxen transport proteins so this is an

78
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,480
image that Robin made from a plant

79
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:09,239
that's expressing yfp labeled pin one

80
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:11,939
pin one is an oxen efflux protein so

81
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,259
wherever you see these green lines on

82
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:15,359
the borders of these cells you can

83
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:17,219
assume pretty much that oxen is leaving

84
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,200
that cell

85
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:20,939
and you can see at the initiation point

86
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,639
of the next Leaf which is here there's

87
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:27,719
accumulation High accumulation of this

88
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:30,419
pin oxygen efflux protein and we also

89
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:32,580
also can see a line that serves towards

90
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:35,878
the middle of the of the

91
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,739
geesh the middle of the ameristam which

92
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:40,079
will eventually form the vascular trace

93
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:43,319
the mid vein we can see this clearly on

94
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,379
these well more well-developed P1 and P2

95
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:49,079
primordia I'll use those terms a lot P

96
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:51,620
refers to plasticon plasticon is defined

97
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,299
as the length of time between successive

98
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,879
Innovations of a leaf from the meristem

99
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,219
so a P1 Leaf is one leaf from the

100
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:01,798
meristem P3 is three leaves when the

101
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:04,919
meristem and so on plastic Crown is a

102
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,980
length of time it they can last a day or

103
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,719
longer so any P3 lead from two different

104
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:11,098
plants will not be at the exact same

105
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:13,019
stage of development but they'll be

106
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:14,459
close

107
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,798
okay

108
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,720
this just shows that pin one

109
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,459
we can infer the direction of transport

110
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,500
of oxygen at the site of leaf initiation

111
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,079
by looking at where these uh this pin

112
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,120
proteins are localizing in the epidermis

113
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:28,918
and we think it's moving down towards

114
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,560
where the leaf will initiate

115
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:33,959
now the legal is derived completely from

116
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,000
the epidermal layer and this is uh

117
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,339
basically work that was uh

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,620
first described in this detail by Anne

119
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:41,939
Sylvester others like Charmin and people

120
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,579
before him

121
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:45,839
did a great job describing legal

122
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:47,339
initiation

123
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,319
I always tell my students if you want to

124
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:51,599
learn about plant Anatomy maze Anatomy

125
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:54,719
made morphology look at Charming first

126
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,600
but Ann did a great job looking at uh

127
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,060
these early events in some great detail

128
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,439
and she defined at about the P5 state so

129
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,600
five leads from the meristem there's

130
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:06,300
this wide band

131
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,560
of localized anticlinal cell divisions

132
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,060
meaning they're in the plane of the

133
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,860
epidermis

134
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,418
if you can see this range of small cells

135
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,580
is forming this wide band we call this

136
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:16,680
the fat band or the fat line

137
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:18,659
and later on a little bit later in that

138
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,139
in that plasticon typically

139
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,840
and this in a region of the fat line you

140
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:26,879
can see a thin line that is emerging by

141
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:29,099
basically periclinal divisions would

142
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,600
send new growth outside the plane of the

143
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,879
epidermis

144
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,960
and that will become the liquid and the

145
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,360
rest of the development of this is

146
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:38,638
basically elongation from that of that

147
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,220
thin line from this fat line to form a

148
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,199
fringe and later on a full-blown legal

149
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,060
if you look at pen

150
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,939
this is work that was first described by

151
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,860
Sarah hake in her lab but Robin did this

152
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:52,918
also in our lab this is a bright field

153
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,680
image basically of a P5 P6 Leaf

154
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,180
primordium probably about P6 we can see

155
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,500
this line here which is the initiating

156
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,720
liguel

157
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,360
and if you look at Pin localization we

158
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,460
can see very clearly nice Stripes of uh

159
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,439
pin localization over the vasculature

160
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:09,180
that's expected that's in the L2 derived

161
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,579
layer we can see that here

162
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,560
it's internal but also there's a

163
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:15,418
striking stripe a perpendicular pin

164
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,180
localization which will Mark the

165
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:20,279
initiating ligule very surprising we can

166
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,199
see that in a cross section here it's in

167
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,599
the epidermis it doesn't connect with

168
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,240
the internal vasculature

169
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:30,000
so there's some similarities already to

170
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,220
a Lego initiation and leaf initiation

171
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,800
which is a theme of this talk looking at

172
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,840
close close-up issue versions of this

173
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,780
localization we really can't infer any

174
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:42,000
any One Direction of transport it seems

175
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:44,698
to be emptying from all sides of all

176
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,339
cells for the most part

177
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:49,500
no infer Direction

178
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:51,418
in terms of legal mutations that this

179
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,399
recessment takes to disrupt the ligul

180
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:55,680
this is work that was done mostly in the

181
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:57,478
90s and 80s by Mike freeling and Sarah

182
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,879
hakes lab but there are two ones I'll

183
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:03,418
talk about one is ligamist one which is

184
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:06,600
important this completely removes

185
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:08,939
this is messed up removes the ligul and

186
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,620
the Oracle but the line is intact there

187
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:13,379
should be an image there of uh

188
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,538
close-up of the of belief look at this

189
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:17,759
too now and so in this case look at this

190
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:19,318
one removes the ligul but the fat line

191
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,879
is there the boundary is still there

192
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,639
it's a little bit disrupted but it's

193
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,139
made ligamentous 2 is different look at

194
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,180
this too the there's a little patch of

195
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:28,918
legal in the margins but we can see

196
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,900
there's act there's actually a sheath

197
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:33,120
that is pushed up where the blades

198
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:34,500
should be so in this case the fat line

199
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,860
is missing

200
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,418
the boundary is Disturbed

201
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,280
not sure what these are showing this

202
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:43,500
must be a PC Mac thing

203
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,059
so a legacy 1 and liquidus 2 were both

204
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,680
cloned many years ago they're both

205
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,959
different types of transcription factors

206
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,819
that's not important to us right now but

207
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,739
uh they were cloned in the 90s but

208
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,598
actually Robin was the first person to

209
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,819
ever get a liquidus one in situ

210
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:59,219
hybridization to work so wherever you

211
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:01,020
see this purple uh standing right here

212
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,060
that's legitus one transcript

213
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:04,918
accumulating here's the shoot meristem

214
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,560
it's surrounded by lots and lots of

215
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:09,180
these tree-like looking a primordia and

216
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,418
we see look at this one first

217
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,699
accumulating at about P6 so after the

218
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:16,680
fat line is established where the thin

219
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:18,180
line is emerging where this Fringe is

220
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,519
just starting to grow is where we first

221
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,579
really see it

222
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:25,799
this is in keeping with uh the phenotype

223
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:28,258
the fat liners is present the boundary

224
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,879
is there but the thin line is gone

225
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:31,979
look at this two

226
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,599
is basically expressed throughout the

227
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,500
Chute this is a big surprise we don't

228
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,200
know what it's doing in the shoot

229
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:40,679
meristem but expressed everywhere but it

230
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,080
seems to only localize okay so let me uh

231
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:44,338
speed this up so there are also a bunch

232
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,680
of dominant mutants that disrupt

233
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:48,360
approximate so patterning the first uh

234
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:49,979
the most famous one is knotted one this

235
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,139
is the picture I got from Sarah it's a

236
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,539
beautiful mutation dominant gain of

237
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:57,120
function uh most of these which I'll

238
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:59,819
talk about today are class one knotted

239
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,399
like home mailbox homo domain containing

240
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,860
proteins that's what they encode that

241
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,120
are Mis expressed expressed ectopically

242
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,039
in the wrong place or the wrong

243
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,320
developmental time

244
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:11,699
and classically what they do is this is

245
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,839
a great example look it's three and

246
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:17,759
other class one Knox Gene uh it shoves

247
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:20,640
sheath tissue distally so it places

248
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,439
Blade with sheath when this happens you

249
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,559
have a new blade sheath boundary along

250
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,300
this this axis here and it's hard to see

251
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:30,119
it here but every time you have this new

252
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:32,879
abutment of ectopic sheath against blade

253
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,379
we get ectopic ligueles forming so

254
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,899
oligos form with the boundaries between

255
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:38,458
blade and sheep you can't really see it

256
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:40,200
because it's mostly a back seal view of

257
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,879
the legal is at axial

258
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,200
but if we were to look at this thing

259
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:45,958
very closely this is a beautiful

260
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,959
phenotype this is all uh sheath tissue

261
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:51,179
tissue which is expressing in the blade

262
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,619
mostly over veins and if we saw this on

263
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:54,059
the opposite side of the leaf we'd see a

264
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,320
little bit of a little flap of legal

265
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:56,879
every one of those little notches of

266
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,399
sheath

267
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:03,419
so this phenotype LED Sarah to specify

268
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:05,339
that perhaps knotted one makes sheath

269
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:08,699
and she described the expression of the

270
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:11,040
RNA and the protein many years ago it's

271
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,140
expressed in the shoot meristem not in

272
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,360
leaves it's turned off in leaves we know

273
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:18,179
now that oxen is responsible for turning

274
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,639
off Knox expression of RNA in the leap

275
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:23,099
primordium and it remains off the RNA

276
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,259
anyway remains off leaves it's also in

277
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,420
the stem the protein was shown many

278
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:29,458
years ago by Bill Lucas Dave Jackson and

279
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:32,159
Sarah to traffic through trash with

280
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:34,379
Despina so we see uh as opposed to a

281
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,059
knotted RNA which is not in the L1 layer

282
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:38,159
of the Marist and we see in the L1 layer

283
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:40,199
the protein and the L1 layer of the of

284
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,179
the meristem but you also see it in the

285
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,680
base of these Leaf primordium we don't

286
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:45,539
see RNA there

287
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,578
so Sarah thinks this is going to be

288
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:49,019
pre-sheath the sheath is very much

289
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:51,659
unelaborated at this stage of

290
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:54,360
development early on and it elaborates

291
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:56,159
last last part of the leaf to grow

292
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,440
so that makes sense so she thinks that

293
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,299
uh knotted specifies

294
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,519
sheath

295
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:04,319
so what did Robin do well she started

296
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,419
with plans and she micro dissected them

297
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,200
and I'll show you how she did that and

298
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:11,879
we did RNA uh seek analysis of micro

299
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,620
domains which I'll explain a bit she

300
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,120
analyzed the data then we went back to

301
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,560
the planets and looked and where to see

302
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,000
where these genes are expressed and now

303
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,159
we want to actually test some of our

304
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,799
models make mutants and double mutants

305
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,778
and see what's going on

306
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,278
so we used laser micro intersection a

307
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:28,379
lot of my lab and what she did was she

308
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:29,939
said okay let's go to a p7 leap where we

309
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:32,159
can clearly see the legal is just

310
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:35,459
emerging and she took three sections

311
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:38,458
each one 100 microns tall

312
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:41,458
a pre-legular emerging legal pre-sheath

313
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:42,958
and pre-blade and she left about 50

314
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,518
microns in between to make sure there

315
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,439
was no contamination

316
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:48,480
and this is a close-up of what our laser

317
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,000
micro dissection scope can do we target

318
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,519
this tissue here this is a thin section

319
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,019
of a shoot Apex it's placed on a slide

320
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,240
these are ugly images there's no

321
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:58,980
staining there's no cover slip we can

322
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,320
still see if we can see if we can get it

323
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,240
we can see the emerging legal and we can

324
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,300
blast this now off the slide into our

325
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,060
collection tube make RNA do rna-seq and

326
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:11,699
she did this analysis

327
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:13,919
reads which map uniquely the mace genome

328
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,540
is duplicated if they're unresolved

329
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,179
parallots we couldn't tell which one it

330
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:20,458
was we threw it out

331
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:21,778
okay so this is basically how we compare

332
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,559
the data I'm not going to show the the

333
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:24,539
Gory

334
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,039
Venn diagrams

335
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:27,299
but there are lots of genes which are

336
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:28,679
differentially expressed in these

337
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:30,958
three-way comparisons of legal versus

338
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,458
sheath legal versus blading Blade versus

339
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,259
two I'm going to talk mostly today about

340
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:37,199
the genes that are upregulated in the

341
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:39,480
legal and there are a lot of them

342
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,220
so as a control we looked at look at

343
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,839
this one we know we knew from the

344
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,060
institution from earlier data that it

345
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:47,940
was expressed highly in the legal and

346
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:50,159
this RNA seek data confirms this

347
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,320
basically not in the sheath or blade

348
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,838
very significantly up regulated in the

349
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,000
legal so we trusted the data we think

350
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,160
laser micro dissection works

351
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,200
so what kind of genes are they

352
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:04,019
well the gene that was the most highly

353
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,000
difference expressed in the legal

354
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:09,360
over a hundred and eight fold versus

355
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,339
illegal 50-fold versus the blade was

356
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,500
this Gene about known function

357
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:15,660
but it's a grass specific as we so far

358
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,519
as we can tell Gene we don't find

359
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:19,500
punitive orthologies of this Gene

360
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,000
outside the grasses

361
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,339
suggesting that maybe the legal it

362
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,100
really is a grass specific

363
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:28,139
sort of a structure

364
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,899
and it's expressed basically a little

365
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:32,940
bit late P6 recommend The Fringe is

366
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:34,919
starting to form and later on it

367
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,600
localizes to this Notch this boundary

368
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:39,059
between the emerging molecule and the

369
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,399
blade and even later on it's clearly in

370
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:42,179
that Notch between the legal and the

371
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,879
blade

372
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:46,919
a beautiful and Powerful expression

373
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,299
but the surprising thing was we also

374
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:50,939
found this Gene was expressed at

375
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:53,159
multiple organ boundaries so this is the

376
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,860
close-up of the pseudohypical meristem

377
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,719
this is a actually a patchwork of

378
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,180
several and situ photographs that Robin

379
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,278
made and we see it's expressed at the

380
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:04,019
boundaries of lots of lateral organs

381
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:05,700
between this incipient leaf primordium

382
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:07,500
and the meristem between this leaf

383
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,680
primordium and the meristem or the Chute

384
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,480
between this lateral bud

385
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:14,759
so it looks like it's expressed multiple

386
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,519
organ boundaries

387
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:19,019
This Grass specific Gene and this was

388
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,759
basically a theme throughout this

389
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:23,519
analysis one of the genes we found was

390
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,899
cuck two homologous two a gene and

391
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,360
arabidopsis which is a member of a

392
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:30,000
lateral organ boundary Gene family

393
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,860
expressed organ boundaries so it's it's

394
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,980
expressed clearly in this cleft between

395
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,720
the emerging liguel in PA primordia and

396
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,480
the blade at the boundary between the

397
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,800
legal and the and the leaf but it's also

398
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,199
expressed that boundaries between Leaf

399
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,578
primordia between lateral blood

400
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,139
primordia

401
00:14:44,578 --> 00:14:48,539
it's everywhere

402
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:51,240
so it looks like legal genes are

403
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:53,759
boundary genes

404
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,579
here's another example uh this is a a

405
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:59,578
gene called Bop 4. this is clearly

406
00:14:56,578 --> 00:15:02,039
analogous to probably the ortholog

407
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:04,559
keep doing that of a gene from barley

408
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:06,360
which is a Unicom or a branching mutant

409
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,518
they fail to make tillers or branches

410
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,100
they're also legulus

411
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:12,839
it's expressed highly in the liguel

412
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,759
shown here but it's also expressed in

413
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:16,560
these lateral buds these will give rise

414
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:19,919
to ears and Maize

415
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:23,458
give rise to tillers and barley

416
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:25,679
so it's a branch primordia Gene

417
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:28,319
we also found two bell-like home mailbox

418
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:30,778
genes which caught our eye Bell homilbox

419
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,940
genes interact with class one nox genes

420
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:35,519
but know that knotted one look at this

421
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,899
three is there enough to make a ligul

422
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,578
develop

423
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:40,500
and the appear to have to interact with

424
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:43,019
these bell-like genes

425
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:47,339
so we our eye was caught by

426
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:49,500
these two genes Bell 12 and Bell 14. and

427
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,600
again they're expressed nicely in the

428
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,220
ligules in this Notch here and also in

429
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,800
the developing legal itself but also in

430
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,300
the boundaries around the ligul not

431
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:59,278
maybe the Oracle that's what that

432
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:00,838
marking but also lots of other organ

433
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,419
boundaries

434
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,279
legals and organ boundaries is a theme

435
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:08,099
here's another one just to drive this

436
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:10,559
home Bell 14. it's expressed in a much

437
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,940
wider region it's in the legal Notch but

438
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,039
it's also in the region around the

439
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,920
legion not localized to the ligular Orca

440
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:18,719
region at all especially early on

441
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:22,639
but it's also expressed that multiple

442
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,639
lateral organs and their boundaries

443
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:26,219
so what are they interacting with an

444
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:27,719
elliptical we know knotted one is not

445
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,860
expressed in the legal region but look

446
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,540
at this three is

447
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,800
so we're doing experiments now to see

448
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:33,599
whether or not these bells can

449
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:36,000
physically interact and direct gene

450
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,680
expression by binding with ligamist 3

451
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,240
protein

452
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,219
it's expressed higher up in the legal

453
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,778
Robin showed this as you see again was

454
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,220
the first person to get a ligamist 3 and

455
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:46,078
situ to work

456
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,519
and it's upregulated and added mutant

457
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,338
leaves so this is a good candidate for

458
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:53,120
interacting with bells way above the uh

459
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:53,120
the boundary

460
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:57,059
it was a big surprise to me Robin showed

461
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,980
me the status that there's a wax

462
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:00,958
transcription Factor that's the most

463
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,399
difference Express transcription factor

464
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,838
in the ligue

465
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,298
and it's caught my eye because I've been

466
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,939
working on a pair of wax jeans for the

467
00:17:06,298 --> 00:17:10,379
last 20 years

468
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:12,419
sheet too I asked who is this narrow

469
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,040
sheath and actually it is and I was

470
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:15,900
totally surprised because we described

471
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:18,959
this as a gene which functions in the

472
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,699
shoot meristem to specify a leaf domain

473
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,140
so this is a narrow sheath one narrow

474
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:24,600
sheet to a mutant

475
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:27,480
which is missing a big chunk of leaf

476
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:29,279
and this is made early in the maristat

477
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,960
there's a lot of legal missing if you

478
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,099
look at the close-up of this uh blade

479
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,360
sheath found there's a lot of legal

480
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:35,399
missing compared to Wild Side but we

481
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,979
figured okay if you don't make Leaf

482
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,240
early you can't make a legal on that

483
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,860
leaf later

484
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,259
so I never expected this thing would be

485
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:45,058
expressed in the legal

486
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:46,859
we described it as being expressed in

487
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:48,720
this in the marathon this is a cross

488
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:50,879
section of the pseudopical meristem this

489
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,980
is where narrative is expressed to

490
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,860
direct those lateral domains

491
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:59,038
so we find Leaf initiation genes which

492
00:17:55,859 --> 00:18:01,379
are redeployed re-initiated at the uh at

493
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,839
the primordium to make a legal

494
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,640
here's another example a gene called

495
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,099
fabulos of one first described in

496
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,740
robidopsis as being involved in Dorsey

497
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:12,538
ventral patterning at axial or top layer

498
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,179
patterning of leaves

499
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:16,679
if expressed in a studio epical meristem

500
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:18,298
is expressed in leave primordial

501
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,700
throughout the vasculature

502
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:23,160
in the protozo's island in the xylem

503
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,860
which is at axial but it's also highly

504
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,840
expressed in the legal so another Leaf

505
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:29,639
initiation Gene which is redeployed at

506
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:31,980
the legal

507
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,679
so the overall theme Here is that legal

508
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,839
genes are organ initiation and Boundary

509
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:38,880
genes Branch genes and leap genes which

510
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:41,159
are redeployed later

511
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,620
and we didn't expect this uh we probably

512
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,140
it makes perfect sense now

513
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:48,178
but uh we didn't expect this uh it makes

514
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,679
sense because we know that evolution is

515
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:51,660
pretty conservative

516
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,798
it's not really good at making brand new

517
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,960
structures

518
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:58,079
it usually takes and borrows mechanisms

519
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,759
and processes from other other events

520
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:01,759
and modifies them slightly

521
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,779
so here's basically the model it's the

522
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,759
crazy model we actually form this model

523
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:10,500
by drawing all over Sarah Hicks walls in

524
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:11,279
her living room uh during a meeting we

525
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,839
had

526
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:15,538
this is the final version it's

527
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:17,399
complicated but basically okay legal

528
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:19,038
initiation reiterates lateral

529
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,380
organizations but it's not completely

530
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:25,140
reiterated if you look for existence for

531
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,520
example at the uh localization of pen

532
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:29,100
protein

533
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:30,779
it connects to the vasculature

534
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:33,538
in Elite primordium it doesn't connect

535
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:35,399
to the basket mature analygo these

536
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:38,220
legals in Maize anyway are not

537
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,960
vascularized

538
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,660
so the idea is that there's a center

539
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,120
action between nox proteins

540
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,700
and oxen oxen is repressed by Knox

541
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:52,678
proteins these boundary genes like Cox

542
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:54,779
are repressed by a pin bioxin

543
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,720
and so not as localized to the base of

544
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:58,918
the leaf we get these Stripes of if you

545
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,538
look at it in this in this transfer

546
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,460
section G's to see here's pin

547
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:04,379
localization auxin which is removing the

548
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,538
nox

549
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,220
and it's also removing the cuts

550
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,960
and they form this boundary where this

551
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,700
pin is formed and this is where the Lego

552
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,519
will initiate

553
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,798
and we think that these bowels interact

554
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:19,079
with some nox proteins in this region

555
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,339
here which will form the Oracle and the

556
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:22,740
ligul

557
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:24,538
so that's the model uh we hope we can

558
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,579
get refunded and we can test some of

559
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:29,339
these uh predictions and test this model

560
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:32,659
we're sure it's not exactly right and

561
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:32,659
thanks I'll take some questions

562
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:45,298
this has been a production of Cornell

563
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:45,298
