1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,919
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,778
University so as always we have our

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:09,210
guest on today so today Brad Park from

4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:10,740
Rutgers University really happy to have

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,389
Brad on we're going to talk about some

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,570
tall fescue so maybe some traffic

7
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:16,710
tolerance of tall fescues I know those

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,050
are going in a little bit more and

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,000
sports fields up here so chat about that

10
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,699
but as always Frank will start us off

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,559
with a little preview well here we go

12
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,010
for those of us jonesing for baseball

13
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:31,559
can you hear me Carl yeah okay good

14
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,539
alright good for those of us jonesing

15
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,399
for baseball this might be what its

16
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:36,509
gonna look like when it comes back to

17
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,840
the United States

18
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:42,509
this is South Korean players now it

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,239
seems surreal to see such a thing so

20
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:47,189
just you know we're wrapping up about

21
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:50,669
ten weeks of doing this with you guys

22
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:52,349
now now that everybody's busy we're

23
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,120
gonna take a hiatus and let everybody

24
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,198
get busy to their work we hope that

25
00:00:54,119 --> 00:01:01,979
these shows have been useful distracting

26
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:04,618
enjoyable fun educational all the things

27
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:06,780
that we've been trying to do and getting

28
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:09,000
us through the first part of this long

29
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,618
haul on this pandemic and and we're

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,719
really grateful for our colleagues like

31
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:15,478
Brad Park that have taken the time out

32
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:19,259
to join us for the fastest 30 minutes in

33
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:21,539
turf as we've started to count let's do

34
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,640
a little quick weather review we're

35
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,618
still behind and you know we heard again

36
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,000
on Thursday mornings we have the benefit

37
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:29,909
of hearing from our climate center

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,129
expert our key guy tano on our weekly

39
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,079
call very very early in the morning I've

40
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:36,750
been chatting to rich with rich Buckley

41
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,368
for 20 years now Brad on this call I

42
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,759
think you've been on it with us a few

43
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:44,280
times we're still well behind in fact we

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,530
were much warmer up north here than you

45
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,930
were down there to the south we're

46
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,540
starting to see ideal conditions from a

47
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,060
heat perspective to do weed control if

48
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,009
you're able to do weed control and again

49
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,769
I've said to school grounds people

50
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:01,438
without the students around this might

51
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:04,408
be a good time to ask for an emergency

52
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:06,868
exemption to make some broadleaf weed

53
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,179
control you know if you have a pesticide

54
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:12,479
license or if there's funds available to

55
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,729
do this this is one important part point

56
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,848
we've

57
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:18,158
a number of weeks ago that weedy fields

58
00:02:15,848 --> 00:02:20,560
are not safe fields right the footing

59
00:02:18,158 --> 00:02:24,098
that you get from these different plants

60
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,590
out there requires a safety intervention

61
00:02:24,098 --> 00:02:29,798
and with out any or minimal exposure

62
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,659
there's opportunities now to maximize

63
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:34,510
that I'm not sure I'd recommend spring

64
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:36,549
as the best time fall is typically going

65
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:38,649
to be a better time but but if you're

66
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:40,870
doing it in the spring models and things

67
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:44,110
like this can be very useful it's

68
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,400
unusually dry now for much of us I think

69
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,860
we're starting to see some drought

70
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,120
stress we heard from Dave Chinnery this

71
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,120
morning on the left here

72
00:02:53,550 --> 00:03:02,430
Oh Frank we lost your audio here mr.

73
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:08,460
priciple

74
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:11,099
how's that I can hear you now little

75
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:17,159
choppy but we'll see her all right how

76
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:19,409
we doing now good we're good okay it's

77
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,150
dry looks like it's gonna be dry we're

78
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:22,799
coming into some of the driest time in

79
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:27,210
the year you grown grass on sands gonna

80
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,580
be worse the heats building and we're

81
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:33,090
starting to see some heat stress

82
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:35,070
certainly in Central Jersey South North

83
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:39,390
Jersey and stop 215 interesting and a

84
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:43,530
little bit cooler by the water soils are

85
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:46,379
starting to warm up er fees low 16 upper

86
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,680
60 you can see everything's plugging

87
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:49,229
along

88
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,670
still not consistent warm right still

89
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,310
not consistent warm

90
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:57,629
alright topic for today hope my internet

91
00:03:53,310 --> 00:04:00,420
holds out Brad is really the importance

92
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:03,629
of the right species and variety

93
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:05,789
selection for sports fields and

94
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:08,159
particularly with regard to traffic

95
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:09,750
tolerance now I've been very hot on

96
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,490
these hybrid things

97
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,550
Greg munch Shaw has been playing around

98
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:16,230
with this and they're finding that not

99
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,569
unlike what you've been finding in the

100
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,939
cool season grass arena that the

101
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:21,629
varieties that you use in these cases

102
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:25,949
matter

103
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:27,480
obviously the muta varieties are a

104
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:30,750
little bit limited Chris you're going

105
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:33,870
with maybe more cold tolerant ones but

106
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:36,420
in this case the bluegrass variety seems

107
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,939
to have a big impact on the performance

108
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,920
of this now Doug sold that just tweeted

109
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:42,719
this out last week that's had some

110
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,850
long-term stuff going on at the

111
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,510
University of Wisconsin looking at

112
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:51,060
different varieties and seeing that uh

113
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:53,219
uh you know variety makes a difference

114
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,110
at weeding instant color and on the

115
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,960
right here you have the Kingfisher

116
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:00,180
variety um let me see if I get this the

117
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:04,199
Kingfisher variety this is zero

118
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:07,079
fertilizer to fertile at two pounds and

119
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:09,658
four pounds and you can see the

120
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:12,209
impact that it has on we deenis in this

121
00:05:09,658 --> 00:05:15,329
particular case and I know you've been

122
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:18,538
doing this work but traffic simulators I

123
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:21,089
think this is the ke it's not this super

124
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:23,009
well as we go through some of this work

125
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:26,728
I want to make sure you clarify it for

126
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:29,069
me what your use and so here's some old

127
00:05:26,728 --> 00:05:30,959
work you did looking at Kentucky

128
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:32,939
bluegrass Azure some recent work done

129
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,739
with Kentucky bluegrass varieties and

130
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:37,289
one of the things I thought you

131
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:41,668
concluded here was really interesting

132
00:05:37,288 --> 00:05:45,810
that seasons of traffic seemed to matter

133
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:47,848
so you also did uh you know and you

134
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,740
looked at different varieties here but

135
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:53,639
let's stop here for a second Brad and

136
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:56,460
and bring you into the conversation let

137
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:59,090
me go back so you can see my screen I

138
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:04,918
want to talk about this bluegrass study

139
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:08,399
first if you don't mind right so so talk

140
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:11,908
a little bit about this work and and

141
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:15,239
this bluegrass day to here let's start

142
00:06:11,908 --> 00:06:17,759
with the different types of bluegrass is

143
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,579
that people can pick many might not be

144
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,439
familiar with the Rutgers way of

145
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:26,490
characterizing blue grasses that you

146
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:28,860
guys pioneered you know years ago let's

147
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:31,139
start with the different types of blue

148
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:35,689
grasses and then we'll get to the

149
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:39,569
seasonality of their traffic tolerance

150
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:42,088
so as far as the as far as the types I

151
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:44,870
think just a little bit of a review for

152
00:06:42,088 --> 00:06:46,199
for everyone participating what

153
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:50,158
bluegrass

154
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:52,740
types involved is a characterization of

155
00:06:50,158 --> 00:06:55,588
individual varieties or individual

156
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,838
experimental selections based on

157
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:59,278
previously was based on their kind of

158
00:06:57,838 --> 00:07:03,990
their growth or performance

159
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:07,319
characteristics their appearance dr.

160
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:09,180
Josh Hoenig dr. bill Mayer have kind of

161
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,338
taken it to an additional level where

162
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,408
now they've they've introduced DNA

163
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:15,240
fingerprinting and genotyping into this

164
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:17,009
where they can look at individual

165
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,658
bluegrass

166
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:19,680
you know varieties experimental

167
00:07:18,658 --> 00:07:22,259
selections and now

168
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,139
group them move them genetically but

169
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:28,439
it's and what is the what is the

170
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:30,810
significance of these of these

171
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,519
differences Brad let's start with their

172
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,530
differences relative to traffic

173
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,750
tolerance well I think what I think were

174
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:38,849
so important is from a from a blending

175
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:42,029
perspective where if you're going to put

176
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:47,009
you know two or more blue grasses

177
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:49,019
together to kind of improve the you know

178
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:51,629
the genetic diversity so to speak within

179
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:53,448
the blind it's important not only look

180
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:57,750
at individual varieties but also try to

181
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:59,550
select varieties across types so for

182
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,360
example the compact midnite types the

183
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:06,449
midnight types are a group of of

184
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:09,389
bluegrass Kentucky bluegrass so they're

185
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:10,919
actually very similar as far as the way

186
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:13,560
their growth or performance

187
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:16,079
characteristics very very slow to green

188
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,728
up in a spring they actually do have

189
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,288
very good summer performance they

190
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:21,439
maintain their winter color long into

191
00:08:19,288 --> 00:08:24,029
the fall they have very dark green color

192
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,519
pretty good summer patch tolerance but

193
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:30,329
they are generally very very slow to

194
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:30,990
green up so not good for lacrosse in the

195
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:33,389
spring

196
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,969
I think petite well I think if it's a

197
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:38,580
very very early you know early season

198
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:42,270
lacrosse which is a is a difficult sport

199
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,740
to deal with it's just just just in

200
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:46,049
general but I think I just think the

201
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,089
expectation on the part of the part of

202
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:49,229
the turf manager has to be okay these

203
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:50,339
things are gonna grow you know these

204
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,100
things are gonna green up very very

205
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:56,400
slowly once they get going though um

206
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,680
they you know they they have good yeah

207
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,970
they're pretty pretty we're and traffic

208
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:06,359
tolerant and so one of the things that's

209
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:09,209
interesting to me is is what I think

210
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,750
Doug is getting at in some ways is that

211
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:17,399
newer varieties seem to be dependent on

212
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:22,070
being fertilized routinely more recently

213
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:24,839
developed improved low cut blue grasses

214
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,820
generally require more intense

215
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,900
maintenance and I'm willing to do that

216
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:33,580
Brad if I get more traffic tolerance is

217
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:36,879
there something there between the

218
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:39,550
common types like Ken blue or some older

219
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,379
ones that might actually be better for

220
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:43,899
where tolerance rather than some of

221
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:45,879
these new ones that will be better with

222
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:48,699
fertilizer but the old ones will be

223
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:52,870
better with minimal inputs do you see

224
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:54,129
what I'm getting at I I do I do I think

225
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,299
I think the one thing you've got to be a

226
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:58,269
little bit careful with some of the

227
00:09:55,299 --> 00:10:00,879
older blue grasses is is susceptibility

228
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:02,169
to leaf spot particularly in the spring

229
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,330
and it's you know different than the

230
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:07,449
gray leaf spot that affects rye grasses

231
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:10,150
and you know an out tall fescue but that

232
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:12,280
that is a you know that is a challenge

233
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:14,590
with the can blues and some of the some

234
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:16,779
of the kind of the common types that the

235
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:21,040
susceptibility to the leaf spot caused

236
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:23,409
by Josh Lara by Polaris you know that's

237
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:29,669
that's that's a challenge with those but

238
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:33,250
I mean I I I think that you know they

239
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:36,129
they do persist yes you know they they

240
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:38,080
they do persist right they do persist in

241
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:41,049
fact the less you do the more they

242
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,580
persist right I I think one of the other

243
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:45,909
thing that just to add with bluegrass I

244
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:48,790
think the I think the establishment year

245
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:51,059
is is pretty critical and particularly

246
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:52,990
from a fertilization standpoint where

247
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:55,539
you know you got you really want to get

248
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,789
these things in the ground seeded you

249
00:10:55,539 --> 00:11:01,449
know latter part of August through the

250
00:10:57,789 --> 00:11:06,009
month of September and then you know be

251
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:08,470
maybe de vigilant use that term with

252
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:11,639
fertilization to just make sure that you

253
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:14,649
know you feel it and to get that canopy

254
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:19,360
canopy to fill in and I think as

255
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:22,899
bluegrass ages I I do think the you know

256
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,389
the the the N need does does does

257
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:27,939
subside but you know that first that

258
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:30,460
fall and then that subsequent spring I

259
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:35,110
think it's pretty important you know

260
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:37,030
what to to solo debug yet let me bug you

261
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,350
now to move on to the tall fescues and

262
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,889
then we're gonna bring them together in

263
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,990
the end

264
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:43,509
mixture right so you've also done

265
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:45,700
similar traffic work with the turf type

266
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:47,419
tall fescues and you know I review I

267
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,040
spend a couple of hours

268
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:51,169
you and some of your work before we get

269
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:52,789
together and this is the quote at the

270
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:55,370
very end of the paper that actually

271
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:58,429
struck me that sometimes the things we

272
00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:01,340
select grasses for like dark blue green

273
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:04,009
and fine texture don't necessarily

274
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:06,080
translate to the functional performance

275
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:08,720
that we always want now this is work

276
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:14,420
from I think one of the international

277
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:16,430
proceedings from 2009 or 2009 anyway the

278
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:18,949
long and the short of it is have we

279
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:21,620
selected for a really good looking blue

280
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:23,840
grass tall fescue types and have we

281
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,340
sacrifice some traffic tolerance because

282
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:32,060
of it

283
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:35,240
I I think that the let me let me say

284
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:37,459
this about the the the the newest the

285
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:41,779
newest tall fescue trial that the 2018

286
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:46,790
test we initiated traffic last fall on

287
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:49,039
it and I actually just yesterday just

288
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:50,949
ran kind of a real basic correlation

289
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:54,980
between the quality ratings that I took

290
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:56,509
which when I rate for quality I I don't

291
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,279
put a real strong bias towards collar

292
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:02,299
for me it's more of a uniformity issue

293
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:04,759
it's it's a density issue and those

294
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:07,969
quality and traffic tolerance ratings

295
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:10,750
were were just as far as a linear

296
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:15,620
relationship they were linearly related

297
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:17,600
so you know the the quality relationship

298
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,460
again I think where the evaluator is

299
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,850
putting a premium on on things like

300
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:25,790
density and uniformity and then traffic

301
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:28,610
tolerance I I bet that relationship you

302
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:30,949
know is still there so you can touched

303
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:33,190
on so you've touched on the things that

304
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:35,600
are important for traffic tolerance and

305
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:39,230
somewhat aesthetic tolerance if you've

306
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,389
got a dense uniform turf independent of

307
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:44,840
the color it may be off-putting from a

308
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:46,399
greenness perspective but but ultimately

309
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,160
it's it's going to be more traffic

310
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,289
tolerant and in many ways our focus on

311
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:53,839
traffic tolerance keeps us safe right

312
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:56,089
there's some measure that that's a safer

313
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,759
field if it's dense in uniform right

314
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:00,610
Brad I I would agree I would agree I

315
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:03,200
think I think the you know just the

316
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:05,210
uniformity issue in and of itself where

317
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,780
you you know you're you're establishing

318
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:11,480
traffic tolerant you know varieties

319
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:13,069
cultivars right on species doing a good

320
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,879
job a species selection and you've got

321
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:17,900
it you know a uniform surface versus a

322
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:21,049
surface that's lack you know just

323
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:22,909
doesn't have the uniformity and I guess

324
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:24,799
you know let me follow up because you

325
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:26,809
really got yourself going there for a

326
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:29,419
minute on the establishment thing and I

327
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:31,489
think it's a key to some of the

328
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:34,189
challenges we have with both blue grass

329
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:36,860
and tall fescue and I have to say it

330
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:38,990
wasn't until you could get good tall

331
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,149
fescue bluegrass sod

332
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:42,740
that you started to see more tall fescue

333
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:44,360
into the landscape because it's not

334
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,070
something that we would recommend you

335
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,500
just put out there like you put out rye

336
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:51,200
grass because of the potential for non

337
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,269
uniformity in leaf texture right if

338
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,430
you're over seating a rye grass field

339
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:58,579
with tall fescue and it gets clumpy

340
00:14:55,429 --> 00:15:01,009
that's going to be off-putting so the

341
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:03,830
ability to put these things together and

342
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:05,450
then sell it as sod is also something

343
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,670
that you've been looking at and again

344
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:10,160
we'll put links to a lot of this work

345
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:11,659
that people can follow up and and review

346
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,240
this yourself but you know your work

347
00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:16,939
here with Murph on these combinations

348
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,930
it's very interesting because you know

349
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:24,020
Brown Pat severity is a weak link for

350
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:26,359
tall fescue and of course you you put

351
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:30,409
the more Kentucky bluegrass you put in

352
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:32,990
there it seemed to reduce the amount of

353
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:35,299
brown patch you've got but and I wonder

354
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:39,139
if you could explain this how did the

355
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:43,129
bluegrass variety impact the amount of

356
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:46,939
brown patch maybe a tall fescue variety

357
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:49,549
that was weakened it got was it the up

358
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,399
was it the percentage of bluegrass or

359
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:54,379
was there something about that cultivar

360
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,820
that kept a brown patch from getting

361
00:15:54,379 --> 00:16:00,259
severe well I think it's what's really

362
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:03,680
important to recognize about this study

363
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:05,899
is that the the bluegrass cultivar

364
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,359
selection was really what governed

365
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:10,639
that's right the the performance of

366
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,800
these mixtures from a standpoint of

367
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:17,328
everything from brown pass severity to

368
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:19,479
speak composition and the two really

369
00:16:17,328 --> 00:16:23,000
strong bluegrass is that we that we

370
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:26,659
investigated were blue note and midnight

371
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,839
too and those are those are very high

372
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:32,809
quality high-performing compact

373
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:36,320
Midnight's well blue note blue note is a

374
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:37,669
compact America type so it's it's

375
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,339
actually got a little bit a little bit

376
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:42,429
lighter color a little bit earlier green

377
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:46,160
up it's it's very quality variety

378
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:49,189
midnight to a little slower green up but

379
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:51,500
you know once it once it gets going you

380
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:52,790
know III think it's about as good as

381
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,220
as good as anything but we don't

382
00:16:52,789 --> 00:16:57,679
associate brown patch typically with

383
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:00,889
Kentucky bluegrass do those also

384
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:02,509
separate out for brown patch ability

385
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:04,818
well I think what happened in that study

386
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:07,250
is that the you know the inclusion of

387
00:17:04,818 --> 00:17:10,068
those cultivars you know they really

388
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:15,588
tended to dominate the tall fescues so

389
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:18,170
that that brown patch that we employed a

390
00:17:15,588 --> 00:17:20,149
fairly complex statistical analysis in

391
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:22,039
the study but the the basically the

392
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:25,670
inclusion of those cultivars in the

393
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:27,828
mixes and as those bluegrass those

394
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:30,470
aggressive blue grasses dominated the

395
00:17:27,828 --> 00:17:31,879
mixtures with tall fescue I think what

396
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,950
you were seeing from a brown patch

397
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,890
perspective was just the bluegrass

398
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:39,080
becoming any more predominant component

399
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:41,780
in the mixtures so is that what happens

400
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:45,649
to these sods if you put them in the

401
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:48,529
ground as you know the best ones are

402
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:52,070
planted what 90 10 in the field 90 tall

403
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:56,089
fescue 10 bluegrass they make it to the

404
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:59,149
field probably 50/50 in some cases maybe

405
00:17:56,089 --> 00:18:02,569
more bluegrass than tall fescue you put

406
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:05,120
the sod down does it then just become a

407
00:18:02,569 --> 00:18:08,299
bluegrass or does it also sometimes

408
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:11,839
become a tall fescue stand what our

409
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:15,109
research suggests is that that

410
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:18,740
transition over to bluegrass is going to

411
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:20,419
be a function of the bluegrass cultivar

412
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,190
selection now this guy kind of goes

413
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:24,410
against what we traditionally recommend

414
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,730
is you know agronomist and extension

415
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:30,019
people and always choose the best

416
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:33,170
variety the catch-22 so to speak of all

417
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:37,609
this is that some of these better blue

418
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:40,160
grasses while we want to use those when

419
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:43,459
they're mixed with tall fescue that

420
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,279
could facilitate that transition over to

421
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:48,680
a predominant bluegrass bluegrass

422
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:49,789
mixture so you know the question kind of

423
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,380
gets back to you know you were bringing

424
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:54,740
up some of these common types and so

425
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:57,710
forth you know do you if the goal is to

426
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:01,429
have as much tall fescue in that mixture

427
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:04,309
is the desire that that to be a long

428
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:05,210
time long term component of the mix do

429
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:08,690
you really

430
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:10,850
need a high-end Kentucky bluegrass

431
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:14,028
cultivar in that mixture you just want

432
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:16,459
something that is not going to perform

433
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:18,230
the role as being raised honest so

434
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:21,380
though that that song can be lifted and

435
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:24,019
then provides some insurance against

436
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:26,028
brown patch which we know tall fescue

437
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:29,359
has got you know there's a big challenge

438
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:32,630
there so so in some ways that bloom Yuda

439
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:36,949
idea is the same way that it feels like

440
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:39,830
these things are helping each other it

441
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:42,710
would through the season I guess what

442
00:19:39,829 --> 00:19:44,898
I'm wondering is are we having issues

443
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,419
with sod growers using the weaker

444
00:19:44,898 --> 00:19:49,609
bluegrass varieties because they

445
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:54,000
typically don't want to buy those

446
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:58,500
varieties for their bluegrass sod

447
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:03,058
I I think it's I think it's kind of all

448
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:04,888
over the map I mean on I there's there's

449
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:07,259
a facility that I'm familiar with that

450
00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:10,288
that established a bluegrass they

451
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:13,500
purchased a sod bluegrass tall fescue

452
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:17,250
mixture the blue grasses were not

453
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:19,798
top-shelf blue grasses and there's still

454
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:22,859
a lot of tall fescue in the you know in

455
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:25,619
in the mix and you know from if the

456
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:28,829
objective of kind of having a tall

457
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:30,628
fescue turf and having it significant

458
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:34,288
pote of the turf bean tall fescue going

459
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:36,658
forward you know that makes that the

460
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:39,179
grower established you know it's

461
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:41,370
achieving that she's also how much is

462
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:43,559
gonna be related to what happens when

463
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:45,658
you put sod down Brad you know you lay

464
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:46,378
side down certainly you know comes

465
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:48,570
juiced

466
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:50,609
probably from the sod producers field

467
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:52,558
and then in a sports field you know they

468
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:53,668
always be let me get it going so he

469
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:56,099
given it some more in

470
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:58,769
and then I'm wondering how much that

471
00:20:56,099 --> 00:21:01,109
always tends to favor the bluegrass over

472
00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:04,319
the tall fescue what we've done on our

473
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:06,089
campuses we've strived to put more tall

474
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,009
fescue in we haven't paid as much

475
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:10,408
attention to the varieties they think

476
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:11,940
like you've said side growers we don't

477
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:13,590
always get the choices that we want

478
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,320
right that's one of the limitations

479
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:18,888
aside but we put it in and we don't

480
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:21,538
really do anything but mow it and

481
00:21:18,888 --> 00:21:23,128
oversee tit and Arif I it once a year

482
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:25,259
over seed it just to get more tall

483
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:27,178
fescue in there and boy those have

484
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:29,970
become beautiful stance you can't barely

485
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:32,100
find the bluegrass in them they become

486
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:35,190
dominant tall fescue so how much does

487
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:36,619
the management then determine how much

488
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:39,528
tall fescue you're going to have

489
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:43,229
thinking that more firt means more

490
00:21:39,528 --> 00:21:45,028
bluegrass is that logical I think it is

491
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:48,360
I think you know I think anything a

492
00:21:45,028 --> 00:21:50,398
higher cutting heights and you know less

493
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:55,888
nitrogen you know lower kind of annual

494
00:21:50,398 --> 00:21:57,750
nitrogen quantities lower you know just

495
00:21:55,888 --> 00:21:59,908
less frequent irrigation and I mean

496
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,980
anything that's going to you know kind

497
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:06,000
of it's going to provide the tall fescue

498
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:07,480
an advantage you know it's got a it's

499
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,069
got it's got to help

500
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:14,079
you know I think having the control over

501
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:15,579
kind of what you're doing if you have

502
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:17,199
the opportunity to establish for a

503
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:19,149
feeling for the first time and you can

504
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,980
you know you can really drill down on

505
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:23,920
that seating rate maybe even want to go

506
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:26,110
to lay nearly a a ninety-five five

507
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,930
ninety five percent tall fescue five

508
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:34,119
percent Kentucky bluegrass

509
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:36,400
bye-bye-bye wait you know that you know

510
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:38,649
I think is another you like that you

511
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,360
like that strategy i I think it's I

512
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:42,370
think it's worth giving it a shot you

513
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,049
see do you see that kind of do you see

514
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:46,239
those things available that's one of my

515
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:48,369
questions on my list I mean you and I

516
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,640
can talk out the kazoo about this

517
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:53,709
variety that variety and the varietal

518
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,600
differences within a species can be as

519
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:58,299
big as the differences between the

520
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:00,879
species right uh you know tall fescue

521
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:02,859
varieties within a tall fescue can be as

522
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,250
different as tall fescue and Kentucky

523
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:08,649
bluegrass species so I don't do you find

524
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:10,900
a lot of ninety-five fives on the

525
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:12,820
marketplace it may find seed companies

526
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,890
willing to work with us on this I I

527
00:23:12,819 --> 00:23:20,349
don't I don't see a lot of it doesn't

528
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:22,870
mean it doesn't exist but I don't how do

529
00:23:20,349 --> 00:23:25,869
you decide how does somebody decide is

530
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:27,789
it season is it maintenance how would I

531
00:23:25,869 --> 00:23:29,799
decide if I'm starting out whether I

532
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:32,920
should have a bluegrass or tall fescue

533
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:34,450
field or go with that blend I'm gonna

534
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,600
put you on the spot of how you get about

535
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:41,039
deciding what to go with if this whole

536
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:43,779
thing allows you to do some renovation I

537
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,460
think first of all having a having a

538
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:47,379
discussion about what the anticipated

539
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:50,680
management inputs are going to be going

540
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:54,070
going forward so you know I think if you

541
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:57,549
know if the objective is lower you know

542
00:23:54,069 --> 00:23:59,169
fewer nitrogen inputs less irrigation

543
00:23:57,549 --> 00:24:01,599
going forward a higher cutting height

544
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:03,940
you know I think

545
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,829
you know I think a tall fescue bluegrass

546
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,690
mixture and I think having the bluegrass

547
00:24:05,829 --> 00:24:09,849
in there it does provide a little bit of

548
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:11,558
a little bit of an insurance policy

549
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:13,449
particularly on the particularly on the

550
00:24:11,558 --> 00:24:15,700
brown patch issue here and here in

551
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:18,390
central New Jersey because that that's

552
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:21,210
that's a legitimate legitimate concern

553
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:24,100
you know but it's let's say a school

554
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:25,480
municipality new construction project

555
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:27,699
they wanted to go for seat you know you

556
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,019
wanted to start something from seed and

557
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,120
even with automatic water but if they

558
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:33,490
were trying to be you know minimalist

559
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:35,829
with it yeah I would I would probably

560
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:38,169
push them in towards uh you know Prague

561
00:24:35,829 --> 00:24:40,230
towards it towards a 90/10 alright hey

562
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:43,509
Carl questions for Brad

563
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:45,569
yeah a couple comments Ben was just

564
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:47,798
mentioning he said great Ben polymer

565
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:49,869
Massachusetts have you've had great

566
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:52,839
success with mixtures of no more than

567
00:24:49,869 --> 00:24:55,149
60% turf type tall fescue and then again

568
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:57,819
he was echoing the need for high-end and

569
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:59,950
establishment so really important for

570
00:24:57,819 --> 00:25:02,500
him that establishment phase great joy

571
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:04,000
this is challenging you guys even

572
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,099
YouTube heavy hitters can't convince me

573
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,769
tall fescue on athletic fields he's used

574
00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:10,359
it he doesn't like it nothing like KBG I

575
00:25:08,769 --> 00:25:11,829
guess some you know the question I want

576
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:13,629
to ask is that you know sometimes we

577
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:17,529
talk about clumpiness of tall fescues

578
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:19,390
and when we achieve draw on a couple

579
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:21,730
weeks ago talking about player safety he

580
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:24,220
was talking about how uneven this and

581
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:26,558
the surface can provide safety concerns

582
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:28,360
when an athlete expects maybe their foot

583
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:30,279
to plant in one way and if the earth is

584
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:31,569
clumpy and it goes a little bit their

585
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:34,450
foot travels a little further down that

586
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:35,889
could present a safety concern anything

587
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,600
from you Brad and the concerns with the

588
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:40,890
clumpiness and the tall fescue and maybe

589
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:44,230
not being something of a safety concern

590
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:48,100
well I think I think part of the part of

591
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:51,759
the issue with clumpiness we could

592
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:54,158
probably spend a whole call on this you

593
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,140
know I think it does get back to

594
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,330
establishment where if you if you don't

595
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,799
do a good job establishing tall fescue

596
00:25:58,329 --> 00:26:01,418
for the first time and you get

597
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:03,099
everything from seed washing to

598
00:26:01,419 --> 00:26:05,200
insignificant you know in insufficient

599
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:08,259
seeding rates and you just don't have a

600
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,610
critical number of plants out there that

601
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:10,089
right off the bat is gonna leave a

602
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,589
clumpiness

603
00:26:10,089 --> 00:26:13,058
I mean with this this actually this is

604
00:26:11,589 --> 00:26:16,418
background that the Franks

605
00:26:13,058 --> 00:26:18,128
using over there kind of on the far side

606
00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:20,860
beyond where we covered we had some

607
00:26:18,128 --> 00:26:22,898
washing and we you know it's not part of

608
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:24,609
the test it's part of a bore area but

609
00:26:22,898 --> 00:26:28,089
that still hasn't filled in and that's

610
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:30,788
going on back in 2018 so you know tall

611
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:32,470
fescue yes there's some rhizomatous you

612
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:34,119
know attributes but it's but it's

613
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:37,058
basically functionally I think it's a

614
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:38,739
bunch type grass it's not like Kentucky

615
00:26:37,058 --> 00:26:42,398
bluegrass the way Kentucky bluegrass is

616
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:48,159
: so III I think some of the clumpiness

617
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:49,898
can be overcome with against seeding

618
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,549
rates seeding timing making sure you get

619
00:26:49,898 --> 00:26:51,819
enough get enough get enough plants out

620
00:26:51,548 --> 00:26:54,398
there

621
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:56,109
I think the species as an athletic feel

622
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:59,739
look I don't think it's for everybody

623
00:26:56,109 --> 00:27:01,990
but I mean we've got a couple school

624
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:03,788
districts here in New Jersey you know

625
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,849
kind of south of the New York metro area

626
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:09,249
that are that are enormous and these

627
00:27:06,849 --> 00:27:13,748
high school middle school kind of group

628
00:27:09,249 --> 00:27:16,058
complexes no irrigation you know they've

629
00:27:13,749 --> 00:27:18,399
got limited limited you know labor and

630
00:27:16,058 --> 00:27:20,589
you know they've gotta mow it to two and

631
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:23,288
a half inches they don't even actually

632
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:26,829
have access to water reels and that's

633
00:27:23,288 --> 00:27:28,868
where you know tall fescue is is a good

634
00:27:26,829 --> 00:27:31,359
choice given you know the some of the

635
00:27:28,868 --> 00:27:32,709
the summers that we have the warmer

636
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:35,378
climate you know kind of northern

637
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:37,149
transition zone and you know that that

638
00:27:35,378 --> 00:27:38,618
to me where we're not talking about real

639
00:27:37,148 --> 00:27:40,058
high in sports here you know we're

640
00:27:38,618 --> 00:27:42,819
talking about middle school sports um

641
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:45,009
high school sports practice fields and

642
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:46,839
so forth where you know III think it

643
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:48,788
makes I think it makes himself and I

644
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:50,199
gotta say and I'm gonna make one more

645
00:27:48,788 --> 00:27:53,200
shot at it Greg

646
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,330
you know I travel and visit golf courses

647
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,119
in the mid-atlantic and they have

648
00:27:55,329 --> 00:28:01,449
embraced tall fescue fully in the rough

649
00:27:58,118 --> 00:28:02,829
you see some beautiful tall fescue in

650
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:05,169
the rough when you get into the

651
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:08,349
mid-atlantic I know Brad can attest to

652
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:10,960
it as well now on a sports field I think

653
00:28:08,349 --> 00:28:14,168
I would always agree with Brad that I'd

654
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,350
want Kentucky bluegrass as a base I just

655
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:20,080
think having a rise ominous base on a

656
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:23,168
sports field is a functional aspect of

657
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:25,028
that field that you can't replicate with

658
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:26,890
any other species that you'd want out

659
00:28:25,028 --> 00:28:28,900
there so there's no question

660
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,670
about the fact I don't want any sports

661
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:33,090
field that's going to plant a cleat in

662
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:34,570
it that doesn't have some rays ominous

663
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:37,689
bluegrass in it

664
00:28:34,569 --> 00:28:40,389
I think call fescue gives us a wider

665
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:42,370
latitude of management that I can do I

666
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,900
could you sit up and get what I want in

667
00:28:42,369 --> 00:28:47,649
the density I think I can cut it lower

668
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:49,420
and then I if if I don't and I'm a

669
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:51,250
little bit more light I think I have

670
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:54,580
some flexibility but I do think what

671
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:56,799
Brad said about warmer right blue

672
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:58,599
grasses have struggled in the heat

673
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,940
historically there's ones that are good

674
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:02,649
in the heat but they maybe are not as

675
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,840
good in the shoulders of the season

676
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:06,490
right Brad I mean I think that's the

677
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:09,549
argument where bluegrass might not

678
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:11,349
always be the answer if if the shoulders

679
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:16,599
of the season traffic might be what you

680
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:17,980
need why I think certainly in the you

681
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:20,409
know in the spring and I think the

682
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,849
shoulder seasons are just you know

683
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:26,590
they're they're just a challenge across

684
00:29:21,849 --> 00:29:30,909
the board you know and and you know it's

685
00:29:26,589 --> 00:29:33,639
it's March it's it's it's the end of

686
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:35,259
it's the end of October and you know

687
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,920
that's where that's where it to me

688
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:42,009
traffic management becomes important

689
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:44,380
trying to kick in you saw it I mean can

690
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:47,829
you find an avenue to sod at some point

691
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:50,620
you know after you know after November 1

692
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:52,389
or November 15 and work with

693
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:54,969
administrators to kind of close the

694
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:56,440
field down okay look we're done November

695
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:58,180
first we're gonna we're gonna sod

696
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,049
between the hash marks we're gonna saw

697
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:03,880
down the center and I mean we can

698
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:06,250
ryegrass oversee dry grass oversee dry

699
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,750
grass oversee but you know being able to

700
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:09,130
come in and and so that's where

701
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,549
bluegrass you know make makes a lot of

702
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:14,740
sense I mean if that's what the you know

703
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:17,379
you know sod with blue over seed with

704
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:20,109
rye but I think there are situations

705
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:22,270
again we're you know in the absence of

706
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:25,359
irrigation and you know establishing a

707
00:30:22,269 --> 00:30:28,029
field for the first time you know I

708
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:30,089
talked I mean I could work with a I'd

709
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:31,680
work with a guy that just swears by it

710
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:33,519
[Music]

711
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,019
you know doesn't want to touch a rye

712
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:37,089
grass because you know he's afraid it's

713
00:30:35,019 --> 00:30:38,619
not gonna survive the summer and you

714
00:30:37,089 --> 00:30:40,569
know they don't think they can't really

715
00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:43,059
do a lot of sodding so

716
00:30:40,569 --> 00:30:45,639
and that's why last year when the gray

717
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:48,129
leaf spot took the tall fescue out that

718
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,780
got very concerning cuz you know that's

719
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:51,400
the kind of thing that changes the game

720
00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:53,379
if all of a sudden these low maintenance

721
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,720
areas with higher cut tall fescue or

722
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,460
having problems with great leaf spot you

723
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,230
know that that was a very scary thing

724
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,180
when you know Bruce Clark a for Bruce

725
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:03,190
Clark's lawn dies because a great leaf

726
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:05,080
spot everybody gets nervous right Brad

727
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:06,670
yeah I think I think that's an emerging

728
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:09,220
concern I think it's gonna be

729
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:11,800
interesting to see how great leaf spot

730
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:14,620
and tall fescue kind of affects you know

731
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:18,700
new plantings versus you know older

732
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:21,399
established plantings you know and I

733
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:23,049
don't know I'm not at least here you

734
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,060
know New Jersey and North that were

735
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:26,919
really know enough about it at this

736
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:31,119
point but I mean which sits on the radar

737
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:33,670
for sure and one of the out of this 2018

738
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:35,709
tall fescue tester there is a new one of

739
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:38,289
the newer variety there just like on

740
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:40,569
commercial and the name actually is kind

741
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:43,920
of marketing itself as they is a gray

742
00:31:40,569 --> 00:31:48,159
leaf spot you know tolerant tolerant

743
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:51,210
yeah new a new tall fescue 12s alright

744
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:53,980
Carl more questions are we good I think

745
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:55,750
there's a lot of great comments from you

746
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,089
know band and grain and dance a chipping

747
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:00,339
in there too so I'm really happy to have

748
00:31:58,089 --> 00:32:04,869
a conversation I think that's about a

749
00:32:00,339 --> 00:32:06,399
half an hour please end it Brad thanks

750
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:08,529

chat with you I really appreciate you

752
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:12,759
being patient with my long questions and

753
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:14,740
putting you on the spot but I don't

754
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:16,900
think we think about varieties a lot and

755
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,700
some of it is to be honest this it's not

756
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,070
a lot of good seedsman left out in this

757
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:23,559
industry I just don't see the seedsman

758
00:32:21,069 --> 00:32:25,689
