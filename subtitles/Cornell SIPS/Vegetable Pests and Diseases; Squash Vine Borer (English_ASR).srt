00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,278
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,439
University hello everyone my name is

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:09,759
keny Rodriguez I am a PhD student at

4
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:11,638
Cornell University and today I'm with

5
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,759
Steve reers he's a Horticulture

6
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:16,399
specialist and today we'll talk about

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,278
some pests that can be in our Gardens so

8
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,959
Steve um we know that there are some

9
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:23,079
pests or diseases that can affect our

10
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,080
fields or our vegetable gardens and we

11
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:27,799
would like to know what is a common P

12
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,399
that we will see and what what what are

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,039
things that we can recognize to know

14
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:35,960
what it is and maybe a a control that we

15
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:37,119
can use to do that so I guess the first

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,160
one we're going to be talking about

17
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:40,679
today is squash Vine bore and that's a

18
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:42,479
huge problem for home gardeners if

19
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,280
you're growing zucchini you're probably

20
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:47,799
going to have squash Vine B and so I

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,359
show this plant right now so this is a a

22
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:51,198
plant that we had and I've just pulled

23
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,280
it up so this we just cut it right at

24
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,960
the base of the plant here and this is I

25
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,679
don't though I don't see any right here

26
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,000
this is where squash Vine bores

27
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,600
typically lay their eggs and what will

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,159
happen is the eggs will be laid usually

29
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,320
within about 2 to three inches of where

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,960
it goes into the soil the eggs will

31
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,798
hatch and as soon as they hatch they

32
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:11,879
will go inside the stem and then that's

33
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,600
the perfect place for them and what

34
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:15,839
they'll do is they'll just start feeding

35
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,798
inside the stem and then they will start

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,359
eating and and pushing their frass out

37
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:21,400
behind them and you'll always be able to

38
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,438
tell because you'll see some small holes

39
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,240
and this will just be starting to rot

40
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,679
and they'll be all this insect frass

41
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:29,560
that's coming out um eventually the

42
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,079
plant will start to wilt eventually it

43
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,159
will ey and again that can be a real

44
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,719
problem and something that more so

45
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,759
probably home gardeners have a problem

46
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:40,239
with than commercial

47
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,640
Growers and what we can do to control

48
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:46,438
that or like um is there another way

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,879
that we can use to manage this for for a

50
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:51,199
home Gardener um it's a little bit more

51
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,718
work but again since the insect it's

52
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,759
laying its eggs right here uh and it's

53
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:58,038
not typically laying its eggs further up

54
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,399
on the plant what you can do is you can

55
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:03,079
wrap that stem and people have wrapped

56
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,239
aluminum foil around it I've seen people

57
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:08,478
wrap like old panty hose around it um if

58
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,959
you have a floating row cover you could

59
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,280
take a little strip of that and wrap

60
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,719
that around it and again it only has to

61
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,318
be up to about those 3 in and that will

62
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:17,359
prevent the insect if it's as it's

63
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:18,598
flying and it's a it's a moth most

64
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,760
people don't really see it but I think

65
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:23,119
you'll show a picture of it later it's a

66
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:26,159
moth that flies during the daytime hours

67
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,959
um and will be laying its eggs here uh

68
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,840
so again if you wrap the stem that can

69
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,400
help there's also another method that's

70
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,680
approved would be to use um you could

71
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,760
use a spray it's called a Diel spray

72
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,719
which is a bacterial material um it's

73
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,679
approved for organic farming and organic

74
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:45,919
gardening and again if you could spray

75
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,760
that maybe every 5 to 7 Days uh just

76
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,359
right here at the base and again what

77
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,079
will happen is as soon as those eggs

78
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,840
hatch before they can get into the stem

79
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,640
they start eating and they'll eat this

80
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,400
bacteria and again it's naturally

81
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:00,119
derived from soil uh bacteria and that

82
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,039
will kill them so that's another thing

83
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,959
that you can do you could also cover the

84
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:07,719
entire plot with with a row cover

85
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,039
typically we won't see Vine Wars around

86
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:13,199
here until mid June or so and then they

87
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,199
will usually we only have one generation

88
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,318
so the moths the adult moths will be

89
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:21,039
active on from mid June until usually

90
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:24,359
the end of July after that they're done

91
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:26,120
um so again a late planting of zucchini

92
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,120
which only takes about 60 days if you

93
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,039
plant it about the first week of August

94
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,039
you can also get around the season of it

95
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:34,158
as well okay a really important thing

96
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:36,000
with squash Vine b as well is once

97
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,798
you're done with your zucchini plants

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,759
even if it's wilted if it has the squash

99
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:43,319
Vine pull them out of the garden compost

100
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:44,959
them if you can find the the worms

101
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:47,399
themselves the caterpillars pull those

102
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,959
out because they will overwinter in the

103
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,879
soil and then they're just going to be a

104
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,719
problem next next spring for you as well

105
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:55,199
so again you want to make sure that you

106
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,799
pull up that all those old curbit plants

107
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,479
that you have out there that'll help

108
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,280
really to to help control it for the

109
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:03,679
following year too learn about squash

110
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,438
bite but and this is a good time for us

111
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,040
to know what to do whenever we have this

112
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:08,840
problem thank you so much for your

113
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,679
advises and I know that this will be

114
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,239
very helpful for people that is

115
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,920
harvesting or it's having their squash

116
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,680
plants or their zucchini plants in their

117
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:20,599
fields or in a garden this has been a
