1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,309
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,309
University

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,089
good morning everyone

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:18,560
and the bill said if you have a long

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,278
drive program

6
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:27,649
hence they got an entire constellation

7
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:31,189
33 mass but I'm furthest to step in by

8
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:34,489
my hair to further forward

9
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:37,670
one of the first thing he did was add a

10
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:42,109
brand for any product in addition to the

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:45,170
anti-fraud are a remington tainted from

12
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:47,840
the unaccountable what do we send them

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:52,460
an application or they choose what label

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:58,880
up so very well during the program from

15
00:00:52,460 --> 00:01:03,759
the flyer with you this is what it looks

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:08,259
like a captain Denny MIMO drive big man

17
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:13,069
but the pinata pictures actually from

18
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:15,618
2014 and numbers of entries fluctuating

19
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:21,318
in our burger I think our teeth was

20
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:25,399
about 2011 we had 1,300 right and this

21
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:28,579
area have to be of you 1600 drives so

22
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:29,609
are they putting more companies to come

23
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:32,739
in

24
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:35,079
well get to control that too much I can

25
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:39,640
why didn't we detach my glasses

26
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:42,429
California but in this case was the

27
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,640
rockers he predetermined prior to our

28
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,390
arrival at that moment this is an error

29
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,329
shot

30
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:52,840
Paula sighs the color quality on it

31
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:55,298
because it was taken by a drone so what

32
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:00,490
the Pens they run weeks Graham's on

33
00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:06,850
Saturday al back the air and certainly

34
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:09,728
not freedom Andrew put a quality and but

35
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:14,289
we also run satellite play for exaple

36
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:16,569
active site and Hershey garden is the

37
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:19,299
oldest of our black explain to you

38
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:27,209
privately grant air pretty boring staff

39
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:30,340
and the master barbers ways are

40
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:32,759
instrumental in hearing sound so they're

41
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:36,219
easy running up that means 19 right

42
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:40,328
subset of our version by the way we have

43
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:43,719
about 950 right again this year

44
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:46,150
one of the little a single ring and

45
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:49,569
we'll give them all funds because plant

46
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,739
died with their deep brown gravy and

47
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:53,049
we're good at that

48
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:56,620
we have fluctuated in September

49
00:02:53,050 --> 00:03:00,219
what that wasn't I am this one year and

50
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:04,560
I thought the morality of silver blaze a

51
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:07,599
job my audience I beautiful

52
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:11,379
Russians are not hardened Siberia they

53
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:15,210
go there to Miami see very lovely the

54
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:19,680
well look at the brown we also do a

55
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:24,670
subset the biography that his everyday

56
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:27,550
men hello they polish and posted at the

57
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:31,209
Larsen Research Forum and that's a huge

58
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:34,300
property and majors but a brilliant

59
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:37,840
three days in order typically 20,000

60
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:40,450
visitors and this yet last year I was

61
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:46,030
alive when that regardeth value any

62
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:49,769
playing on our program and they have

63
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:54,280
this is the three thousand acre park

64
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:58,930
there's a fun there's a partner with red

65
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:02,770
circle is inspector there the area

66
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:04,370
movies again we're doing a grand testing

67
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,640
all three of

68
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:11,090
nice comparison to the largely container

69
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:14,568
for this planter at FEMA which stands

70
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:23,269
for Baptist agriculture researchers he

71
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:25,399
was alive last this is your nap and I

72
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:27,259
didn't print any favorite hobby but it

73
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:30,500
is our web page

74
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:35,959
all this data is up there all you have

75
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:39,769
to do the Greek word anyway click on the

76
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:42,199
topic result and you're looking for all

77
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:45,430
the hallmarks of women triggering come

78
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:48,139
up number of how many connections

79
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:51,530
grading button in the Miranda top to

80
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:53,840
bottom so is the viewer information at

81
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:57,709
little more comprehensive national

82
00:04:53,839 --> 00:05:01,549
probably which we also painted if you

83
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:03,918
click on a picture they be a scores and

84
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:07,610
comment that were rendered very nice

85
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:10,159
Austria and a number of rehab operators

86
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,530
really you're thinking man to this is

87
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,600
their hobby Pennsylvania and we have

88
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:17,689
some of the planes that broke the honors

89
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,849
and then neighbors and friends come out

90
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:24,050
and I'll take a poll let's go to guard

91
00:05:19,848 --> 00:05:26,689
sense of ours we also have berger sales

92
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,250
will show up and bring people quiet and

93
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:30,589
they're writing orders right here in

94
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:35,000
abroad with that makes it really paper

95
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:40,699
industry and light would be helpful to

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,459
see well that's what I hold I talk about

97
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:47,659
the operating to let's get into that and

98
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:50,060
we have over 63 tablet Otis in the

99
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,919
program this year and these are some of

100
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,329
the ones that are left and these pop

101
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:56,538
scores of these lon

102
00:05:53,329 --> 00:06:00,038
first rate to remember we could change

103
00:05:56,538 --> 00:06:02,959
this as we go forward we'll have scores

104
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:04,909
admission standing of this plan but this

105
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:10,129
is the first reading it was conducted

106
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:12,289
between July 2 and July 15 and it does

107
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:21,050
make it out to week to do a grading

108
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:24,319
because in 33 hours are in the gloom

109
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:28,550
maybe probably waiting this line was

110
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:32,978
really exciting Da Capo right Mountain

111
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:34,250
see and I know that an active Agassi

112
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:36,699
consumers

113
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:41,410
praxis immoderation

114
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:45,360
a number people to lose very well and I

115
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:49,180
only show any plan to receive it woody

116
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:53,050
- you know school here today so that

117
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:58,449
could hotline with one people today all

118
00:06:53,050 --> 00:07:01,360
the way up to five the perfect score so

119
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:04,269
there's superb elderly and courses to

120
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,150
develop the proven winners introduction

121
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:12,669
they are quite itis they have wonderful

122
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:15,699
i imitated as well as the hostess nine

123
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:19,090
flight and Lena did exceptionally well

124
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:22,620
in first grade and they had a lot of

125
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:25,810
blue bullier quality proper or

126
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:29,759
programmatic second so that date back

127
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:34,660
he's five this is funny hope they had

128
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:37,599
built healed Omid what is it is a sport

129
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:40,180
and you get a lot of sport and

130
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,790
horticulture back in the 1890s quite a

131
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:45,370
number of chrysanthemum besides bra that

132
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:47,169
wraps the sport

133
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,250
the yellow one of those of the white

134
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:51,430
rains from that they cut that off

135
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,680
propagated

136
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,689
we called through the winter 2000 that

137
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,668
they do is the propagation some

138
00:07:55,689 --> 00:08:00,639
conservative attorney visits

139
00:07:57,668 --> 00:08:03,370
intellectual property that is lost to

140
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,189
the civilian company we have contractors

141
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:10,209
that are gonna state that directly in

142
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:14,110
the contract so the one Anita I get

143
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:16,899
anyone where the bio legal point but a

144
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:19,689
they very good for if you know

145
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:23,319
that they have more dirty plant come out

146
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:26,680
of him let them not keen fan that of his

147
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:30,490
act and attracted white flowers away

148
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:34,658
Martin warranty what Louie a library

149
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:38,918
wire so that cycle and some of the other

150
00:08:34,658 --> 00:08:41,439
one visa both rulers plan on grandpa's

151
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:45,399
strength and super Belfield also

152
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:49,210
inverter different worth and we had some

153
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:52,889
passed upon bread on one last year at

154
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:58,420
the top 10 percent plan it will be

155
00:08:52,889 --> 00:09:01,088
working in this year conservative lovely

156
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:03,519
and the reason for that is we

157
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:07,270
continually have had with Alternaria

158
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:11,528
from the in the convenience talented

number think we can eradicate if you

161
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:20,860
remember you know your disease triangle

162
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:24,129
if you can bring one of those legs you

163
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:28,089
can check these laws but

164
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:31,179
in a common area of infectious materials

165
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:33,339
all these presidents late and when you

166
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:36,039
get to that period straight about now

167
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:39,190
some of the cities aside Rock a lot of

168
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:44,469
these and spray a fungicide 50 pediment

169
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:47,800
and the show secret phonetic who

170
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:51,810
vanishes so the show is actually hybrids

171
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:55,179
we have a code of opinion and they're

172
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:58,448
particularly strongly oppose the rich of

173
00:09:55,179 --> 00:10:05,888
my adult Odyssey to developing wonderful

174
00:09:58,448 --> 00:10:09,419
under the plan so the other bikini

175
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:14,079
variety and you know until it actually

176
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:17,078
is market share because while the names

177
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:19,809
of the different really sold understand

178
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:23,939
offices as we have happened

179
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:28,000
the forgetting to some of the top in

180
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:32,199
part in the broker a little overwhelmed

181
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,879
a lot of growers on inside he can't be

182
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:36,879
bought

183
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:38,828
consumption hunters over what but let me

184
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:42,458
come back and repeat your business to

185
00:10:38,828 --> 00:10:48,818
the site and you painted a to do an easy

186
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:52,059
selection on so easy wave their

187
00:10:48,818 --> 00:10:54,129
companion Venus baited and they're

188
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:56,859
extremely nice they had a good blue

189
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:59,708
polity and they also have intriguing

190
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,480
color the engineer is one of our

191
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:05,629
long-term

192
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:08,750
program and very pleased with what they

193
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:12,259
bring to the briefing brought barriers

194
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:16,309
experience and how family is a

195
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:20,088
distracting variety new alleged to the

196
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:22,909
federal gold cigarette tag and sometimes

197
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:25,400
the company will say new plot but they

198
00:11:22,909 --> 00:11:27,980
excited to listen here before I remember

199
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:31,240
something to try that way so when it

200
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:36,528
actually showed a new planet and state

201
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:41,330
acceptable children that I have visitors

202
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:44,379
Austin's of artists factory mark says

203
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:48,470
that a lot and equation

204
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:51,470
ecology and followed by awesome food and

205
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:54,950
interns looted and is a beautiful

206
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:57,440
passage purple diamond I thought that

207
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:59,680
beautiful and certain perform very well

208
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,990
so looking good today

209
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:07,219
three weeks after the first reading so

210
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:10,100
so about I did look back on a record and

211
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:15,528
native center that we had over a hundred

212
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:18,500
days in Greece Romania in 2010-2011 and

213
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:20,710
now the man would be working with this

214
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,480
resplendent passed away

215
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:27,290
big Lawson horticulture and one of our

216
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:30,649
friends property sure so that at least

217
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:33,649
would have been with all the material in

218
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:34,669
there is a memorial for that season turn

219
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:36,679
but anyway

220
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:38,929
and again dinners on a different tact

221
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:42,109
and they're going in and doing about 20

222
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:44,689
to 30 varieties for that site and we

223
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:48,340
back all of their material is pretty

224
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:51,410
aggressive and of course we have

225
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:56,120
participation communities our second

226
00:12:51,409 --> 00:13:00,889

229
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:12,589
and son being a little bit more trailing

230
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:19,009
of suprises cycles or top right policies

231
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:23,269
but those are big nose and we have over

232
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:26,120
three years running over 36 firm the

from management a lot of things from

239
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:52,570
them and this success road and after

240
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:56,230
publishing a unique explanation that

241
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:58,090
they're doing online but anyway this is

242
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:01,600
the strong performer where they honest

fitted the line so my to see finally

246
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:17,649
grant a seriously though this is

247
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:23,200
seriously doesn't look at always a

00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:26,529
pharmacist and but need is a good life

249
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,410
has a very different view the draft even

250
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:30,939
as we go forward

251
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:33,579
southern plant that are really really

252
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:37,990
strong and a number of these magnets in

253
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:40,270
a swanky roads like violet and what's

254
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:43,480
that etcetera that this very way they

255
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:46,480
need to alter like that stronger this is

256
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:50,139
our major difficulty with the Austin

257
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:53,970

including the 15 apartment and see from

262
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:08,198
this picture this is a very very strong

263
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:12,610

266
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:21,849
firms come is that it's so hard

267
00:15:18,528 --> 00:15:26,600
repeat that Super Duty especially in

268
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:30,079
mid-may and I sure enjoyed us the

269
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:33,199
creative her family Atlanta still very

270
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:37,159
humid every morning to wake up balance a

271
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:40,578
committee and then by the time the

272
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:43,850
community of do hot drop ended up 50%

273
00:15:40,578 --> 00:15:46,818
and that firm strong black us does the

274
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:50,360
employment yet fifty percent in any

275
00:15:46,818 --> 00:15:53,599
means that you are so while everything's

276
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:56,000
pretty California ass program when you

277
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,278
bring it back our position here things

278
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,389
are a little different that's why a lot

279
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:05,269
of companies landfill area for all

280
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:10,009
visitors Europe yet also from that nine

281
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:13,549
states surrounding and why that's the

282
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:19,068
lion share of the population and yeah

283
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:22,849
sometimes I kinda wondered at me I think

284
00:16:19,068 --> 00:16:28,789
why they chose that one the team are

285
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:33,080
keen was busy but it is only later music

286
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:36,419
and being at a personal

287
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:40,019
maybe they're not quite as appearances

288
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:43,349
would be any but they have stated and

289
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:46,320
that is more suited being they're all

290
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:51,420
good probably the best selling of

291
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:55,350
opinion Lang sentimentality this moment

292
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:57,649
and I used to drive a drive out 30

293
00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:00,930
minutes from work to this

294
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:04,679
experimentation and go along while I

295
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:08,099
like in our daily report and account

296
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:11,900
number of this both of you PM group now

297
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:15,448
I say market charity single that land

298
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:21,030
nothing other things like Brandis y'all

not their plan another really nice long

304
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:42,000
trilogy bread out there researching in a

305
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:46,859
program we had pronoun so then GMO

306
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,190
plants marketed and or distributed need

307
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:53,209
to have registrations

308
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:58,400
with USDA not so guys villains

309
00:17:53,210 --> 00:18:01,670
very capable lot autism drains nation to

310
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,610
the key fact lab discovered it go back

311
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:07,190
to the orgy

312
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:10,149
well Douglas lead that would be a

313
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:14,380
logical process or create issues

314
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:18,620
concerns of our art plans of eight words

315
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:21,730
but with legal matters who argued that

316
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:26,000
as you on that we are under all his

317
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:30,680
survive and so he is parted after work

318
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,890
right by of lucky the list came out a

319
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:40,009
time to come enjoy music pink with over

320
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:44,840
sixty right how hard the big reason had

321
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:47,779
to throw away all times prophecy written

322
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:50,359
in that form another group has been

323
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:55,009
showing the real promise aside secrecy

324
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:59,389
is aesthetic fear that I stick to those

325
00:18:55,009 --> 00:19:00,750
from Syngenta and I like in Texas Brock

326
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,850
there

327
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:05,039
most of them are in strong but he

328
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:08,159
staggered and Withings Erdogan being

329
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:13,589
conservative and looking like a very

330
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:14,130
little public hopefully give a second

331
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:17,220
thought

332
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:23,090
classified a little smaller come to our

333
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:23,089
opinion but they're a good apartment 11

years back a white during this load room

335
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:43,529
and the music birds are all of the able

the beetle the data field big painting

340
00:19:56,369 --> 00:20:04,529
that lasting cheaper to live and have

341
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:07,529
since present life so you're selling

342
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:10,230
black Athenians or sultana's or urban

343
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:13,349
landscape survive but they're going to

344
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:17,039
go in areas where certain present or

345
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:19,649
private you wind up with unbeaten and

346
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,549
and I dreadfully had the very

any artillery any ethical Department to

sweet pea slipping like Swiss cheese

350
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,230
with the abeyance is not acceptable

351
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,289
well having been at background

352
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:40,170
information these two gay men builded

353
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:43,589
have Latin so we power on the action

354
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:48,900
climbing variety that you have here torn

355
00:20:43,589 --> 00:20:51,179
up but really only market share when is

356
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:55,490
a beautiful mix invaders with lease

357
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:58,320
their art appropriate pain or any plant

358
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:05,099
they're growing out there that this all

359
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:09,869
reality my by the fact very instruction

360
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:13,259
is actually the all the qualities of

361
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:17,029
variety very well for rare one point

362
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:25,950
with the lowest score that work 167 and

363
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:28,829
but he denied any of these something

364
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:31,640
else's I didn't want actually provided

365
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,639
out for you

366
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:35,200
[Music]

367
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,379
propinquity

368
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,919
I ran across a little bird theory to be

369
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:43,509
mayor

370
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:46,538
these design containers and this is the

371
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:49,329
plot and right now he's plant is so

372
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:54,450
loaded through I can't believe it the

373
00:21:49,329 --> 00:21:57,939
probably is to portal plan I should say

374
00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:01,600
they are close to come from February

375
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:05,500
through April sometimes we learn this is

376
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:08,168
a mature had entry shut up in bed they

377
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:10,599
all one for an active spot and then

378
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:13,509
replace three four and a half a box of

379
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:15,819
this body outer layers in contrast this

380
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:20,378
helps us standardize things going into

381
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:23,908
the problem little birdies and they

382
00:22:20,378 --> 00:22:27,128
preferred this canary this Red Robin

383
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:30,389
support and that cute but four

384
00:22:27,128 --> 00:22:34,199
containers on back or happy or about

385
00:22:30,388 --> 00:22:37,959
what they not have to worry about within

386
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:44,080
his plant blowing over it you some power

387
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:46,298
Brian three people about that we had

388
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:49,480
done of the Sun versions of three

389
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:52,139
winners and I saw one at color

390
00:22:49,480 --> 00:23:00,460
how fortunate

391
00:22:52,140 --> 00:23:04,259
we're not seen but I love this 11 which

392
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:07,120
is a strong grower and also nice color

393
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:11,710
pictures of the livers I should've shot

394
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:14,559
it on fire unit I mean with his desert

395
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:16,990
name this plant has been with us for a

396
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:21,119
number of years every year had a very

397
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:25,329
high school always mine down to 10% and

398
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:28,750
boggles my mind it's true blue the

399
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:31,480
lovely power and that kind of rare say

400
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:33,609
back horticultural cultivars that are

401
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:37,059
really blue and there aren't that many

402
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:40,349
matters that's that's it well they for

403
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:43,720
men's ears they want a farm in any way

404
00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:46,809
here in I love I felt a very strong

405
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:50,230
bloomer brought by the time we get in

406
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:53,679
office typically things the cover the

407
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:56,440
flowers won't give people Sheila does

408
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:58,810
beaten fertile so I've seen places where

409
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:02,559
it's Groundhog Day well and the blue

410
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:04,929
versus compromising edition one of my

411
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,339
favorite American hockey entrances is

412
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:09,730
known fully intact

413
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:12,759
hold that they had perfect adda me in

414
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:16,150
that really well throughout season and

415
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:22,379
also have the beautiful gold ha so very

416
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:22,380
forever very for the stronger corner and

417
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:28,539
we did it American you want to see

418
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:31,569
marital religious oven down Arboretum

419
00:24:28,538 --> 00:24:34,808
they talk about 100 finished oligarchs

420
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:37,928
in their proper we hit two three four

421
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:42,398
depending on here this one can see the

422
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:45,580
business wall but at very strong bloom

423
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:50,589
may color is called see across the

424
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:54,189
bargain but I had as well so recommended

425
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:56,470
Harlan we do get a lot of combinations

426
00:24:54,190 --> 00:25:01,419
and obviously that's this year the ad

427
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:04,690
and son doesn't do so well worth of this

428
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:07,750
new great and we wind up with plans that

429
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:10,480
are three everything eaten plain Isis

430
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:13,019
grab see where did you have three

431
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,339
different species sometimes one Michael

432
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:19,679
Feazell

433
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:20,908
at ember pretty much gone these are inch

434
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,750
centavos

435
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:30,510
we had probably 20 he ended this year

436
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:33,839
last year 30 or 35 and here's one that

437
00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:36,890
is not really new seen this before in

438
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:41,970
the perfect last year for the meta but

439
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:45,778
good work and actually for us usually we

440
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:48,360
fill this Barlow guillotine but any

441
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:50,880
comedy to be nice that were

442
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:55,259
experimenting why happens what we be

443
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:58,080
doing very go to survive will get up to

444
00:25:55,259 --> 00:26:01,379
a hundred forty three entries in this

445
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:05,548
container and awesome that there are

446
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:08,429
black plastic is what hot try growing

447
00:26:05,548 --> 00:26:11,819
will be in white-hot one year we got

448
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:15,659
within third bubble temperature razor in

449
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:20,308
the sand that family and we went up with

450
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:22,919
savory not good it anyway the night

451
00:26:20,308 --> 00:26:26,038
Pompey love the color combination a

452
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:28,649
Halton was the claim fairly could score

453
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:31,470
there's no sort of like it this is

454
00:26:28,648 --> 00:26:35,639
another one activity Marquis month

455
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:41,470
matrix and what the mom shows when I eat

456
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:45,879
that but anyway a that preferences

457
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:49,509
hey way strong before the word very few

458
00:26:45,878 --> 00:26:52,449
years ago for those of you to stand off

459
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:55,808
and I ain't that always a dream you see

460
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:59,620
how much different State Park and an

461
00:26:55,808 --> 00:27:00,700
impacted the same culpable often ain't

462
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:04,479
that be better

463
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:07,990
why they're not sitting on Garcon Laurie

464
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,960
all that a merry way when she brought

465
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:20,169
that back you're getting the board's

466
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:30,460

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,919
any sight and the paint but often blows

00:27:44,048 --> 00:27:49,418
over

473
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:51,879
whereas beta is positive that my record

474
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:54,460
personally is for very loud message

475
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:55,089
doing something really light may be

476
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:58,090
happy

477
00:27:55,089 --> 00:28:02,319
operating on every windows bought both

478
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:05,709
of these very plant in current size of

479
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:08,918
your market identity to it and we

480
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:11,288
actually grows long saying water at some

481
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:13,880
of the deeper super moderated school

482
00:28:11,288 --> 00:28:18,049
degree now they were

483
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:21,770
wrong I wasn't approved cultivars do you

484
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:25,009
think like this receiving plant and the

485
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:28,220
other standing activity got food some

486
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:31,910
people collect the knack a couple years

487
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:36,610
ago at supertunia plenty from proven

488

winners and opinion Indian Summerford an

489
00:28:36,609 --> 00:28:42,979
understanding era will award under

490
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:47,620
hundred he favored I had and my first

491
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:50,599
year for San Jose update so often coming

492
00:28:47,619 --> 00:28:53,179
license of the three winners getting and

493
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:55,819
opportunities change the name lineup

494
00:28:53,180 --> 00:29:00,019
would say cult or how does that work

495
00:28:55,819 --> 00:29:05,419
back off both burn fat but from vision

496
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:08,779
perspective he said what we had number

497
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:11,870
burgers of years but more common mutant

498
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:15,170
jabu that all they produce they have

supporters verbena had about 40 good

507
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:52,559
routine of ours and our programs here

508
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:55,740
were all on my Bible words he is back at

509
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:59,309
grown higher the Penn State Extension on

510
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:02,819
fire today on the anyway who was

511
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:05,909
remarkably estimated Raveena's sessions

512
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:10,289
in this year film degree this is from

513
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:14,040
Zulueta and a very strong color all the

514
00:30:10,289 --> 00:30:16,680
rock garden diseases with often repeated

515
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:18,869
cycle with a very strong period

516
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:24,570
production of flowers in history

517
00:30:18,869 --> 00:30:28,529
everyone that is a good one and interest

518
00:30:24,569 --> 00:30:32,279
rates the ball always most of the very

519
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:36,509
strong in Veritate bread probably best

520
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:39,990
that our last year in period lap 70 feet

521
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:43,500
will over 95 degrees and set down a lot

522
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:45,960
for being upset my intern after the

523
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,420
garden that I wish you to cut back one

524
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:51,420
of these fries let's see if they come

525
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:54,840
back with one kid back there isn't this

526
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:57,000
the brothers were kind of active or

527
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:59,490
being yeah I cleaned them up and they

528
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:04,109
look a little tight she may not be very

529
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:07,250
much do they include the ever son can

530
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:10,969
give another good song colors awful

531
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:14,900
warmer and super being a cherry person

532
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:17,900
he W black ruinous color there too and

533
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:20,380
it's very important we had a number of

534
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:23,360
antennas they do very wrong program

535
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:26,180
until the apology or is that after wait

536
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:28,639
and then a white has a lot of scenes

537
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:31,880
that so they're teenage cultivar that

538
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:35,440
involve Oh Dudley Sarah this is one of

539
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:38,960
luma five road and it's terrible that

540
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,059
because this is salsa or missus laugh

541
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,000
will gap there their garden and she

542
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:46,250
multipliers off John sniffing this way

543
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,829
that peak is one hand and one play

544
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:51,799
soccer everybody my crazy effect out

545
00:31:48,829 --> 00:31:54,859
they don't have eyes do so my program

546
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:58,190
and try not to do a lot of Holly body or

547
00:31:54,859 --> 00:32:01,009
may need of the plan this is one is the

548
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:03,549
very well for 32 so a blue light and

549
00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:06,980
receipts superior Radian per straight

550
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:10,700
but dealt with very well last year at

551
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:14,900
the compact variety colors brought and

552
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:17,809
his hobbies but we have hundreds of tons

553
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:20,900
of skippers out there you've got solvers

554
00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:24,139
that I swallow tail all kind of

555
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:28,480
beneficial track they're playing when in

556
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:32,390
the vicinity that were claimed by

557
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:35,680
disease this year losing for was a very

558
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:41,440
large cloud of our slaves

559
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:44,310
but that is all this man and first time

560
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:48,279
I didn't think like I was so delighted

561
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:50,679
our games living very well looks like we

562
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:54,879
did before and certainly here's another

563
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:58,380
one this cultivar also come their way of

564
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:01,960
life another form of an Athenian path

565
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:04,840
that I am too tall so every in that

566
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:09,190
support plan removing very useful in

567
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:12,129
their operation that will appear being

568
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:16,900
anti problem is located usually they

569
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:20,770
have as well be right but that very

570
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:23,230
short a suit of hierarchy would be this

571
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:27,039
year but if we want to place the bread

572
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:31,390
all gooey and very strong bloomers got a

573
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:34,509
brain for looking flower but they can be

574
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:38,920
cut black hole and also have a very long

575
00:33:34,509 --> 00:33:42,069
period with either than that there lotta

576
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:44,650
many women in our program

577
00:33:42,069 --> 00:33:48,429
some people look alive he's a plan to

578
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:51,100
the develop after third one and three

579
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:54,670
versus three final animation and where

580
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:59,349
he is he that all deities they are not

581
00:33:54,670 --> 00:34:03,550
either maybe backward in south axis but

582
00:33:59,349 --> 00:34:04,969
he didn't want to get oil nectar as

583
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:07,940
anyone's

584
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:11,710
they stacked real and the most North

585
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:11,710
American species existed wait

586
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,740
I'm in switchover we had a little issue

587
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:30,869
with my computer so I'm going to go into

588
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:34,079
another series of flies here all right

589
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:36,839
so the phonies I have you seen before

590
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:41,279
but now one very attention to this

591
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:46,350
particular opinion this is a sensation

592
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:51,540
we first did even all merit selection

593
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:52,170
award important greater damage once a

594
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:55,769
traitor

595
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:59,430
are we actually to be that we had better

596
00:34:55,769 --> 00:35:03,300
sniffers and die and secondarily one

597
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:05,929
second one requires the presidential

598
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,930
party half

599
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:23,269
probably done but yet it had a serious

600
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:27,180
importance of usability and I ran to why

601
00:35:23,269 --> 00:35:31,110
the people if they see the power and the

602
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:33,210
power button painted battlefield some of

603
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:38,640
the others realized for dinner will be

604
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:42,710
on that strong market hall but whatever

605
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:42,710
they wanted to get to the chef

606
00:35:52,889 --> 00:36:00,389
this is something that we saw on

607
00:35:56,809 --> 00:36:02,220
California and Tenant retreat continued

608
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:07,199
to attention to it immediately

609
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:10,288
I said wow it's a double duty and what

610
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:13,498
you're seeing there is it actually sort

611
00:36:10,289 --> 00:36:15,539
of really put into the fire again over

612
00:36:13,498 --> 00:36:18,449
there several cultivars to be happy

613
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:24,269
this one is pretty much the strongest

614
00:36:18,449 --> 00:36:27,358
Wildman plus a so-called player bill for

615
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:30,629
that patient of large component of the

616
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:33,659
program manifested as one shade here one

617
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:36,509
book collection distributed isone color

618
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:41,538
of the variety had bigger flowers of

619
00:36:36,509 --> 00:36:44,730
Latin ordinary plant others had a lot

620
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:50,489
small platter when to plant 300 color

621
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:53,940
ribbon but these pieces may want and

622
00:36:50,489 --> 00:36:57,568
Alton Walker the Bremen spirited ready

623
00:36:53,940 --> 00:37:00,749
serious energy and leaf element part but

624
00:36:57,568 --> 00:37:01,588
they often have it that plantation don't

625
00:37:00,748 --> 00:37:04,709
go

626
00:37:01,588 --> 00:37:07,288
I only want to breathe last year you

627
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:10,590
have it in Calais including the popular

628
00:37:07,289 --> 00:37:14,730
standing up at work four and a half feet

629
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:19,850
the clinical result whether they really

630
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:23,429
sweat and examine problem tonight

631
00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:27,679
deposited worried and were the Angley

632
00:37:23,429 --> 00:37:30,480
one on top readers as that brought the

633
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:33,210
dozen patients really good grower and

634
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,360
there's not a hundred recruit baloney

635
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:40,619
this is Theodora and Loretta had a

636
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:45,990
really strong color to it is close-up of

637
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:50,159
that and then were spat they have

638
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:52,469
neither collected in truth and then it

639
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:56,789
is flowers a nickel on their gentleness

640
00:37:52,469 --> 00:37:59,689
in a promotional video of about 87 plant

641
00:37:56,789 --> 00:38:04,380
sitting area to see cadre of wall

642
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:06,590
faculty commercial will blast this earth

643
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:09,660
in the life support

644
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:11,970
insert the rain watch the plant

645
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:14,940
rehydrating from that full glory of

646
00:38:11,969 --> 00:38:19,439
anniversary time that's what meaning

647
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:22,500
back for began but director flower power

648
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:26,369
plant if you obviously have one ward

649
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:29,219
three years ago refine a habit and pop

650
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:32,929
consenting to that sticker on the year

651
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:37,399
they attended bright world very strong

652
00:38:32,929 --> 00:38:41,429
lovely plant and this beautiful dude

653
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:44,410
came ahead and pair that right there big

654
00:38:41,429 --> 00:38:49,828
flower first from growers

655
00:38:44,409 --> 00:38:54,159
- warpath here's my grows and deeper

656
00:38:49,829 --> 00:39:00,339
look at Lawrence plant there's nothing

657
00:38:54,159 --> 00:39:02,679
to blame her either on when our that

658
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:06,699
before the on top and I'm delighted to

659
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:11,368
say they only had one apart they had the

660
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:15,058
problems here what a strong focus you

661
00:39:11,369 --> 00:39:17,200
would have Oscars and container

662
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:19,720
explaining these things are great

663
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:22,389
