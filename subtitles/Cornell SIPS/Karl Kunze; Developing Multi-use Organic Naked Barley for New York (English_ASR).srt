1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:06,049
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:09,160
University so I'm gonna be talking about

3
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:12,710
developing a little bit about developing

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,388
multi-use naked barley for New York I'm

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,929
first going to focus on what naked

6
00:00:14,388 --> 00:00:20,809
barley is of how whether its potential

7
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:23,050
uses in a future market um some of the

8
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:25,579
challenges of naked organic barley and

9
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,800
I'm gonna do a little bit of focus on

10
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:30,198
some results so far in terms of we

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,590
competitive ability and if there's time

12
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:35,920
I will look at show you some of the

13
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:39,770
protein and yield data from first gear

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,750
so what is naked barley on it's simply

15
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:46,040
barley without the hull and so what that

16
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:50,000
means is when barley is it's threshed on

17
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:53,679
when harvested but the hull falls off

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,329
similar fashion to wheat compare that to

19
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:59,030
malting barley with a halt remains on

20
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:02,000
the grain on some examples right here

21
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:04,250
are our Copeland and full pint eye which

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,090
are hauled barley and then buck which is

23
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:11,810
hauless or naked and which all falls off

24
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:13,790
on this gene of for Hollis barley is

25
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:17,629
characterized by the nut gene on

26
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:19,270
chromosome 7 HL it's recessive and it's

27
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:22,849
loss of function single point mutation

28
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:25,159
and so on in theory it's quite easy to

29
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:27,469
breed out of after a couple selfing

30
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,200
generations however there are some

31
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:34,459
modifiers which make it a little bit

32
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:37,640
more difficult to make truly naked

33
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:39,439
sometimes ah the big advantage of Hollis

34
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,629
barley or naked barley compared to whole

35
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,250
barley is that without the whole you

36
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:47,478
don't have to purl it and it could be

37
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:51,950
useful for food purposes also in order

38
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:55,099
to determine the the potential for naked

39
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:57,620
multi-use organic barley on we're kind

40
00:01:55,099 --> 00:02:01,099
of basing our potential success off

41
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:04,340
these to move these two movements or

42
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:06,559
sources of increased markets the first

43
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,379
being the craft brewing movement on as

44
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,110
Dan mentioned in seminar last Tuesday

45
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,729
there there's been an increased movement

46
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:17,120
for using

47
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:19,128
naked malted barley uh particularly in

48
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,000
New York on the New York farm brewery

49
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:25,548
bill as incentivized local Brewers and

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,759
mall stirs to sorcerer ingredients from

51
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:31,280
New York on that in combined with the

52
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:33,259
organic grain market on which there's

53
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,348
been an increase in demand for novelty

54
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:39,429
food grains and with previous work of

55
00:02:36,348 --> 00:02:43,389
value-added grains with mark Lisa and

56
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:45,950
Lisa kissing Cusack and June rustle I

57
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:48,679
have been really instrumental in

58
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:50,899
developing market for organic grains so

59
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,469
hopefully with the combination of the

60
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,719
moulting and brewing ended movement and

61
00:02:54,469 --> 00:02:59,780
the organic grains we can replicate the

62
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:02,079
success with multi use organic barley so

63
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,729
what are the potential benefits

64
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:06,530
specifically um as I previously

65
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:09,048
mentioned the characteristic is no

66
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:12,310
hollows its main selling point health

67
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:15,829
benefits such as beta glucan and protein

68
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:18,139
levels compared to wheat on but mainly

69
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:20,959
we're really focused as an alternative

70
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:23,299
crop organic farmers and so some of

71
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,370
these are characteristics that we hope

72
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:27,680
that organic farmers can sell to our

73
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:30,530
moulting and if moulting doesn't work we

74
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,950
can do food and if food doesn't work we

75
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:35,989
can go for the feed market however

76
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:38,149
the feed market can be a bit dismal but

77
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:40,909
perhaps with organics there'll be a

78
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:43,639
better better market compared to the

79
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:46,310
conventional counterpart so um

80
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:49,280
unfortunately with naked barley there's

81
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:51,409
a lot of challenges and I'll start with

82
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,289
the agronomic ones of course we have to

83
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:58,519
worry about yield with barley um winter

84
00:03:54,289 --> 00:04:00,108
kill for the winters and lodging and

85
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,780
then we worry about environmental

86
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:07,370
factors that barley is highly sensitive

87
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:09,378
to disease resistance scald and powdery

88
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:12,500
mildew for the winners our leaf rust

89
00:04:09,378 --> 00:04:15,828
it's pot wash for the springs and of

90
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:18,199
course for zrm head blight for malting

91
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:20,389
in food we have worried about static

92
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:23,210
traits on is the barley going to be

93
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:24,500
marketable on for example if you have a

94
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:27,388
purple barley that's going to be

95
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,329
definitely more marketable than say

96
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:33,360
conventional white barley protein and

97
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:36,149
beta glucan and more specifically within

98
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,639
the problem protein beta glucan your

99
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:40,019
food Barley's will probably where you

100
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,759
might want your food Barley's that have

101
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:44,430
a higher level and moulting to have a

102
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,229
bit lower level and then of course in

103
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,240
New York we have a pre harvest sprouting

104
00:04:46,228 --> 00:04:51,060
issue which was really a problem this

105
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,689
year where the grain germinates in the

106
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,848
field on so we want to avoid that in an

107
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:58,889
edition with disease resistance we want

108
00:04:56,848 --> 00:05:01,019
we're concerned about the don being part

109
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:03,718
of the grain and then those are your

110
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:06,468
ganic specific challenges on with yield

111
00:05:03,718 --> 00:05:09,149
you have different management are

112
00:05:06,468 --> 00:05:11,399
concerning the grain on fertilizer

113
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:12,929
applications and whatnot certified

114
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:16,019
organic land what nutrients are

115
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,848
available for that disease resistance on

116
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:19,829
you have limited amount of fungicides

117
00:05:17,848 --> 00:05:21,509
that you can use if there's some sea

118
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:24,329
borne diseases there is currently no

119
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:27,330
solution and of course we competitive

120
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:30,959
ability and so put all these traits

121
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:32,848
together um you have Cordova to consider

122
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:36,239
and so well we hope to make gains and

123
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:38,579
all these making idealized schemes and

124
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,550
all of these won't necessarily be

125
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:42,959
possible so for this for what I'm going

126
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,270
to be talking about here I'm going to be

127
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:48,838
focusing on these three traits protein

128
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:51,028
we competitive ability in yield so for

129
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:53,009
the project these are the three main

130
00:05:51,028 --> 00:05:55,978
approaches we have the marketing to

131
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:58,288
market market the grain on as something

132
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:59,310
that people should buy on which is kind

133
00:05:58,288 --> 00:06:00,449
of putting the cart in front of the

134
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:06,180
horse a little bit with this breeding

135
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:08,250
project education um we have a barley

136
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,990
composite central little local middle

137
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:13,918
school so they get to learn about of

138
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:17,370
aspects of barley on or any genetic

139
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:19,288
concepts the teacher might want I talk

140
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:23,300
to them about and then the research

141
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:28,500
component which is what I'm here for

142
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:30,718
so so I would so we have both the

143
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,019
diversity panel in a regional panel our

144
00:06:30,718 --> 00:06:36,478
regional trials I wanted to talk about

145
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:38,818
the diversity panel however

146
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,889
we did get some good data on height on

147
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:43,800
heavy date disease

148
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:46,680
but due to the do the inclement weather

149
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:50,030
short amount of time and it being a

150
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,288
diversity panel the seed the seed

151
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:54,538
phenotypes were not that great so I'm

152
00:06:52,288 --> 00:06:57,269
I'll before we talk about that for now

153
00:06:54,538 --> 00:07:00,089
and then of course regional Charles on

154
00:06:57,269 --> 00:07:02,609
so for the regional feel design and

155
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:04,679
management our entries included released

156
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:07,288
some release varieties including bucket

157
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,030
streaker that we've grown out on Ford

158
00:07:07,288 --> 00:07:12,658
grow New York City already awesome

159
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:15,089
hauled checks selections from Oregon

160
00:07:12,658 --> 00:07:17,668
State based on the previous diversity

161
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:21,209
panels they've conducted and breeding

162
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:22,799
efforts and some naked lines that have

163
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:26,188
been grown here for the past few years

164
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,278
for the field design I for these trials

165
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:31,020
we had 25 entries for the winner 20 for

166
00:07:29,278 --> 00:07:32,759
the spring on each one of the three

167
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:36,329
replicates randomized complete block

168
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:38,189
design for the locations for the winners

169
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:40,348
we had one only one location at free

170
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:43,020
though and from the springs we had to

171
00:07:40,348 --> 00:07:45,180
loop we had two locations for the

172
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:48,538
springs one also at free will and one at

173
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,189
Musgrave and I in regards to management

174
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:54,269
practices relevant for these phenotypes

175
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:56,519
we did do try and weeding on as much as

176
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:58,500
I would like as much as we might be able

177
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:01,198
to get a better read percent management

178
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,399
without tying weeding breeding for weed

179
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,620
competitive ability supposed to

180
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:08,489
complement organic practices not replace

181
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:10,490
them and of course organic fertilizer

182
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:15,110
rates are in effect yield and protein on

183
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:17,879
somewhat so for we competitive ability

184
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:19,800
attempting to find what characteristics

185
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:22,080
are related to yield they're quite

186
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,658
difficult on they're easily confound

187
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,968
with environment on things such as

188
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:30,240
previous year rotation of what crop was

189
00:08:26,968 --> 00:08:33,059
there before it I'm just random factors

190
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,908
that result in weed to spurt weed seed

191
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:39,478
dispersal it's just a very hard for you

192
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:41,639
know type of true measure so pretty much

193
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,919
what I've done is trying to do like a

194
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:47,189
shotgun approach and identify certain

195
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:50,519
more flat barley traits and weed weed

196
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:52,949
measurements to see how well on if any

197
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:54,208
of them correlate to you and we can use

198
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:57,299
them I

199
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:58,768
as evidence of an entry having a higher

200
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:01,678
we competitive ability compared to

201
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:04,198
others so some of these traits that I

202
00:09:01,678 --> 00:09:08,129
phenotype included stand counts and

203
00:09:04,198 --> 00:09:10,349
October in November 2017 early vigor

204
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:12,480
where one is that they plants not even

205
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:16,379
there and nine plant completely fills

206
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,629
out the plot and May and June I did

207
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:22,050
wheat barley percentages and I measured

208
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:24,389
that by using this PVC point five meter

209
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:27,448
squared plot by throwing in rent section

210
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:31,139
and then seeing how much what percent

211
00:09:27,448 --> 00:09:32,998
within that plot is either barley weeds

212
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:35,579
or neither so it would be ground and

213
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:39,050
then did that twice for each plot and

214
00:09:35,578 --> 00:09:41,368
then did it for all of them and then

215
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:44,938
recorded plant form where one is

216
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:47,699
prostrate so the barley spreads out and

217
00:09:44,938 --> 00:09:50,938
five is erect and recorded these values

218
00:09:47,698 --> 00:09:54,740
um for the verb weed and barley plant

219
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:57,419
form three times every two weeks so

220
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,759
these were the weed results of the weeds

221
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:01,078
for the winter regional this bar graphs

222
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,230
show cases of rye

223
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:05,099
varieties that had the greatest

224
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:08,938
differentiation for weeds on

225
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:11,129
unfortunately a lot of the weed though

226
00:10:08,938 --> 00:10:14,068
unfortunately there was a lot of wheats

227
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:17,009
in winter or at least they weren't on

228
00:10:14,068 --> 00:10:20,998
very correlated with yield most likely

229
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:22,919
due to the dry weather conditions and or

230
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:25,409
it could be that all these barley

231
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:28,498
varieties may have some effect and we've

232
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:30,328
depression but between Barley's and

233
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:34,230
other plants I didn't we haven't grown

234
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:35,998
those yet so it would be hard to say so

235
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,298
these were some of the correlations for

236
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:42,240
these traits that I measured on overall

237
00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:44,419
plant form and sent weeds wasn't very

238
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,459
highly correlated

239
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:49,198
barley not surprisingly if more barley

240
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:52,018
given in the plot it's going to have a

241
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:55,048
higher correlation Stan counts and vigor

242
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:58,709
had some correlation but on nothing too

243
00:10:55,048 --> 00:11:02,308
too promising but it's important to keep

244
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:06,539
in mind this is only the first year this

245
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:07,740
is only the first year and so more we're

246
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:10,019
going to need to do this

247
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:13,169
for multiple years to get multiple

248
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:14,879
weather conditions or weather conditions

249
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:16,979
that will be more desirable for weeds to

250
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,960
grow and maybe not so much for barley to

251
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:22,800
see whether these wheat or barley will

252
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:26,310
truly on I will compete the wheats as in

253
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:30,750
a tree so we did the same thing for the

254
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:33,959
Springs locations free ville and free

255
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:36,029
ville and Musgrave on it we same same

256
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,519
traits the only thing that I did add is

257
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:41,189
that I did beat counts when I did the

258
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:45,299
wheat barley percentages as a proxy to

259
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:47,340
see well maybe if we account for the the

260
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:48,629
type of weeds or the size of the weeds

261
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,360
maybe that will have a greater

262
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:55,009
correlation on it recorded those three

263
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:58,169
times every two weeks as well um

264
00:11:55,009 --> 00:12:01,590
unfortunately that was even worse on due

265
00:11:58,169 --> 00:12:03,809
to the Sousa trout or severely localized

266
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:06,379
drought in Musgraves and the fact that

267
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:08,819
these were planted very late on May 25th

268
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:10,710
there wasn't many weeds in the first

269
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:15,600
place because even weeds don't like dry

270
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:17,040
weather lots of ground space as well

271
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,310
because the Barley's had a hard time

272
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,360
growing this environment on so

273
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:26,819
unfortunately we weren't able to get

274
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:29,970
much weed measurement data on now these

275
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:32,690
valleys of barley again are highly

276
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:35,129
correlated surprisingly so in the weed

277
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:37,770
measurements were more highly correlated

278
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:39,419
however that's really hard to say

279
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:41,519
whether it was the barley that

280
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:44,099
suppressed them or if it was more rather

281
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,750
they filled in the void on the barley

282
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,710
just not growing in the first place

283
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:52,019
I've free ville we had a little better

284
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:54,060
success a little better weed pressures

285
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:57,899
in must be over the winter location but

286
00:12:54,059 --> 00:13:01,559
even then with with a drought on WE

287
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:03,539
conditions still drought the weather

288
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:05,639
conditions still impeded the growth of

289
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:08,069
weeds looking at some of these

290
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,500
correlations again our two highest ones

291
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:15,330
were barley and for this one it was a

292
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:17,820
vigor rating on in the future i for this

293
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:20,860
trait it'll probably be better to

294
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,510
measure on barley at

295
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,519
certain stages as a plant where these

296
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:26,679
where barley is more highly correlated

297
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:29,620
if we wanted to turn whether these can

298
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:32,409
grow faster either that or we're gonna

299
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:36,820
have to do a better job of accounting

300
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:38,649
for for the weeds and so forth at it we

301
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,750
would have to do more of an experiment

302
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:42,519
where we would have to like seed the

303
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,139
ground with a certain population of

304
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:47,019
weeds that are relevant to that stage

305
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:50,649
that that stage and development of the

306
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:56,139
barley so on so yeah so these are

307
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:57,879
questions I would hope the answer so for

308
00:13:56,139 --> 00:14:00,250
overall yield performance of the winners

309
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:03,059
they did quite well this is a

310
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:06,850
statistical model used to fit on

311
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:08,979
responses yield I didn't put any fixed

312
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:12,850
effects in as any of the fixed effects

313
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:15,310
tried had no significance on Iran that

314
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:18,970
the random effect was i with entry model

315
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:21,069
was such and for the error variance well

316
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,540
you did it rows columns spatial

317
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:25,060
correction where the diagonals

318
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:28,049
represents the error for each plot and

319
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:31,949
the off diagonals represent the distance

320
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:35,409
correlated errors between the plots and

321
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:37,420
overall these yields did quite quite

322
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:40,029
well but on it's important to consider

323
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:41,829
that this is only the first year on a

324
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:44,709
lot of these are not specialties

325
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:47,680
selected to row malting so a lot of the

326
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:49,450
energy for the plant on can be focused

327
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,250
more on the grain yield as opposed to

328
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,680
other traits that you would select for

329
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,690
from malting so that may be a

330
00:14:53,679 --> 00:15:00,939
contribution to why these are a bit

331
00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:02,620
higher and then and then these for the

332
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,330
springs on the only thing that was

333
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:08,919
different is that I added a fixed effect

334
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:12,520
for location on and as expected these

335
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:15,429
did not do so Springs had a very hard

336
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:20,110
time this year with unfavorable weather

337
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:21,609
conditions and even between the dismal

338
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,500
conditions at Musgrave and free though

339
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:26,110
being marginally better the distribution

340
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,809
of these scores are still quite narrow

341
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:32,080
so the weather certainly played an

342
00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:34,328
effect for that I also did protein on

343
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,429
took a 20 grand to

344
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:39,399
you know type protein took a 20 gram

345
00:15:36,428 --> 00:15:41,860
sample from each plot samples analyzed

346
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:45,009
using a fuss and our our system on using

347
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:47,318
least squares regression and depending

348
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:47,919
if the barley was a Hollis or a halt

349
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:50,378
check

350
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:53,678
there's calibrated on separate files on

351
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:56,019
because all whole calibration files do

352
00:15:53,678 --> 00:15:59,919
not help calibrate all this ones or

353
00:15:56,019 --> 00:16:02,739
naked ones so for overall protein

354
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:04,719
performance on the same model use the

355
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:08,048
same models yield only with response of

356
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,239
protein said on overall for the winters

357
00:16:08,048 --> 00:16:12,639
they did quite well in terms of our

358
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:15,850
desired range for what it should be for

359
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:19,749
proteins however this is only one year

360
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:21,100
and we'll still need to evaluate these

361
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:22,959
across better years to get a better

362
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:26,619
picture of how these will respond in

363
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:28,688
terms of protein ranges and if we have

364
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:30,069
not phenotype for beta glucan yet but

365
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:31,748
that should be another factor in

366
00:16:30,068 --> 00:16:34,719
determining whether these might have

367
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:36,699
some potential mall quality i for the

368
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,548
springs these also didn't do well in

369
00:16:36,698 --> 00:16:41,708
that regard either same model as

370
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:45,639
previous one except adding a fixed

371
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:48,938
effect location due to the do the the

372
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:52,089
weather on protein gyros tend to be much

373
00:16:48,938 --> 00:16:54,219
higher and on and barley when there's

374
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:57,429
not enough water or there's a lot of

375
00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:00,278
drought and so hopefully next year we'll

376
00:16:57,428 --> 00:17:03,698
have a better accurate depiction of

377
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:08,199
these spring Barley's on with better

378
00:17:03,698 --> 00:17:11,459
weather conditions so future plans in

379
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:14,288
terms of multi-use organic barley on

380
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:19,269
with a genomic data the diversity panel

381
00:17:14,288 --> 00:17:20,740
i hope to find different hope to combine

382
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:22,720
with the phenotypes have some

383
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,709
temperature potential information for

384
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,000
some genome-wide Association studies and

385
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:29,980
perhaps examined different method

386
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,548
message measuring the rate of growth of

387
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:35,589
barley and with that I acknowledge ins

388
00:17:33,548 --> 00:17:38,888
like thank my committee members mark

[Applause]

393
00:17:53,579 --> 00:18:10,839
any questions I apologize that that was

394
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,880
just a journal they could barely picture

395
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,569
that was not germinated I apologize put

396
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,610
that one up there

397
00:18:13,569 --> 00:18:24,220
that's it was not relevant to the

398
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:27,039
protein my post from the field on deck

399
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:29,679
directly take a pod sample from on yep

400
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:43,899
lots yep after they're harvested and

401
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:45,640
wait of course yeah so um I didn't I

402
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,559
didn't put that bad in here but I did

403
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,540
take note of which ones they were and to

404
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:52,750
account for that I did take kind of the

405
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:54,940
size on but yeah I have been taking

406
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,440
notes on what kind of weeds are present

407
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,390
so if I were to do with seeding

408
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,420
experiment on those of the weeds are

409
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:03,400
used on generally it's a lot of lambs

410
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:06,700
for this for the winners you have to

411
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,570
worry about henbit and chickweed and for

412
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:13,600
the springs you have to worry about

413
00:19:07,569 --> 00:19:17,980
pigweed and land quarters more so you

414
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:20,769
mean to use a correlation for errors

415
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:22,750
between spots or was that supposed to be

416
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:33,819
an AR one there was supposed to be an

417
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:37,509
error this has been a production of

418
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:40,439
