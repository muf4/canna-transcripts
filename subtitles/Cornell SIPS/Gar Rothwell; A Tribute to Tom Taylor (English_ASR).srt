1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:18,089
well it is my sad pleasure to talk on

4
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:21,920
the late Tom Taylor one of the

5
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:27,629
preeminent paleobotanist of our time and

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:30,839
to kind of celebrate Tom and Tom's

7
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:33,839
contributions to the discipline over

8
00:00:30,838 --> 00:00:38,250
time those of you who have been in the

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,850
field for a little while like Fran will

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:45,149
know all of the history of this but

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:49,439
students coming in I think it's helpful

12
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:52,289
for students to see what people can do

13
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:56,968
but people can become and what kind of

14
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:59,280
contributions people can make and so I

15
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:04,730
can I don't have a better example for

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:10,969
any of us than Tom Taylor to emulate if

17
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:16,228
you can aspire to the success and

18
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:18,629
contributions of Tom Taylor and fail by

19
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:21,118
getting twenty percent of it done you

20
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:27,449
will be a roaring success in the

21
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:33,859
discipline so this is to Tom who died on

22
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,859
the April twenty-eighth at the age of 78

23
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:41,819
now is a bit of a background Tom

24
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:48,240
Taylor's Ohio boy we went to miami

25
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:50,118
university graduating in 1960 and then

26
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:54,859
he went on to the university of illinois

27
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:58,019
to work with Wilson Stewart at that time

28
00:01:54,859 --> 00:02:00,539
the vast majority of paleo botany that

29
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:05,359
was being practiced was Cole ball

30
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:09,689
paleobotany the tropical wetlands of

31
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:12,240
primarily Pennsylvanian age and Wilson

32
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:16,079
Stewart was one of the leading ran one

33
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,240
of the leading labs in that area and

34
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,920
when Tom this is Tom this

35
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,030
his high school graduation picture so

36
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:25,409
you can see what he look like at the

37
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:27,990
time he then went after completing his

38
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:30,919
PhD he went on to Yale University and

39
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:35,180
worked with Ted dela Boreas who became

40
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:38,459
lifelong friend and confidant of Tom's

41
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:41,069
and immediately after finishing his

42
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:44,330
postdoc he was hired at the University

43
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:47,609
of Illinois at Chicago circle where he

44
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:50,370
arrived in 1965 as the assistant

45
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,950
professor he was promoted to full

46
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:56,640
professor before leaving in 1972 and he

47
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:58,889
took his first graduate students in 1967

48
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,209
when the graduate program opened up at

49
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:04,589
the University of illinois-chicago

50
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:06,840
circle then in 1972 he went to Ohio

51
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,810
University was there for two years and

52
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,490
then he went on to a high oh State

53
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:17,069
University to chair the department of

54
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:21,210
botany there and after 21 years there he

55
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:25,759
retired well he retired from Ohio State

56
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:27,900
University and he went he accepted a

57
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,459
endowed chair at the University of

58
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,210
Kansas where he went his chair of the

59
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:38,120
department and where he has been active

60
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:41,850
ever since he also had some significant

61
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:44,700
visiting professorships working with ted

62
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:46,739
della voice 1978 setting up the

63
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:49,349
international organization of paleo

64
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:52,020
botany conference that was at University

65
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:54,239
of Alberta in 1984 and then moving on to

66
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,930
munster where he became heavily involved

67
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:02,719
with riney chert and particularly the

68
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:06,330
Fogle by otis associated with that

69
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:08,520
here's Tom with his mother tom was more

70
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:12,330
than a paleobotanist he was a person and

71
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:18,959
he was a guy that a lot of us thought

72
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:20,639
very highly of here's there are two

73
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,350
kinds of slides here though the ones on

74
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,939
the black background that I've made up

75
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,710
in the last two or three days and then

76
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:29,069
there are these that are very artsy that

77
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:32,609
Ruth did for a program two or three

78
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:36,240
years ago so here she celebrates it his

79
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:40,620
mentor Wilson Stuart here's some early

80
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,050
fieldwork and in this will be a coal

81
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:47,699
mine in southern Illinois here's Wilson

82
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:50,100
Stewart here's Tom here's another one of

83
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:53,069
the same era here's Tom here's Don

84
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,930
eggert who Tom worked with it very

85
00:04:53,069 --> 00:05:05,879
closely for many years and Dave dill

86
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:08,540
chirp now Tom's career is a fantastic

87
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:13,040
example of research productivity

88
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:16,319
research breath research innovation and

89
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:24,450
rigor high very high standards of

90
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:28,459
quality in his research he published 468

91
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:34,259
peer-reviewed papers this is a goal

92
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:36,870
didn't it on your way Kelly yeah and in

93
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:40,529
peer-reviewed journals and edited

94
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:43,470
volumes he published three editions of

95
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:45,719
his very famous and popular paleobotany

96
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,630
textbook here's the last edition of that

97
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,550
he published the first paleo mycology

98
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:54,538
textbook which just came out the last

99
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:58,139
few months here and to follow the

100
00:05:54,538 --> 00:06:00,629
progression of Tom's research we see

101
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:03,870
that he began working on morphology in

102
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:07,350
anatomy of Kobol plants as a graduate

103
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:09,750
student he worked he then was very

104
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,090
interested in little things he became

105
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:15,389
very enamored of and worked on pollen

106
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:17,699
and spores which brought him to electron

107
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:19,439
microscopy he brought the first scanning

108
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:22,228
electron microscope in the city of

109
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:24,329
Chicago into the University of Illinois

110
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:26,159
and we had it in the lab there when

111
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:30,300
medical schools had to come and use the

112
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,340
equipment so and he developed scanning

113
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:36,480
electron microscopy techniques that are

114
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:38,459
used paleobotany today he also used

115
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,100
transmission electron microscopy and

116
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:46,649
some of his students were trained in

117
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:49,500
that realm later on he became interested

118
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:52,169
in fossil fungi which we knew very

119
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,350
little about and which was very

120
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:58,530
reasonable because paleobotanist for

121
00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:02,990
vascular plant people and fungi you find

122
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:05,159
in anatomical sections preparations and

123
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:08,480
paleobotanist always want to have the

124
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:11,250
nicest anatomy and of course the fungi

125
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,160
you find in the crappiest anatomy

126
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:17,449
because they've been working on it so

127
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:20,430
although they're fungi were extremely

128
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:23,670
abundant we didn't look at him because

129
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:27,470
we didn't know what to look for tell Tom

130
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:33,170
got into it he that brought him into

131
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:38,070
organismal interactions through time and

132
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:40,850
his last major conquest with antarctic

133
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:45,509
paleo botany working on permian-triassic

134
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:46,980
and jurassic by otis some anatomically

135
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:52,139
preserved from the church and some

136
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:55,350
compression fossils here's some early in

137
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:57,389
the field shots collecting coal balls in

138
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,520
the Sahara number six mine southern

139
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:01,649
Illinois here's a shovel here it's about

140
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,269
that that's about the size of a

141
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:05,789
three-story house and here we are like

142
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:07,799
little ants the shovel is actually about

143
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:11,280
a hundred yards beyond where we are

144
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:15,180
collecting there and we collected them

145
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:18,059
in the pits Tom worked on the genus

146
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:22,230
testa the medicines for his doctoral

147
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:24,089
dissertation and after collecting these

148
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:26,160
things and bagging them up we would fill

149
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:29,310
up u-haul trucks with them and then we'd

150
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,230
be extremely tired at the end of the day

151
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,070
we just kill ourselves doing that stuff

152
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:37,409
and so there were

153
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:41,379
I think 6,000 cold balls that were cut

154
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:43,240
catalog in the plants identified and

155
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:50,759
cross-referenced University of

156
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:55,000
illinois-chicago circle tom was a 8th

157
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:56,500
outstanding mentor students so in

158
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,500
addition to scholarship we have

159
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:04,870
mentorship East and he took his first

160
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:06,669
master students in 1967 and there's a

161
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:10,840
list of the people who had master's

162
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:17,399
degrees with him he turned out doctoral

163
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:17,399
students from 1975 right on up to 2015

164
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,210
and you see a large number of names of

165
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,370
people here you know on people who have

166
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:28,509
gone on to be productive scholars in the

167
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:31,259
field here are some pictures of Ruth put

168
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:34,419
together for his 75th birthday

169
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:36,039
celebration of the former students I'm

170
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:40,179
not going to be able to go through all

171
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:42,219
of these because of the time but this is

172
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:44,079
going to go up on the web so anybody

173
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,360
who's interested can actually read all

174
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:51,730
the names they will point out a few

175
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:56,789
these are early graduate students Jim

176
00:09:51,730 --> 00:10:01,600
Mickle there's Ruth and there's ed

177
00:09:56,789 --> 00:10:06,449
here's Mike Malay down here and there's

178
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,450
of course Tom working hard in the field

179
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:16,889
this his teaching went on all the time

180
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:19,629
and this is this is a field trip to

181
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:22,019
arkansas working on mississippi and

182
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:24,610
stuff with done egerton in his

183
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:31,629
competitor with his tongue out here and

184
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:34,259
sheila brat here and here he is teaching

185
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:34,259
in the field

186
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:45,299
here are more students and from his Ohio

187
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:48,180
State days with Kathleen pig Charlie

188
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:54,179
good Sarah Stubblefield who did a lot of

189
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:57,089
the early mycology work with Tom as Ruth

190
00:10:54,179 --> 00:11:00,479
again here is Mike chin who was

191
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:03,780
tragically killed in an air crash coming

192
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:11,789
back from the meetings it was the plane

193
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:14,059
that crashed in Detroit in the city more

194
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:19,019
students chucked all in with Ruth

195
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:21,509
there's patty and won't go into won't

196
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:23,399
name them all because of time I will

197
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:25,830
point out one one person here though

198
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,720
here's Michael cream so the only picture

199
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,850
I have of any of his German connections

200
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,950
so there's Michael who he's worked with

201
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,950
very extensively in the last few years

202
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:42,360
in the mentorship continued on to post

203
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:45,779
Doc's Tom had a few postdocs during his

204
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,430
time and I'm not going to talk about any

205
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:50,669
of them individually but I will point

206
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:55,799
out that the postdocs extend from 1975

207
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:58,939
to 2015 from around the world a large

208
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:05,689
number very productive scholars today

209
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:07,470
are on this list he also had very wide

210
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:10,410
collaboration so in addition to

211
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:12,300
scholarship and mentorship collaboration

212
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:17,370
with colleagues is something that he did

213
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:19,019
very well and these are a list of not

214
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:22,080
all of his collaborators these are the

215
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:27,179
visiting scientists that he hosted in

216
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:30,450
his lab over the years and this is

217
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:32,909
include our colleagues from around the

218
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:35,180
world and many very prominent names as

219
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:35,179
well

220
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:43,909
now along the way he built a lot of

221
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:47,060
really strong friendships cadell of

222
00:12:43,909 --> 00:12:51,019
aureus has been a very close friend of

223
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:55,309
his over the years this is mike bolter

224
00:12:51,019 --> 00:13:01,100
from England and very Thomas from Wales

225
00:12:55,309 --> 00:13:09,829
and here is this is Bill challinor from

226
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:14,779
England in the early 1980s Tom began to

227
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:19,940
work with Argentine paleobotanist this

228
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:22,250
is sergio arc and gel ski papa the

229
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:27,860
patriarch of paleobotany in argentina

230
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:32,889
and he began working with Sergio and his

231
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,889
students which has brought together a

232
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:40,780
lifelong collaboration and little kids

233
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:44,419
like this came into it along the way

234
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:47,679
just Tom on a collecting trip back of a

235
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:47,679
truck in Patagonia

236
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:58,419
argentinian snow how to have a good time

237
00:13:54,690 --> 00:14:07,090
so here's revenge cuneo who was here

238
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:10,659
last week and here's nacho at Scapa who

239
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:12,220
spent a year here a couple years ago six

240
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:15,250
months six months here a couple years

241
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,930
ago yeah this is uh an asado that we had

242
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,669
when I was out in the field with him

243
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:24,639
four or five years ago here's an early

244
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:27,490
one from 1985 there is Papa there's Tom

245
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:32,830
and there's ed I don't know the other

246
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:40,240
people in that photo you do I'm sure you

247
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:44,230
would okay and so tom went back and

248
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,240
forth between first ohio state and then

249
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:50,529
from Kansas to Argentina here he isn't

250
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,600
the Petrified Forest he actually started

251
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:54,879
unworked from this when he put ruth

252
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,389
stocky on her master's and doctoral

253
00:14:54,879 --> 00:15:01,120
dissertation on cones from the Petrified

254
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:02,740
Forest and I don't have time to tell you

255
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:09,789
about her never being there because she

256
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:11,940
got deported from Argentina but and then

257
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:15,519
there was the German collaborations and

258
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:17,350
I'm afraid I don't have pictures of the

259
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,689
German collaborators because I'm in the

260
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:22,600
midst of moving from Ohio to Oregon and

261
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:24,010
everything is packed and so in the two

262
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,889
or three days I had to put this together

263
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:29,559
i was unable to get pictures but he went

264
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:33,549
over there first on an alexander von

265
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:37,750
humboldt senior research award for 1994

266
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:41,289
49 and again in 1996 actually and he

267
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:44,740
worked on riney chert that Winifred rimi

268
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:46,959
had been working on and he worked

269
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:49,730
actually some with ramy but more with

270
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,829
hot skirt and his technician who

271
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,379
and collaborate hog and Haas and most

272
00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:56,419
recently with Michael cranks who he's

273
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:59,570
worked with very extensively recently in

274
00:15:56,419 --> 00:16:02,799
this a co-author on the fossil fungi

275
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:06,528
book so that's been an extremely

276
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:08,569
important collaboration both for paleo

277
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:13,698
mycology and for biological interactions

278
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:16,579
through time and finally the last thing

279
00:16:13,698 --> 00:16:20,539
that tom is done which has made a really

280
00:16:16,578 --> 00:16:23,299
major impact is antarctic paleo botany

281
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:25,250
of the permian-triassic and more

282
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:26,750
recently up into the Jurassic with this

283
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:31,669
really good stuff that starting to come

284
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:36,649
out of there now so here's Tom dressed

285
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:41,448
for the the helo now to put this in

286
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:44,389
perspective the James Morton shop or old

287
00:16:41,448 --> 00:16:47,809
Jim shop who was one of our paleo

288
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:51,110
botanical patriarchs in 1960s was at the

289
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:52,638
US Geological Survey coal geology lab in

290
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,610
ordine Hall on the ohio state university

291
00:16:52,639 --> 00:17:00,068
campus across the campus from tom when

292
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:00,068
he was there and jim was working on

293
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:08,150
antarctic fossils in the 60s and into

294
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:12,890
the 70s and when he died in the late 70s

295
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:14,569
his mom picked up the material looked it

296
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:18,110
over and realized that there was just a

297
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:20,838
huge amount of work that to be done with

298
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:23,599
it shaf had just barely scratched the

299
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:27,198
surface so he picked up the mantle from

300
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:30,048
shop at that time and extended it into

301
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,450
permian-triassic and Jurassic church and

302
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:35,298
compression floors that we have seen so

303
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:37,220
much of over the last few years but Tom

304
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:41,690
and his students and his post Doc's in

305
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:44,829
his collaborators so here's some

306
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,830
pictures from Antarctica

307
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:54,889
it's a great picture of Tom looking

308
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:58,509
content here are some of the people who

309
00:17:54,890 --> 00:18:03,799
worked with John Isabel and Ruben cuneo

310
00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:11,480
oops this will be Isabel and this will

311
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:13,490
be Ruben and somewhat younger date this

312
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:17,440
is the first Antarctic trip that Tom

313
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:21,679
took where you went with Ed and Ruth

314
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:25,640
gross times easy to pick out here this

315
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,380
one's Ruth and they were not only

316
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,710
collecting but they were doing things

317
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,850
like who they're building an igloo

318
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:34,009
because when you went down there at that

319
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:35,869
time you had to do survival training and

320
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:39,369
so you had to build yourself a shelter

321
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:41,539
and stay in it overnight and since well

322
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:46,879
overnight even though there's no dark

323
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:52,940
light all the time here they are penguin

324
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:56,570
rookery the Penguins hairs Ruth working

325
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,880
from a snowmobile or a skidoo and Ed

326
00:18:56,569 --> 00:19:00,529
there and then here we are packing up

327
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,970
fossils I didn't go with him on the

328
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:10,849
first trip but I went with him a couple

329
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:13,548
of times later and more shots of life

330
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:17,209
when you're camping out in Antarctica

331
00:19:13,548 --> 00:19:19,819
and collecting and this is the source of

332
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:22,759
the material it gets collected it gets

333
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:26,210
boxed up in crates gets put on the ship

334
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:32,058
shipped back and arrived several months

335
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:33,829
after you get back the one of the

336
00:19:32,058 --> 00:19:37,819
biggest camps they have is it Beardmore

337
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:42,379
glacier and here's the 1976 or 1986 crew

338
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:45,019
at Beardmore glacier here are some of my

339
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:49,370
favorite pictures from there I always

340
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:52,240
thought that this was Tom being serious

341
00:19:49,369 --> 00:20:02,369
about having people collect

342
00:19:52,240 --> 00:20:04,900
and and here is the his certificate of

343
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:09,449
completing the snow craft in survival

344
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:12,490
school in that 1985 and you can see how

345
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:15,450
much he's enjoying himself in that

346
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,450
environment there

347
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:23,799
another area where tom was extremely

348
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:28,569
influential isn't building our

349
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:32,019
discipline tom has been an extremely

350
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:34,689
important builder of paleo botany at the

351
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:36,279
national and international levels he was

352
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,840
very important in building the

353
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:40,119
international organization to paleo

354
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:45,279
botany where he was president at one

355
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:47,379
time in the 1984 he went to the

356
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:49,509
University of Alberta for six months and

357
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,430
he and Ruth organized the second

358
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:53,740
international organization of paleo

359
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:58,350
botany conference University of Alberta

360
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,349
and has spectacular field trips there

361
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:04,960
these are shots of a paleo seen locality

362
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:06,789
and here's how they made the fossils

363
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,220
available to people they ran over there

364
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:10,720
with the bulldozer and cut shelves back

365
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:15,360
so that people just go ahead and collect

366
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,360
the fossils and spectacular collecting

367
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:27,789
they also had a champagne and watermelon

368
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:35,349
at the end of the collecting trip Tom

369
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:38,289
always did everything with class they

370
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:40,319
went to the lots of places in the

371
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:43,740
Canadian Rockies while they were there

372
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:46,450
here he is with Ted and here are some

373
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:48,309
Japanese graduate students on the

374
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,840
athabasca glacier where there pulls the

375
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:52,720
water and it would stick their hand down

376
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:54,789
in the water and at time them to see who

377
00:21:52,720 --> 00:22:04,509
is a toughest and could keep it in there

378
00:21:54,789 --> 00:22:07,109
the longest Tom had a lot of family in

379
00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:09,609
terms of scholastic family and friends a

380
00:22:07,109 --> 00:22:13,479
lot of people with whom he is very close

381
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:16,959
and influenced extensively he worked

382
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,309
very closely with with Don eggert for

383
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,200
many years they were together at the

384
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:25,539
University of Illinois at Chicago circle

385
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:27,190
in the late 60s and early 70s and at

386
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:29,049
that time it was probably the most

387
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,660
active paleo botany lab in the world

388
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:35,079
they had a dozen graduate

389
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:41,700
students going and here are some of the

390
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:46,210
of this crew including here's Ted that's

391
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:49,269
Mike the other side that's guy I don't

392
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:53,289
know he's what he washed out there's

393
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:57,339
very careful Marian Wilson here's Ruth

394
00:22:53,289 --> 00:23:03,399
and Ed that I'm not sure that could be

395
00:22:57,339 --> 00:23:07,059
cookie trivet there's some marine thank

396
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:11,110
you every buried Herman yeah I was at a

397
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:14,589
meeting around nineteen seventy maybe

398
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:16,899
something like that I was looking for a

399
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:18,519
picture it was old enough for Bill not

400
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:27,190
to have white hair but I couldn't find

401
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:30,279
one so here's a fortunately for we were

402
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:36,460
able to have a celebration for Tom when

403
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:38,710
he turned 75 and in 2012 and we had a

404
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,360
celebration of that at the Paleo

405
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,730
botanical banquet at the Botanical

406
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:46,750
Society meetings and then later in in

407
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:53,289
September that year at the OPC we had a

408
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:56,980
symposium dedicated to him and from that

409
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:59,230
came a special issue for the

410
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:04,059
international journal plant science we

411
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:08,110
had I forgotten 2425 papers by a almost

412
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:11,500
50 authors all of whom had been very

413
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:14,319
closely associated with Tom as students

414
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:18,519
former students students of former

415
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:21,250
students postdocs former postdocs close

416
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:22,539
collaborators and people he worked with

417
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,190
in building the international

418
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:25,809
organization of pedo botany so we were

419
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:28,900
delighted to be able to honor him with

420
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:30,879
that in the thomas &amp; Taylor Diamond

421
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,769
Jubilee special issue the intern

422
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:38,200
journal Applied Sciences that came out

423
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:41,529
2013 now the last thing I want to talk

424
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:46,900
about is Tom as a poet you don't think

425
00:24:41,529 --> 00:24:50,049
of Tom as a poet but his students do and

426
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:52,480
it brings out some of Tom in a more

427
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:57,129
personal sense the types of things which

428
00:24:52,480 --> 00:25:01,750
have made in dear his students to him

429
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:04,150
and him to his students he would write

430
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:07,089
poems for his students and leave them on

431
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:08,620
their desk now fortunately I cleared out

432
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:12,339
of the lab before he discovered he could

433
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:14,109
do that and he often did that with when

434
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:16,059
somebody had done something that was a

435
00:25:14,109 --> 00:25:17,789
bit embarrassing is that or somebody did

436
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:21,909
something that was really outstanding

437
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:24,250
this is a Charlie good at the time I'll

438
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:27,130
read the beginning of this there once

439
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:29,529
was an employee named good who worked

440
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:31,930
with fossils as best he could his

441
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:35,579
talents and drive were better than most

442
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:37,810
he even was known to occasionally boast

443
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:40,539
that's a little digging in there and

444
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:43,329
then I'll to skip down the bottom for

445
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:48,009
morale I have none to relate to this

446
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:51,599
chap but there he but were he now hear

447
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:54,309
me through Thunder would clap and

448
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:57,669
probably an echo would be whispered for

449
00:25:54,309 --> 00:26:01,269
sure your dear friend and colleague in

450
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:03,580
occasional butcher Charlie had screwed

451
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:09,009
something up and you left the note on

452
00:26:03,579 --> 00:26:12,609
his desk i am not going to read all

453
00:26:09,009 --> 00:26:16,269
these here's one that was that he wrote

454
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:19,419
for ed when she was his student where

455
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:21,279
she had I think done a misidentification

456
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:23,820
which he brought to her attention with

457
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,819
this poem

458
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:42,789
ah here's one for Lisa Boucher here's

459
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:45,460
one for Jeff Osborne and here's what

460
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:46,869
real long one for Murray kerman and

461
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,970
since these are going to go up i'm not

462
00:26:46,869 --> 00:26:51,750
going to bother to i'm not going to read

463
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:56,860
them because i don't have the time but

464
00:26:51,750 --> 00:27:00,970
over the years ruth was complaining that

465
00:26:56,859 --> 00:27:03,459
he never wrote a poem for her and so at

466
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:05,829
the roof growth that we had when she

467
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:09,130
retired University of mérida that was

468
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:11,409
held last year he wrote a poem for and

469
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:14,680
he read it i think i'm going to i will

470
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:17,800
play that for you there once was a last

471
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:21,789
name started all my poems begin there

472
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:25,180
once was there once was a last name

473
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:29,500
stocky who's climbed to the top was

474
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:32,950
always rocky she labored away night and

475
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:37,299

476
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:41,470
say for a reason we distill far from

477
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:46,599
clear this last sake was sometimes heard

478
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:50,769
to cheer isle of pines I'll akerians and

479

even you I'm a gymnosperm down through

480
00:27:50,769 --> 00:28:03,609
and through give me stomata with sunken

guards useful climate secrets that are

482
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:10,959
known to castel a Place in the Sun were

483
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:15,490
all will know I was the first to

484
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:19,120
describe him and not just for show her a

485
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:22,029
search was silent and easy to share she

486
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:25,109
got funded to travel here and there do

487
00:28:22,029 --> 00:28:26,349
comparative studies with much to say

488
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:29,589
junos

489
00:28:26,349 --> 00:28:35,009
rooms are great but now pass their

490
00:28:29,589 --> 00:28:37,689
heyday are you for the years to come

491
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:47,710

00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:59,230
might be fun but the researchers are

494
00:28:50,019 --> 00:29:01,569
bores I now she had traveled some

495
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:04,839
distance away where the winters are cold

496
00:29:01,569 --> 00:29:07,259
and the snow is all played to a land

497
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:09,849
where all colours continue to stall

498
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:19,419
there's also the home of the edmonton

499
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:22,449
mall now entered a wise man named

500
00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:25,000
Stewart who said Ruthie might be air you

501
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:27,100
won't need a sweat this isn't a sight I

502
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,630
know very well where the summers are

503
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:35,408
great and the winners are held the four

504
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:38,230
floor of their screams visit our grade

505
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:43,059
will show you stuff that will make even

506
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:46,089
watch well range many hold secrets that

507
00:29:43,058 --> 00:29:50,529
some will scorn that we were around here

508
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:53,500
before even you were born flowers abound

509
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:57,099
they're all over the place with perianth

510
00:29:53,500 --> 00:30:01,329
parts in your face son Drew and waters

511
00:29:57,099 --> 00:30:05,259
others dry land Princeton's our names so

512
00:30:01,329 --> 00:30:08,408
give us a hand will set you off to

513
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:12,429
publish more stuff with your students

514
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:15,340
and colleagues some enough up just think

515
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:18,669
about the data we humbly whole new

516
00:30:15,339 --> 00:30:20,829
hypotheses for perio botany that can be

517
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:25,930
easily so

518
00:30:20,829 --> 00:30:25,929
and so she went to Princeton that Yale

519
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:36,110
collecting megatons and rock and even

520
00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:39,500
some shale trapping the stuff and

521
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:45,219
looking for plants so even with fungi in

522
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:49,519
their pants the bio not Waller your

523
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:52,460
curiosity stronger I look this stuff she

524
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:56,450
sent you all the eocene is great it's

525
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:59,090
even a ball and then one day a new

526
00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:03,140
friend would say there's a place that I

527
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:05,959
call the Appian Way petrified stuff all

528
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:09,410
over the place nodules in rocks some

529
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:13,220
even in place and so it went from this

530
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:19,880
site to papers and talks more research

531
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:22,900
to do is this getting too long in

532
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:28,570
reading this poem to a meet one night

533
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:28,570
whose eyes roll up and then on the side

534
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:35,900
stop it term I can take no more your

535
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:40,640
knowledge will think you're a terrible

536
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:43,790
more after crying out loud the shameless

537
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:47,090
poet did say I've given your Ruth your

538
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:50,059
special day a verse for her it is long

539
00:31:47,089 --> 00:31:53,559
overdue if you don't like the rhymes

540
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:53,559
here then screw all

541
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:08,750
so with that in mind when Tom became

542
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:11,539
really ill in the last month proof wrote

543
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:17,960
a poem for him and I'll try not to screw

544
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:20,539
it up too badly a poem for Tom Taylor my

545
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:23,180
wrist Aki there once was a botanist

546
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:26,629
named Taylor who said that I talked like

547
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:29,620
a sailor mentor and friend no horses

548
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:33,740
rear and a Prince of a fellow Tom Taylor

549
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:36,069
his microscopy type was scanning flames

550
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:39,170
of palin ology then he was Fanning

551
00:32:36,069 --> 00:32:42,559
pollen and spores no study for boars

552
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:45,230
carboniferous cold balls in planning his

553
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:48,470
partner in crime was named Donald a guy

554
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:50,180
who with no need to be coddled they blew

555
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:53,660
up the truck with a little bad luck

556
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:58,100
falling rocks was the story they modeled

557
00:32:53,660 --> 00:33:01,370
a fern they named to Delia with fern

558
00:32:58,099 --> 00:33:04,579
characteristics so curia named for dello

559
00:33:01,369 --> 00:33:08,779
various the name was just glorious but

560
00:33:04,579 --> 00:33:12,529
Norwood heeya oh my odious Tom perfected

561
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:14,299
the method of peeling ground testa

562
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:16,579
with verb and with feeling carboniferous

563
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:21,139
seeds fulfilled all his needs but in

564
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:23,629
time needed work more appealing left

565
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:26,990
Chicago for Athens Ohio an additional

566
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:31,010
notch on his bio start of interest in

567
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:33,859
fungi we all know this fun guy was a

568
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:35,930
scientist there for tomorrow callum

569
00:33:33,859 --> 00:33:39,409
it's-- radstock iya and seed ferns

570
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:41,660
Bowman ID sakky pollen and we learned he

571
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:45,080
said that ontogeny recapitulates

572
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:49,820
phylogeny toward reproductive biology he

573
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:52,009
turned he moved on to columbus ohio to

574
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:54,859
be chairman department of bio the

575
00:33:52,009 --> 00:33:58,519
dandelion bloomed an insurrection loomed

576
00:33:54,859 --> 00:34:02,029
but he triumphed in time meal mile his

577
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:04,700
students the line should be towing

578
00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:08,148
darkroom whining on time spent is

579
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:11,050
growing help with foot fatigue called

580
00:34:08,148 --> 00:34:14,109
those these workers bush league

581
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:17,650
rubber matting the solution now showing

582
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:21,760
his wisdom for his students legendary in

583
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:25,150
this lab no need to stall or ever Terry

584
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:30,040
get your pubs drafted or else you'll get

585
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:33,429
shafted good job good now good jobs are

586
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:36,759
what's customary in my lab you'll get a

587
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:39,130
PhD in moving its kool balls from the

588
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,620
strata we're removing publish or perish

589
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:44,829
the mantra or weed cherries it's

590
00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:46,900
hypothesis we should be proving all is

591
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:49,630
students at the Uni so productive

592
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:55,260
studied gymnosperms horsetails and firms

593
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:58,240
reproductive it's time for cathartic

594
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:01,020
will collect the Antarctic glossopteris

595
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:04,059
sure sounds deductive Beardmore glacier

596
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:06,909
laboratory students added to the story

597
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:11,230
fossil plant explanatory working on

598
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:15,639
their oratory came cambium and fossil

599
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:18,070
phloem some of them deserved a poem all

600
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:21,129
of their work is laudatory added greatly

601
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:24,550
to his glory many reconstructions of

602
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:27,910
whole plants even gave us time to work

603
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:29,800
on grants ferns and fungi from Triassic

604
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:33,339
developmental studies classic

605
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:36,400
paleobotany ramps from fossil plants

606
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:40,059
from the chert known as rainy with fungi

607
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:43,840
included so tiny studied with Hagen Haas

608
00:35:40,059 --> 00:35:48,820
in others with class with life cycles

609
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:51,490
that formally stymie the Permian studies

610
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:53,980
of tree rings conifers cuticles and like

611
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:58,259
things lichens and a side the studies

612
00:35:53,980 --> 00:36:02,139
were classy bacteria with Mikkel creams

613
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:04,780
pennsylvanian leaf epiphyte fungi were

614
00:36:02,139 --> 00:36:08,139
described by this famous once Buckeye

615
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:11,230
cones of the cycad spores found in dyads

616
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:13,809
were papers with his old alumni his

617
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:16,570
paleo books have been well-received even

618
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:18,099
better than we all believed biology and

619
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:22,480
evolution was his great contribution

620
00:36:18,099 --> 00:36:24,539
each particularly well achieved what

621
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,599
will be his future goal

622
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:31,840
will he study petioles will he macerate

623
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:36,389
some coals will he have new founded

624
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:38,980
roles must stay away from all

625
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:42,129
we who have benefited from his

626
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:44,469
instruction succumbed to paleo botanical

627
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:46,390
seduction learned the powers of chanical

628
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:49,319
deduction practice whole plant

629
00:36:46,389 --> 00:36:52,769
reconstruction try to emanate his

630
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:57,660
production so there is Ruth

631
00:36:52,769 --> 00:37:01,259
recapitulating Tom's career and his

632
00:36:57,659 --> 00:37:04,029
effect on his students and colleagues

633
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:06,940
here are a list of awards and honors I

634
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:09,190
will point out that he his awards

635
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:11,170
include distinguished scholar

636
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:13,559
distinguished teaching awards here's his

637
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:22,990
national academy of science selecting

638
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:26,349
amongst the others and so as a an

639
00:37:22,989 --> 00:37:29,529
example of what one can be and what we

640
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:36,420
all wish that we were and what students

641
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:36,420
still can be so long tom we miss you

642
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:48,420
this has been a production of Cornell

643
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:48,420
University on the web at cornell.edu
