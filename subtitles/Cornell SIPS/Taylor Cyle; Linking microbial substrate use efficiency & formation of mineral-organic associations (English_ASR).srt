1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,979
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:06,750
University today I'm gonna talk to you

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,820
about some ideas I've been putting

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,400
together and starting to work on as part

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,669
of my PhD dissertation the goal of this

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,410
work is linking microbial substrate to

7
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:19,259
the formation of organo mineral

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,359
associations so both of these areas of

9
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:23,338
research are heavily studied by our

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,839
community and so my goal was to ask

11
00:00:23,338 --> 00:00:28,049
questions trying to link these two

12
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:29,908
processes it's hard to find a nice

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,130
picture to sum all this up the best I

14
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:34,939
could do was a picture from some field

15
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,440
work recently so this is looking down on

16
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:39,589
the soil surface after we pulled away

17
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,149
the Oh a horizon you see these beautiful

18
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,100
fungal hyphae extending at this

19
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,829
interface between the Oh a horizon and

20
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:57,810
the more mineral-rich B horizon below

21
00:00:46,829 --> 00:01:13,679
that you know how I advanced I can do it

22
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:15,299
manually on the research I've been

23
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:19,560
involved with in the past and how this

24
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,999
research led me in leading into my

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,170
dissertation questions and the Met

26
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:26,699
designs and I want to show you some

27
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,530
preliminary results from my first

28
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,539
chapter and then hopefully the outcomes

29
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:36,780
so as amy said before coming to Cornell

30
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:39,718
I was involved I was fortunate enough to

31
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,108
be involved in Alana's change project so

32
00:01:39,718 --> 00:01:45,568
I was doing more ecosystem scale

33
00:01:42,108 --> 00:01:47,638
measurements ecosystem auditor if you

34
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:49,590
will if you will we were looking at a

35
00:01:47,638 --> 00:01:53,849
management intensive grazing grazing

36
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:56,368
dairy system after transitioning from a

37
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:59,068
row crop agricultural management system

38
00:01:56,368 --> 00:02:01,349
so it was a lot of digging pits taking

39
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:03,629
multiple soil samples and filled with

40
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:06,169
cores and watching that change in soil

41
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:08,719
carbon and nitrogen

42
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:11,240
and so that work really led led me to

43
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,340
note the importance of human management

44
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:17,150
in sequestering soil carbon and nitrogen

45
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:19,640
and it was uh was more about you know

46
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,819
taking note of the stocks and not as

47
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:24,769
much about process based science and so

48
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:27,409
moving into my Master's I wanted to ask

49
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:30,020
more about ask more questions about

50
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:33,439
decomposition and what processes Drive

51
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,790
soil carbon nitrogen accumulation so

52
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,090
while I was doubly into the literature

53
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:39,650
for my master's thesis there was a lot

54
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,900
of papers coming out really stressing

55
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,629
the importance of microbial of the

56
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,069
microbial community in this process so

57
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:48,500
this is one paper I've chosen that

58
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:49,329
really stuck out with me and they pulled

59
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,129
out some back of the envelope

60
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,900
calculations that show that microbial

61
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:56,870
necro masks forty times greater than

62
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,219
living by them biomedicine soil so it's

63
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,550
really a graveyard out there in some

64
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:06,430
sense up to 80% of soil organic carbon

65
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:08,510
is microvilli derived and you've seen

66
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,150
inferences of the importance of

67
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:13,939
microbial biomass to soil carbon and

68
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:16,159
nitrogen preservation by a whole host of

69
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:18,019
measurements so if you look at studies

70
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,299
that look at different fractions of the

71
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:22,730
depth or denser fractions that tend to

72
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:24,890
be more mineral associated or fractions

73
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:28,340
that tend to have older ages by 14c

74
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:30,229
dating you tend to see evidence that

75
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,239
this carbon nitrogen is microbially

76
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:36,139
derived since they have a lower c2n

77
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,989
ratio a more enriched isotopic

78
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:41,000
composition which indicates processing

79
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:43,400
by the community and then spectroscopic

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,049
and biomarker analyses also indicate

81
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,689
that this carbon nitrogen has been

82
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:49,640
processed so I'm telling you all this

83
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:51,469
because it's important to have a better

84
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:54,109
understanding of microbial processing

85
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:57,139
understand the preservation of soil

86
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:59,870
carbon and so I picked these two figures

87
00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:01,009
out for the paper cuz they really stood

88
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,469
out to me at the time when I was

89
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:05,750
introducing myself to the subject so

90
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:08,870
these I believe they are German

91
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:13,159
researchers gruesome E coli up in the

92
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:15,890
lab on 13 C enriched substrates so you

93
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:17,089
have enriched ecoli biomass and then

94
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:19,459
they just threw that out into an

95
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,959
agricultural deal and they followed the

96
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:23,050
fate of

97
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,709
carbon-nitrogen for several years three

98
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:28,750
or four years and you can see with time

99
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:32,258
over fifty percent of that dead biomass

100
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,279
still retains and in the soil matrix so

101
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:34,900
that's surprising because these are

102
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,348
compounds that you think would decompose

103
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:40,418
relatively rapidly and they attribute a

104
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:43,779
lot of this preservation as others do in

105
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:48,310
the field to sorption of this dead

106
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:49,508
biomass to mineral surfaces so also at

107
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:53,168
this time while I'm working on my

108
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:55,240
Master's it was kind of a there was a

109
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:57,038
conceptual framework put out that was a

110
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,319
reiteration of some ideas that have been

111
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:03,038
floating around for a while that really

112
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:05,050
changed how we viewed the the

113
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:07,659
persistence of carbon and nitrogen in

114
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:10,389
Plzen soil so you know your intuitive

115
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,669
approach to the topic is if you add

116
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:14,319
stuff that decomposes slower it should

117
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:17,288
stick around longer that's just the

118
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:19,360
intuitive view of the subject and what a

119
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:21,490
lot of authors are coming to to

120
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,889
understand is that when you really look

121
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:26,319
at longer time horizons you see an

122
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:29,168
inverse in this relationship and so

123
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,240
these more recalcitrant litters which

124
00:05:29,168 --> 00:05:35,348
may have higher sita in ratio though

125
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,939
they disappear faster earlier on and you

126
00:05:35,348 --> 00:05:38,800
look at longer time horizons there's

127
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:41,348
actually less of that recalcitrant

128
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,449
carbon nitrogen in the soil so the idea

129
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:45,759
here is that this material is used less

130
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:51,669
efficiently so I had long time horizons

131
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:53,199
it's not preserved so I wanted to you

132
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:54,848
know that's a great idea and all but I

133
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,478
wanted to test to see if I could see

134
00:05:54,848 --> 00:06:00,848
that in in a laboratory incubation so

135
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:03,550
working in these dairy systems there's

136
00:06:00,848 --> 00:06:04,750
this interesting opportunity I didn't

137
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,669
tell you much about the system but they

138
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:10,360
can really manage the age of the forage

139
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:13,538
which dairy cows are grazing so we had

140
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,658
this idea of could you choose an optimum

141
00:06:13,538 --> 00:06:19,478
forage age at which you could enhance

142
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:20,978
not only carbon sequestration but the

143
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:25,800
preservation of that material by

144
00:06:20,978 --> 00:06:30,310
minerals and so I intubated a range of

145
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:32,079
residue inputs ranging in quality and so

146
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,480
the white circles here are showing the

147
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,240
bermudagrass forage

148
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:39,540
and then we made fake manure from that

149
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,750
forage which is lower in quality and I

150
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:45,240
can tell you later how we made that

151
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:47,310
pretty interesting story and what I

152
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,759
incubated that in the lab at optimum

153
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:52,379
conditions and then we followed how much

154
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,659
of that carbon was remaining and how

155
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:56,790
much wood that was associated with

156
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,910
mineral fractions and what I found would

157
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:02,850
you look at the y-axis this is clay

158
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:04,710
associated carbon is that there was a

159
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,629
clear relationship that if you add

160
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:09,269
higher quality litters you see more of

161
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:11,250
that carbon associated with the clay

162
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:13,709
fraction than you do with lower quality

163
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:16,139
layers and a similar trend holds for

164
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:21,779
nitrogen as well though it's a lower

165
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:24,449
magnitude and so moving into my PhD I

166
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:28,049
wanted to continue looking into this

167
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:32,250
topic but at a much finer scale and at a

168
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:33,689
molecular scale and so to do that we

169
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,370
first have to think about what do I mean

170
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:40,500
by carving use efficiency I've said it

171
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:43,079
many times to do that I don't to use a

172
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,360
cartoon so don't cringe too much

173
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:49,050
microbiology people in life this is a

174
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,819
bacterial cell if you can imagine it in

175
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,949
the soil environment it's surrounded by

176
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:56,579
all of these compounds that it might use

177
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:59,789
to grow right but a lot of these

178
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:01,649
compounds can't assimilate as they are

179
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:05,129
right they're too large to transport

180
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:06,870
across the membrane and so do

181
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:08,939
polymerization reactions are needed to

182
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:12,530
cut these larger molecules into smaller

183
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:17,550
monomers or dipeptides smaller molecules

184
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:19,469
of membrane but so at any one time you

185
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:21,720
can think these low molecular weight

186
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:23,490
compounds make up about 10% of the

187
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,719
carbon and nitrogen in solution so

188
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:28,968
they're a very small fraction

189
00:08:26,718 --> 00:08:31,158
and you can imagine also that some

190
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:32,958
microbes may not have ability to produce

191
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:35,599
the extracellular enzymes to

192
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,878
depolymerize these larger molecules but

193
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,240
anyways there's a small fraction that's

194
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:44,688
readily available to the microbe and it

195
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,310
may choose one substrate to grow on it

196
00:08:44,688 --> 00:08:47,899
may sequentially move through low

197
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:50,208
molecular weight substrates as it grows

198
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:54,559
and it may use several substrates

199
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:58,698
simultaneously and during that process

200
00:08:54,559 --> 00:09:00,859
it produces more biomass and it respires

201
00:08:58,698 --> 00:09:03,620
in the in the process some of these

202
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:07,159
substrates are assimilated and used to

203
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:09,078
produce more biomass produced reducing

204
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:13,129
equivalents and get that proton motive

205
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:14,688
force to do these reactions and so if we

206
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:17,209
want to think about how efficiently the

207
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:19,879
carbon is used to make new biomass we

208
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:22,159
can simply calculate the carbon in the

209
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:23,778
microbial biomass versus the amount of

210
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:25,969
carbon that is moved through the system

211
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:28,490
in this process so the amount in the

212
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,949
microbial biomass plus the total

213
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:34,850
respiration so the size of this red

214
00:09:30,948 --> 00:09:36,378
arrow and then there are some

215
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,180
interesting inferences we can make about

216
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:40,610
how carbon you sufficiency might change

217
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:43,549
with temperature or with substrate

218
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:47,329
concentrations and also maybe most

219
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:51,139
importantly with phylogeny so this is my

220
00:09:47,328 --> 00:09:56,808
fungal cell please don't cringe we can

221
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:57,980
think of it as part of a - maybe yeah we

222
00:09:56,808 --> 00:10:00,110
tend to think that these fungal

223
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,058
organisms can use a wider range of

224
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,909
compounds to grow so they have more

225
00:10:02,058 --> 00:10:08,328
metabolic diversity right and when they

226
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:11,000
grow they tend to grow more efficiently

227
00:10:08,328 --> 00:10:14,799
so they produce less co2 per unit

228
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,188
biomass so that's carbon use efficiency

229
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:22,338
but then we can also think about

230
00:10:18,188 --> 00:10:25,789
substrate going back to this bacterial

231
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:28,399
cell if we could follow just one

232
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:31,429
substrate maybe with an isotopic label

233
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:34,818
then we can partition out how

234
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:36,828
efficiently that wants us so we can

235
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:38,439
follow the label of the carbon from that

236
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:43,089
fuko's for instance

237
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:46,240
into the biomass substrate your

238
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:48,100
sufficiency so that gets interesting cuz

239
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,039
here we're not looking at much at total

240
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,050
metabolic efficiency we're really at are

241
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:58,870
these compounds being assimilated more

242
00:10:53,049 --> 00:11:02,469
versus dissimilar and predicting how

243
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:04,539
these compounds may be used is an

244
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,519
interesting idea and some people have

245
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:08,709
thrown away thrown out different ideas

246
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:10,689
on how to do this and one idea that

247
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,509
seems promising is using the nominal

248
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:15,280
oxidation state of that card so this is

249
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:16,840
kind of an average of the oxidation

250
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:21,429
state of all the carbons in that

251
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:24,610
molecule so you can imagine I have nos C

252
00:11:21,429 --> 00:11:26,379
on the x-axis here and on the Left we

253
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,810
have carbonate an oxidation state of

254
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:31,629
four so that's the most oxidized going

255
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:34,469
to the most reduced you know co2 for

256
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:36,970
example versus methane and with

257
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:39,190
decreasing oxidation state you actually

258
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:43,750
have a higher heat of combustion so you

259
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:45,760
have more energy in that compound and

260
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,799
then we can think about where is biomass

261
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:50,649
and on average microbial biomass is

262
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:54,339
around negative 0.2 so it's slightly

263
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:57,459
more reduced than the average sugar and

264
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,259
so if you're building biomass from

265
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,110
compounds that are more oxidized than

266
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:05,409
you are then your energy limited right

267
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:07,090
so you can convert that carbon into new

268
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:08,860
biomass but the second law of

269
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:11,620
thermodynamics really prevents you from

270
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,360
using that carbon completely efficiently

271
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,850
because you don't have enough energy to

272
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,250
generate enough heat right to to

273
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:21,790
compensate for the entropy you're losing

274
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:23,769
by making new cells on the other side if

275
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:26,049
you're using carbon sources that are

276
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:28,090
more reduced your carbon limited so you

277
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:31,809
have enough energy but you can't produce

278
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:33,700
that that biomass is officialy so then

279
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:36,879
we can look at where different compounds

280
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,710
are on this gradient you know

281
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:41,110
unsurprisingly organic acids are more

282
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:43,540
oxidized right a lot of the sugars and

283
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:46,419
amino acids range closer to the

284
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:49,539
microbial biomass and then membrane type

285
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:52,919
compounds tend to be more reduced

286
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:55,480
so then we can look at some data from

287
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:58,479
microbiology literature so these are

288
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:02,200
single isolates growing on one carbon

289
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,269
source and you can see this trend where

290
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,490
as you get further away from the biomass

291
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:08,860
oxidation state you see a decrease in

292
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,360
carbon use efficiency so right if you

293
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,240
squint your eyes you can see this trend

294
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,279
approaching the average oxidation state

295
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,159
of the biomass and then maybe on the

296
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:21,429
reduce side you see downward trend or no

297
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:24,789
relationship so that's looking at carbon

298
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:26,709
use efficiency with one substrate but

299
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:29,370
then we can also look at additions of

300
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:31,750
substrates to the soil matrix so this is

301
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:36,340
substrate use efficiency it's tracing

302
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:38,169
one compound and from these two papers

303
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,240
we can see a similar trend in soil

304
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:43,089
environments where these more oxidized

305
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,750
compounds or use less efficiently and we

306
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:49,810
don't have much data on the reduced side

307
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:55,509
but perhaps that's a decrease or perhaps

308
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:57,369
there's no relationship so so that's an

309
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:58,840
introduction to carbons and substrate

310
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,060
use efficiency and now I want to talk a

311
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,070
little bit about mineral surface

312
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:06,250
sorption and the kinetics of those

313
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:09,450
processes and thinking mostly about the

314
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,620
mineral surface as a competing

315
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:15,550
repository for these compounds versus

316
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:17,679
the microbial violence so this is some

317
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:21,299
data from a lab mate of mine Mike

318
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:24,099
Schmidt came out this year and this is

319
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:26,849
kinetics absorption and so here we're

320
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:31,149
looking at DNA sorption on to ger type

321
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:34,330
so on the x-axis we have time in minutes

322
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:37,090
and on the y-axis we have Q so this is

323
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:41,980
from FTIR data but you can think of it

324
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:43,629
as the surface loading of this DNA and

325
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,960
the point I want to make here is first

326
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:48,639
of all with increasing initial DNA

327
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,470
concentration so with higher

328
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,870
concentrations of compounds in solution

329
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,279
you can get more on the surface so

330
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,980
anyone who's done sorption isotherms

331
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:59,409
realizes this point you can get higher

332
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,970
loading rates with more organic

333
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:03,219
compounds in solution

334
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:05,500
higher concentrations and then the

335
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,139
second point I want to make is the

336
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:10,568
kinetics of this process are a function

337
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:13,829
of the saturation deficit so it's a

338
00:15:10,568 --> 00:15:16,179
function of how far are you away from

339
00:15:13,828 --> 00:15:19,539
saturation under those conditions

340
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:21,338
so maybe sounds a little esoteric if you

341
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:24,789
look at this bottom line we think of

342
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:26,500
this one DNA concentration solution at

343
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:28,990
time zero you have the highest

344
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,240
saturation deficit possible right refer

345
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,799
this from equilibrium as you can be and

346
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,269
that's where your heist kinetics can be

347
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,969
found and as you approach that

348
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:41,679
saturation point things slow down slope

349
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:44,079
of this line and more importantly as you

350
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:46,059
increase the Q max possible at

351
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:48,578
equilibrium you see those kinetics

352
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:50,289
increase as well right so if you have a

353
00:15:48,578 --> 00:15:52,659
higher Q Max looking at this green line

354
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:54,219
you have higher initial kinetics right

355
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:56,799
you can see that there's a much higher

356
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,300
slope initially so what I'm pointing out

357
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,758
here is that saturation deficits really

358
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:02,969
drives how well the surface can compete

359
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:05,250
for these low molecular weight molecules

360
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:08,230
and so then you can try to think about

361
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:10,509
well win might a microbe out-compete a

362
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:14,259
mineral surface for these compounds it

363
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:16,089
needs to grow right so early on kinetics

364
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:17,110
are really high if you have a high

365
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:19,629
saturation

366
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:22,329
so maybe the mineral surface can

367
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:25,240
out-compete them like if you're already

368
00:16:22,328 --> 00:16:26,588
at saturation close to it there's a

369
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,480
higher chance that the microbe can

370
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:36,639
out-compete the mineral surface to get

371
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:39,579
these you can think early on that

372
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,528
perhaps metabolism isn't as important

373
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:45,039
because the mineral is out competing the

374
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:47,649
microbes to sort whereas in these middle

375
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:50,588
phases understanding how efficiently the

376
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:52,659
microbial metabolism is processing might

377
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:54,670
increase in importance because it can

378
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:57,490
help compete the mineral surface and

379
00:16:54,669 --> 00:17:00,250
there's still some there's still some

380
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:01,870
saturation deficit left right so if it

381
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,088
does process that carbon efficiently

382
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:07,058
there's still room for that biomass to

383
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:10,328
be stored after the fact and in the last

384
00:17:07,058 --> 00:17:12,568
days you're already at Q max so if you

385
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:14,558
efficient if you metabolize the

386
00:17:12,568 --> 00:17:16,298
substrates efficiently or not

387
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:20,980
does it matter because none of its gonna

388
00:17:16,298 --> 00:17:24,849
stick pregnant in simple terms so I

389
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:27,818
think my goal moving into this into this

390
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:30,128
work was to devise model system

391
00:17:27,818 --> 00:17:32,829
experiments to tease out these different

392
00:17:30,128 --> 00:17:36,459
questions in isolation and try to use

393
00:17:32,829 --> 00:17:38,199
those results to build up to a model

394
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:46,419
soil then I can then ask these questions

395
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:50,950
in an actual soil environment so to show

396
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:53,259
you one more schematic I'm looking at

397
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:58,569
how different how efficiently different

398
00:17:53,259 --> 00:18:01,329
compounds whether the clay fraction or

399
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:02,829
the biomass and how compete which one

400
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:08,349
can win this competition for these

401
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:10,599
substrates and then lastly does the

402
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:12,759
saturation deficit so how much loading

403
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:14,980
of organic material is on this track

404
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,720
clay fraction does that influence the

405
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,179
importance of substrate use efficiency

406
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,600
in determining carbon and nitrogen

407
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:26,499
loaded on the mineral surface so for my

408
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:28,538
hypotheses I think I think that nominal

409
00:18:26,499 --> 00:18:30,579
oxidation state may be a useful tool to

410
00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:33,009
predict how efficiently these compounds

411
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:34,960
are metabolized and I think the shape of

412
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:37,179
that bell curve may change depending on

413
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,419
the phylogeny of the organism you're

414
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:41,710
talking about for uptake kinetics I

415
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:45,070
think mineral surfaces will out-compete

416
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:46,058
at higher saturation deficits so when

417
00:18:45,069 --> 00:18:48,819
they have less carbon and nitrogen

418
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:51,609
loaded on their surfaces and then lastly

419
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:53,470
I think differences in substrate use

420
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:58,240
efficiency will only be important at

421
00:18:53,470 --> 00:19:01,389
middle saturation I've talked about a

422
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,159
lot of things here in the abstract and I

423
00:19:01,388 --> 00:19:06,428
think it's important to kind of bring

424
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:07,869
this into a real contest so I'm trying

425
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:10,210
to build these model systems but I'm

426
00:19:07,868 --> 00:19:13,148
trying to build them in the context of a

427
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:14,048
soil profile so I chose a field site at

428
00:19:13,148 --> 00:19:16,359
Arnett Forest

429
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:17,730
it's a hemlock hardwood dominated course

430
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:21,329
in

431
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:22,589
with an inset the sole below it the

432
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:24,589
earthworm's haven't gotten here there's

433
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:28,139
a pretty thick Oh a horizon still and

434
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:32,309
then you have a pretty shallow a maybe

435
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:35,910
an e horizon slowly forming on top of

436
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:38,490
analytic dominated the horizon and so

437
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:41,130
this is the real-world context on

438
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:44,940
building these questions and the idea is

439
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:48,030
I'm in some way simulating the pulse of

440
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:50,070
a rainfall event so organic rich soil

441
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:51,690
solution percolating downward where you

442
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:56,909
have this competition between mineral

443
00:19:51,690 --> 00:20:00,870
surfaces and the microbial box for my

444
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:03,170
soil solution I'm making a tea if you

445
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:04,859
will from this Oh a horizon so I've

446
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:07,380
homogenized it something try to

447
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:09,479
replicate this process I shake it with

448
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,070
water for a specified period of time and

449
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,759
then I filter sequentially till it's

450
00:20:11,069 --> 00:20:17,039
sterile so I've made a undefined media

451
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:19,769
to grow microbes in and then what I've

452
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,329
tried to do it's not easy as trying to

453
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:24,240
define that in as many ways as possible

454
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:25,889
right so I can do crude measurements of

455
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,130
total carbon total nitrogen and

456
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:31,080
phosphorus measure reducing sugars amino

457
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:33,720
acids and then right now I'm using

458
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:36,769
proton NMR and HPLC mass spec to

459
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,769
quantify individual

460
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:43,029
it's not as easy as making a defined

461
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:44,920
minimal media that the moving from there

462
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:47,259
I need some microbial players to work

463
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,660
with obviously I'm not going to capture

464
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:52,109
the diversity of microbial species in

465
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:55,000
the soil but you have to start somewhere

466
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:58,000
so I've isolated species from the Oh a

467
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,980
horizon and the B horizon and then the

468
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,890
main idea here is I'm trying to separate

469
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:05,980
for fungal versus bacterial eyes it's a

470
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:08,290
crude distinction but once again I'm

471
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:11,500
trying to get physiological differences

472
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:16,269
in phylogenetic differences and so I've

473
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:17,829
isolated those on my soil extract so

474
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:19,230
I've tried to get real players that

475
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:23,379
would hopefully respond with this

476
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:27,339
percolation event so with that I've got

477
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:28,450
a a an isolate library

478
00:21:27,339 --> 00:21:31,209
I think there's around 12 of these

479
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:33,130
isolates and currently working with I

480
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,930
was really proud of those twelve

481
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,270
isolates till one day I was talking to

482
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:42,970
Roley and he was like I've got 56 or

483
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:45,819
something but I have several them I know

484
00:21:42,970 --> 00:22:00,640
are fungal and several I know are likely

485
00:21:45,819 --> 00:22:04,450
bacterial they represent a simple sugar

486
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,850
and glucose some organic acids and two

487
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:10,840
amino acids and then the goal here was

488
00:22:06,849 --> 00:22:13,119
to span that nominal oxidation state to

489
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:15,399
choose some that are more reduced on

490
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:18,309
average versus others that are more

491
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:23,980
oxidized right with formate this is

492
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:26,678
basically a co2 ready - and then from

493
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,779
mineral phase I extracted the clay

494
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,669
fraction on this the horizon

495
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:34,058
so it's analytic dominated clay fraction

496
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:36,610
and I have cleaned it with bleach which

497
00:22:34,058 --> 00:22:39,609
is apparently the least destructive way

498
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:41,048
to clean so I shake it I've shaken it

499
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:45,729
with bleach and tried to remove as much

500
00:22:41,048 --> 00:22:47,558
of that surface so now I want to walk

501
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:51,099
you through the experiment experimental

502
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:53,470
methods I'm using to determine substrate

503
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:55,149
use efficiency I'm growing different

504
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:58,539
isolates of interest in this soil

505
00:22:55,150 --> 00:23:00,370
solution I grow them to exponential

506
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:03,298
growth phase and then I can use that

507
00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:06,219
starter culture to inoculate

508
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:08,440
experimental flats and so the way I've

509
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,850
designed this is I add a low molecular

510
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,340
weight cocktail with all of my

511
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:14,740
substrates of interest and then only one

512
00:23:12,339 --> 00:23:18,730
is labeled so you can imagine in this

513
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:21,160
experiment every flask should be growing

514
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:25,150
at the same on the same trajectory and

515
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:29,860
the gross carbon nitrogen the only

516
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:32,169
difference so in a you know in a second

517
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:35,379
treatment I would have a different and

518
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:37,059
the idea here is I'm spiking around two

519
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,410
times the original concentration so I'm

520
00:23:37,058 --> 00:23:40,960
trying not to change things too

521
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:43,540
drastically and then I can measure co2

522
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,370
over the course of growth and then at

523
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:49,089
stationary phase I can filter out the

524
00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:51,759
biomass and measure total biomass as

525
00:23:49,089 --> 00:23:53,139
well as the isotope in that biomass so

526
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:58,419
that allows me to measure carbon use

527
00:23:53,140 --> 00:24:00,580
efficiency and substrate using dishes on

528
00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:02,169
top of that I'm also doing uptake

529
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:05,109
kinetics because I'm interested in how

530
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:08,890
in what substrates are being a blast

531
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:12,308
what order and at what rate so it's the

532
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:14,590
same design but there is no label added

533
00:24:12,308 --> 00:24:16,329
and then I'm destructively harvesting at

534
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:18,279
different points along the growth curve

535
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:22,869
so then I can look at uptake from the

536
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:25,480
extracellular solution for the mineral

537
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:28,239
I'm doing batch kinetic studies as well

538
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,980
as batch equilibrium studies hopefully

539
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,200
producing data similar to that of mics

540
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:35,200
that I showed you so the goal here is to

541
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:38,230
look at the kinetics of total carbon and

542
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,960
nitrogen sorption from solution as well

543
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:42,970
as looking at looking at that data in

544
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,210
terms of individual compounds so here's

545
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:50,069
where I can look at competition between

546
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:52,539
microbial uptake in mineral sorption

547
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:56,500
so here's a picture of this clean clay

548
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:59,909
and the idea is from the batch sorption

549
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:03,359
experiments I can look at saturation

550
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:06,040
behavior at different soil solution

551
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:07,569
concentrations at equilibrium so then I

552
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:10,389
can also determine for this third

553
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:13,960
experiment how to load that clay out to

554
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:16,480
different saturation deficits so for the

555
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,340
final portion of this project the goal

556
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,140
is to take the data from the first two

557
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:25,029
experiments and see if I can replicate

558
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:28,059
that in a real soil so when I'm using

559
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:29,678
real Lucy I'm mixing that clay fraction

560
00:25:28,058 --> 00:25:33,190
which I will load up to different

561
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,110
saturation deficits with clean sands and

562
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:38,170
then I'm spiking in that soil extract

563
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:40,569
along with my isolate of choice and

564
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:43,360
different substrate treatments and so

565
00:25:40,569 --> 00:25:45,308
the goal here is to see okay I have two

566
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:47,558
substrates that are used with vastly

567
00:25:45,308 --> 00:25:50,170
different efficiencies does that matter

568
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:51,639
in a real soil environment does that

569
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:53,769
impact the amount of carbon nitrogen

570
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:57,250
that is retained by the mineral fraction

571
00:25:53,769 --> 00:26:03,460
and does mineral surface loading impact

572
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:04,829
that process either so for this portion

573
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:09,058
I want to show you some data from

574
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:09,058
genetic experiments I've been conducting

575
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:13,599
so to do these experiments I chose one

576
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:17,259
isolate of interest

577
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:19,058
it's just be one in and that just means

578
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:22,599
it was isolated from the B horizon on

579
00:26:19,058 --> 00:26:25,899
just soil extract it's a so

580
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:28,269
bacillus organism and I chose it simply

581
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:31,920
because it produces the most biomass so

582
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:31,920
I figured it was a good place to start

583
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:36,180
and so to refresh your memory I'm

584
00:26:34,349 --> 00:26:38,879
growing this overnight in a starter

585
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:40,470
culture and then sampling along the

586
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,220
growth curve and then I'm measuring

587
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:46,440
carbon and nitrogen before filtering and

588
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,299
after filtering so that allows me to

589
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,400
estimate carbon and nitrogen in the

590
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:53,659
biomass and then on the filtered

591
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,640
solution which is the extracellular

592
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:59,580
material I'm looking at carbon nitrogen

593
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:03,960
nitrogen speciation as well as different

594
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:06,389
substrates using these methods so this

595
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:11,190
is the growth curve I'm showing time and

596
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:12,240
hours versus optical density and so like

597
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,250
you may have learned an intro

598
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,250
microbiology you can measure growth just

599
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:19,920
by measuring changes in humidity and you

600
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,839
see a nice growth curve I haven't shown

601
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,160
the fit past stationary phase so you'll

602
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,109
just have to take my word for it but

603
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:28,529
stationary phase is around point two in

604
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:30,359
this soil extract and I've tried to hit

605
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:35,579
different points of this exponential

606
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:37,949
growth so anyone in the room who's upset

607
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:39,569
I'm showing this as optical density 600

608
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,789
I'm just showing you with my different

609
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:45,990
measurements I can easily convert that

610
00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:47,700
number to biomass so I have a linear

611
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:50,069
relationship with total biomass being

612
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,920
abused as well as carbon and nitrogen in

613
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:58,039
that biomass or a more traditional assay

614
00:27:52,920 --> 00:28:01,140
approach so now I want to talk about

615
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:03,750
solution dynamics I will start with

616
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:07,500
nitrogen so I'm nitrogen in milligrams

617
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:10,619
per liter versus time in the blue we

618
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:13,890
have total nitrogen so this is outside

619
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:15,449
of the cells we're starting at around 12

620
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:17,910
milligrams per liter of nitrogen and

621
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:19,650
then you see an uptake or loss of

622
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:22,110
nitrogen from outside the cell its

623
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:23,940
growth and so I haven't shown a mass

624
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:27,839
balance but there's no loss of nitrogen

625
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:29,759
from the system so this uptake is or

626
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,980
this loss from solution is uptaken

627
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:35,129
system and you see that looking at

628
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:37,799
biomass nitrogen in the red you can see

629
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:40,170
all that nitrogen loss from solution is

630
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:42,178
ending up in the biomass and by the end

631
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:44,370
of growth you have about equal amounts

632
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:47,100
of nitrogen in the cell

633
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:50,849
nothing surprising here and then I'm

634
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:54,359
showing loss of amino acids as well as

635
00:28:50,849 --> 00:28:56,009
ammonium during growth so to start with

636
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:58,229
we know this microbes growing it's

637
00:28:56,009 --> 00:29:02,400
consuming amino acids in ammonium as it

638
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:04,589
grows if we look at carbon same thing

639
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,450
we're looking at extracellular carbon in

640
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:09,869
the blue so in milligrams per liter

641
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:12,480
about 185 to begin with we see loss of

642
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:15,599
carbon from solution that's as it's

643
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:19,529
taken up in the biomass in red I can

644
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:21,839
calculate co2 produced by difference and

645
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:24,779
then also just at the crudest level I

646
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:26,699
can see I'm losing reducing sugars once

647
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:31,259
again not surprising this microbe is

648
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:33,029
growing on sugars in this soils so

649
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:35,308
here's where it gets interesting I can

650
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:37,170
then take these samples into proton NMR

651
00:29:35,308 --> 00:29:41,910
on them to try to get compound specific

652
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:45,509
information and so this is a method

653
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:47,220
that's being used quite a lot in minimal

654
00:29:45,509 --> 00:29:48,990
media work where you have higher

655
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,808
concentrations it's a little easier to

656
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:54,480
do or in medical applications or

657
00:29:51,808 --> 00:29:56,299
engineering work I've seen it with like

658
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,110
biofuel research trying to figure out

659
00:29:56,299 --> 00:30:01,159
metabolic pathways so

660
00:30:00,109 --> 00:30:03,079
have to do is I have to take this soil

661
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,420
extract you can concentrate at 30 full

662
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:08,569
because I'm right at the detection limit

663
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:11,019
so and then I get this spectrum so I'm

664
00:30:08,569 --> 00:30:14,309
showing chemical shift here on the X

665
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:16,259
intensity is arbitrary here

666
00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:18,240
and I got this data from the Cornell

667
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:19,650
chemistry unit and I was very excited

668
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,599
about it and they thought it was the

669
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:26,519
worst section but the goal here is I can

670
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:28,889
choose Peaks that are not overlapping

671
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:30,599
with other compounds and then I can

672
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:33,390
integrate them and compare them to a

673
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:34,859
standard to quantify them and so the

674
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:36,780
real beauty of NMR is I don't need a

675
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:41,609
standard for every compounds I can use

676
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:43,799
one in terms any compound so I've shown

677
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:46,859
you some you know I don't know what this

678
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:49,200
aromatic compound is I there's a bunch

679
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:52,139
of sugars here some amino acids organic

680
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,080
acids and then I can look at that

681
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:56,550
through time and you can see you can't

682
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:58,470
see the peaks very well here but you can

683
00:30:56,549 --> 00:31:00,750
see it the depletion and all the peaks

684
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:04,130
and so I can choose individual compounds

685
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:04,130
and look at that depletion

686
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:11,028
show you my best example right so this

687
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:13,579
is my one of my glucose seats it's for

688
00:31:11,028 --> 00:31:16,278
alpha glucose so if we look at the

689
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:19,970
glucose molecule we get a proton NMR

690
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:21,829
signal from this behind a proton on the

691
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:27,110
fine group right here the number two

692
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:29,720
carbon and that's a doublet and as you

693
00:31:27,109 --> 00:31:31,519
can see the initial soil solution is

694
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,190
this dark line and what time the line

695
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,339
gets lighter and we see a loss of that

696
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:40,129
sugar from solution so I can integrate

697
00:31:36,339 --> 00:31:42,500
this area and quantify that out into

698
00:31:40,128 --> 00:31:46,428
micro moles of glucose and you see this

699
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:48,019
nice sigmoidal uptake curve and so

700
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:50,090
that's a good start right that matches

701
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:52,069
with my expectations and then not only

702
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:54,500
that it's in the right magnitude so I'm

703
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:56,990
looks like I'm probably doing this right

704
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:59,240
right so the red curve is total reducing

705
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:02,028
sugar so that's multiple triggers and

706
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,548
this is just my glucose peak and I

707
00:32:02,028 --> 00:32:07,278
should say this flucos piece is peak is

708
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:11,418
the is the alpha glucose plus the beta

709
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:13,190
glucose so that's one example and then

710
00:32:11,419 --> 00:32:16,100
where this gets even more interesting is

711
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:19,700
I can fit that sigmoid 'el uptake using

712
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:22,158
a four-point sigmoidal curve and so I

713
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,720
can extract a t-50 value so that's the

714
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:28,159
point at which half of that compound is

715
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:30,919
being Absolution and then also I can get

716
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:33,019
a usage width and then I can convert

717
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:37,059
that to whatever I'd like but what I

718
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:39,649
like to show is 90% and 10% of compounds

719
00:32:37,058 --> 00:32:42,339
so here's an example for ammonium right

720
00:32:39,648 --> 00:32:49,008
I can pull out a t-50 value and again

721
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:50,869
Cheers so what gets interesting is I can

722
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:52,669
then overlay that on the growth curve

723
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:55,038
and start to think about in what order

724
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:57,980
are associates being used by this

725
00:32:55,038 --> 00:33:00,259
microbe and so here are some early

726
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:02,808
examples from this NMR work where I can

727
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:06,620
see that baylene and threonine are being

728
00:33:02,808 --> 00:33:08,450
used much earlier than glucose glucose

729
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:09,949
is being used later than the average of

730
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:12,860
all the sugars so there are some sugar

731
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:14,840
is being used earlier than glucose and

732
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:18,979
then what gets interesting and this is

733
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:20,599
maybe an aside for my main questions is

734
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,639
also intrigue to think about can we

735
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:25,339
predict substrate use efficiency just by

736
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:27,019
where it is used in the growth curve so

737
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:29,480
we look at the same experiment I can

738
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:32,620
calculate carbon use efficiency shown

739
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:35,089
here on the on the y axis with time and

740
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:37,129
you see an increase in carbon in

741
00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:39,859
cumulative carbon use efficiency with

742
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:41,990
growth so this microbe by stationary

743
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:44,058
phase to use the carbon with about 40

744
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:46,490
percent efficiency but if I calculate

745
00:33:44,058 --> 00:33:48,379
the instant power use efficiency over

746
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:50,450
these intervals you see that looks

747
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:52,639
somewhat like maybe a bell curve right

748
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:53,960
so there's this idea that maybe the

749
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:55,729
compounds being used right at the

750
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,798
inflection of growth are being used most

751
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:59,569
efficient which gets interesting because

752
00:33:57,798 --> 00:34:01,278
that means I should be able to predict

753
00:33:59,569 --> 00:34:05,178
the substrate use efficiency just might

754
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:08,750
be what order those compounds so that's

755
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:12,039
a little is another question from

756
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:14,599
thinking about so moving forward I'm

757
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:17,269
conducting this similar experiments for

758
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:18,829
my fungal isolates I'm conducting the

759
00:34:17,269 --> 00:34:21,559
isotope work right now with the

760
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:23,440
different substrates and then using this

761
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:28,338
data to hopefully build up to that final

762
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:30,409
model soil so the outcomes of this work

763
00:34:28,338 --> 00:34:32,960
is to test the role of phylogeny and

764
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:35,030
carbon you sufficiency test the

765
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,099
predictive power of nominal oxidation

766
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,530
state or predicting substrate use

767
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:42,139
efficiency and then also testing the

768
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:44,089
impact of saturation deficit on the

769
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:46,309
formation rate of these mineral organic

770
00:34:44,088 --> 00:34:48,168
associations so I think all of that

771
00:34:46,309 --> 00:34:49,878
summed up is when is microbial

772
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:53,108
metabolism important for the formation

773
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:56,269
of these mineral organic associations

774
00:34:53,108 --> 00:34:57,619
and then lastly there's some hope that

775
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:59,869
this may provide some guidance to

776
00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:02,599
modelers none of these parameters would

777
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:04,818
be directly usable by a model but it may

778
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:06,559
give some guidance on the magnitudes of

779
00:35:04,818 --> 00:35:08,989
these parameters and the relationships

780
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:10,969
and some of you are thinking that's

781
00:35:08,989 --> 00:35:14,029
crazy who models at this scale and

782
00:35:10,969 --> 00:35:16,459
people do this is a model from do-e

783
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,800
where they're explicitly trying to build

784
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,590
in

785
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:23,380
fungal versus more heterotrophic aerobic

786
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:27,070
bacteria and modeling specific compound

787
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:29,230
classes so I think my interest is to so

788
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:30,910
look at this scale I question that this

789
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:32,380
scale and try to provide parameters

790
00:35:30,909 --> 00:35:35,019
towards those who are thinking at this

791
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:38,890
scale so with that I'd like to

792
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:41,500
acknowledge you guys for bearing with my

793
00:35:38,889 --> 00:35:43,809
lab group in a marked facility the

794
00:35:41,500 --> 00:36:05,889
Buckley lab and my funding sources so

795
00:35:43,809 --> 00:36:10,690
thank you very much yes I would very

796
00:36:05,889 --> 00:36:39,400
much like uh I would hopefully do 16s or

797
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:40,929
18s I don't know physically how I when

798
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,910
you have your framework those sort of

799
00:36:40,929 --> 00:36:45,519
more oxidized or more of these compounds

800
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:47,079
and sort of your hypothesis is based

801
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:49,210
you know the metabolism and the

802
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:51,159
efficiencies can change occupations and

803
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:53,230
then you're kind of setting up the

804
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:55,210
experiment to prove that by having

805
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,679
different substrates right or at least

806
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:58,510
to see you know season matches

807
00:36:56,679 --> 00:37:00,789
expectations but if you took a different

808
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:03,190
approach and tried about falsify it by

809
00:37:00,789 --> 00:37:05,469
doing something like having a molecule

810
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:07,210
that the organisms might have different

811
00:37:05,469 --> 00:37:09,039
efficiency for but maybe

812
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:11,380
oxidation-reduction doesn't change like

813
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:13,559
glucose and cellulose right nd the

814
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:17,230
oxidation reduction is the same but the

815
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:18,849
microbes ability to encounter that and

816
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:22,030
use it is going to be dramatically

817
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:23,860
different so if if you found very

818
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:29,019
different carbon use efficiency on

819
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:31,180
glucose versus cellulose with that no I

820
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:33,900
think it would just

821
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:33,899
let me try to

822
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:44,859
so first of all that's a good point

823
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,010
and I think you see that in some of the

824
00:37:44,858 --> 00:37:50,348
data we are so if you look closer to

825
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:51,910
microbial biomass you see there's a

826
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:56,200
bigger range right and that's some of

827
00:37:51,909 --> 00:37:58,809
those compounds you're mentioning so no

828
00:37:56,199 --> 00:38:00,608
I think I don't think that falsifies I

829
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:03,309
mean you're looking for a predictive

830
00:38:00,608 --> 00:38:05,710
proxy that may not work in all cases but

831
00:38:03,309 --> 00:38:07,869
I'm looking for a general trend of can

832
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:10,659
this be used and some kind of modeling

833
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:12,280
framework right so no I think I would

834
00:38:10,659 --> 00:38:21,819
just say that things are not as simple

835
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:23,920
as this obviously so when you so

836
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:25,809
company's efficiency can be problematic

837
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,150
and I think the issue that problematic

838
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:30,099
is the timeframe at which you assess it

839
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:32,019
you know so if you assess it in a very

840
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:34,390
short window you're measuring one comma

841
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:36,219
and if you measured it in a longer

842
00:38:34,389 --> 00:38:38,858
window of time for a very long period of

843
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:40,209
time but you're actually measuring is

844
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:42,730
cheating quite a bit whether its

845
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:45,789
physiology or interaction cells were

846
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:47,769
actually ecological interactions you're

847
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:50,289
measuring it at a really short timeframe

848
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:53,380
I think it's really neat but my question

849
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:54,880
was this so so if you had so your

850
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:56,800
expectation is you've got these

851
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,539
equilibrium processes you're eating the

852
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,390
substrate you're converting it into co2

853
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:04,599
and biomass so what if you violated that

854
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:06,730
assumption so what if your amino acids

855
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:08,650
are going directly in the protein right

856
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:11,588
they're not going in the co2 they're not

857
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:13,510
being used to make ATP what if the

858
00:39:11,588 --> 00:39:16,119
glucose is going directly into a storage

859
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:17,890
product it's not going the co2 it's

860
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:19,829
actually consuming ATP and then maybe

861
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:22,239
this great product being used later on

862
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:23,619
so since you're doubling time is four

863
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:26,529
hours you're measuring these things

864
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:28,990
scale of hours you know might you be

865
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:31,240
having differences in efficiency because

866
00:39:28,989 --> 00:39:33,069
you know the cell is using these amino

867
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:34,868
acids just to make protein or it

868
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:37,539
speaking sporadic how might that affect

869
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:39,369
your results so I think what you're

870
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:41,320
describing is trying to redo the

871
00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:43,000
experiment but spiking at different

872
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:46,000
points in the growth curve is that well

873
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,920
you're seeing carbon use efficiency airy

874
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,230
and you're kind of saying

875
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,480
well you know maybe they're growing more

876
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:54,460
efficiently on this substrate versus

877
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,750
that substrate and maybe it's not that

878
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,358
they're growing more efficiently it's

879
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:59,769
maybe they're storing more carbon and

880
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:02,338
disappointment that one it's not about

881
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:04,630
efficiency so much as it's just these

882
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:06,969
reproductive choices in the cell you

883
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:09,338
know instead of doing balance growth I'm

884
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:12,519
actually making more storage products at

885
00:40:09,338 --> 00:40:13,838
this point and I'm not and because

886
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:16,659
you're looking at this carbon ease

887
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:18,489
efficiency at a very granular measure

888
00:40:16,659 --> 00:40:19,960
you know it looks like though the

889
00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:22,808
company's efficiency is going up and

890
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:26,858
down but in reality you just have non

891
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:28,720
equilibrium processes happening I think

892
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:31,539
I follow you I just don't know how I

893
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:35,709
would try to think of how to probe that

894
00:40:31,539 --> 00:40:37,869
experie what I mean

895
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:40,030
I guess in my millennial you mean -

896
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:41,559
simulate this pulse of it right so you

897
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:43,599
you know you might think why don't you

898
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:46,240
do this and chemostat setting and the

899
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,798
ideas that's not how things tend to work

900
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:49,838
right you have this pulse event and then

901
00:40:47,798 --> 00:40:51,190
you have rapid growth because wow

902
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:53,108
there's all these substrates available

903
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:54,579
all of a sudden so in some sense that's

904
00:40:53,108 --> 00:40:56,170
what I'm trying to mimic and I guess

905
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:58,119
maybe maybe even test it with a more

906
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:01,809
defined medium instead of a soil extract

907
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:03,599
so you grow them on glucose amino acids

908
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:05,829
and if you have a systematic difference

909
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:11,769
with one versus the other than it's

910
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:13,329
telling you that oh okay I see what

911
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:25,869
you're saying I think there is some

912
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:31,089
evidence looking at single you've got a

913
00:41:25,869 --> 00:41:32,440
storage pool within the microbes so you

914
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:36,150
might also be able to do some other

915
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:38,289
experiments and just some kind of

916
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:39,548
input-output modeling right you might be

917
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:41,469
able to estimate the size of that

918
00:41:39,548 --> 00:41:44,108
storage pool or measure it in some way

919
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:45,969
so you can actually answer it well yeah

920
00:41:44,108 --> 00:41:50,889
this might be happening but it's only 5%

921
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:53,348
you know or yeah this could be 90% get

922
00:41:50,889 --> 00:41:55,598
it some idea that's what it is sort of

923
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:58,329
saying instead of like this instead of a

924
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,250
straight line it's like this you know

925
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:01,269
where if you average it looks like a

926
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:04,179
straight line but there

927
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:06,130
really granular level in stepwise and so

928
00:42:04,179 --> 00:42:07,719
depending on where you if you sampled at

929
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:10,240
this point versus this point it might be

930
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:18,699
low or high present example at a really

931
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:21,039
poor scale if you wanna use mineral

932
00:42:18,699 --> 00:42:24,609
weird an exaggeration model if you know

933
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:27,429
you've brought up some up up yet another

934
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:32,099
account where it's working space that

935
00:42:27,429 --> 00:42:32,099
will be occupied by my back to my school

936
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:43,260
so looking at this model I'll pull it up

937
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:57,269
so this model it's not even they haven't

938
00:42:51,519 --> 00:43:00,420
even put the minerals on the where it is

939
00:42:57,269 --> 00:43:04,360
but it's in there and all they have

940
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:07,119
think it's it's it's initialize based on

941
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:08,470
the amount of clay in the soil and then

942
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:21,309
they just have a forward and backward

943
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:22,869
rate there's no modeling excites no so

944
00:43:21,309 --> 00:43:26,500
at this point I'm thinking about this

945
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:27,849
more I'm not even bringing in I'm just

946
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,159
thinking if you thought about these as

947
00:43:27,849 --> 00:43:32,679
separate players in the system thought

948
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,779
about competition so there's all also

949
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:36,219
these other concepts where just because

950
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:38,140
something sorb doesn't mean a microbe

951
00:43:36,219 --> 00:43:40,000
can't kick it off by exerting another

952
00:43:38,139 --> 00:43:41,889
compound right like exerting a phosphate

953
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,570
rich compound that could in these are

954
00:43:41,889 --> 00:44:04,329
back compound and allow that substrate

955
00:43:43,570 --> 00:44:06,809
to be utilized yes I would say so any

956
00:44:04,329 --> 00:44:06,809
other question
