1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:14,669
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:18,660
University why don't to thank all the

3
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:21,329
graduate students as well it's been fun

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,420
for me so far I think I was placed

5
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:25,889
appropriately an order of speakers I

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:29,070
learned a lot just listening before my

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,570
presentation so today I want to talk to

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,379
you a little bit about the lay Institute

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,109
where I work

10
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:37,679
I said Institute that's founded about 40

11
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:39,899
years ago with with a certain set of

12
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,628
uncommon problems or uncommon goals in

13
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,549
mind and I'd like to begin with a quote

14
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:46,829
from the founder of the Institute West

15
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:48,509
Jackson and West says that it's

16
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,429
impossible for us to operate in our

17
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:52,198
daily lives and not create the world

18
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:54,600
that everyone must live in what we

19
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:56,399
desire arranges the genetic code in all

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,050
of our major crops and livestock we

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,509
cannot avoid participating in the

22
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:02,369
creation and it is in agriculture far

23
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:05,069
and away our largest and most basic

24
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:08,368
artifact that human culture and the

25
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:11,339
creation totally interpenetrate and this

26
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:14,188
is very real very obvious as we look at

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,100
how humans have changed the landscape of

28
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:18,779
the world today if we look you know in

29
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:22,199
the mountains of China where we have

30
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,769
paddy rice systems in terraces or Greg

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,540
County Kansas the Candice Nebraska

32
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:29,789
irrigated agriculture areas or places

33
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,040
like I was in January ty Bay Palestine

34
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,618
where through agriculture over thousands

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,390
of years we've eroded away the soil that

36
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,909
was there to a point where not only can

37
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,000
we not do agriculture in here anymore

38
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,340
but the ecosystems that preceded them

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,688
the oak savannas that were there before

40
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,990
cannot reestablishing that for hundreds

41
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,989
of years

42
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:52,569
and so what we've done through

43
00:01:50,828 --> 00:01:54,819
domestication in the technologies that

44
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:57,489
we've developed to create the

45
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:59,828
agriculture that we have today is fairly

46
00:01:57,489 --> 00:02:01,539
amazing and if we look at a map of the

47
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:04,118
amount of human appropriation of net

48
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:06,670
primary productivity around the world we

49
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:08,348
see that many of the areas we think of

50
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:11,709
as being very productive

51
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:14,949
we're appropriating up between 60 and 80

52
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:16,030
percent of the biomass the net primary

53
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:18,189
productivity that would have been there

54
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,110
before agriculture so we're in the 80%

55
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:23,829
range of the ecosystems that we were

56
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:25,930
replacing with and that's that's pretty

57
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:29,549
amazing when we think about what the

58
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,549
crops that we've domesticated started as

59
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,780
but the way that we're growing those

60
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,959
cups crops has problems so if we think

61
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,400
about how our crops are grown they're

62
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,329
grown in these systems that require

63
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:47,140
continual disturbance they're kept at a

64
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:50,170
ecosystem level that's early in the

65
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:51,988
successional gradient right so we never

66
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:55,030
allow ourselves to develop these systems

67
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:58,209
to retain nutrients and as a result we

68
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:00,519
have leaky agro ecosystems and so we see

69
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:02,859
that in our cropping systems we have

70
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:04,209
losses of biodiversity from those

71
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:06,969
landscapes in those systems we have

72
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:09,069
losses of soil resources from those

73
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:13,180
systems and we continue to lose

74
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:17,979
nutrients through volatilization through

75
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:19,810
leaching through runoff and etc and this

76
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:22,179
is ultimately an inefficient try this is

77
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,379
keeping our net priority down and to

78
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,090
maintain the net primary productivity

79
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:29,549
those systems we have to supplement

80
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,549
those ecosystems with continuous inputs

81
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:36,010
so just a like look at biodiversity loss

82
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:39,159
this is a this is a map of the United

83
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:41,199
States showing the counties in the US

84
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:43,030
every county that has a color at least

85
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:46,269
20% of the cropland in that county is

86
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:48,520
devoted to crop production

87
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,650
and you know we look around it big

88
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,240
portions of the US we have a small

89
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,760
effective crop number meaning you know

90
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:57,040
on 20% of the landscape just maybe only

91
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:59,289
three four maybe only one or two species

92
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,459
that are making up you know that are

93
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:03,099
thinking of the surface area of their

94
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:05,230
landscape I'm from Nebraska and my

95
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:07,449
family farms and York County Nebraska

96
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:09,269
and this is very interesting mean

97
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:11,679
somehow there's like three to four

98
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:13,570
effective crop species on the landscape

99
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,760
but out of the three hundred sixty-six

100
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:19,139
thousand acres that are there 84% of

101
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:23,019
them were voted to crop production and

102
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,939
you know eighty to eighty two and a half

103
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:27,310
percent are devoted to just two crops

104
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:28,689
corn and soybean production and we think

105
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,939
about okay what's happening on those

106
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:32,529
other 16 percent of the acres well you

107
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:36,149
know there's a couple of towns there's a

108
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:39,579
lot of roads we have a golf course

109
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:43,239
there's a few parks and that's that's

110
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:45,219
about it and I think it's really easy

111
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,870
for us to be desensitized to those

112
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,010
environments that's normal for me and I

113
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,040
was talking with some of the other

114
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:53,050
speakers I flew into Detroit on my

115
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,730
commute here you know I always look out

116
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,650
the window and I see an ad here and I

117
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,509
see a quarter section here and it's

118
00:04:56,649 --> 00:05:00,759
normally you know perfect grid square

119
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:03,159
line and it was really interesting

120
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:05,500
flying into Michigan where you still see

121
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,570
the sections but there was like the back

122
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,339
40 or a 20 that was devoted to timber

123
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:12,699
still um it was something that was a

124
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:14,529
part of that culture I guess that was

125
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:16,529
there before that's not a part of mine I

126
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:21,008
haven't seen something like that and

127
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:23,739
where I'm from you

128
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:25,059
the thing that is is really important to

129
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,150
remember is that we're losing a lot of

130
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:30,490
soil from our our agro ecosystems we

131
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:32,019
look at a natural ecosystem there is

132
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,869
soil formation right we have better

133
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:36,848
Genesis we're building soil through rock

134
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:40,029
weathering really really slow you know a

135
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:41,438
thousandth of a millimeter per year for

136
00:05:40,028 --> 00:05:43,209
developing new technologies and new

137
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,309
techniques to do agriculture better and

138
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:48,519
one of those is no-till agriculture

139
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:51,610
or still having net losses of soil on an

140
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:53,558
annual basis and a small percentage of

141
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,050
our agriculture is devoted to no-till we

142
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:58,149
have about 5% notes so in the u.s. right

143
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,930
now the majority that our culture is

144
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:04,569
still plowed we're losing up just up to

145
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:06,610
you know one and a half millimeters of

146
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:07,809
soil per year from those landscapes and

147
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:11,408
if we think about now what does

148
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:13,930
sustainability mean you don't have soil

149
00:06:11,408 --> 00:06:16,538
left to do agriculture where's that

150
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,098
where is that food going to come from so

151
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:20,348
you know we can look at soil losses

152
00:06:18,098 --> 00:06:22,509
around the world in 2012

153
00:06:20,348 --> 00:06:24,819
most of our most productive areas are

154
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:27,189
still losing you know enormous amounts

155
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:29,699
of soil look at you know here's the Iowa

156
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:32,319
Illinois region we're losing five to ten

157
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:36,430
five to ten metric tons per hectare of

158
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:40,059
soil think about you know the volume of

159
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:44,348
soil that that is and where is it going

160
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:47,229
right the other thing that we've lost

161
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:49,149
from most of the soils is the organic

162
00:06:47,228 --> 00:06:52,329
matter that was there we lost lose it a

163
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:54,430
co2 through respiration and oxidation of

164
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:56,258
the soil organic content and so this is

165
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,120
a map I farmed a little bit my

166
00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:00,968
cousin-in-law in Kansas now and this is

167
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,550
a map of one of our fields and you can

168
00:07:00,968 --> 00:07:05,139
see here really clearly so my

169
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,269
cousin-in-law took the field over about

170
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:09,129
eight years ago all the stuff that's

171
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:11,110
yellow and green this was native

172
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:13,180
pastures it hadn't been tilled in anyone

173
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,129
that could remember his lifetime so we

174
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,348
have strong organic levels that are in

175
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:20,139
the you know threes fours fives and even

176
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:21,998
sixes there's areas that are red those

177
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:24,509
have been farmed continuously for the

178
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:26,528
last you know unknown number of decades

179
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:28,809
and this is pretty typical I mean look

180
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:30,848
at our in the world just 30 40 years of

181
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:32,889
tillage we reduced the soil organic

182
00:07:30,848 --> 00:07:34,500
matter that was there by you know 30

183
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:36,840
percent that's a 50 or 60 percent

184
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,069
depending where we are at so organic

185
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:39,689
matter is very important right that's

186
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:41,639
our nutrient storage system is how we

187
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:42,899
store the water that our crops need

188
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,889
that's how we store the nitrogen that

189
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:46,099
our crops mean that's where the

190
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:48,680
phosphorus is that's where everything is

191
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,760
and when we lose them when we have sand

192
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,019
it's even more important for us to

193
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,939
continue adding inputs to the system

194
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:58,769
every year to maintain the fertility and

195
00:07:53,939 --> 00:08:01,170
the productivity of those systems not to

196
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:02,729
mention the co2 that we're losing right

197
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,759
some of that co2 that's in the organic

198
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:08,490
matter is old prime that primary from

199
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:13,680
how many years ago we were unsure and so

200
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:15,360
um the other thing that we lose often is

201
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,370
our nitrogen and our phosphorus losses

202
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,100
so most of our phosphorus losses right

203
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,750
that's imported phosphorus that's an

204
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,290
omen or that's rock phosphate that's

205
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,689
mine

206
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:28,500
from around the world and nitrogen is

207
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:30,300
the same way we know that this has major

208
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,120
consequences and you know these aren't

209
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,070
just some unique outcome of Agriculture

210
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,080
these are predictable consequences of an

211
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,580
agriculture practice in the way that

212
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,650
we're doing in my keeping or a Greek

213
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:44,099
assistance at this early stage secondary

214
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:45,959
succession so now we have hypoxic areas

215
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:48,330
around the world dead zones around the

216
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,920
world we have you know the largest dead

217
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:55,379
zone in the world this year 20,000

218
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:56,789
hectares annually in size and we're not

219
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:58,019
doing that much to address this issue

220
00:08:56,789 --> 00:09:00,360
we're projected that we're going to

221
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:04,949
continue increasing our nitrogen inputs

222
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,330
annually you know we 2% of the world's

223
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,339
energy every year goes to creating

224
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:11,339
synthetic nitrogen it's a huge reason

225
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:14,310
why we're all here is because of that

226
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:16,200
unique invention but we're we have not

227
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:18,119
really improved our nitrogen use

228
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:22,110
efficiency very much in the u.s. now

229
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,460
we're in the 60% range but globally our

230
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,250
global average is about 42 percent

231
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,350
nitrogen use efficiency so 1% of the

232
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,600
world's energy is creating nitrogen

233
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,790
that's not used it's running off and

234
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,490
leaving the system house whereas I just

235
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:37,169
oxide emissions a potent greenhouse gas

236
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:41,509
or as nitrate leaching into groundwater

237
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:45,870
supplies or runoff into into our

238
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:47,549
bring ecosystems so really you know as a

239
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,769
consequence of agriculture and human

240
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:52,189
activity in general we're beginning to

241
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:54,779
cross these planetary bound but

242
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:57,510
boundaries humans are now you know the

243
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:59,519
the biggest determining factor of

244
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:02,129
climate and environmental effects and

245
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,829
that's a unique time in history you know

246
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:07,049
that one species is controlling so many

247
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,550
things and so if we look at what kind of

248
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:10,409
boundaries we've already crossed you

249
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:12,329
know we've already crossed about four we

250
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:14,549
know that our climate is increasing at a

251
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,830
rate that we have uncertainty about what

252
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:18,839
the risks of that are going to be some

253
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:21,300
things like genetic diversity loss and

254
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,889
land system change from a forest

255
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:24,419
ecosystem that's holding the carbon in

256
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:26,939
place and the nutrients in place to our

257
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:29,399
cropping system they've also crossed

258
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,230
these boundaries and what's very

259
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,000
interesting to me you know we have

260
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,789
really disrupted these biogeochemical

261
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,320
flows through our nitrogen and

262
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:42,349
phosphorus fertilizer inputs and you

263
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,810
know we have UN agencies and

264
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:47,250
international agreements about things

265
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:49,199
like climate change and what

266
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,149
temperature's you want to talk be it but

267
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,340
we haven't really addressed this issue

268
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:54,720
you don't have an international agency

269
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,330
or agreed-upon

270
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,800
you know levels of inputs we're just

271
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,629
continue to project with we haven't

272
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,159
really used nitrogen on the whole

273
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:05,490
African continent and that's a place

274
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,230
where we imagine right now they're in

275
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,870
the 80s for nitrogen use efficiency but

276
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,460
as soon as they begin really applying it

277
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,580
we imagine that efficiency is going to

278
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:19,920
go way down and so you know when we talk

279
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:21,960
about you know uncommon uncommon common

280
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,569
plants for uncommon goals so uncommon

281
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,780
goals of plant breeding a barb plant

282
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:30,540
science of our research you know these

283
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:32,189
are still pretty uncommon goals in or at

284
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:34,559
a time in history where they need to

285
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:36,990
become our common goals all of us need

286
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,000
to be thinking about things as a

287
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:41,190
graduate student but where is your crop

288
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,960
bone what soil type is it growing on

289
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,700
what's the vulnerability of that soil

290
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:48,050
what do we have to do to maintain the

291
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:50,430
fertility of those soils I think it's

292
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:53,250
very important for us to consider in the

293
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:54,419
future and you know more importantly how

294
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,899
are we going to address these issues

295
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:56,909
what can we

296
00:11:54,899 --> 00:12:00,269
changing our crops and so the land

297
00:11:56,909 --> 00:12:01,708
institute West Jackson once again you

298
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:03,959
know this is what he says

299
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:05,748
so since nature as the most sustainable

300
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:08,219
ecosystem and since ultimately

301
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:09,930
agriculture comes out of nature our

302
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:15,809
standard for a sustainable world to

303
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:18,169
denature zone ecosystem so let's look at

304
00:12:15,808 --> 00:12:21,539
some ecosystems that have reached this

305
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:24,928
later term secondary succession where we

306
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:27,208
have proper earth systems we have the

307
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:29,249
nitrogen cycle that's functioning we're

308
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,868
retaining your traditional system and

309
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,220
what do we notice about those you know

310
00:12:30,869 --> 00:12:34,649
whether it's the Prairie whether it's a

311
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,720
tropical rainforest or savanna or even

312
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:39,539
coastal wetlands and Tyga's and Tundras

313
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,670
all of these ecosystems are composed of

314
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:43,948
you know really noticeable things one

315
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:45,808
they all are predominantly made of part

316
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:49,078
of perennial crop perennial species

317
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:51,509
perennial plant species and - it's never

318
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:53,039
just a single species there's some

319
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:54,839
species might be more dominant in the

320
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:59,039
goose ISM and others but there's always

321
00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:02,509
diversity in those systems so this is

322
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:04,498
becoming the goal of our organization

323
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:06,509
when we look at a natural ecosystem

324
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:08,639
right because we're pretty long height

325
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:10,289
and high diversity we have soil

326
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,928
formation happening we have increased

327
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:15,629
soil organic matter we're retaining

328
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:18,178
nutrients in the system we have a

329
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:20,850
habitat that allows for a functional

330
00:13:18,178 --> 00:13:22,230
soft soil microbiome to develop and we

331
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,999
actually have water infiltration we

332
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,350
don't have Rock like in Palestine where

333
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:26,999
the water just lands on the rock and

334
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,350
runs on the hill we're using the

335
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:30,269
nutrients they're landing on that

336
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,550
constitute and we will look at our

337
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:35,308
entire ecosystems you know they're

338
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:37,258
characterized by annuals crops low

339
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:39,298
diversity we have soil erosion we have

340
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:40,709
reductions in soil organic matter we

341
00:13:39,298 --> 00:13:42,749
have nutrient losses we don't have

342
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:44,428
functioning slow microbiomes we have

343
00:13:42,749 --> 00:13:48,209
poor water infiltration and in a lot of

344
00:13:44,428 --> 00:13:50,639
landscapes so we're trying to envision a

345
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:52,768
new we call natural systems agriculture

346
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,269
that's not natural it's still engineered

347
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:56,220
it's still humans we are still the ones

348
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:57,720
that are affecting the climate in the

349
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,778
environment right by designing these

350
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,778
systems

351
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:04,139
they're composed of perennial crop

352
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:06,549
species they have moderate diversity and

353
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:08,559
you know that we envision them as

354
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:10,240
actually allowing soil formation to

355
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,309
happen having increased soil organic

356
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,470
matter retaining nutrients having

357
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:17,939
functional soil microbiome and

358
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,940
infiltrating water that's landing

359
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,830
and so you know what are some of the

360
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,750
reasons that maybe these later

361
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,970
successional turn successional

362
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,740
ecosystems are functioning and you know

363
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,879
on we can see that we actually probably

364
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,789
have increase in that primary

365
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:35,129
productivity this is a field in Kansas

366
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:36,719
this is a field that's been filed it's

367
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:39,389
about to be planted to sunflowers at the

368
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,269
same time of the year this is one of our

369
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:43,559
researchers feel to institute this is

370
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:45,379
Silphium which is a perennial relative

371
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:48,329
of sunflower and the Asteraceae family

372
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:50,340
and you can see it's big and growing and

373
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:52,860
so when we have living root systems

374
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,379
they're gonna begin growing doing

375
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,070
photosynthesis as soon as the

376
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:57,779
environmental conditions are appropriate

377
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,820
produced to do so as soon as we have

378
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:02,029
warm enough temperatures in the spring

379
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,990
they're gonna be actively growing and

380
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:06,870
hopefully someday as a whole you know we

381
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,370
can see that instead of taking away most

382
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:10,590
of the net primary productivity has seen

383
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,269
from the system we have a larger pool of

384
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:14,399
net primary productivity begin from and

385
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:16,319
we can still take large yields of seed

386
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,090
away leaving some of the net primary

387
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,340
productivity there to feed the soils and

388
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:21,990
to build the organic matter and those

389
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:25,190
other ecosystems that we need for a

390
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,190
bunch of slow microbiomes

391
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:33,600
so we also can see that primality can

392
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:35,399
increase the soil organic carbon and we

393
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,440
look at temperate grasslands perennial

394
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,590
species out there and in general

395
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,880
perennials have a forty to sixty percent

396
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:44,389
below ground allocation of their net

397
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:46,409
primary productivity and so a lot of the

398
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:48,240
organic material that's landing in the

399
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:51,750
landscape is actually going into living

400
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,840
ranks in the soil in our annual grains

401
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,039
we only have fifteen to twenty percent

402
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,680
below ground allocation of net primary

403
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,969
activity it's turning over each year so

404
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:03,209
though this is the vision of the lands

405
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:05,700
like this this is an uncommon goal but

406
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:09,030
one that we know is possible this at the

407
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:11,430
top is intermediate wheat grass species

408
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:12,929
that we've been domesticating with other

409
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:14,669
people around the world for a quite a

410
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:16,709
few years and on the bottom is our

411
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:18,089
annual wheat and you can see the

412
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:21,120
differences in the net primary

413
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:24,180
productivity the system and the amount

414
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,919
of organic matter of carbon that's

415
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:28,159
entering the soil each year in those

416
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,159
root systems

417
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,110
so this is really the vision of the

418
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:40,980
future you know you guys can stay in

419
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:43,649
this and in addition to bringing carving

420
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,159
into the systems these large living root

421
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:46,529
systems

422
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,959
you know accomplished most well their

423
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:51,209
goals when grown on slopes they can

424
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,400
limit water erosion we're covering the

425
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:56,790
soil and holding the soil all year every

426
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:58,559
year and we can also you know limit our

427
00:16:56,789 --> 00:17:00,719
water contamination so the water that's

428
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,339
there is being infiltrated we have large

429
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,529
living root systems that are gonna be up

430
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:06,959
taking all of the nitrate that's that's

431
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:08,578
in our soil and preventing runoff into

432
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,589
our streams so instead of planting you

433
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:13,859
know a buffer strips in and around our

434
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:17,309
fields we have field scale buffer strips

435
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:21,359
and it's something that I hope that we

436
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:22,980
can envision in dream resource

437
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,519
partitioning in diverse systems so when

438
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:29,519
we look at a diverse system we have you

439
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:31,230
know biomass and we have root organs and

440
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,049
plant organs of all different shapes and

441
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,700
sizes and some of them are big tap root

442
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:38,190
steeping reaching deep in the soil and

443
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,660
we have no fibrous root systems that are

444
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,309
putting a lot of matter into the top of

445
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,110
the soil and we really have this

446
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:46,289
partitioning this niche partitioning

447
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:50,250
that happens in a secondary later term

448
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:52,619
successional ecosystem so we're

449
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,420
capturing nutrients and holding them in

450
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:57,719
place at all levels of the soil profile

451
00:17:54,420 --> 00:18:02,190
we're capturing sunlight in water at all

452
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:04,529
levels in the system and so you know we

453
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:06,240
can imagine even with perennial grains

454
00:18:04,529 --> 00:18:09,599
right if we have a perennial servitor

455
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,039
right species we have some ecosystem

456
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:12,240
services that we're accomplishing we're

457
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,970
holding the soil in place we're

458
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,569
providing continuous living roots there

459
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:21,059
that are creating habitat for things

460
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:23,639
possibly like amf fungi and other soil

461
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:26,279
microorganisms as we add new species

462
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,259
like alfalfa to this mixture we have

463
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:30,089
another additional ecosystem service

464
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:33,029
that we can provide we have these

465
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:36,049
nodules providing habitat for nitrogen

466
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:38,549
fixing fixing rhizobia species and

467
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:40,409
ultimately we're bringing nitrogen into

468
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:42,119
the into the system to facilitate the

469
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:44,130
growth and development

470
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:46,379
our solid organic nitrogen pool and

471
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,539
other plants and organisms in the system

472
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,429
and finally you can imagine that we had

473
00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:53,908
a maybe a thirsty she's a perennial

474
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:57,150
sunflower type of relative that in

475
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:59,760
addition to growing additional biomass

476
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,590
and and using the resources there is

477
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,710
also providing you know habitat for

478
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:07,230
beneficial insects for pest control and

479
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:11,038
habitat for other wildlife and our

480
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:13,110
systems and ultimately you know we have

481
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:18,028
this gradient of soil health that is

482
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:19,469
improved through this process and so

483
00:19:18,028 --> 00:19:21,538
these are really the uncommon goals of

484
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,250
our institute we're working to develop

485
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:25,558
perennial grain crops three

486
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,659
domestication so this species

487
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:29,308
intermediate grass here is a pretty

488
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:30,899
allot relative of wheat and we have a

489
00:19:29,308 --> 00:19:33,178
direct domestication program for them

490
00:19:30,898 --> 00:19:36,658
probably or through wide hybridization

491
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:38,519
so we have multiple other programs we're

492
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:39,570
looking at other combination with grain

493
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:41,849
crops that we're trying to eat

494
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:44,278
harmonization to bring ferny allottee

495
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:46,319
into those species and finally in

496
00:19:44,278 --> 00:19:48,240
addition we're trying to deploy these

497
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:52,379
grains in diverse crop assemblies on

498
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,548
agricultural landscapes and so in

499
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,840
addition to the lannister we have

500
00:19:53,548 --> 00:19:56,668
collaborators all around the world that

501
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:59,189
are interested in working on these same

502
00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:00,870
crops and cropping systems with us it's

503
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:03,419
really increasing quickly we have a

504
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:04,939
pretty low rice reading program and

505
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:07,020
researchers that we're working on that

506
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,130
have developed you know rice for days

507
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:10,589
that are planted on thousands of

508
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:12,390
hectares already and have been almost

509
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:13,889
equally as productive as the annual rice

510
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:17,070
or variety is growing in those same

511
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:21,500
regions six harvests in a row three

512
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:24,230
three three years to tumour tune events

513
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:28,798
and so for any elude the game breeding

514
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:39,210
that's what i do the land institute

515
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:41,849
hired me in 2016 legume breeder was the

516
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:44,069
international year of the pulses FAO is

517
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:46,019
here and the year before was the

518
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:49,769
International Year of the soils and so

519
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:52,470
we recognized the importance of pulses

520
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:54,569
and legumes in this idea of what a

521
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:56,779
sustainable future agriculture could

522
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:56,779
look like

523
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:02,269
very interesting I really enjoyed

524
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,740
Allison's talk today and I think you

525
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:05,809
know looking into the future the one

526
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,390
thing that we're missing still is is the

527
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:09,859
nitrogen cycle we need sustainable

528
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,990
inputs of nitrogen into our system and

529
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:15,139
the games are one way that we can do

530
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:17,230
that especially a perennial you get the

531
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,610
you accomplished you know that's

532
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:21,950
developing a long term root system and

533
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:24,919
you're slowly releasing nitrogen into

534
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:30,350
the soil that's becoming part of the

535
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:34,580
soil organic nitrogen pool we also know

536
00:21:30,349 --> 00:21:38,599
for example like well we'll just keep

537
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:41,480
sucking here so I was hired in 2016

538
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:43,189
without a species or a crop or even a

539
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,440
vision of exactly how the pretty all the

540
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:48,529
games were gonna fit into the system and

541
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,890
so that was interesting and so I started

542
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:56,990
at late fall 2016 and I remember kind of

543
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:58,280
sitting in my office with a set of

544
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:01,009
questions that are still the same

545
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:02,990
questions that I'm asking today and you

546
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:05,299
know so like the first question is what

547
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,710
what legumes are perennials which

548
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:09,889
legumes are there and what I can work

549
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,819
with a next question was which species

550
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,950
should I choose

551
00:22:10,819 --> 00:22:15,769
you know how many are there and which

552
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,220
one can I work on you know the next

553
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:18,079
question

554
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,940
Larry's presentation was really nice you

555
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:23,179
know how do we develop an idiot type for

556
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:25,250
whatever species were working on and you

557
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:28,230
know eventually as a breeder how do I

558
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:29,548
develop a breeding program for that crop

559
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:31,858
so which legumes are perennial I

560
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:34,679
actually began working in a

561
00:22:31,858 --> 00:22:35,939
collaborative project while I was still

562
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:36,989
at the University of Wisconsin as a

563
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,769
graduate student a couple of months

564
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:42,269
before I started the position with dr.

565
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:44,489
Alison Millers through this perennial

566
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:46,618
agriculture project global inventory and

567
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:49,858
so we wanted to build an inventory of

568
00:22:46,618 --> 00:22:51,749
all the legume species and look at their

569
00:22:49,858 --> 00:22:54,058
life histories so there was no you know

570
00:22:51,749 --> 00:22:56,009
nice list of what are the what are the

571
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:57,720
pronoun the taxa in the fabaceae family

572
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:59,519
and which ones are annuals and which

573
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,919
ones are perennials and what type of

574
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,450
perennial they are and so we had this

575
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,788
idea that we want to have perennial

576
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:08,580
herbaceous legumes they fit into our

577
00:23:05,788 --> 00:23:11,210
sort of envisioned cropping system of

578
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:13,618
things that are growing back every year

579
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:17,730
so out of twenty thousand some species

580
00:23:13,618 --> 00:23:19,199
about 30 percent or printing alerts the

581
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:22,079
kind that were interested in forty eight

582
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,679
hundred and so you know now I had my

583
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,939
list of which ones are perennials but we

584
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,950
still have to decide which species are

585
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,570
choose there's a large number and what's

586
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:32,308
really interesting to me so there's you

587
00:23:30,569 --> 00:23:35,519
know twenty thousand some species in the

588
00:23:32,308 --> 00:23:38,489
fabaceae family as humans we use maybe

589
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:42,089
fifteen as foods that we eat and maybe

590
00:23:38,489 --> 00:23:44,608
another 30 to 40 as a ones that we use

591
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:48,720
as forage crops and so there's this

592
00:23:44,608 --> 00:23:50,548
whole broad amount of diversity that in

593
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,319
some instances where we're at risk of

594
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:55,138
losing and that we don't really know

595
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,849
that much about did we choose those 15

596
00:23:55,138 --> 00:23:59,339
because those were the obvious

597
00:23:56,849 --> 00:24:00,238
candidates the people know ten thousand

598
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:03,778
years ago when they started

599
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:05,399
domesticating plants around the world or

600
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:08,308
to just kind of happen was they're just

601
00:24:05,398 --> 00:24:09,808
you know that one unique person who saw

602
00:24:08,308 --> 00:24:12,028
that plant and was used to eating that

603
00:24:09,808 --> 00:24:13,858
plant and thought oh I'm gonna try

604
00:24:12,028 --> 00:24:15,960
planting the seeds one time and then it

605
00:24:13,858 --> 00:24:20,349
and then it you know just kind of went

606
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:22,480
from there and so now is that this way

607
00:24:20,349 --> 00:24:23,859
species should we choose and so the

608
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,169
night that was the next question I

609
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:27,909
focused on kind of my first few months

610
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:30,580
at the land Institute and really

611
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:32,620
developing this idea of you know what do

612
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:34,599
we want in a crop and so you know some

613
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:36,819
basic concepts we care about its

614
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:39,250
economic potential is it can we

615
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:41,619
establish it does what are the field

616
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:43,029
management strategies that I need is it

617
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:44,889
harvestable what's the yield potential

618
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:46,960
is it adaptable it can it be only grown

619
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:48,580
in a specific you know location in the

620
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,798
world or can it be grown all over the

621
00:24:48,579 --> 00:24:51,609
place what are some of the seed quality

622
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:53,619
attributes

623
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:55,599
what's its nutritional profile does it

624
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:57,819
have any anti nutritional compounds and

625
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:00,099
it's can it be used like CBD and some

626
00:24:57,819 --> 00:25:02,009
high-value product seems like a quick

627
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:04,808
way to commercialize a new a new species

628
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:06,250
and then you know very importantly what

629
00:25:04,808 --> 00:25:08,349
are the ecosystem services that this

630
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:10,089
species could provide how does it

631
00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:12,699
require resources how does it retain

632
00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:15,788
resources does it provide other

633
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:18,370
provisions for other purposes is it dual

634
00:25:15,788 --> 00:25:22,900
use can it be used as a fiber and a seed

635
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:24,428
crop and finally I was wanting to think

636
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:27,429
about the ease of breeding so we know

637
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:29,620
that things like claudi level and genome

638
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:31,890
size are really gonna be an important

639
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:33,908
criteria long term and how successful

640
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:35,710
we're gonna be and also this

641
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:38,530
availability of genetic resources and so

642
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:40,298
you know when you're a new scientist and

643
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:43,899
you want to start doing something your

644
00:25:40,298 --> 00:25:47,048
first year availability of germ plasm

645
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:48,580
and genetic resources and then really

646
00:25:47,048 --> 00:25:50,168
thinking about what's the what's the

647
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:51,490
quickest way that I can release

648
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:54,130
something that's useful in agriculture

649
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:55,630
dual-use became kind of the most

650
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:58,330
important criterias for me right now

651
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:59,650
we're still evaluating many other native

652
00:25:58,329 --> 00:26:01,509
and wild species that haven't been used

653
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:05,288
before but moving forward with these

654
00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:06,669
ideas and so when we think about what

655
00:26:05,288 --> 00:26:08,408
perennial legume species are being used

656
00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:11,110
right now well we have many common

657
00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:13,480
peroneal forages especially alfalfa

658
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:15,178
alfalfa is probably the perennial

659
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,860
herbaceous species that's had the most

660
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:20,980
genetic research economic research and

661
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:23,079
we grow it everywhere so we've really

662
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,610
been looking hard at these pretty Oh for

663
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:26,079
there's people that I can collaborate

664
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:28,658
that know something about these crops

665
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:30,970
their seed available for me it really

666
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:33,520
makes sense to start with those species

667
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:34,269
and so we're looking at them as kaneo

668
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:35,558
companion looking

669
00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:38,048
something that we can inter plant

670
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:40,028
between rows of other annual or

671
00:26:38,048 --> 00:26:43,418
perennial grain species as as our

672
00:26:40,028 --> 00:26:44,950
nitrogen input source and then also as

673
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:47,739
kind of the perennial grain for Neopost

674
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:50,440
idea can we harvest something that's

675
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:54,819
edible that can be used as a new pole

676
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:56,588
scrub and so that was sort of the

677
00:26:54,819 --> 00:26:58,928
beginning of my how do we develop an

678
00:26:56,588 --> 00:27:00,579
idio type and my first year I just kind

679
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:02,919
of ran with it right well probably you

680
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:04,928
want big seed so alfalfa is a great

681
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:06,879
example of a crop with really good

682
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:08,589
potential we have a whole seed industry

683
00:27:06,878 --> 00:27:10,868
that's already existing to produce seed

684
00:27:08,588 --> 00:27:12,999
for farmers we grow a lot of it in the

685
00:27:10,868 --> 00:27:14,949
western United States in there sometimes

686
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:17,019
achieving yields you know six hundred

687
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:18,700
eight hundred thousand pounds on acre

688
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:19,838
without really breeding for those

689
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,759
characteristics and those are pretty

690
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:24,368
comparable to the lentil yields that are

691
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:28,118
in the same environment growing in very

692
00:27:24,368 --> 00:27:29,828
similar ways and so you know I think at

693
00:27:28,118 --> 00:27:31,298
first naive they're thinking well we

694
00:27:29,828 --> 00:27:32,769
need to have bigger seeds for sure

695
00:27:31,298 --> 00:27:36,819
because people aren't gonna want to eat

696
00:27:32,769 --> 00:27:39,429
really small lentils and also you know

697
00:27:36,819 --> 00:27:40,749
thinking about long term seed

698
00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:43,239
establishment of forage legumes is

699
00:27:40,749 --> 00:27:46,659
pretty hard we have to either kill a lot

700
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:49,389
and have really firm seed beds and plant

701
00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:50,950
very shallowly which is the same as with

702
00:27:49,388 --> 00:27:52,478
hemp it's a big challenge and so we

703
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:55,209
didn't want tillage to be part of our

704
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:56,558
long term cropping system and we also

705
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:57,969
can't have that much residue on the

706
00:27:56,558 --> 00:27:59,378
solid surface of the soil because the

707
00:27:57,969 --> 00:28:01,028
seeds are small I can't push up through

708
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:02,949
them and so I was hoping that you know

709
00:28:01,028 --> 00:28:04,898
increasing seed size will help with

710
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,729
establishment as well and so we did a

711
00:28:04,898 --> 00:28:09,518
little bit of work I started with this

712
00:28:06,729 --> 00:28:11,499
germ plasm called al boria dr. Edwin

713
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:13,569
Bingham had worked on at the University

714
00:28:11,499 --> 00:28:16,450
of Wisconsin for a long time and it's an

715
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:18,729
alfalfa wide Harvard with medicago

716
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:20,709
arborio which is a woody perennial shrub

717
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:22,659
from the Mediterranean it has seed size

718
00:28:20,709 --> 00:28:24,980
that are quite a bit larger than

719
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:26,570
conventional alfalfa

720
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:29,240
and so one cycle of selection we saw

721
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:33,500
some interesting things you know out of

722
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:35,599
my half sibs I had families that were

723
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,990
really outperforming the alfalfa checks

724
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:41,269
in the experiment and as you know this

725
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:43,370
is just data from the USDA grain system

726
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:47,599
but if we look at the two subspecies of

727
00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:49,849
medicago sativa compared to all of my

728
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:52,308
breeding populations as a whole now we

729
00:28:49,849 --> 00:28:55,449
are actually shifting the seed size of

730
00:28:52,308 --> 00:29:01,700
alfalfa in some way closer towards this

731
00:28:55,450 --> 00:29:02,840
other species natural seed size another

732
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,460
crop that I'm really interested in is

733
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:05,829
same flowing it's another perennial

734
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:09,710
forage like you met has a long history

735
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:11,689
it's pretty fascinating in that we look

736
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:13,190
at archaeological evidence humans were

737
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,409
eating this at one point in time so

738
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,028
there's caves in Turkey and around that

739
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:21,559
area where we're finding charred remains

740
00:29:17,028 --> 00:29:23,538
of these seeds now and there's been some

741
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:25,548
recent interest in actually using it as

742
00:29:23,538 --> 00:29:27,679
a seed crop a grain crop already so

743
00:29:25,548 --> 00:29:30,888
there's been a few studies in Italy and

744
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:33,048
in Europe where organic protein sources

745
00:29:30,888 --> 00:29:35,148
are really in need and really expensive

746
00:29:33,048 --> 00:29:37,220
and so they've been actually looking at

747
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:40,428
these seeds as a possible protein

748
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:42,259
delivery system and in feeding trials

749
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:44,720
with pigs and chickens and other mono

750
00:29:42,259 --> 00:29:46,369
graphics like mice in general we haven't

751
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,350
seen any negative consequences there's

752
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:50,959
been good rates of gain that are

753
00:29:48,349 --> 00:29:54,168
comparable to soybean meal and it seems

754
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,970
like there's a lot of promise it also

755
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:58,970
has you know when we think about idiot I

756
00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:00,679
think lupins kind of encapsulate what I

757
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,909
imagine the morphology of a new

758
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:04,429
perennial grain would look like they

759
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:06,080
have this beautiful terminal regime that

760
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:08,240
has all these nice little flowers on it

761
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:10,460
you can imagine being skimmed off easily

762
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,538
with a combine and we expect this to be

763
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,730
one of the big problems with

764
00:30:11,538 --> 00:30:15,109
domesticating perennial forbs in general

765
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:17,298
if there's a they don't really have this

766
00:30:15,109 --> 00:30:19,009
nice determinate growth pattern and then

767
00:30:17,298 --> 00:30:21,500
senescence pattern that we can think of

768
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:22,849
in our annuals dry down sort of

769
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,919
naturally on their own and are easily

770
00:30:22,849 --> 00:30:26,209
harvest with the combine so you know

771
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:28,730
maybe in a system like this where we

772
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:30,380
have dry seed pods up above we can use a

773
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,700
stripper header on the combine and come

774
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,679
through and just skim them off the top

775
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,058
and if you've never seen a Lupin pottery

776
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,919
and they're super interesting to look

777
00:30:35,058 --> 00:30:38,680
pretty much like a soybean pot so they

778
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:40,630
look like a stem of soybeans

779
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:43,539
with pods all the way up three or four

780
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:45,309
seeds in a pod and pretty good size we

781
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:46,899
have three other species of lupins that

782
00:30:45,308 --> 00:30:49,149
have already been domesticated annuals

783
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,920
that are grown in the world actually one

784
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:52,930
of the species that was domesticated by

785
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,400
the Incas in South America its

786
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:56,590
progenitor is actually a perennial

787
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,420
species and so there's a lot of

788
00:30:56,589 --> 00:31:00,129
opportunities to explore that in more

789
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,690
detail we can cross it with the native

790
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,400
species Lupin is prolly Phyllis that I'm

791
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:05,070
interested in so this is the ornamental

792
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,240
Lupin that you see planted in people's

793
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:08,710
flowerbeds there's been reading already

794
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,740
for these you know increased

795
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:14,529
reproductive output so it's an

796
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:16,480
interesting one for me and so you know I

797
00:31:14,529 --> 00:31:20,079
started this second round of ok how do

798
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,519
we develop an idiot type and this is

799
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:23,289
really began when I started thinking

800
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,910
about companion legumes and how do you

801
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:27,190
breed for something that you're gonna

802
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:30,100
plant between rows of something else if

803
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:32,259
your phenotype is actually you know the

804
00:31:30,099 --> 00:31:35,619
expression of a phenotype in a different

805
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:37,690
crop what is your how do you select for

806
00:31:35,619 --> 00:31:40,509
that interaction and what what sort of

807
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:43,000
breeding system do you use and so we

808
00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:44,289
have people have been trying this for

809
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,750
quite a lot one of the species I'm

810
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:48,129
working on is cure clover and we tried

811
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:50,920
using it as kind of this living

812
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:52,809
continuous cover mulch system especially

813
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:55,120
in Wisconsin can Albrecht worked on it a

814
00:31:52,808 --> 00:31:59,220
lot in Wisconsin craig Schafer's worked

815
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:01,569
on it in the University of Minnesota and

816
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,670
we've tried all sorts of ways of trying

817
00:32:01,569 --> 00:32:05,500
to kind of manage the compatibility in

818
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:07,090
the competition in that system but no

819
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,009
one has taken a breeding approach so no

820
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:11,379
one has really gone through is there a

821
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:13,929
way that we can select to change these

822
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:16,030
systems and so you know I began to think

823
00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:17,320
about really didn't details so what is

824
00:32:16,029 --> 00:32:19,000
our cropping system what's the row

825
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:21,579
spacing going to be what are we planting

826
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,170
it in between what are the limitations

827
00:32:21,579 --> 00:32:24,689
of a candidate species in that system so

828
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:28,120
a lot of these new species that we try

829
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:29,980
you know I'm getting wild seed scent

830
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:31,689
from either our biome from native sieve

831
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,099
nurseries or there's like these wild

832
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:35,410
seed collection networks where they just

833
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:36,969
you email this person and they mail you

834
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:38,800
some seed back I collected this at this

835
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:41,200
place and so we have terrible

836
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,720
germination rates usually there's a lot

837
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,220
of out reading depression in genetic

838
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,569
load that's there and it's hard to

839
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,640
evaluate these things in plots even

840
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:50,629
because you know there's a they're hard

841
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,250
to compare

842
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:54,680
traits our components of seed yield so

843
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,970
even like in loopiness poly Felicity old

844
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,710
study we don't really know should I be

845
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:00,019
selecting for more seeds per pod or

846
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:02,840
should I be selecting for more flowers

847
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:04,519
on a Racine and which traits are

848
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:07,490
increasing the compatibility of my

849
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:09,410
legume in my mixtures and and finally

850
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:12,259
you know for these mixtures can I breed

851
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:14,269
plants in monoculture stands or in space

852
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:16,279
plant nurseries or do I have to do my

853
00:33:14,269 --> 00:33:17,720
breeding in between rows of the

854
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:21,200
companion that they're going to be grown

855
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:23,120
with so one of the projects we started

856
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,640
last last year's last year was our first

857
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:27,529
year of phenotyping with technician and

858
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,030
master student in my lab it's really

859
00:33:27,529 --> 00:33:31,819
trying to design these intermediate

860
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:34,399
wheat grass alfalfa by cultures so we

861
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:37,309
began a multi-state study we have about

862
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,960
30 varieties of alfalfa planted in

863
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:43,970
between rows of intermediate wheat grass

864
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,350
in Wisconsin Kansas and Minnesota really

865
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:46,759
trying to see you know these varieties

866
00:33:45,349 --> 00:33:48,829
are really divergent entries are really

867
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:52,099
divergent we have branching root systems

868
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:54,679
tap root systems really quick regrowth

869
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:58,279
etc are there certain traits that are

870
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:59,600
correlated with the system in maybe are

871
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:01,369
there certain varieties that we can

872
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,649
already recommend to farmers to adopt

873
00:34:01,369 --> 00:34:05,389
the system because Kern's a and we do

874
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:07,040
eat grasses in this early stage of free

875
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:08,990
commercialization and farmers are

876
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,759
beginning to plant it would be great if

877
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:13,099
we could you know have farmers start

878
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,230
planting this in a cropping system in a

879
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:18,519
way that we you know know a long term is

880
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:18,519
where we should be moving

881
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:23,880
and so we started designing a cropping

882
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:26,789
system and this is how we're running it

883
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,500
at the at the moment so both of them are

884
00:34:26,789 --> 00:34:31,739
perennials they both produce a lot of

885
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:34,190
biomass and in late April early May

886
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:36,418
depending where you're at the alfalfa

887
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:38,340
almost begins to flower the first time

888
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:39,989
depending where you're at and the

889
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,659
intermediate wheatgrass has grown as

890
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:44,668
well and so you can actually have a

891
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:46,860
grazing event or a forage harvest here

892
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:48,869
just before this onset of chiller

893
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:51,030
elongation in last year our trials in

894
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:53,579
Kansas we were producing one and a half

895
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:57,630
or so tons of really high-quality dry

896
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:59,880
matter at that time after this forage

897
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:01,320
harvest we left to let it go and the

898
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,920
alfalfa is gonna start flowering again

899
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,480
and in late May early June but because

900
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,450
it's between rows we can't really

901
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,039
harvest it and at this time the intimate

902
00:35:09,449 --> 00:35:12,569
wheatgrass really starts closing up the

903
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:14,219
canopy and so when we look at the

904
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:18,210
alfalfa we're actually declining in

905
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:21,119
biomass continually from about this you

906
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:22,829
know May June transition until we

907
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,389
ultimately have mature seed that we're

908
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:26,670
harvesting from the intermediate grass

909
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:29,339
here at the end we have residue that we

910
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:31,409
can once again graze or or Bale and so

911
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,150
at this cutting last year averaging

912
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:36,089
about four and a half tons dry matter in

913
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:38,099
our plots that's not nearly as good

914
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:41,039
quality of hay but it would be fine as

915
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:44,429
grinding forage for heifer diets or beef

916
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,969
diets after that is first regrowing

917
00:35:44,429 --> 00:35:47,879
again

918
00:35:44,969 --> 00:35:50,309
and so by the middle of September we can

919
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,110
take a third cutting a third harvest or

920
00:35:50,309 --> 00:35:54,900
a third grazing event where we're gonna

921
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:57,750
produce another 1/2 tons and so our

922
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:01,079
grain harvests are respectable last year

923
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:05,489
we were in the 700 or so pounds of seed

924
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:08,069
yield per acre but we also are producing

925
00:36:05,489 --> 00:36:09,959
between 6 and 7 tons of dry matter and

926
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:11,420
so it's really this giulio system that

927
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,500
we can imagine farmers adopting

928
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:15,840
hopefully very quickly especially in

929
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,610
Kansas where we still have a tradition

930
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,970
of having these warm season pastures

931
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:23,370
that farmers are most farmers still own

932
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:25,769
a small herd of cattle and so you know

933
00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:27,420
we're we're generally buying feed and

934
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:30,309
hay and feeding hay in this period of

935
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,659
time and so you know stretching

936
00:36:30,309 --> 00:36:33,400
stretching it out and reducing the hey

937
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:34,838
we need to buy this time before we move

938
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,088
to our warm season pastures in the

939
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:38,650
middle of May would be a great benefit

940
00:36:37,088 --> 00:36:40,630
and then once again once our warm season

941
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:41,949
pastures start declining in productivity

942
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:44,949
we can move them back to our cool season

943
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:46,269
grass legume mixture here and depending

944
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:48,430
how many feels we have you know we can

945
00:36:46,268 --> 00:36:50,379
bulk residue and and graze throughout

946
00:36:48,429 --> 00:36:53,828
the winter so it really fits nicely into

947
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:56,650
our system we're also looking at cura

948
00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:58,180
clover and so Abbey Han is is here with

949
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:00,548
me she's a research resident Delana

950
00:36:58,179 --> 00:37:04,118
student and we're really starting to

951
00:37:00,548 --> 00:37:05,739
begin to understand you know what what

952
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:07,059
is controlling compatibility in this

953
00:37:05,739 --> 00:37:08,380
system especially with maize and with

954
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:09,789
intermediate wheatgrass so we have a

955
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,619
project we've planted out all the

956
00:37:09,789 --> 00:37:14,289
accessions in the USDA we're

957
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:17,459
characterizing really well using some

958
00:37:14,289 --> 00:37:20,559
interesting morphometric proaches for

959
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:22,868
leaf size and area and shape and color

960
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:24,069
we looked at white clover research when

961
00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:26,528
they're using in mixtures with grasses

962
00:37:24,068 --> 00:37:28,838
the leaf color and the leaf shape and

963
00:37:26,528 --> 00:37:31,358
size and really makes a difference in

964
00:37:28,838 --> 00:37:32,828
the competitiveness of the curé clover

965
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:34,719
and in candace we really noticed this so

966
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:36,640
there's these clovers that have sort of

967
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:38,708
a bluish color and that's they're really

968
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:40,868
a waxing waxy coating on the leaves

969
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:42,278
that's really preventing water losses in

970
00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:47,499
the system and those ones seem to

971
00:37:42,278 --> 00:37:48,938
perform really well in our area so

972
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:51,818
finally how do we develop a breeding

973
00:37:48,938 --> 00:37:53,828
program and so this has been a very fun

974
00:37:51,818 --> 00:37:55,808
experiment for me to start from nothing

975
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:59,109
and so you know the first year we're

976
00:37:55,809 --> 00:38:00,339
asking questions like know what pieces

977
00:37:59,108 --> 00:38:02,078
of equipment do we have that we can

978
00:38:00,338 --> 00:38:03,969
plant these things or how do I get the

979
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,849
seeds out of the pods of my alfalfa

980
00:38:03,969 --> 00:38:08,229
plants how do I harvest my Lupin seeds

981
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:10,539
before they all shatter and fall on the

982
00:38:08,228 --> 00:38:12,278
ground so I can measure yields or should

983
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:13,420
I not let them try not measure yield

984
00:38:12,278 --> 00:38:15,748
should I just measure after everything

985
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:21,860
shattered is a way to find ones that are

986
00:38:15,748 --> 00:38:23,449
into sin to isint and then also you know

987
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:25,640
because we don't have an idio type how

988
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:26,989
do we do breeding on the fly right how

989
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:29,329
are we going to develop an idiot i p--

990
00:38:26,989 --> 00:38:31,489
and advanced populations we don't know

991
00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:33,170
what to select for while we're still

992
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:34,489
doing the agronomic work to figure out

993
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:36,800
what the cropping system is and how it

994
00:38:34,489 --> 00:38:40,399
should function and so this has been an

995
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,320
interesting experience for me and when

996
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,480
you think about a typical forage legumes

997
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,059
system pretty well we want to look at

998
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,190
yields for two three four years in a row

999
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:51,440
before we really make our selections so

1000
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:53,990
we want this long-term yield stability

1001
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,700
and so this is what I've started doing

1002
00:38:53,989 --> 00:38:57,019
this is just accurate clover example

1003
00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:58,549
we're really starting to do this with

1004
00:38:57,019 --> 00:39:01,670
the five species that I minced in

1005
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:04,190
alfalfa pure clover Lupin's

1006
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:07,099
same fine and alfalfa again as a grain

1007
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:09,380
so we're starting with maybe a hundred

1008
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:11,539
selected plants here in making a poly

1009
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:14,480
cross in the greenhouse in the late fall

1010
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:16,550
we did this last November and was we're

1011
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,740
moving into you know the beginning of

1012
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:21,950
year two or you know it's kind of year

1013
00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:23,869
one but we harvest the seeds from those

1014
00:39:21,949 --> 00:39:26,089
Hollett those poly crosses and maybe I

1015
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:28,309
want to plant 100 100 seed so I have

1016
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:31,490
10,000 total progeny that I'm gonna

1017
00:39:28,309 --> 00:39:33,139
evaluate that's a lot of plants to

1018
00:39:31,489 --> 00:39:34,250
evaluate and so we're gonna do some

1019
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:36,980
selection here we're going to select

1020
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:39,039
bigger seedlings that haven't succumbed

1021
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:41,329
to diseases in the greenhouse

1022
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:43,309
specifically inoculating them for traits

1023
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:46,000
like the funnel my sees to resistance

1024
00:39:43,309 --> 00:39:49,009
which is a seedling disease in our area

1025
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,510
in the spring we're just started doing

1026
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,830
this Abby's been potting plants in the

1027
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:54,260
greenhouse so we're gonna try to plot

1028
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:56,690
the pot as many of these ceilings as we

1029
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:59,720
can store about 2500 we're going to go

1030
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:03,260
through another poly cross here to

1031
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:07,250
produce new half sip seed families

1032
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:08,750
basically or grants and families and we

1033
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:10,579
want to be able to plant swords in the

1034
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:12,050
field so this is typical kind of forage

1035
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:15,079
research we want to go to source so that

1036
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:16,940
we can evaluate on a whole plot basis we

1037
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:19,849
don't expect that many of them to

1038
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:21,590
actually produce enough seed to to plant

1039
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:24,889
in Swords so we further reduce our our

1040
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:27,289
our entry number by selecting the top

1041
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:29,179
CEOs here and eventually we're gonna

1042
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:31,699
plant them in plots in the field

1043
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:32,899
intercropped with a species intermediate

1044
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:34,948
grass after there or maybe in

1045
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:37,920
monocultures for the grains

1046
00:40:34,949 --> 00:40:41,249
at the beginning of our second year this

1047
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:44,969
would be the fall of of 2019 this fall

1048
00:40:41,248 --> 00:40:46,919
and hopefully we have enough plants that

1049
00:40:44,969 --> 00:40:48,239
actually produce seed to make two plots

1050
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,699
that we can use some sort of partially

1051
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:54,599
replicated design instead of having to

1052
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:57,298
use Czech varieties and as we move into

1053
00:40:54,599 --> 00:41:00,690
our beginning of our third year here

1054
00:40:57,298 --> 00:41:02,548
we're starting to in the spring have our

1055
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:05,969
first spring grazing simulation like I

1056
00:41:02,548 --> 00:41:07,619
showed you in that that first our

1057
00:41:05,969 --> 00:41:09,088
cropping system design we're gonna have

1058
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:10,769
a summer grazing harvest and another

1059
00:41:09,088 --> 00:41:13,650
fall grazing here and we'll go through

1060
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:15,689
that iteration three times these plants

1061
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:17,369
are planted in monocultures space plants

1062
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:19,739
and we're going to really evaluate you

1063
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:21,719
know things like leaf area regrowth rate

1064
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:23,969
fall dormancy and a variety of

1065
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:25,889
characteristics that we can also use and

1066
00:41:23,969 --> 00:41:29,068
at the end of it we can select our top

1067
00:41:25,889 --> 00:41:30,778
1% of our plants at the same time we're

1068
00:41:29,068 --> 00:41:33,088
learning about our system we're learning

1069
00:41:30,778 --> 00:41:35,009
you know is this viable are there

1070
00:41:33,088 --> 00:41:40,828
certain traits that are better adapted

1071
00:41:35,009 --> 00:41:42,208
to this system yeah and in really

1072
00:41:40,829 --> 00:41:46,140
developing our ideo type through this

1073
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:49,139
process hopefully starting in 2022

1074
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:51,358
I guess fall 2021 we'll take those

1075
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:52,879
hundred plants that we selected begin

1076
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:55,108
moving towards a genomic selection

1077
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,568
procedure we'll start the same way with

1078
00:41:55,108 --> 00:42:01,318
the hundred seeds harvest the seeds and

1079
00:41:57,568 --> 00:42:03,989
plant those 10,000 seedlings out but

1080
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:04,978
ultimately begin selecting 100 progeny

1081
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:06,478
each year based on the genomic

1082
00:42:04,978 --> 00:42:09,118
prediction model that we had developed

1083
00:42:06,478 --> 00:42:11,068
previously so we're designing an idiot

1084
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,358
i'p we're learning about the plants

1085
00:42:11,068 --> 00:42:16,079
we're phenotyping all these things at

1086
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:18,179
the same time as we go and splitting off

1087
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,709
into you know additional cycles so

1088
00:42:18,179 --> 00:42:22,798
instead of having a five year cycle I'm

1089
00:42:19,708 --> 00:42:24,748
now on a one-year cycle but I'll take a

1090
00:42:22,798 --> 00:42:27,420
portion of these plants that will become

1091
00:42:24,748 --> 00:42:29,669
my next training population it's over

1092
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:32,130
time basically have about 500 plots at

1093
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:33,568
my one year age group my two year age

1094
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:36,269
group and a three year age group of

1095
00:42:33,568 --> 00:42:40,048
plants in the field that were

1096
00:42:36,268 --> 00:42:41,399
continually cycling through and we

1097
00:42:40,048 --> 00:42:43,559
pick a species yet remember we have five

1098
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,999
species so at the same time we're trying

1099
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:47,309
to select species and so this is really

1100
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:49,738
a way to compare effectiveness in a

1101
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:51,239
cropping system you know a building in

1102
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:54,989
the future - maybe perform as a grain

1103
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:56,309
crop all simultaneously and a be

1104
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:58,588
starting to develop some genomic tools

1105
00:42:56,309 --> 00:43:01,380
for these species where like cure clover

1106
00:42:58,588 --> 00:43:04,438
doesn't have markers or a linkage map or

1107
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:06,539
anything yet and so we're developing a

1108
00:43:04,438 --> 00:43:09,268
linkage map using capture seek from

1109
00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:13,949
Rapid genomics while while also at the

1110
00:43:09,268 --> 00:43:16,318
same time you know eventually we'll make

1111
00:43:13,949 --> 00:43:17,999
a targeted sequencing panel from the

1112
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:20,068
linkage map choosing markers randomly

1113
00:43:17,998 --> 00:43:23,968
distributed across those linkage groups

1114
00:43:20,068 --> 00:43:27,268
to make a target panel for the genotype

1115
00:43:23,969 --> 00:43:30,119
of the training population initially in

1116
00:43:27,268 --> 00:43:32,518
these genomic selection models and so so

1117
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:34,650
that's what I'm doing if you have any

1118
00:43:32,518 --> 00:43:35,779
questions I'd like to hear them thank

1119
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:43,200
you

1120
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:45,099
[Applause]

1121
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:46,868
thanks for your presentation

1122
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:49,420
I was wondering out how long you

1123
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:51,910
envision the alfalfa to be president in

1124
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:53,380
an inner crop system like that it seems

1125
00:43:51,909 --> 00:43:58,389
like the intermediate wheat grass could

1126
00:43:53,380 --> 00:44:01,000
out outlast the Alpha by quite a bit so

1127
00:43:58,389 --> 00:44:04,328
just wondering what you had in mind yeah

1128
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,949
so so far we've observed animate wheat

1129
00:44:04,329 --> 00:44:08,260
grass is that we have declining yields

1130
00:44:05,949 --> 00:44:11,348
after you know the second third year I

1131
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:14,319
mean depending where you're at is gonna

1132
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:17,109
determine how long that crops sitting is

1133
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:18,460
gonna be a part of your rotation so it

1134
00:44:17,108 --> 00:44:20,528
might not have to be more than four or

1135
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:22,389
five years the one nice thing about the

1136
00:44:20,528 --> 00:44:25,989
way we're imagining it is that we allow

1137
00:44:22,389 --> 00:44:28,659
time for accumulation of carbohydrates

1138
00:44:25,989 --> 00:44:30,879
in the root grounds to increase the

1139
00:44:28,659 --> 00:44:32,139
persistence of our alfalfa over time and

1140
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,150
so we hope that it's going to stay there

1141
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:36,368
and by you know not actively cutting it

1142
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:38,528
the five times that we would in a normal

1143
00:44:36,369 --> 00:44:41,079
year that's gonna help with the system a

1144
00:44:38,528 --> 00:44:42,548
little bit and obviously persistence is

1145
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:44,920
part of the selection procedure so

1146
00:44:42,548 --> 00:44:47,018
that's why we're really measuring three

1147
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:49,210
years of phenotypic data before we make

1148
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:50,528
selections that were making sure that we

1149
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:53,190
select plants that are really performing

1150
00:44:50,528 --> 00:44:55,019
in that way

1151
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:56,940
and and things like cure clover for

1152
00:44:55,019 --> 00:44:58,829
example it could be a better candidate

1153
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:02,280
and we haven't really chosen yet cure

1154
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:04,769
clover has this rhizomatous growth it's

1155
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,030
it's extremely persistent and it might

1156
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:08,338
stay there longer in the system but

1157
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:10,319
turns and cure clover both have these

1158
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:12,449
really fibrous above-ground root systems

1159
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:15,088
that may end up competing more we don't

1160
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:17,068
really know that my also you know how

1161
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:18,838
allow for this interaction and nitrogen

1162
00:45:17,068 --> 00:45:20,338
transfer to occur but we're learning

1163
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:28,769
that through the breeding at the same

1164
00:45:20,338 --> 00:45:31,019
time so yep hey when do you expect due

1165
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:35,038
to peak viability for the ability to

1166
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:37,170
cooperate with the other species in your

1167
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:38,940
interpreting yeah so that was one of the

1168
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:41,670
goals for this sort of pre breeding

1169
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:43,200
plant these other varieties in the

1170
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:44,880
system so right now we have about thirty

1171
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:46,679
varieties planted about alpha at least

1172
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:50,280
with intermediate wheat grass around the

1173
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:52,318
country hoping to see you know is there

1174
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,150
genetic and phenotypic variation does

1175
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:55,798
the currents or intermediate grass

1176
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:57,000
respond differently and you plan

1177
00:45:55,798 --> 00:45:58,739
different varieties between it so that's

1178
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,690
like the first experiment right if

1179
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:02,729
nothing if we use the most divergent

1180
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:04,318
phenotypic variation that we have in

1181
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:06,990
varieties in that experiment and there's

1182
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:08,338
no difference maybe we have to go the

1183
00:46:06,989 --> 00:46:10,048
opposite direction maybe there's

1184
00:46:08,338 --> 00:46:12,630
something we need to be selecting for an

1185
00:46:10,048 --> 00:46:14,190
intermediate wheat grass but so far

1186
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:15,930
we've observed quite a bit of variation

1187
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:18,150
and we think greetings gonna work and so

1188
00:46:15,929 --> 00:46:22,348
it's at least for adaptation to climate

1189
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:24,389
so in Wisconsin the alfalfa was out

1190
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:25,920
competing in Wisconsin Minnesota both

1191
00:46:24,389 --> 00:46:27,808
alpha was out competing the internet

1192
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,450
wheatgrass quite a bit in the

1193
00:46:27,809 --> 00:46:31,890
establishment year in Kansas it was the

1194
00:46:30,449 --> 00:46:33,808
opposite so if we look at like biomass

1195
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:36,179
ratios the alfalfa des enemy at

1196
00:46:33,809 --> 00:46:39,028
wheatgrass biomass ratio it's like two

1197
00:46:36,179 --> 00:46:41,848
to on and Wisconsin in like one to two

1198
00:46:39,028 --> 00:46:44,130
in Kansas so it's the exact opposite and

1199
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:45,510
if we go further and try to figure out

1200
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:47,670
okay what is it about these varieties

1201
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:50,010
that's pausing that fall dormancy seems

1202
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:52,588
to be key so in now alpha we have this

1203
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:54,809
range as a fall dormancy that are we

1204
00:46:52,588 --> 00:46:56,369
expect controlled by photo period

1205
00:46:54,809 --> 00:46:57,720
sensitivity and so they're gonna start

1206
00:46:56,369 --> 00:47:01,500
growing at a certain time of the year

1207
00:46:57,719 --> 00:47:02,909
and grasses have some photo Pierson's TV

1208
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,730
but they're also more growing degree

1209
00:47:02,909 --> 00:47:07,288
dependent and so we accumulate growing

1210
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:08,909
degree days and photo period differently

1211
00:47:07,289 --> 00:47:12,150
in both environments so we can imagine

1212
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:13,920
at some point in time you know making

1213
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:16,139
sure we overlap the phenology of those

1214
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,059
two things just right so that we can

1215
00:47:16,139 --> 00:47:19,710
reduce competition or increase

1216
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:22,010
compatibility however you want to look

1217
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:22,010
at it

1218
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:29,079
so this is really related to what you're

1219
00:47:26,929 --> 00:47:31,098
just talking about is that what about

1220
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:31,760
undesirable species since you're not

1221
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:34,519
tilling

1222
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,150
what about weeds nutgrass you know all

1223
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:41,780
these other kinds of things that incur

1224
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:44,480
problem fields yeah so so far what we've

1225
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:48,349
seen that's a pretty big problem the

1226
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:50,298
first year of our establishment but most

1227
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:52,700
of the weeds when we think about them in

1228
00:47:50,298 --> 00:47:54,858
our cropping systems right now are also

1229
00:47:52,699 --> 00:47:56,179
annuals that are adapted to using all

1230
00:47:54,858 --> 00:47:59,769
the resources really quickly and growing

1231
00:47:56,179 --> 00:48:03,230
really quickly in these early

1232
00:47:59,769 --> 00:48:05,480
successional ecosystems and so what

1233
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:07,338
we're finding to some extent is that

1234
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,650
when you put a big perennial grass there

1235
00:48:07,338 --> 00:48:11,838
and these other perennial the game

1236
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:13,780
species especially the rhizomatous ones

1237
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:16,548
they're gonna they out-compete the weeds

1238
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:18,140
fairly quickly as we move up this

1239
00:48:16,548 --> 00:48:20,420
successional gradient in our cropping

1240
00:48:18,139 --> 00:48:23,440
system we're gonna have problems with

1241
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:26,480
things like trees and with things like

1242
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,490
other you know perennial species that

1243
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,670
don't really take hold in our cropping

1244
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:33,108
systems the way we grow them right now

1245
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:35,269
but we haven't had problems with you

1246
00:48:33,108 --> 00:48:37,239
know like the Palmer amaranth sand the

1247
00:48:35,269 --> 00:48:39,650
things like that after the first year

1248
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:43,279
and so we don't know what's gonna happen

1249
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:45,289
right this is the new frontier so we can

1250
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,298
think about continuing to go along

1251
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:49,548
password' to explore things that you

1252
00:48:47,298 --> 00:48:50,809
know we've overlooked as humans for the

1253
00:48:49,548 --> 00:48:53,030
last 10,000 years we've kind of

1254
00:48:50,809 --> 00:48:55,940
overlooked this idea of having perennial

1255
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:58,700
grain crops and it's somewhere that you

1256
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:00,409
know we see how things function in our

1257
00:48:58,699 --> 00:49:03,669
earth systems right now that we need to

1258
00:49:00,409 --> 00:49:03,670
begin exploring in more detail

1259
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:08,880
so I think the the perennial Lupin idea

1260
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,740
is kind of interesting I know that for

1261
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:15,539
annual lupin production there's issues

1262
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:16,769
with anti Nutritionals so in your if

1263
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:17,759
you're looking at lupins is this

1264
00:49:16,769 --> 00:49:19,650
something you would want to look at

1265
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,290
sooner rather than later because it's

1266
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:25,260
such a big potential roadblock to grain

1267
00:49:22,289 --> 00:49:29,009
usage yeah so we are starting

1268
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:30,800
collaborations my little circle diagram

1269
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:33,330
are showing you where we're actually

1270
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:36,060
phenotyping we're doing some aspect work

1271
00:49:33,329 --> 00:49:39,469
to look at alkaloid profile so there's

1272
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:44,190
our cloyd's and lupins that are toxic to

1273
00:49:39,469 --> 00:49:45,269
mammals and other things one of the

1274
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:47,760
things that's really interesting about

1275
00:49:45,269 --> 00:49:49,829
it so we had three species of lupins

1276
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,810
that were domesticated in Eden for

1277
00:49:49,829 --> 00:49:53,460
thousands of years with the alkaloids

1278
00:49:51,809 --> 00:49:55,139
there was always a most of them are

1279
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:57,360
water-soluble and heat sensitive and so

1280
00:49:55,139 --> 00:49:59,099
there was a processing step to removing

1281
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:00,900
the alkaloids and they were kind of nice

1282
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:04,170
to have there because they provide sort

1283
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:08,880
of anti herbivore in those cropping

1284
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:11,250
systems and we've now used mutagenesis

1285
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,500
three times and removed the alkaloid by

1286
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:16,800
synthesis pathway basically it doesn't

1287
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:19,500
function anymore and the lupins that

1288
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:21,450
we're cultivating now especially in

1289
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:23,429
Australia so all the lupins in Australia

1290
00:50:21,449 --> 00:50:25,349
are non bitter types the sweet types

1291
00:50:23,429 --> 00:50:27,119
they don't produce alkaloids in Europe

1292
00:50:25,349 --> 00:50:29,519
we still have a lot of the bitter types

1293
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:33,000
that are grown and so if you buy like

1294
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:34,530
zucchini beans in Italy or in Palestine

1295
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,840
we're just where those are all actually

1296
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:39,450
soaked for multiple days before they're

1297
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:41,130
fed to you so that's a really good

1298
00:50:39,449 --> 00:50:43,379
question to think about you know I'm

1299
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:45,809
starting breeding potential new species

1300
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,710
is it something I should get rid of or

1301
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:49,409
is this something that I should take

1302
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:52,380
advantage of in designing this crop and

1303
00:50:49,409 --> 00:50:53,730
in what sort of food system do you need

1304
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:55,769
to have to control that and so in

1305
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:57,480
Australia they have a law that you can

1306
00:50:55,769 --> 00:50:59,670
only have the non bitter types because

1307
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:02,190
they don't want anyone to you know have

1308
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:04,889
have the chance of eating something that

1309
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:06,750
is high in alkaloids in Europe there's

1310
00:51:04,889 --> 00:51:09,239
no laws and so everything has to be

1311
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:10,710
processed this kind of the same way I'm

1312
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:11,459
treated like they might have alkaloids

1313
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:13,500
in them

1314
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:14,789
and there's all these fascinating things

1315
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:17,130
like when we talk about high-value

1316
00:51:14,789 --> 00:51:19,650
products you know alkaloids are

1317
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:21,240
important in you know for medicinal uses

1318
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:23,730
in etc and so there might be a whole

1319
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:25,558
industries about you know actually

1320
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:26,929
taking the alkaloids out of the lupins

1321
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:32,150
and using them as a secondary product

1322
00:51:26,929 --> 00:51:32,149
using the proteins for human consumption

1323
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:40,639
other questions do we have one on Zoom

1324
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:50,369
okay we have a question from Chris

1325
00:51:42,989 --> 00:51:52,949
Smallwood Oh uh-huh

1326
00:51:50,369 --> 00:51:54,480
what are some challenges he faced with

1327
00:51:52,949 --> 00:51:55,889
product development using these

1328
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:01,349
perennial crops and what are some

1329
00:51:55,889 --> 00:52:06,690
successes you've had yeah so we've done

1330
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:08,640
no product development so far and and

1331
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:10,079
this is because I'm still trying to

1332
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:11,219
decide what what we're gonna do with it

1333
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,079
but we have been doing product

1334
00:52:11,219 --> 00:52:15,328
development for other grains at the land

1335
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:17,130
Institute so intermediate wheat grass is

1336
00:52:15,329 --> 00:52:19,980
in this pre commercialization stage

1337
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:23,280
under the name the grain sold under the

1338
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:25,679
name Kern's a-- and we just hired a

1339
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:31,589
commercialization manager to oversee

1340
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:34,889
that process and so far there's there's

1341
00:52:31,588 --> 00:52:37,858
way more demand and supply available so

1342
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:39,568
we're in this unique state a time where

1343
00:52:37,858 --> 00:52:41,519
there's so much demand that we can't

1344
00:52:39,568 --> 00:52:43,920
produce enough seed performers to plants

1345
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:46,019
because we're trying to have income to

1346
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:49,349
support the research and etc by selling

1347
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:51,088
the grain to people to eat so hopefully

1348
00:52:49,349 --> 00:52:54,000
what we imagine is that people begin

1349
00:52:51,088 --> 00:52:55,920
valuing like the plant-based proteins

1350
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,199
that we were talking about people begin

1351
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,088
valuing things because of the impact

1352
00:52:58,199 --> 00:53:02,789
that they have on our environment people

1353
00:53:00,088 --> 00:53:06,358
can pay a premium for those things in

1354
00:53:02,789 --> 00:53:08,940
the future we we need to do a whole lot

1355
00:53:06,358 --> 00:53:10,679
of food safety research before I can

1356
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:12,530
release anything so a current

1357
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:15,269
intermediate wheatgrass has gone through

1358
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:17,329
iterative rounds of applying for these

1359
00:53:15,269 --> 00:53:19,650
kind of generally regarded as safe

1360
00:53:17,329 --> 00:53:22,470
ingredients so that they can be

1361
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:24,750
registered for use in the US alfalfa is

1362
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:26,099
a really nice candidate also and lupins

1363
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:29,840
because it's already lupins there so

1364
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:32,969
they already have some of those statuses

1365
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:38,910
which which hopefully helps someday in

1366
00:53:32,969 --> 00:53:42,809
that process any other questions I have

1367
00:53:38,909 --> 00:53:45,629
a question yeah thinking about sort of

1368
00:53:42,809 --> 00:53:48,449
how you might transition from annual

1369
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:51,210
systems to these more diverse perennial

1370
00:53:48,449 --> 00:53:53,339
systems how do you think it's the best

1371
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:55,320
strategy to go about that what sort of

1372
00:53:53,340 --> 00:54:00,990
compromises are you willing to make and

1373
00:53:55,320 --> 00:54:02,850
what are you yeah so you know one of the

1374
00:54:00,989 --> 00:54:05,369
reasons that I was that we're pushing

1375
00:54:02,849 --> 00:54:08,819
towards these dual use you know Forge

1376
00:54:05,369 --> 00:54:10,289
grain systems is that we are

1377
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:12,150
compromising right now we're leasing

1378
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:13,619
intermediate we crest as a grain crop

1379
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:17,610
we're not gonna achieve the same yields

1380
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:19,289
as wheat we can you know producing

1381
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:22,200
respectable amounts if there's a premium

1382
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:27,269
value for the for the grain is one way

1383
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:29,189
to move move in that direction and one

1384
00:54:27,269 --> 00:54:31,230
of the compromises we're gonna make is

1385
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:33,059
is probably in the amount of

1386
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:35,070
productivity and this is just the way it

1387
00:54:33,059 --> 00:54:37,789
is right so anything about wheat it's

1388
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:41,970
got like a 10,000 year head start

1389
00:54:37,789 --> 00:54:43,469
we need to envision right 2050 is this

1390
00:54:41,969 --> 00:54:45,569
number that we throw out about how are

1391
00:54:43,469 --> 00:54:47,219
you gonna feed people in 2050 but we

1392
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:51,990
just need to think about feeding people

1393
00:54:47,219 --> 00:54:53,429
in 20 120 150 and what are we going to

1394
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:55,439
do to solve these problems that are

1395
00:54:53,429 --> 00:54:59,190
pressing right now we already have upset

1396
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:00,599
biogeochemical systems in the US we need

1397
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:02,760
to start thinking about those problems

1398
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:04,380
as well and so if I don't release

1399
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:06,180
something if there's no printing a

1400
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:08,099
legume crop in the next 10 years I don't

1401
00:55:06,179 --> 00:55:09,659
know if that's a problem we really need

1402
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:11,429
them at some point in time someone needs

1403
00:55:09,659 --> 00:55:13,619
to start working on them and it

1404
00:55:11,429 --> 00:55:16,079
definitely has to not be a me it's got

1405
00:55:13,619 --> 00:55:18,329
to be a we like we know that there's no

1406
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:20,460
chance that any of these pretty legume

1407
00:55:18,329 --> 00:55:23,340
species can exist or perennial green

1408
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:24,990
crops etc without having a larger you

1409
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:26,640
know scientific public and private

1410
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:28,629
interest and investment in the

1411
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:30,420
development of these crops

1412
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:35,490
[Music]

1413
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:35,490
okay with that let's think Brendan again

1414
00:55:36,358 --> 00:55:45,179
this has been a production of Cornell

1415
00:55:39,429 --> 00:55:45,179
University on the web at Cornell edu
