1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,960
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,960
university

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,320
um as don mentioned i was really lucky

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,839
in that i got to

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,480
do part of my dream award

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,278
uh i started in january and things only

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,960
started

8
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,719
getting interesting when covet was

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,679
starting to get interesting

10
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,439
but i did manage to learn a lot from

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:31,439
coffee and i just want to share

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,599
some of that with you um today

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,599
so

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,640
this was my initial plan was my husband

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,480
and i were going to

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,120
travel down to mexico

17
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,078
and hopefully meet some farmers who are

18
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,759
growing organic

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:53,039
coffee organic coffee is um

20
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:55,439
one of the biggest growing areas of

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,239
coffee in in terms of the market share

22
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,679
that it has and the mexican farmers have

23
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,599
been doing it

24
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:04,000
for many years and they are probably the

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,280
most successful organic coffee growers

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,879
so i wanted to go and meet them and see

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,560
what i could learn from them

28
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,478
and like i said just as we were getting

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,560
to the southern part of mexico

30
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,239
in chiapas covered with cerny get

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,000
interesting

32
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,478
the original plan was that we were going

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,400
to travel to colombia

34
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,519
to meet up with some organic growers

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,200
there as well

36
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,599
and then we managed to make some

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,320
contacts in peru so we were hoping to

38
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,438
get

39
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,359
to peru as well but what ended up

40
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:36,879
happening was

41
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:40,078
we drove all the way down to tapachula

42
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:43,519
which is down in the south

43
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:45,199
very close to guatemala and on march

44
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:48,078
12th we decided you know what

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,520
it's getting kind of weird uh mexican

46
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,919
government was starting to shut down

47
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,599
certain institutions and

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,280
things like museums and universities

49
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,679
were starting to close and we didn't

50
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,640
want to

51
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,479
get stuck so we decided to head back to

52
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,399
the states

53
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:08,080
and a couple of days later

54
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:10,399
we were spending the night with a friend

55
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,400
in san luis potosi and we heard that the

56
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,120
colombian border had shut down and they

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,599
weren't taking

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,000
any travelers anymore to try to keep the

59
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,919
virus under control so

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,360
we had rented out our ithaca house we

61
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,199
couldn't come back here

62
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,720
we couldn't get to colombia which was

63
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:28,000
the initial plan

64
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:30,000
so we decided well let's just spend

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,680
some time with my sister in rural

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,519
sinaloa because

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,519
that sounded like a safer option than

68
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,360
coming back to upstate new york given

69
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:42,480
kobe so this is a picture of our car

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,760
in um in

71
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:48,479
a little town called amburgo in

72
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,318
chiapas which is a couple of kilometers

73
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:54,639
north of

74
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:57,518
of guatemala so

75
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,359
fortunately before all of this i took

76
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,680
advantage of the smart

77
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,879
program which is hosted in the dyson

78
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,120
school

79
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,239
and it's a class that happens over

80
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,640
winter break

81
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,840
where as the name implies student-led

82
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:12,958
multi-disciplinary research teams come

83
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,519
together

84
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:20,878
and basically do a consulting

85
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:25,039
project for an agribusiness in

86
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:27,840
what they call a developing economy and

87
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,840
um with my former office mate marie

88
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,840
swetzler who is a cornell grad

89
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,878
we organized a trip down there because

90
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,959
we thought oh we can bring

91
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:41,919
relatively low cost easy soil testing

92
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,199
um a little soil package that we put

93
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,518
together we would do

94
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,039
a ph test and we would do an active

95
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,640
carbon test and we would talk to the

96
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,560
farmers about how

97
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,919
their management of the farms could

98
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,039
impact

99
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:58,559
their soil quality and

100
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:02,400
we met a lovely organization

101
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,560
um but sorry that skipped um

102
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,319
but we we learned a lot more than than

103
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,840
we were able to give back to them

104
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:12,318
and this

105
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,640
experience inspired my dreary trip in

106
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,798
that i wanted to

107
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,879
fully grasp what it is that is limiting

108
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:22,478
coffee farmers

109
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:24,478
nowadays so in case um

110
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:27,120
people don't know i'm gonna give a

111
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:30,319
little crash course in what coffee is

112
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,040
in the horticultural sense of the crop

113
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,839
so most of what we know as coffee is a

114
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,479
species called kofia arabica

115
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,319
which is pictured here next to my very

116
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,240
tall husband and as you can see

117
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,360
it can grow to be a pretty large bush it

118
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,639
grows up to

119
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,280
around nine meters in the wild it's

120
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:53,360
originally from the highlands

121
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:56,000
of ethiopia where it is a an understory

122
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,800
shrub so it grows in pretty dense

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,879
forests

124
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,960
it doesn't like it too warm and it

125
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,519
doesn't like it too cold

126
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:06,000
so the temperature ideals range between

127
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,240
15 and 24 degrees celsius it definitely

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,560
cannot stand any frost

129
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,360
and this makes it ideal to grow in the

130
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,839
highlands in the tropics

131
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,879
um it's also really tied to

132
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,560
precipitation

133
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:23,279
in terms of flowering and

134
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,280
um an interesting fact it's an aloe

135
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,079
tetraploid which means that it has

136
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,359
it the species arose as a hybridization

137
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,319
event between

138
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,000
coffea canefera which is another coffee

139
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,560
crop that we actually consume

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,600
and coffee euglenoides which is not a

141
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,959
crop

142
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,520
and the result kofi arabica

143
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,120
kept two complete copies of both of

144
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,439
those genomes

145
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,478
um it is the only polyploid species in

146
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,959
the genus

147
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,000
it is self-pollinating which makes it

148
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,198
relatively easy

149
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,038
to propagate and each flower will

150
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,720
produce a droop

151
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,318
which is what we call the coffee cherry

152
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,240
and then those have

153
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,919
usually have two seeds which is what we

154
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,560
call the coffee beans and that's what

155
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:09,680
most people are familiar with it's just

156
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,918
a very slow crop to grow so most farmers

157
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,120
will start their plants from seed

158
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:17,198
and it'll take them six months between

159
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,879
sowing to actually transplanting them in

160
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,800
the field

161
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,478
you won't get a first harvest until two

162
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,639
years after

163
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,879
and then each year after that you'll get

164
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,519
an inflorescence which takes nine months

165
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:32,560
to develop into a fully mature seed

166
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,478
so it is it is actually a really slowly

167
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,160
developing crop and it also means that

168
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,199
as a farmer you need to take care of

169
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,880
these seeds

170
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,038
for a really long time before you can

171
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:45,038
harvest them

172
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:48,318
each plant can live around 20 years but

173
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:51,360
more intensive

174
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,879
management styles will place plants

175
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,879
around every eight to ten years

176
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,559
so like i said coffee grows in the

177
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,400
tropics because of it

178
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,639
the ideal temperature ranges

179
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,279
and brazil is the only country that can

180
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,519
afford to grow it on flat land

181
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:12,638
so they have these huge extensions of

182
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:15,359
perfect altitude perfect temperature

183
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,840
and this has allowed them to have

184
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,199
enormous plantations that are completely

185
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,478
mechanized and completely

186
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,919
everything is done in a really

187
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,279
technological way so you see

188
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:26,879
monocultures

189
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,598
all the same variety everything is

190
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,360
handled in a very intensive way

191
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:34,719
but as you can see in the image to the

192
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:38,319
left that also leads to

193
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,240
harvesting that isn't even so you are

194
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,439
harvesting green beans you're harvesting

195
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,120
red beans and the

196
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,639
ripeness of those beans is going to be

197
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,759
completely different

198
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,199
and that's why colombian coffee became

199
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,400
so famous

200
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,400
because the topography that the rest of

201
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:57,519
latin america has which is these

202
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:59,839
really rough mountains allows for the

203
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,839
right elevation for coffee to grow but

204
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,159
it doesn't allow for mechanization so

205
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:07,679
you can't have mechanical picking here

206
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,319
everything has to be done by hand and

207
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,840
what the latin american countries did is

208
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,039
they capitalized on what would have

209
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,598
otherwise been

210
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,478
a disadvantage right so instead of

211
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:18,399
having these

212
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,478
very efficient plantations as they do in

213
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:24,318
brazil what these countries did was

214
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,318
promote the quality of their coffee

215
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,679
however as i mentioned everything has to

216
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,879
be done by hand so

217
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,200
labor is incredibly important in

218
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,080
coffee production and these are actual

219
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,800
pictures

220
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,200
of last year's harvest in colombia from

221
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,838
this

222
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,278
um great article but i just want to

223
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,200
point out that

224
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,958
the ripeness of the cherries is very

225
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,920
even what you can see in the basket in

226
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,679
the top left

227
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:52,319
is that all the beans are red and ripe

228
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,278
and there's actually some farms where

229
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,160
the pickers will

230
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,360
paint their thumb nails red so that they

231
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,759
can match up

232
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,240
the thumbnails to the cherries that

233
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,240
they're picking

234
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,800
so this is the organization that we

235
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,120
worked with through the smart programs

236
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,319
their name is federacion campesina del

237
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,600
cauca

238
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,879
and they are a

239
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,440
second tier organization that makes up

240
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,759
around 700 member families

241
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,880
they are all small holders which means

242
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,439
that they

243
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,399
have relatively small farms the average

244
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,959
farm size

245
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,839
in this organization is around maybe

246
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,958
three acres

247
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,680
or 1.5 hectares something like that

248
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:37,679
they promote organic coffee as part of

249
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,759
their mission to improve the livelihood

250
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,679
of local farmers

251
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,519
and they're just they're a wonderful

252
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:44,958
group and that they have really tried to

253
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,639
do

254
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,799
all of it they try to work on the

255
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,399
growing part of it on the quality part

256
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,000
of it on the marketing

257
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,759
maybe even started roasting their own

258
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,799
coffee

259
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,838
and part of the the biggest lesson that

260
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,000
i got from them

261
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,360
is that coffee growers they know what

262
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,879
they're doing they know how to manage

263
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,240
their farms and they know

264
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,320
how to make the right decisions for

265
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,959
their farms the one thing that they do

266
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,600
not have

267
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,599
access to is the market side of it

268
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,958
so they do have a lot of other

269
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,958
challenges and

270
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,039
climate change is just exacerbating all

271
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,919
of them and it is incredible to see

272
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,439
how aware these farmers are of climate

273
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:24,958
change

274
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,320
there isn't a single farmer i've ever

275
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,919
talked to who doesn't mention climate

276
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,959
change as the biggest challenge they

277
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,278
have

278
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:33,119
and one of the consequences of this is

279
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,200
that the coffee berry borer which is

280
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,078
this tiny little beetle

281
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,800
um it likes hot temperatures and it

282
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,439
benefits

283
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:44,399
from hotter years in that it manages to

284
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,399
produce more and more offspring and have

285
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,919
basically it accelerates its life cycle

286
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,480
so you have more generations happening

287
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,599
within

288
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,320
a particular time frame and this is a

289
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,959
picture of

290
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,399
my hand holding a bean that was infested

291
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:59,199
with them

292
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,799
um their life cycle is very interesting

293
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,959
that they very

294
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,278
infrequently mate most of their

295
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,958
reproduction happens through

296
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:09,039
parasitogenesis so the females will

297
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,958
leave the infected being only for a very

298
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:13,759
short period of time

299
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,879
and will find an uninfected being and

300
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:18,639
they bore their

301
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:20,958
way into it lay eggs and then die inside

302
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:23,838
the bean

303
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:25,919
the picture on the right here is a trap

304
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,480
where you have soapy water in the bottom

305
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,519
of this bottle and then in the little

306
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,680
vial you have

307
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,839
a mixture of ethanol and methanol which

308
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,759
attracts them

309
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,600
and they're not very smart they just

310
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,399
fall in there and die

311
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,759
but the they use these traps to keep

312
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,799
track of the population

313
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,600
sizes and the only way to manage this

314
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:48,639
bug really

315
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,839
is cultural so you have to pick every

316
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,919
single bean

317
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,600
that is in the farm if you let any beans

318
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,360
fall to the ground they will just become

319
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,680
breeding grounds for new bugs

320
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,600
because they spend such a short amount

321
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,319
of time outside of the bean

322
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,399
spraying for them is not really an

323
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,680
option

324
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,200
so unless your neighbors and everyone in

325
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,439
your region is working

326
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,278
together to control this bug it can

327
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,079
really become a problem

328
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:16,078
if people leave

329
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,720
ripe beans just lying around for them to

330
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,360
infest

331
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,079
another huge issue that coffee growers

332
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,240
have is coffee

333
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:32,159
leaf rust which is a fungus it is a

334
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:35,519
obligate um oh my god for another word

335
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:37,919
they need a living tissue to reproduce

336
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,720
so they will infect the underside of the

337
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:40,319
leaves

338
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,959
and they create these little spots that

339
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,320
look like rust hence the name

340
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:48,399
and they can propagate ridiculously long

341
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,000
distances and it's really hard to

342
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,879
understand what is

343
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,839
exactly going to cause an outbreak of

344
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,919
rest so it's very hard to control

345
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,120
um there were two particular cases that

346
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,759
kind of stand out

347
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,039
in the history of coffee rust in latin

348
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,000
america

349
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:08,319
in 2008 it devastated colombia and then

350
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,600
in 2011

351
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,200
to 2012 it devastated central america

352
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,000
and they think that

353
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,720
the patterns kind of match up with

354
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,120
greater

355
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,160
metal meteorological patterns so they

356
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,839
think that el nino

357
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,759
fluctuations might be involved in

358
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:28,079
spreading the spores throughout

359
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:31,200
the whole region there's also

360
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,879
a lot of influence on the changes

361
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,240
between daylight and nighttime

362
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:37,439
temperatures

363
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,680
and relative humidity so unfortunately

364
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,560
climate change is just exacerbating the

365
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,278
disease pressure on coffee plants and a

366
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,399
lot of what

367
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:47,919
um conventional coffee plants

368
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,839
coffee plantations will have is

369
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,078
susceptible varieties

370
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,959
and as you can see on the right what

371
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:54,399
ends up happening

372
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,239
is when you have a really bad

373
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,278
infestation your plants lose all their

374
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,519
leaves

375
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:01,278
they don't necessarily die from it but

376
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,320
your crop is definitely affected for the

377
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,320
rest of the year

378
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,919
working with the fct i learned though

379
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,159
that the biggest problem

380
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,319
that coffee growers have is the

381
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,559
fluctuations in the coffee price

382
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,760
because most of the coffee in the world

383
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,799
is still

384
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:24,159
being sold through the stock exchange

385
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,679
and that's terribly unfortunate because

386
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:27,039
the stock exchange doesn't really care

387
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,239
about the weather

388
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:32,639
or how good the production was in one

389
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,720
place versus another so

390
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,879
because of all the financial tools that

391
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,240
people use

392
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,360
trading and futures and all sorts of

393
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,000
speculation

394
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,240
the price that coffee growers get for

395
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,078
their crop is incredibly volatile and

396
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,720
it's really hard for them to plan

397
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:51,278
for the next year so this graph is

398
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,440
showing

399
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:58,000
the prices in dollars per pound that

400
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,480
um people are trading coffee at the

401
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,399
stock

402
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,079
exchange obviously the farmers get a

403
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,679
fraction of this and depending on who

404
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:06,879
they sell their coffee to

405
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:09,919
that fraction can be anywhere from 60

406
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:12,240
of this price to 90 is the highest that

407
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:14,319
i ever heard um

408
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,079
and as you can see the price increased a

409
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,639
little bit during 2012

410
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:20,000
after the coffee leaf rest devastated

411
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,759
central america

412
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
but other than that it just keeps

413
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:26,480
getting lower and lower

414
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,519
so organizations such as fair trade have

415
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,800
come together and said

416
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,720
all right we need to guarantee these

417
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,758
farmers at least a minimum price that

418
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,240
will cover

419
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,120
their production costs and they agreed

420
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,320
on a dollar

421
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,320
40 as the fair trade minimum however

422
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,320
that only applies to farmers that

423
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,360
can afford to sell their coffee to

424
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,320
somebody who

425
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,120
recognizes that they are following the

426
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,120
fair trade

427
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,799
guidelines and they have to be certified

428
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,440
and certifications come at their own

429
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,559
cost

430
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,480
to farmers if you sell organic fair

431
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:59,359
trade certified coffee then you have

432
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,399
a price of 1.70 which is a little bit

433
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,039
better

434
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,480
but then you also need to have access to

435
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:06,879
somebody who will buy your coffee as

436
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,879
such

437
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,480
so ultimately it comes down to financial

438
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,720
sustainability if a coffee farmer is not

439
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,800
making ends meet at the end of the year

440
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,399
they might be viable for a couple of

441
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,838
more years but they can't keep it up in

442
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,320
the long term

443
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:27,279
so um miguel gomez at the dyson school

444
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,639
and his team have been working on what

445
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:32,000
does it actually cost

446
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:35,120
to produce coffee because data are

447
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,320
just ridiculously hard to come up come

448
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,399
come up with in the first place but also

449
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,240
um compare between different systems in

450
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,000
different regions

451
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,600
so they teamed up with fair trade and

452
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,519
the atkinson center and did this

453
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,720
beautiful project where they tracked

454
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,919
how much does it cost to produce a pound

455
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,440
of coffee

456
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,599
and they teamed up with these four

457
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,399
organizations

458
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,480
one was in mexico in honduras in

459
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,078
colombia which happens to be the fcc the

460
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,599
organization i worked with

461
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:07,038
and then one in peru and between them

462
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,558
they gathered 2

463
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:13,199
400 members that their average farm size

464
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:17,199
was 3.5 hectares so that's

465
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:19,839
somewhere around 8 acres

466
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,919
this represents a total volume of more

467
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,798
than 16 million pounds which is a lot of

468
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,720
coffee

469
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,038
most of it is certified fair trade and

470
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,960
most of it is organic so these farmers

471
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:30,480
actually have access to what we would

472
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,400
consider the higher

473
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:37,919
end of the coffee price

474
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:40,000
however what this study found was that

475
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,640
none of these farmers are making enough

476
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,038
money to make their farms viable in the

477
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,038
long term

478
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,159
this graph shows the cost of coffee

479
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,240
production

480
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,519
separated from in in different

481
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,679
categories

482
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,200
so the variable costs are the things

483
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,919
that you don't necessarily have to do

484
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,600
every time

485
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,038
things like you might fertilize this

486
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:00,639
year but not next year

487
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,640
or you may have to invest more in

488
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,320
pesticides

489
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,759
the fixed costs are the things that

490
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:10,558
happen every year things like taxes

491
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,200
labor for the harvest the depreciation

492
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:13,599
cost

493
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,279
includes the cost of okay so you buy a

494
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,678
tractor this year and then

495
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,279
it wears and tears over a year so it

496
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,480
loses value

497
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:25,200
and then the total costs

498
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,960
account for how much it costs to

499
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,120
establish

500
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,200
the coffee farm in the in the in the

501
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,439
first place how much it costs to buy

502
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,240
new seeds things like that that don't

503
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,880
necessarily

504
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,279
happen all the time but that ultimately

505
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,000
make

506
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:41,200
make part of your of your agricultural

507
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,640
business

508
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,720
and then the little red dot in the

509
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,559
middle is the farm gate price that these

510
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,600
coffee growers are getting so even

511
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,200
though

512
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:51,519
most of these people were selling their

513
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,640
coffee as fair trade certified which

514
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,000
would guarantee them that 1.40 minimum

515
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,400
they are not getting that they are

516
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,400
getting a ridiculously lower price

517
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,240
so part of this experience that i've had

518
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,880
with coffee

519
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,000
is meeting all of these small holder

520
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,240
farmers

521
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,640
and around the world we're talking about

522
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,839
25 million people who

523
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:21,520
farm less than 10 hectares and

524
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:24,558
usually fall below the poverty line

525
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:27,038
but many of them have this incredibly

526
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:28,639
strong attachment to their land and

527
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:30,798
their culture they've been farming

528
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,840
coffee for generations

529
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:36,160
um many can trace their coffee ancestry

530
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,319
back to like the 1800s at least the

531
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,519
people i've spoken to in colombia

532
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:44,000
so losing their coffee business

533
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:47,359
is more than just losing their cash crop

534
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,038
it's very tied to their identity

535
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,798
and because they are farmers they're

536
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:53,038
also growing their own food so even

537
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:55,839
though you don't necessarily put a value

538
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,279
on the additional crops that you have

539
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:00,639
you're still feeding your family off of

540
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,639
that so the value that is

541
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:06,240
in a way not um monetized

542
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,799
is is incredible and it's at risk of

543
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,798
being lost

544
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,679
so um i used part of the time on the

545
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,320
drear to participate in this

546
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,320
workshop that was organized by the

547
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,240
university of wagnerhead

548
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:22,000
in collaboration with siat which is a

549
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,200
center for

550
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,599
international tropical agriculture based

551
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,159
in kali colombia

552
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,319
and as you can see many of you might

553
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,919
recognize alyssa pritz and marie

554
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:38,720
swetzland who are cornelians

555
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,840
they brought together these coffee

556
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,240
researchers from

557
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,439
around the world with different

558
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,359
expertise on

559
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,360
pests and on marketing and on

560
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,280
agroforestry systems and they wanted to

561
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,200
diagnose what is going on with coffee

562
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:58,558
growing and what is going to happen

563
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:02,880
to all of these people and all these

564
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:06,079
um landscapes that are changing

565
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:10,559
and we identified six

566
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:16,158
main trends and research needs

567
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:19,918
um for the next decade

568
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,640
um so the first thing that we're seeing

569
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,759
is that

570
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,280
people are substituting their

571
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:24,720
traditional varieties because like i

572
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,480
said traditional varieties are very

573
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,798
susceptible to rust

574
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,880
so if you can have a resistant variety

575
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,879
you are going to simplify

576
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,799
your production costs but also it's

577
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,520
going to make your whole farm a little

578
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:38,480
bit

579
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:41,038
more resilient there's also a big push

580
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,798
towards intensification because

581
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,158
if you can't reduce your costs you have

582
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:50,079
to increase your yields

583
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:50,080
to be to keep financially sustainable

584
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:56,720
there's also a lot of land abandonment

585
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,880
and land use substitution

586
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,759
so you've probably all heard about the

587
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,840
south american

588
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,759
the central american migrations that are

589
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:05,359
happening people are

590
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:08,000
afraid and there's a lot of violence

591
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:10,240
there's very

592
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,599
very few economic opportunities so

593
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,240
people are leaving

594
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,678
their land in the case of colombia

595
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,558
there's huge pressure from

596
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,200
illegal crops on the same lands that

597
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,158
coffee now

598
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,440
occupies there's also been a lot of

599
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,120
expansion of range

600
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,798
into higher elevations because of

601
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,519
climate change so as temperatures get

602
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:29,038
higher

603
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,200
people are pushing higher higher up the

604
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:34,640
mountains threatening

605
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,480
native forests there is also a couple of

606
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,679
countries that had traditionally banned

607
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,640
the growing of coffee

608
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,400
coneferra known as robusta because it's

609
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,159
traditionally known as lower quality

610
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,120
coffee

611
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,120
but they are now starting to allow it

612
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:49,839
and there's also a lot of urbanization

613
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,279
as

614
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:53,199
some of these communities get more

615
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:55,440
wealthy people start leaving the

616
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,360
countryside for the city they decide

617
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,279
to build houses on their farms and so

618
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:01,599
all of this land is being lost

619
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,519
this problem is particularly bad in

620
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,599
costa rica

621
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,038
i'm going to focus on these three trends

622
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:10,399
just because

623
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:12,798
i saw them during my junior trip

624
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,840
um and because i think they're the more

625
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:16,960
general ones

626
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:19,038
to the whole of latin america so

627
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,960
there's a huge problem with traditional

628
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:24,319
coffee varieties and that they are

629
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,319
a genetic bottleneck

630
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,480
and there's absolutely no disease

631
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:32,000
resistance genes in them so

632
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:35,279
most of what we know as

633
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,159
at least arabica coffee comes from the

634
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:40,240
few plants

635
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:43,278
that the europeans back in the

636
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,278
probably 1600s

637
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,439
took from yemen and started bringing to

638
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:49,200
their colonies

639
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,720
in particular to indonesia and to it

640
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,840
with ceylon

641
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,600
and that in itself is already a

642
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:56,798
bottleneck but then the plants that got

643
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:00,000
to latin america

644
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:01,918
are just a substitute of that

645
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,038
so all of the varieties that are now

646
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,919
grown

647
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:07,119
throughout all of latin america come

648
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:12,400
basically

649
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:12,399
from the typica and the bourbon

650
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:18,079
and even though there are a handful of

651
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:21,038
other and people usually

652
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:23,119
will associate the diversity in the bean

653
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:25,278
sizes and colors which you can see in

654
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:27,519
the left hand side

655
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:28,640
with genetic diversity the truth is that

656
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:32,960
these varieties are

657
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:36,159
very similar to each other so

658
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,679
there's been a huge push for

659
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,360
promoting these varieties called

660
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,240
katimores and sarchimores

661
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:43,359
because they come from a wild hybrid

662
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,519
that was found

663
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:50,240
years ago decades ago in indonesia

664
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,400
in an island called timur which is a

665
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,038
hybrid between kofia arabica

666
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,960
and kofia kanaphara and that hybrid

667
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:58,079
actually has disease resistance genes

668
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,558
against

669
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:02,079
coffee leaf rest so people have been

670
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:05,200
introgressing those genes

671
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:06,720
back into the more culturally acceptable

672
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,080
coffee varieties

673
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,919
but there's been a lot of pushback

674
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:12,720
because they are associated with lower

675
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,720
quality products

676
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,599
so like i mentioned before there was a

677
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:21,038
big uh leaf rust outbreak

678
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:23,359
in colombia in 2008

679
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:24,480
where 80 of the coffee was susceptible

680
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:27,839
to rust

681
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,599
and since then the federation of coffee

682
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:30,720
growers in colombia has been pushing

683
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:32,639
really hard

684
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,200
to get people to plant resistant

685
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,960
varieties to the point where in 2018

686
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,400
80 of the coffee in columbia was

687
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,558
resistant to rust

688
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,080
so at least that problem has been kind

689
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:43,839
of taken care of

690
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:45,199
however in speaking with the farmers

691
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:47,119
i've learned that

692
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,319
they don't particularly oops they don't

693
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:49,759
particularly like

694
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:51,519
growing these resistant varieties

695
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,200
because they have other characteristics

696
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:55,599
they're harder to pick

697
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,480
um the beans feel different the sizes

698
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,359
are different

699
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,519
and there's this myth that the quality

700
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:04,719
is inferior

701
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,200
i do want to take a second to um talk

702
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,000
about

703
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,720
the national coffee grove federation in

704
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,880
colombia it's basically it started as a

705
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,640
union of coffee growers

706
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,039
and i want to mention them because

707
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,278
they are the only example i know of

708
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:23,599
where there's a strong institution that

709
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:24,720
is taking care of coffee growers in the

710
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,918
region

711
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,880
and you can probably recognize the logo

712
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,600
they did a incredible marketing campaign

713
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,320
back in the

714
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:36,399
80s where something like 90 percent of

715
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:38,558
people in europe will recognize the logo

716
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,000
as a high quality product

717
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:44,240
and the image in the left is an actual

718
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,880
actor who's this is his real-time

719
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,919
job he is juan valdez he impersonates

720
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,760
this

721
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,200
colombian coffee grower and he carries

722
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:55,038
his meal around

723
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,278
this is at the um

724
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:58,319
the red carpet party that they held for

725
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:01,278
a movie

726
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:03,678
a while ago called bruce almighty where

727
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:05,919
he actually

728
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,240
requests coffee grown in the mountains

729
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,880
of colombia from juan valdez

730
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,278
but the reason i bring it up is because

731
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,679
it's

732
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:14,480
probably the most successful marketing

733
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,720
campaign for

734
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,919
an agricultural product that doesn't yet

735
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,399
have any added

736
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,159
value like colombian coffee is green

737
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:24,239
beans it's not even roasted

738
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,640
and yet everyone everywhere recognizes

739
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,919
it as a high quality product

740
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,960
in fact i learned recently that in 2005

741
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,480
it was the first

742
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:38,159
non-european product to be granted

743
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,640
a protected denomination of origin

744
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,919
so there's essentially champagne and

745
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,840
parmesan cheese

746
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,120
and then there's colombian coffee which

747
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,119
is really impressive

748
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:53,440
so there's been another trend in how

749
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,880
coffee is grown uh it used to be that

750
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,679
coffee was grown

751
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,840
in the understory of a forest that's

752
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,159
where the coffee plants come from

753
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:03,918
and so you can have what is known as

754
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,600
rustic coffee where you just have an

755
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,720
intact forest that you just grow a

756
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:10,719
couple of coffee plants on the bottom of

757
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,278
but it's there's been a strong push

758
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,640
towards intensification which is on the

759
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:18,398
on the lower end of this figure

760
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,919
where you basically have no shade or

761
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:22,558
just a few

762
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,559
shade trees

763
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,399
and this comes in part because if you're

764
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:28,480
in the

765
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:30,158
mountains usually you have a lot of rain

766
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,960
so your plants are going to be light

767
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,720
limited

768
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,480
and if you want to increase your yields

769
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,759
the best thing you can do is increase

770
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,960
the light

771
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,398
access of your plants however

772
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,480
the more shade you have the more

773
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,398
ecosystem services that you have so for

774
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,759
instance there's good data that

775
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:49,119
if you have more birds you're going to

776
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:52,558
have less coffee bean borer pressure

777
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:54,479
if you have more shade it's going to

778
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:56,158
reduce the fluctuations in temperature

779
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,679
and so the leaf rust is going to hit

780
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,720
your coffee less

781
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:03,038
hard you can also have additional

782
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,319
benefits of nitrogen fixation depending

783
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:07,519
on the trees that you use

784
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:09,200
of different soil quality different

785
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:11,918
nutrient cycling

786
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,240
so there's there's a really strong push

787
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,759
especially from academic circles for

788
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:23,440
people to grow coffee under some sort of

789
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:23,440
um agroforest polyculture system

790
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,960
however the um

791
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,558
shift towards growing robusta coffee is

792
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,000
doing the opposite it's pushing for

793
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:37,678
monocultures because

794
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,720
robusta is a really uh hearty plant

795
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,798
it is completely resistant to breast it

796
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,240
can take harsh conditions it can take

797
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:48,960
high temperatures

798
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,960
and exposure and it yields

799
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,519
something like twice as much as an

800
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,440
arabica crop

801
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,639
it also has higher caffeine so it's

802
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,278
preferred

803
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:04,480
for um processed coffee beverages

804
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:07,759
so your pre-made starbucks coffee

805
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,440
and your four loco and your five hour

806
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:11,519
energy drink all of those

807
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,159
caffeine products probably come from

808
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:14,158
robusta

809
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:22,798
so when we were in mexico in the

810
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:23,199
southern part of chiapas we met up with

811
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:27,918
this

812
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:31,120
lovely professor at ekosur which is the

813
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:33,840
their regional university

814
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:35,199
his name is juan barrera and he works on

815
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:37,359
biological control

816
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,120
of coffee bean borer in robusta

817
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:43,678
plantations

818
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:44,398
and one of the things that he showed us

819
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,559
was

820
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,479
the the change so you go from these

821
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,000
beautiful forests to a completely

822
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,759
exposed field with these

823
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,960
enormous robusta plants

824
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,879
usually it's the bigger producers that

825
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,640
are shifting to robusta

826
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:06,080
because the increase in yield is just

827
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,640
really affordable but he also told us

828
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:10,158
that

829
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:13,038
the only buyer in the region is nestle

830
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:15,120
and that presents a problem for the

831
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,839
farmers because they don't trust nestle

832
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,639
so

833
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:19,759
there's also been a lot of resistance to

834
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,240
this

835
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:23,038
and what nestle did was they introduced

836
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,839
four

837
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:27,679
clones of robusta that they figured were

838
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:29,678
optimized for production

839
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,798
but this makes the farmers really

840
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,640
skeptical because

841
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:33,918
they know that they're growing a lower

842
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,200
quality product

843
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,759
which they're not going to be able to

844
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:41,600
sell if nestle one day decides to leave

845
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:41,599
or just to not buy their coffee

846
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:46,720
we did meet this lovely man called fidel

847
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,480
lopez

848
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:53,440
also in the southern region of chiapas

849
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,079
and he has a completely different story

850
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,200
so

851
00:31:54,079 --> 00:32:00,398
he used to grow conventional coffee and

852
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:03,120
when the coffee leaf rest hid his farm

853
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:04,639
in 2012. he decided he just couldn't

854
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:05,518
afford the pesticides so he was going to

855
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,200
let it go

856
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,599
and basically abandoned his farm for a

857
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,159
couple years and then he came back

858
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,398
and he saw his plans and the way he

859
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,880
tells the story is he found these

860
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:18,479
trees that just looked more beautiful

861
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,480
than ever

862
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,640
and so he harvested their seeds and

863
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,159
propagated them and started his coffee

864
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,799
plantation again

865
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,200
and he also decided that he was going to

866
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:29,359
grow

867
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,480
organic coffee because it was safer for

868
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:32,240
his family

869
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,679
so like i mentioned most of these small

870
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,880
holders have

871
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,360
farms that are maybe

872
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,799
four acres and their farms are on their

873
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:42,319
their houses are on them and their

874
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:43,679
children are playing there

875
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:45,918
so nobody wants to be spraying

876
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,759
pesticides constantly

877
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,278
so for a lot of these small holder

878
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,200
farmers the organic

879
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:52,720
certification has the appeal that they

880
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,080
feel like they're safer

881
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,558
and that they're taking care of their

882
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:58,000
little plot of land

883
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:59,599
he decided also that he was going to

884
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,079
start roasting his own coffee

885
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,839
and selling it and he teamed up with his

886
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:05,278
family and now the whole family runs

887
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:07,278
this

888
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:08,480
little company called cafe richilia

889
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:11,038
where they sell

890
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,480
the product that they grow and he says

891
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:13,119
that it's working out really well for

892
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,880
him

893
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:16,879
because he's actually making more money

894
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,278
and this is him showing us one of those

895
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,120
uh

896
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:26,159
wonderful trees that he claims has

897
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:27,439
become resistant to rust

898
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,278
he had at least three different

899
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,919
varieties of coffee

900
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:32,880
he had one that was produced by the

901
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,880
mexican

902
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,200
equivalent to the usda which was an

903
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,519
improved variety resistant to rust

904
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,519
but the others he had were the

905
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,240
traditional susceptible varieties and he

906
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:47,278
claims he has

907
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:50,798
absolutely no rust pressure in his farm

908
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:53,038
uh so one of the latest things that

909
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:53,918
is affecting coffee growers is

910
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:57,440
unfortunately

911
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:59,600
kovid and this is what the

912
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,360
colombian federation of farmers is doing

913
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,759
to try to keep people safe

914
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:04,839
they've taken their traditional logo and

915
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:08,800
transformed it

916
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:10,398
into on the left to keep social distance

917
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,039
and on the right to cover your mouth

918
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:13,039
when you sneeze

919
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,720
i was saying that colombia expects to

920
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,280
have

921
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:26,480
the best harvest ever in 2020

922
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,960
but obviously because

923
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,358
the coffee harvest is so labor intensive

924
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,918
they require a lot of migrant workers to

925
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:33,519
come in

926
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:36,000
and they actually move throughout the

927
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:39,199
whole country so

928
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,679
like i mentioned before coffee

929
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:46,559
blooms right after the rainy season and

930
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,079
because of the way the winds work in

931
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:50,960
colombia there's

932
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,320
very discreet rainy season that starts

933
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,199
at the beginning of the year in the

934
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,399
north

935
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:59,679
and then moves south along the andes

936
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:01,440
and then ends at the southern part of

937
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:04,000
the andes in colombia

938
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,440
at around october and then we'll

939
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,920
basically shift the rain

940
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,679
back north so the middle of the country

941
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,440
has two harvests

942
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:13,679
while the north and the south part have

943
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,760
one and there's this huge

944
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,279
body of migrant workers that just move

945
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,160
with the rains following the coffee

946
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,440
harvest

947
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,879
and obviously covet is a horrible risk

948
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,559
because not only are you putting these

949
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,599
people in risk they're just

950
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:29,599
literally moving it across

951
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,200
another big problem is that because

952
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,240
people are leaving the countryside for

953
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:37,679
the cities it's hard to find laborers

954
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:37,679
and that's one of the

955
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,559
surprising situations in which the very

956
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:45,599
sad

957
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:47,519
situation in venezuela has proved useful

958
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,400
for colombian coffee growers and that

959
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,440
venezuelans now make up a big chunk of

960
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:58,400
the migrant

961
00:35:51,440 --> 00:36:01,599
labors that pick coffee

962
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,240
so anyway um that's all i have

963
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,838
i'm happy to take questions sorry for

964
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:07,039
the introduction the interruption i

965
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:09,279
don't even know what happened

966
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,279
but

967
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:16,959
i know where host is but uh i'm here so

968
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,960
i mean there are the questions for juan

969
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,599
one this is marvin it sounds like with

970
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,358
that narrow genetic diversity

971
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,119
uh the industry's crying out for a

972
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:27,920
breeding program for

973
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:30,079
expanding the diversity of the germplasm

974
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,519
so what's happening around the world

975
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,160
with breeding programs um lots of things

976
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:37,599
there's

977
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:39,920
well first of all there's uh

978
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:43,280
there's a lot of people who are

979
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,519
interested in the wild coffee species

980
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,519
in the forest of ethiopia and apparently

981
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:50,719
there's huge pressure on these forests

982
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,039
um so there's there's a lot of concern

983
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:54,239
that

984
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:55,599
the the source of all this genetic

985
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:58,399
diversity is being lost

986
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,599
because of you know a deforestation an

987
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,280
expansion of

988
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,760
of the agricultural boundaries and all

989
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,960
that stuff um

990
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:10,320
there is a research group from

991
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,358
texas that is working on producing f1

992
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,000
hybrids

993
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:14,639
which is something that coffee growers

994
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
at least

995
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:21,118
to my knowledge do not work with um

996
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,599
because because production costs are so

997
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,680
high

998
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,119
what most growers will do is they will

999
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:26,719
propagate their own plants

1000
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,880
so you grab your seeds from your plant

1001
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:32,239
from the good plants and then you

1002
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,000
start your new plants if you're working

1003
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:36,399
with an f1 hybrid

1004
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,760
you need to you need to buy the seed and

1005
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,519
that is going to

1006
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,359
mean more costs for the computers so

1007
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:46,000
i know that they're promoting this in

1008
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:48,000
mexico and in guatemala

1009
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,320
i haven't heard of an f1 hybrid project

1010
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,320
program in colombia um

1011
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:56,720
the fnc which is the colombian

1012
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,960
coffee union they have a research

1013
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:00,179
program and they've just released a new

1014
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,000
variety

1015
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:04,559
[Music]

1016
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,559
they release varieties i think every

1017
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:09,759
five years or so and they are

1018
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:10,719
very very specialized and regionally so

1019
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,359
they will

1020
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:14,559
release their latest variety it's called

1021
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:16,480
sunny cafe one

1022
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:18,000
but they have a senica for the centers

1023
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,800
and center

1024
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,639
for ourselves so it's very specialized

1025
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,920
in that sense

1026
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:28,078
um there's also

1027
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,079
some people will use rootstock but i've

1028
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,599
only seen this in big plantations

1029
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:36,640
you know 300 hectares or more

1030
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:39,359
where they'll use the robusta rootstock

1031
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:40,719
on arabica's scions and that seems to

1032
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:44,000
work really well

1033
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:48,399
for at least for disease pressure

1034
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:51,679
um i know that they've developed um

1035
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:54,240
a transgenic coffee for resistant to

1036
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:55,679
the coffee bean borer but no one wants

1037
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:58,639
to release that because that immediately

1038
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:01,039
means you lose the european market and

1039
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:04,000
no one's gonna buy it so that's a dead

1040
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:08,159
end unfortunately

1041
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:13,760
um yeah that's that's all i know of

1042
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:16,960
thanks any other questions for juana

1043
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,800
fascinating look at the

1044
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,358
place that we don't generally get to so

1045
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,920
i always enjoyed your

1046
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:26,239
vlogs from uh columbia and wherever you

1047
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,240
were

1048
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,480
so i thank you very much for that i

1049
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,599
think there's some questions on the chat

1050
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,440
okay do you know why fair trade

1051
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,800
guarantees 140

1052
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,800
but growers get less than that

1053
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,838
um yes so

1054
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:48,799
coffee is really complex um a lot of

1055
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,519
growers are really far away

1056
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,200
basically and they need to bring their

1057
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:56,400
coffee to

1058
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:59,358
a on a copy of a

1059
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,880
gathering uh a warehouse where everybody

1060
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:04,480
brings their coffee yet to sell

1061
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,880
right and some people

1062
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,800
so the the values that i presented here

1063
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,599
are what's called

1064
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,960
value at farm gate so you have to

1065
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,440
include transportation

1066
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,800
and the further you are the more that is

1067
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,760
going to cost

1068
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,760
um in particular i can speak for

1069
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,440
colombia the roads are terrible

1070
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,440
and sometimes the distance might not be

1071
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,079
too long but the road is so bad that it

1072
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,240
takes you hours to get there

1073
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,160
so that's a big chunk that gets taken

1074
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:34,639
off the price

1075
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:36,159
in addition most small holders will be

1076
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:37,279
part of an organization and that

1077
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:39,759
organization takes

1078
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,560
its share too so even though the

1079
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,640
organization sells the coffee for 140

1080
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:46,318
they don't pay the growers 140. because

1081
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:47,920
they need they have their own operating

1082
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:50,318
costs and

1083
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,240
whatever in in the case of these four

1084
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:54,199
organizations that were considered in

1085
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:55,679
this study

1086
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:57,118
[Music]

1087
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:58,399
at the end of the year they'll all get

1088
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,400
together and they'll decide all right

1089
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,480
how are we spending this extra money

1090
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,519
that we got from fair trade

1091
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,318
as their premium and they some will say

1092
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:10,800
all right we want dividends or some will

1093
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:13,519
say we want some sort of

1094
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,359
um you know improvement project that

1095
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:17,440
benefits the community so maybe

1096
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:19,519
they'll build a school or they'll build

1097
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:23,358
a processing plant or

1098
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:25,838
something like that um yeah some people

1099
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:26,639
find full fund extension agents some

1100
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:30,639
people will

1101
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:32,838
fund even scholarships for their members

1102
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,400
so it depends a lot on what the

1103
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:38,000
organization

1104
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,960
wants and how they're structured um i

1105
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,519
also know of

1106
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,720
italy which is a big coffee seller in

1107
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:45,920
europe

1108
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:48,719
they also guarantee that they're there

1109
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,358
they buy their coffee at 1 140. but

1110
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:52,000
again

1111
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:52,880
this value was they came up with it kind

1112
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
of

1113
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:58,720
out of nowhere because the cost of

1114
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,679
production are really hard to estimate

1115
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:03,598
um part of one of the smart programs

1116
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:05,440
that i did was trying to

1117
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,680
to come up with what is this cost of

1118
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,519
production and and what we found is it's

1119
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:11,838
really hard because a lot of

1120
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:13,280
a rural economy is still very informal

1121
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:14,318
so there are no receipts there's no

1122
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,000
keeping track

1123
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:17,199
farmers don't like to keep track because

1124
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,559
they don't want to know how much money

1125
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:22,239
they're losing

1126
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:24,078
so it's it's a tricky situation and if

1127
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,598
you're such a big organization as fair

1128
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,280
trade which is in

1129
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,359
every country and almost all crops

1130
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,960
it's hard to come up with a baseline

1131
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:35,759
cost that's going to help

1132
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:38,079
everybody so i hope that answered the

1133
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,079
question

1134
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:44,000
there's another question have you heard

1135
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:46,640
of any progress in the usda

1136
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,480
coffee germ plasma collection to develop

1137
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:49,199
release coffee germplasm with rust

1138
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,240
resistance

1139
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:55,039
and superior cupping quality

1140
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:57,199
i have no idea about the usb coffee

1141
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:59,199
collection i have to admit

1142
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:00,639
i did hear that they found rust in

1143
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:03,358
hawaii which is really sad

1144
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:05,679
but that's all i know unfortunately

1145
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:05,679
sorry

1146
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,838
i have a question i was wondering um

1147
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:16,000
this last picture here kind of looks

1148
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:19,440
like a very diversified

1149
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,800
farm um and i was wondering what you

1150
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,838
think the future holds for doing more

1151
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,480
regenerative types of agriculture where

1152
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:31,199
more of the ground is actually covered

1153
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,000
with crops or if you know the future

1154
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,399
really holds

1155
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,760
us cutting more and more of our rain

1156
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,079
forest down

1157
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,400
and what the irrigation schemes look

1158
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:43,680
like especially as water becomes more

1159
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:47,280
scarce as the water cycle is disrupted

1160
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:49,279
that's a great question um so one of the

1161
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,280
things that successful coffee farmers

1162
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,319
are doing is diversifying

1163
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,119
and not necessarily separating their

1164
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:57,119
crops but

1165
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,720
incorporating everything so as you can

1166
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,920
see here there's pineapples and then the

1167
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,919
foreground there's

1168
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,000
banana trees and the coffee in the

1169
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,880
middle um

1170
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
that's that's a strategy that's proven

1171
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,599
very successful

1172
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,480
more than than for let's say ecosystem

1173
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,640
services for

1174
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,800
food security because a lot of

1175
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:19,118
smallholder coffee farmers are very food

1176
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,680
insecure

1177
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,800
so a lot of organizations are promoting

1178
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:25,118
diversification

1179
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,119
as a strategy to increase food security

1180
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,680
and then it comes with benefits of

1181
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:31,440
better soil quality and other things in

1182
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:35,598
terms of

1183
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:38,000
more broader scale things there's

1184
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:40,240
a couple of good examples of payments

1185
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,318
for ecosystem services to coffee farmers

1186
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:44,559
in costa rica

1187
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:46,559
but they tend to miss the smallholders

1188
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:48,960
it tends to be the bigger

1189
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,078
farms that can afford to you know

1190
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,358
dedicate half the farm

1191
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:55,920
to forest and then get paid for that um

1192
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:57,119
if you only have a couple of acres you

1193
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,480
can't afford to not

1194
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,160
farm at all because then you just don't

1195
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,559
make enough money

1196
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:07,679
um so from a research perspective

1197
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:08,400
there is a big push for agroforestry

1198
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:10,879
systems

1199
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,519
in that you have a forest it serves up a

1200
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,400
function

1201
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:16,159
and you can select species that are are

1202
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,000
valuable for wood for instance if you

1203
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:19,358
have a bad coffee here you can cut down

1204
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,920
your trees and sell them and you're not

1205
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:23,679
going to

1206
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:26,800
starve but it's it's hard because

1207
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:29,279
until we start valuing the

1208
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,800
ecosystem services such as carbon

1209
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,519
sequestration

1210
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,960
on a global level it's just not no one's

1211
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:36,239
going to pay the farmer and if the

1212
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,280
farmer doesn't get paid

1213
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,318
then ultimately they're not they're not

1214
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,440
successful they won't

1215
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:43,440
they won't be sustainable

1216
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,599
thank you i hope that answered the

1217
