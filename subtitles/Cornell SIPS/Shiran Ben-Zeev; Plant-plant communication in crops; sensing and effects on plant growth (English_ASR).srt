1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,400
University yeah so um thanks Luke for

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:16,640
the introduction and um yeah so I I want

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,160
to share some of what I've been doing uh

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,439
and listening to Luke and and preparing

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,480
for this uh if you sum up everything I

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,920
did for a short period of time it seems

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,240
like I've done a lot of things and

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,599
that's a a really nice thing to reflect

10
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,598
on um so

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:40,399
I uh I did make this plan for what I

12
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:42,799
wanted to touch on today

13
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,079
um I prepared for this and I ran this a

14
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,119
bunch of times so I can either either go

15
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:49,039
really quickly and be uh way too quick

16
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,919
or it might be a little bit over so I'll

17
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,079
try and be cognizant of time I apologize

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,079
in advance for any discrepancies but

19
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:57,600
what I want to do is I I want to talk a

20
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,600
little bit about how I got to do what

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,160
I'm doing and some of the stuff I did

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,599
during PhD which was working on te and

23
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:08,798
then how that led to plent plent

24
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:11,199
interactions and then working on stuff

25
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,479
we've done recently things we are doing

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,240
and things we hope to do um and yeah I'm

27
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:19,959
going to hope to leave a lot of time for

28
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:22,239
questions uh so far everyone I've in

29
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:23,719
interacted with here has been both kind

30
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:28,599
and smart so I I really want to hear

31
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:32,840
what you all have to say um so I go up

32
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:34,078
there uh I've been working on a farm

33
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,399
since I

34
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:41,478
was 11 I've been driving tractors for a

35
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:43,280
very long time um and this

36
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:45,879
was I

37
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,640
guess uh pretty diverse I Ved on

38
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:50,759
multiple crops but uh working on crops

39
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,960
is actually not where my interest in

40
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:57,118
plans plants came from I fell in love

41
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:59,359
with plants here uh these are meadows

42
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:03,000
that are very close to my home where I

43
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:04,519
uh would hike as a child and and uh this

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,520
is one of my favorite places in the

45
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:10,199
world and when you look at where I got

46
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,480
interested in plants you can see just

47
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,639
how many plants grow here together so in

48
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:18,199
a sharp contrast to the monoculture you

49
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:20,958
see behind of of grapes and and almonds

50
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:22,878
and olives and all that uh you have

51
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,640
legumes here and cereals here and a

52
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,878
whole bunch of other genres and and

53
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,359
families all growing together and and

54
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,840
they make it work and I think that's

55
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,040
what Mak

56
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,840
them as much as us what makes them

57
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,079
appealing is how diverse they are how

58
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,120
interesting they are and how they well

59
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,239
how they get

60
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:45,480
along um but there really wasn't a study

61
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:50,759
The Meadows behind your house class so I

62
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:53,079
went into crop science instead and uh so

63
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:55,318
I started learning about te as an

64
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,440
undergrad working in uh Professor Yoshua

65
00:02:55,318 --> 00:03:00,079
sanga's Lab at the Hebrew

66
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,199
University and

67
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,200
very early on it picked my interest

68
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:07,439
because um I found out that te has a

69
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,719
very large demand in Israel which is not

70
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,598
where it's endemic to te is a Serial cop

71
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:16,439
that's endemic to Ethiopia if any of you

72
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:19,878
uh are unfamiliar and um in the early

73
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:22,079
90s there was a big uh wave of rep

74
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:24,280
patriotism of uh Jews who came from

75
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,120
Ethiopia to Israel and they contined to

76
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,719
consume te as their

77
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:32,280
staple being recent immigrants this

78
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:34,519
wasn't the best well off population and

79
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,919
at the same time the cost they paid for

80
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:41,840
the staple flour was three times as high

81
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:43,719
as that of wheat flour which to us it

82
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,360
made a screen to High Heavens and we got

83
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:46,359
interested in lowering the price by

84
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,799
producing it

85
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,599
locally and on top of that farmers in

86
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,360
Israel as well as here always needed

87
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,919
more corops in the rotation we always

88
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,079
need more things to grow we need the

89
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:01,359
diversity we need those changes and

90
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:04,560
there was a specific need for a short

91
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,319
season seral crop that can utilize

92
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,280
excess nutrients and water from the soil

93
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:12,280
for specific Farmers specifically those

94
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,959
who grew carrots and potatoes they had a

95
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,279
large interest in the so with all that

96
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,000
in mind we said hey let's work on it

97
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:23,918
let's see if we can go with

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,959
Ean and starting off we had some ideas

99
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:28,079
of how TEF grew but we had a lot of

100
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:31,079
questions and all of these were

101
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:34,038
nonobvious when we started started so we

102
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:35,478
were going off of some ideas we got from

103
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:38,478
people who came from Ethiopia and were

104
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:41,279
farmers previously and I spent

105
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:47,079
substantial amounts of time trying to

106
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:49,319
adapt practices used in small holder um

107
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:51,478
traditional farming in Ethiopia to

108
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:53,719
highly mechanized irrigated agriculture

109
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:56,639
like the type we have and we had to

110
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:00,120
answer each of this so literally which

111
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,478
planter to use for these tiny seeds when

112
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,918
to sew how to irrigate we use sprinklers

113
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:08,519
or pivots uh how do we even get the

114
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:11,519
right yields what sort of genetics we

115
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:13,439
needed for those yields um and then

116
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,680
later on WE focused on lodging which I'm

117
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,000
going to touch on heavily in this and

118
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,240
then we also had the question of how to

119
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,839
harvest which actually uh became the

120
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,800
easiest one to answer I went on YouTube

121
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:26,439
I Googled te and we found a video from

122
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,840
Idaho and pl I wish everything was that

123
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:32,038
easy um but everything else we had to C

124
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,918
so we literally had to ask that question

125
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:36,560
and so um we did get some answers I

126
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,839
won't go into the whole process of this

127
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,319
but we did find that if we so in early

128
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:43,439
spring we got up to 150% more yield

129
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,199
compared to some other periods

130
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:48,719
throughout the time so the the timing

131
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:51,240
was crucial and then we also found out

132
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,360
that as luck would have it there was a

133
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,680
planter that was heavily sold back home

134
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,600
in the 80s a Great Plains planter that

135
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,879
had a small seed uh chamber in it that

136
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,800
fit very very good and it was pretty

137
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,639
accurate in in sewing densities which

138
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,639
you'll soon soon realize is very

139
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,639
important as well we also tested uh what

140
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,160
the right density of plants was and we

141
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,280
found that that produced really high

142
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,680
increases in yield as well and P seeds

143
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:20,839
being this big which is about between a

144
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:25,000
fifth or a third of a sesame seed so

145
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:28,399
teeny tiny uh we had to find out if we

146
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,519
can sew them or actually cover them with

147
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,959
soil and not put them on the soil

148
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:35,799
surface which which was what which was

149
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,399
what farmers were doing at the time

150
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,560
since they looked at these PL and said

151
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:40,239
this this is never going to make it out

152
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,038
of the soil but we actually found out

153
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,759
that they can make it from pretty

154
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:47,199
substantial depth and that if we covered

155
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:50,598
them we decreased sea desiccation so we

156
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:53,199
got better establishment and we got

157
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:55,000
better Anchorage so the roots the the

158
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,720
shoot to root Junction happened below

159
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,079
the ground and that improved the plant

160
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,000
Anchorage which is a major determinant

161
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:02,800
in logic

162
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,800
and as for the genetics and how to get

163
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,400
the best yields

164
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,520
we I feel like I'm I'm it's like I want

165
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:10,719
the lottery there's a lot of luck

166
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:12,079
involved in this is with any science but

167
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,759
we wanted to work on the we needed

168
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,079
genetics we reached out to Ethiopia it

169
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,319
was made clear to us that that's never

170
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:17,680
going to happen and not a single seed

171
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,520
was going to leave their ger plasant to

172
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,879
come to us so then we looked locally and

173
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:24,318
we went to a conference we spoke to

174
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,000
someone who worked at Israel Gene Bank

175
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,639
said hey but we have tests and then we

176
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,079
found out that we actually had a

177
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:33,960
collection that was collected by the

178
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:35,240
USDA in the 50s and 60s B here something

179
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:36,878
was done to it and then for whatever

180
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,879
reason it was shipped to Israel to be

181
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,479
shared with Israeli uh researchers and

182
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:43,720
basically disappeared we don't know who

183
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:46,680
who ordered it who got it who maintained

184
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,599
it we knew nothing so we started with

185
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,319
those

186
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:53,158
somewhere uh pretty obvious uh mixtures

187
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:55,360
of different colors of seeds and we had

188
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:57,639
to uh sort of stabilize them genetically

189
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,000
we did a single seat descent stabilizing

190
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:03,000
phase and created a panel of uh just

191
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,360
under 300 lines we then used that panel

192
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,918
for two things one we tested it in a

193
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,199
bunch of different locations trying to

194
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:12,639
see if anything stands out and if we can

195
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:15,478
see a line that's readily adaptable to

196
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,439
Israeli agriculture uh which I'll I'll

197
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:20,000
share I I've said it to some of you this

198
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:22,279
morning I just found out that one of the

199
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,120
lines we started licensing is is enter

200
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:25,679
the final stage and not only that but

201
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,840
it's the line that's named after my son

202
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,560
so that's pretty

203
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:35,038
cool um and so we Ed that panel to uh do

204
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,838
a GBS we then use that GBS data to do a

205
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:40,879
preliminary gwas and try and map key

206
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,080
trades to specific Losi and we were able

207
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,000
to find hits for a lot of important

208
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,480
traits but the the really cool thing we

209
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,958
found is that multiple sites were shared

210
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,440
between the three biggest things we were

211
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:57,518
targeting so days to heading grain yield

212
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,200
and lodging index all shared specific

213
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,078
locations on the genome which was a very

214
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,079
exci excited fine uh both muluken who

215
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:05,559
worked on this with me and I have since

216
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:07,120
finished and moved to something else but

217
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:08,439
I'm really hoping somebody picks this up

218
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,240
because I think it's really

219
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,360
interesting um yeah and then the big

220
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,879
issue we were dealing with is lodging

221
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,360
which is what you see here and what I'm

222
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:23,159
I'm about to say is it's somewhat

223
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:26,879
contested in in the te science ecosystem

224
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:29,559
so I hope nobody gets offended uh

225
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:32,200
lodging generally is the permanent displ

226
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:35,199
of a plant from the upright position

227
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:38,120
that that part is not contested uh what

228
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,399
is contested is if this is root lodging

229
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:44,519
or shoot lodging so in the literature

230
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,320
root lodging is a partial uprooting

231
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,799
which I think that's what we're seeing

232
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,079
here but and shoot lodging is a bending

233
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:55,000
of the shoot which also happens except

234
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:57,120
it happens after this so I'm going to

235
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,759
say it's root lodging if you're

236
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,639
contested I agree with you uh uh and

237
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:05,200
then uh it's it's a big issue so

238
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,519
compared to a three or supported growth

239
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,278
this leads to up to 50% yield reduction

240
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,879
in both biomass and grain yield and this

241
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:16,559
environment that's created here is the

242
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:19,399
the perfect place for bugs and and

243
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:22,719
fungus and pathogens of all Natures it's

244
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:24,200
a big big issue and to make things worse

245
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,839
it makes it really hard for the

246
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,480
Harvester to go over it because those

247
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,079
plants just stuck under this has been

248
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,519
possibly less of of an issue in Ethiopia

249
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:34,958
where the the most of the harvesting is

250
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:38,240
still manual but it it's still all of

251
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:40,479
those losses still apply there as well

252
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,200
so we saw this and I was a TA at the

253
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,200
time uh which I loved and I was a TA for

254
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,160
intro to plan science and one of the

255
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,200
things we got to talking about we got to

256
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:53,639
talk about is um shoot development and

257
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,240
the effects that shading has on things

258
00:10:53,639 --> 00:11:00,519
so we said hey maybe you know ta brain

259
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,639
at the time maybe uh the plants are

260
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:04,200
sensing shading thus they are becoming

261
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,799
taller thus they're losing their

262
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,120
Anchorage because their center of

263
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:11,199
gravity Rises maybe that's why they they

264
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,879
topple over so he said okay what causes

265
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,920
this and possibly higher densities right

266
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:20,879
there's there's uh it's a pretty short

267
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:23,919
jump in in my brain and then we tested

268
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:26,879
so as a context to this when we started

269
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:30,639
out the data we had was that people are

270
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:35,559
sewing up to 20 kilograms per Hector

271
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:38,480
which is a lot it it's the seeds are

272
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:41,879
tiny we're talking billions of plants

273
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,000
per a few meters it's it was very dense

274
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:47,480
so we said okay this is probably too

275
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,159
much let's cut it so we went to uh 9

276
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,879
kilograms which is about half all the

277
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:54,360
way down to 300 to um 3 kilograms per

278
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:56,159
hectare I'm I'm sorry for stumbling we

279
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,200
we don't really use hectors in Israel we

280
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:59,879
use dunams because hectors are way too

281
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,519
big in the country's weights

282
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:06,600
so um but when when we did this we found

283
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:09,560
that the plants growing in in lower

284
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:13,000
densities were taller not shorter so it

285
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:16,879
didn't seem to be that effect also we

286
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,159
found that lodging was reduced and that

287
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,000
got me interested and I was trying to

288
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:22,319
yank those plants out and I also found

289
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,839
the plants here just held on to the

290
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,639
ground more that it's called Anchorage

291
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,079
and that pointed to another thing that

292
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,759
pointed Us in the direction of root

293
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,759
logic

294
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:36,039
um so that I felt was interesting and

295
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:39,958
then I said we got to thinking what in

296
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:45,159
the root could it be and this is about

297
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:46,879
the time that uh Jonathan Lynch who um

298
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:49,879
the time I was afraid of now I know him

299
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:52,159
is actually very nice uh he had a paper

300
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:53,838
about root cortical enima and that got

301
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:56,078
us thinking about maybe that's what's

302
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,320
happening maybe some of the areas of the

303
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:01,278
cortex are deforming and then the

304
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,040
connection between the side that's

305
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:05,439
attached to the soil and the side that

306
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:08,120
is definitely connected to the Chute

307
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,639
maybe something there breaks and when we

308
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,159
looked at it we saw that some of the

309
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:16,278
more lodging resistant lines and they're

310
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:19,958
not not resistant completely but more

311
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:22,919
so they produced less root cortical en

312
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:25,759
Kima and they also produced it sorry

313
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:28,559
later in the season so they had

314
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,120
improved uh retention of the C of the

315
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:34,000
cortex

316
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:36,560
what we think is happening is that with

317
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,958
the partial uprooting there's a

318
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:41,838
significant secondary uprooting that's

319
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:44,319
happening inside the root so the steel

320
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,120
could be just moving inside much like a

321
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,680
fiber moves inside an electrical wire

322
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,320
because it's not connected and that

323
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:53,679
could enable some flexibility to enable

324
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,920
the pl to switch without disconnecting

325
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:56,359
because we're not seeing the roots cut

326
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:59,639
but we do see the plant lying on its

327
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,199
side so that could be and uh

328
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,680
I'm really happy about this this was a

329
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:05,359
simple light microscope I was lucky

330
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,239
enough to know the right people and I

331
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,919
can show you what it looks like under a

332
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,240
uh scanning electron micro microscope

333
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:16,879
which uh was done by other people in our

334
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:20,639
group and that second uh work also found

335
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:24,679
that other metrics of the root cortical

336
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:27,320
area changed uh but it seems to be the

337
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:29,399
case it seems to be that if a plant

338
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,720
tends to Lodge that root cortical in

339
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:34,198
kaima is developed more and vice versa

340
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,720
so we don't know what starts the process

341
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:38,039
but there's definitely something going

342
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,680
on with root Anatomy when it comes to

343
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:44,240
lodging and because of what we knew

344
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:46,159
about the densities and the changes we

345
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,680
found based on densities that got me

346
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:51,879
thinking how are plants telling one

347
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:53,958
another what's going on how are plants

348
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:55,759
picking up signals that make them change

349
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:58,399
their anatomy and their development

350
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:01,079
resulting in lodging or other metrics

351
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,600
and that's really how I landed in um

352
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:07,159
plant plant

353
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:08,759
interactions um which is sort of the uh

354
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:13,240
in between stage between my PhD and my

355
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:17,320
posttop and so uh this is not new to you

356
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,839
uh PLS grow in uh diverse communities if

357
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,278
you don't believe me

358
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,720
there um but also under cultivation so

359
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:25,039
poly cultures have been used for

360
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,680
thousands of years you all know this

361
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:29,719
three Three Sisters Garden idea it's

362
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,679
amazing uh it's

363
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,120
an embodiment of symbiosis right because

364
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:38,120
the beans grow on top of the maze

365
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,240
getting support they fixate

366
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:44,198
nitrogen as a as a way of repaying the

367
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,079
the corn is the way it's depicted at

368
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:48,159
least and then the squash grows and

369
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:52,719
covers the soil taking advantage of

370
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:55,559
excess um radiation so we know this

371
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,000
happens and we know it works sustainably

372
00:15:55,559 --> 00:16:00,758
but for all we know about plant plant

373
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,278
interaction the below part is less well

374
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,639
known and I can tell you why because

375
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:06,759
it's really hard to stop it's it's a lot

376
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,480
of hard work and it's the the invisible

377
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:11,639
part right and and I'll spoil the the

378
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,600
rest of this but I also focused on root

379
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,440
exit dates which is the invisible part

380
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,639
of the invisible part so uh it's hard to

381
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:23,240
study but it holds a tremendous benefit

382
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:25,680
potential because there's a big emphasis

383
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,480
on soil plant soil and plant microb

384
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,479
interactions and those plant plant

385
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,519
interactions specifically in inas

386
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:36,199
species ones they Cloud our view they

387
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,839
produce noise to other questions that

388
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:41,198
we're asking and so I think that's

389
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:43,199
important I was lucky enough to get to

390
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:45,919
know Jesse laski who also thought that

391
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:48,559
was important and I won a b Fellowship

392
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,198
to go and get my poster with him that

393
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:54,318
has been the

394
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:56,758
previous uh two years and pretty short

395
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:59,519
time before I came this paper came out

396
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:02,480
from the lasy lab which showed that in

397
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,558
arabidopsis plants if all other things

398
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,038
being equal and no shortage of nutrients

399
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:10,759
no shortage of water the presence of

400
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:13,599
competing plants inter and intas species

401
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:15,558
caused changes to development and in

402
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:19,958
this specific paper they were also able

403
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:22,918
to mimic it by using um a strol lactone

404
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:25,439
standard and got similar responses so we

405
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:30,280
had an idea that the root exod dates

406
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:32,840
played a role here and I was

407
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:35,200
uh amazed at this it's a whole new topic

408
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:37,000
and I spent some time thinking about how

409
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,519
plants communicate with one another

410
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,279
excuse the very um I'm not a good draw

411
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:44,319
I'm not good at drawing and less so on a

412
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:46,359
computer but we can think of some

413
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:48,798
channels of plants communicate we talked

414
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:50,759
about shading there's volatiles above

415
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,240
ground there's stuff that plants exude

416
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:54,839
towards one another of course there are

417
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:59,440
microbes that are either shared or are

418
00:17:54,839 --> 00:18:01,038
used to trans to trans transfer cues so

419
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,600
and of course we can talk about micro

420
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:07,279
isy uh these are all things that we know

421
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:10,038
I can also say that I knew this was

422
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,480
important because uh we know that

423
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:13,119
agriculture is becoming ever more

424
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,798
intensified so we know plants are

425
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:18,000
growing in higher and higher

426
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:20,759
densities and it is my hope that with

427
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,400
with regenerative agriculture and with

428
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:26,558
um newer more eco-friendly systems we're

429
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,519
going to

430
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:31,678
mix some cors in the same time so inter

431
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,599
coping became something that I was uh

432
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,720
interested in as

433
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:39,519
well

434
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:42,000
and um the other question I had being

435
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:44,480
that I worked with um PL selection and

436
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,599
breeding before was is this breedable is

437
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,400
this something we can breed for and it's

438
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:52,359
this is not a new idea since the uh at

439
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,759
least the late 60s people have been

440
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:59,240
talking about doing the selection of new

441
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:00,960
lines under higher densities because

442
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,519
agriculture was expected to keep on

443
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,720
intensifying and you probably know about

444
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,279
the leaf angle changes in corn that make

445
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,798
the plants fit better together and share

446
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,678
more of the sunlight but these are all

447
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:13,759
above

448
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:16,919
ground uh below ground traes that could

449
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:19,000
benefit higher densities were less well

450
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:21,038
documented at the time so that was

451
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,240
something we were very interested

452
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:26,000
in and we also thought that because

453
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,480
seeds are sewn very close to one another

454
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,240
and they take longer to shade one

455
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,000
another other than to start exuding

456
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:37,279
towards one another probably root to

457
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,880
root sensing happens before shading so

458
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,279
to try and and check what the effect of

459
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,120
this was and there was a paper that

460
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:46,158
showed that you can even transfer um

461
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:48,519
flowering signals through root exit8 so

462
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:51,400
there was definitely enough evidence to

463
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:53,720
support working on the communication

464
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,759
belowground and trying to remove that

465
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,120
from the context of above ground um

466
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:02,720
interactions

467
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:05,558
so we tested 10 sorum lines some were

468
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:09,200
land races some were Elite lines all of

469
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:12,319
which we grew under high high fertilizer

470
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,319
abundance with either uh drought

471
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:17,798
conditions or well water conditions and

472
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:20,000
we did not allow plants to shade one

473
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:21,798
another what we did was we divided we

474
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,200
had focal plants of the 10 genotypes we

475
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:28,279
tested and we grew them in pots in

476
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,000
circled by multiple plants or a or a

477
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:32,399
single genotype that was the same

478
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,079
competitor for all of these 10 lines so

479
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,360
one competitor competing against 10

480
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:41,279
lines and we at first use these plates

481
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:43,918
to push the plants to the side uh the

482
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,839
plants lifted the plate like with no

483
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,440
issue at all then we tied them off to

484
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:49,558
remove the leaves from being able to

485
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,798
interact with one another and that did

486
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:53,879
produce stress but we didn't see really

487
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:56,480
signs of stress of those competitor

488
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,840
plans and then we asked the question how

489
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,759
does this affect

490
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:03,918
um the productivity and the development

491
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:09,879
of plants and what we found was that the

492
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:12,600
presence of competition which is the one

493
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:16,679
on the the second Flo to the right

494
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:18,519
produced a smaller plant reduced biomass

495
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,080
reduced the plant height and reduced the

496
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:23,359
leaf area and that was on par with the

497
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,399
control of a non-competition this is

498
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,719
supposed to be

499
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,038
non-competition uh a non-competition

500
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,360
drought so drought

501
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:34,000
and the presence of neighbors led to

502
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:37,439
similar reductions in productivity in

503
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,400
sorum and this is intas species so sorum

504
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,080
a sorum plant sensing neighbors around

505
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,559
it reduced its productivity almost like

506
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:47,678
it was experiencing drought and then we

507
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:51,240
looked at photosynthesis measurements of

508
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:55,080
stomatal conductance and and PS2

509
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:57,759
uh activity sorry and we saw a reduction

510
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:59,879
in that as well so not only is it

511
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:03,720
smaller it's producing less it's less

512
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:07,200
productive and this could be I can um

513
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,759
put this in a in a uh a very kind

514
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,278
context of saying it's just trying to

515
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:12,640
share it's trying not to steal

516
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:16,400
everything it's making itself small as a

517
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,759
sort of um con survival through

518
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,519
conservation or it could be that there's

519
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:22,319
something going on there that's reducing

520
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:24,038
its activity similar to what we found in

521
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:26,480
arabidopsis

522
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:29,319
before so we

523
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,159
saw that below ground interactions led

524
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:32,439
to this reduction and we said okay so if

525
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:35,000
it's below

526
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,840
ground there's multiple things we can

527
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,480
think of it could be removal of

528
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:41,199
nutrients on a very M micro scale so

529
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,440
close to the root maybe that's what's

530
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,720
going on or maybe it's a biochemical

531
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,440
thing maybe it's an exudate thing the

532
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,278
plants are exuding some something that's

533
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,200
causing other plants to reduce their

534
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:54,000
activity and if that's the case then we

535
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,360
use this very high-tech system of a

536
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,679
bucket and a funnel in a tube where we

537
00:22:56,359 --> 00:23:02,558
grew Source plants SE in a pot we

538
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:05,320
collected the leade from this pot that

539
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:07,158
had all the Riso deposits from the same

540
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:09,879
competitor genotype and we transferred

541
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:12,640
it to a Target Port that either had

542
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,960
actual competition in addition to the Le

543
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:19,840
shate or just this leate and we were

544
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:22,519
wondering if is this que transported by

545
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:25,278
exid dates and if

546
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:26,918
the nature of that interaction will be

547
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:29,240
different the answers are very

548
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:32,080
straightforward yes there is a signal

549
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,919
that's carried by exid dates and no it's

550
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:37,199
not different in nature it seems to be

551
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:40,679
the same thing and what we found here

552
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,600
was that the presence of the leate of

553
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:46,038
competing plants was similar in its

554
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:48,879
effect to physical competition plants

555
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:51,000
grown in the same pot we also found

556
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,480
something that is very uh important for

557
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,278
my uh current response to reviewers

558
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,038
where we did not see a heightened

559
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:03,400
response when we had both competition

560
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:06,079
and leate cuz some of you are probably

561
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,080
thinking allelopathy and autotoxicity

562
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:10,480
auto toxicity when it is created

563
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:13,278
produces a linear response across almost

564
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:17,400
all concentration so this would have

565
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:19,599
been here if this was a natural

566
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,200
autotoxicity uh effect and I'm a little

567
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:25,158
bit bitter about it because I had paper

568
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:28,720
eject um and so that was one thing we

569
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:32,080
did and working with sorum I uh was

570
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,558
interested in what it did to other

571
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:35,398
plants and there are two reasons for

572
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:38,398
this one is when you dive into the

573
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:40,639
literature about sorum there is a ton of

574
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:42,759
papers saying that if you grow sorum the

575
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,799
weed population is decreased which

576
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:46,879
didn't sit well with my experience of

577
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:49,679
seeing weeds in sorum fields but I was

578
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,360
interested in it uh and then another

579
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,880
thing was that we did a lot of work in

580
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:58,759
Jesse laski's lab about working with

581
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,640
striga and sorum stga interactions sta

582
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:03,079
is a parasitic plant in subsaharan

583
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,960
Africa that picks on S plants and is

584
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:09,079
it's a major yield reducing element uh

585
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,319
and we were working on it and one of the

586
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:12,119
one of the things in the process of

587
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:15,798
working on it was getting good exid

588
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:18,519
dates to germinate striga seeds so we

589
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:20,240
had that system and I was wondering and

590
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:23,440
I was lucky enough to know Dr Caroline

591
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,839
Lowry who worked with me on this uh if

592
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,840
we could see an effect this plant plant

593
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:31,319
interaction between the root exod dates

594
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:35,639
that works so immensely on striga seeds

595
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:38,798
on some key weeds so um both Comm both

596
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:42,320
common water hemp and fox taale are this

597
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:44,319
is giant Fox taale are major weeds in

598
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:46,599
Pennsylvania and we looked at

599
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:50,558
germination and we found yes the the

600
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:52,000
plants that were 5 to 14 days old we

601
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:54,000
grew them in nutrient solution with then

602
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,159
transfer them into di water for 3 Days

603
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,440
let them exude and we use that to

604
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,240
germinate seeds and we found that those

605
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:04,038
exid dates reduced germination of both

606
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:09,839
these species both Fox taale and common

607
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:12,240
water hemp were um less germinated a

608
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:14,918
lesser extent when exposed to these exid

609
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,038
dates and we were wondering if that was

610
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:19,919
if there was a killer agent in this is

611
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:21,720
this a thing where the seeds just die

612
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,159
there's a toxic element to it so we

613
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:28,880
checked for seed viability and and it

614
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:31,240
wasn't and so with with us seeing no

615
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,760
reduction in seed viability what we

616
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:37,038
think is happening is that there is a

617
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:39,879
secondary induced dorcy that's happening

618
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:43,158
in these seeds which seems

619
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,919
to go along with gap sensing which is a

620
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:48,840
thing that small seeded weeds are known

621
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:50,520
for that if they see the light see

622
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:52,278
parenthesis but if they sense the

623
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:54,200
sunlight and if there's a niche that's

624
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:56,398
available for them to occupy they will

625
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:59,120
germinate more and perhaps what we're

626
00:26:56,398 --> 00:27:02,839
seeing is that those exid dates serve as

627
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:06,239
another agent sending the message of

628
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:07,959
this area is taking there is no Gap so

629
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,240
this is what we're thinking and we also

630
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:14,558
looked at early development and we saw

631
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,759
in common water we didn't see any effect

632
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:19,480
because the seeds were so tiny we need a

633
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:21,679
smaller ruler to teste this it's just uh

634
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,960
it was all within noise but we found

635
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,919
something interested that with uh giant

636
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:29,558
foxtail the seeds that did germinate

637
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:31,960
developed much quicker so they elongated

638
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:34,359
much more they produced a higher root

639
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,000
mass uh when they were exposed to these

640
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:38,639
exod dates how

641
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,278
time

642
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,840
um so I'm going to run a little bit

643
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:47,839
through this but all of this work on

644
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:48,959
sorum led us and my reviewers to talk

645
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:52,720
about

646
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,519
allopathy which I dove in I jumped into

647
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,079
that rabbit hole and I can say that the

648
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:59,880
original paper the seminal paper for

649
00:27:57,079 --> 00:28:01,480
allelopathy says that allelopathy is any

650
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,200
interaction between one plant and

651
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:06,159
another not necessarily delerious and

652
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,558
with that yes what I'm seeing here is

653
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:11,200
allopathy it's just not autotoxicity not

654
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:14,480
allopathy in the common way that it's

655
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,798
spoken you'll excuse the football joke

656
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,599
um and with this in mind and these paper

657
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:20,960
being written I started a new postdoc

658
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:23,798
working on

659
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:27,159
intercropping with uh the understanding

660
00:28:23,798 --> 00:28:31,240
that with newer practices coming along

661
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:34,000
we're going to need inter coping to work

662
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,319
and uh the benefits of inter coping

663
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,880
depending on who you read are immense

664
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:40,079
anything from nutrient availability

665
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:43,760
going up to pest resistance going up to

666
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:47,639
higher yields they're all presented as

667
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:51,079
possible and for us they fit another

668
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:53,759
idea that my current advisor Dr GUI Wang

669
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:58,240
uh has in mind where if

670
00:28:53,759 --> 00:29:01,158
we convinced Pennsylvania Farmers to who

671
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:05,640
are growing silage to replace 10% of

672
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:08,720
their corn plants with soy and sorum we

673
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:11,200
can get a higher protein intake higher

674
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,798
protein content in the silage we can get

675
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,159
a higher sugar content making the in

676
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:17,798
sealing process

677
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:19,600
quicker without substantial yield

678
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:23,798
reduction making a better product

679
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:26,278
quicker for the um for the the cows to

680
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:28,278
eat and the secondary effect that we are

681
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:29,919
also very interested in is because

682
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:31,558
there's a lot of dairy farms and a lot

683
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,600
of cows producing a lot of manure that

684
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:37,200
manure gets put on the fields the

685
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:39,240
farmers then get find if there's

686
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,679
leeching of nitrogen or runoff of

687
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,519
phosphorus because it leads into the

688
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:45,399
chesap bay and causes a lot of troubles

689
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:47,519
and there are evidence in literature

690
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:50,599
where if you grow this you get higher

691
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,240
nutrient upake and so this is why we're

692
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:54,359
interested in this and we got to

693
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,759
thinking about those three Corps and a

694
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,959
lot of everything I'm going to present

695
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:00,960
in the next couple of minutes was done

696
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,798
by these three women uh Risha over there

697
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,480
and Marin and dirra and they did basic

698
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:07,798
things they undergrads and I'm very

699
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,679
lucky to have had them work with me and

700
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:13,519
we were wondering imp planting these how

701
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:16,240
much longer do I have if you want leave

702
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:22,000
time for questions we should stop around

703
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:26,200
one oh perfect um so I can slow down

704
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,798
um so we got thinking about how those

705
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,519
fields of inter coping might look like

706
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:32,000
and what the practices might be and to

707
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:34,480
me it was very obvious that we should

708
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,440
tell the Farmers plant the soy and sorum

709
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,759
first let them establish their slower

710
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:41,159
growing you you Americans you did a

711
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:42,960
great job with your corn it grows so

712
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:46,080
quickly I was amazed the first couple of

713
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:49,278
times but you know not the same effort

714
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:50,879
has been done on soy and so and so I

715
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:53,240
said let's plint those first let them

716
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:57,720
establish and then put in the corn but I

717
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:59,638
was uh assured that there's no way the

718
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,679
far are going to go twice there's just

719
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:05,158
no chance so basically we knew that soy

720
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:07,720
and S are going to be germinating in a

721
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:10,480
in an area that has corn plants that are

722
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,440
bigger and already exuding so we got

723
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,079
thinking what what would the effect be

724
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,080
what would the exudates do in terms of

725
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:19,319
early development which we did in these

726
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:21,000
germination papers and uh to actual

727
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:24,798
germination which we did in Petri dishes

728
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,880
so we grew these all three species in a

729
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:29,599
uh hydroponic system we then transferred

730
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:33,399
the exod dates two plates or to these

731
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:36,398
tubes to see what the effect was and

732
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:38,038
this is what the seedlings look like in

733
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:42,319
germination paper and this is what we

734
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:44,720
found so we saw that for corn any sort

735
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:48,240
of exid dates that you put next to the

736
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,839
seeds reduced its germination rate so

737
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,720
there is a heighten s sensitivity there

738
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:56,240
we also found that s does not care it

739
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,679
will just germinate and we found that we

740
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,519
saw it's small picky so so with corn and

741
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,720
sorum there was a reduction in

742
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:07,839
germination rate with soy exudates soy

743
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,720
seeds germinating in soy exid dates no

744
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:11,839
substantial

745
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:15,759
reduction and we also looked at

746
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:19,278
germinating Dynamics so this is a

747
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:22,200
hydrothermal hydrothermal timeline

748
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:23,599
model um which we applied to the

749
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:28,798
germination

750
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:32,439
data um and what we found was the water

751
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:34,839
was constantly the fastest to induce

752
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:38,360
germination we did not find any effect

753
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:40,480
for corn between soy and uh corn and we

754
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:43,519
saw a reduction in sorum for all three

755
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,919
of them so it produced it germinated

756
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,558
less and slower so there was an effect

757
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,000
but it could be by the way that that

758
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:52,359
slower effect is just the decomposing of

759
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,759
the exodites we don't know how long some

760
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:56,599
of the compounds in the exod dates live

761
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:58,278
for we've not done that metabolomics I

762
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,599
don't even know what those compounds are

763
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:03,638
are

764
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:06,158
yet uh and then we also did some uh

765
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:09,038
early development tests and we found a

766
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:11,600
response in corn in terms of total root

767
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:14,000
length for the exid dates once again soy

768
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:16,918
and corn did not really induce a strong

769
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,599
response but with sorum we saw a

770
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:23,159
reduction to the point of uh to the same

771
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:25,439
level of water so basically once again

772
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:28,240
like I showed you with the fox tail the

773
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,240
seeds that did germinate here developed

774
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,798
quicker on the same time period they

775
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,798
produced more

776
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:38,079
roots and it could be that they're

777
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:40,440
trying to compete more in terms of uh

778
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:42,960
the shoot dry weight we saw that the

779
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,440
plants the corn plants are germinating

780
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,480
in corn exid dates were the biggest and

781
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,120
there was a response we also saw an

782
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:54,159
interesting response in soy where the

783
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:56,278
shoots of plants of seedlings in corn

784
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,679
exod dates of soy were the biggest so

785
00:33:56,278 --> 00:34:01,960
maybe once there realizing they're under

786
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,720
competition they carry things around is

787
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,159
what we're

788
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,280
thinking um we also looked at Sho root

789
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:11,838
ratio but um for lack of time I might

790
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,599
not go into it so now we're analyzing

791
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:16,519
this data and we're thinking about what

792
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:19,480
we want to do next so the literature now

793
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:21,480
has two different opinions and they're

794
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:27,440
both equally as loud if you

795
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:30,480
want um so it could be that corn plants

796
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,838
up take more phosphorus by the sheer by

797
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,679
just sensing the existence of soy plants

798
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:37,398
next to them it's possible it's been

799
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,838
claimed in the literature other papers

800
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:41,279
say no the actually the exudates from

801
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:43,838
soy plants make phosphorus more

802
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,000
available and that's why there's in

803
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:48,320
increased uh uptake there's also a paper

804
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,159
that showed that there's higher

805
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:55,720
transcription of phosphorus Transporters

806
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:58,320
in the in the roots of uh corn plants

807
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:01,000
grown with soy but recently there's been

808
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,599
a c correction thing added to that paper

809
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,960
where if you look at it it's not really

810
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:06,960
happening so I don't know we're very

811
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,400
curious about this because if we can

812
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,760
cause plants to uptake more phosphorus

813
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,599
just by putting in exodites it's like a

814
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,960
bio stimulant we just have to grow them

815
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:18,000
in water and use that water in

816
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,320
irrigation and bang we get more

817
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,679
phosphorus in the complex if that exists

818
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,640
it's amazing another thing we were

819
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:27,039
thinking about and I'll maybe just uh

820
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:29,799
say that quickly and jump to my summary

821
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:32,279
uh is there is a claim that soy plants

822
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:36,079
will fix more nitrogen when they're

823
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:38,079
grown next to corn to me that is not

824
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,519
evolutionary stable there's no reason

825
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,680
for a plant to be altruistic it could be

826
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:45,639
that they're expecting some nitrogen

827
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,199
deficiencies later on but these are not

828
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:49,480
plants that have coevolved for a very

829
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:50,679
long time so we're very curious about

830
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,400
this and this is what we're planning to

831
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:55,679
do now we're going to ask these

832
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,160
questions and uh the first thing we're

833
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:00,838
doing is growing all three oops

834
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:03,679
all three uh plants in a hydroponic

835
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:05,679
solution with high nutrient availability

836
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:07,679
to try and see what the roots do we're

837
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:10,759
later going to try and grow them in pots

838
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:12,559
and see if we see elevated uptake which

839
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,720
I don't know what to expect it's a very

840
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:16,960
interesting situation where I do

841
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:18,118
actually have a two-sided hypothesis I

842
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,519
do not know what to expect the

843
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:24,358
literature can point you in both

844
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:26,440
directions it's exciting types um but if

845
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:28,358
if any of it works it's amazing it's

846
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,800
it's something that uh

847
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:33,358
I'm I'm very hopeful can lead to better

848
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,318
outcomes for farmers and then one last

849
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,679
thing I wanted to say is that I recently

850
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:41,679
partnered with the Botanical Society of

851
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:45,759
America uh for which I'm hosting a new

852
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:49,919
podcast um and sorry Jen I just realized

853
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:52,960
you were on the last one too um and I

854
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:56,358
think it's super super important for us

855
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,318
to uh present our science in a more

856
00:36:56,358 --> 00:37:00,838
approachable and easy to find way for

857
00:36:58,318 --> 00:37:03,639
the general public I think in this day

858
00:37:00,838 --> 00:37:05,639
and age and I was strictly warned by uh

859
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:09,039
my advisers to not talk about politics

860
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:11,679
but I think we all do what we do because

861
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:16,279
we believe it's true and I think truth

862
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:20,078
needs to be as easily accessible as

863
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:22,359
misleading information and this is my

864
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,680
small attempt at doing that this should

865
00:37:22,358 --> 00:37:26,440
be launched in the next month and if any

866
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:29,318
of you are working on anything related

867
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:31,159
to plans and are either members or of or

868
00:37:29,318 --> 00:37:33,519
affiliated with the Botanical Society of

869
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:35,279
America reach out to me I would love to

870
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:38,039
have you on it's a really fun experience

871
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,560
I'm fun to talk to on zoom and it's uh

872
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:44,800
it's it's a really easy experience and

873
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:47,759
those are expected to have a big crowd

874
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,839
um one

875
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,240
o'

876
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:54,358
yeah all right so I think we can start

877
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:57,759
with uh questions in the room I have a

878
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:57,759
slide for that

879
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:06,598
hi um so some research in our lab

880
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:09,280
suggests that maze plants through

881
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:12,480
different compounds as they develop did

882
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,519
you play at all with the age of your

883
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,599
maze or other plants and capturing their

884
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:20,559
exod dates did not am expecting to and

885
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:23,000
uh the reason for that is that I had the

886
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:25,599
fortune of uh overlapping with Eric

887
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,280
laoren Paul who is a big vegetative

888
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:30,920
phase change expert so we know we know

889
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,680
it's true we even know it from strier I

890
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,039
I agree with you 100% we've not done

891
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:35,960
that yet uh it's something we're

892
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:38,000
planning to do but I I I couldn't AEO

893
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,639
those definitely

894
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,559
changes yeah uh thanks for the

895
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:45,759
presentation I was wondering so plant

896
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:48,639
plant interactions I I've done a little

897
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,680
bit of work in like uh crop weed

898
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:52,279
interaction same thing right plant plant

899
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:54,679
are you familiar with like Clarence

900
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:58,160
Swanson's work from the University of

901
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:59,719
gal I'm not okay well I it's interesting

902
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:02,399
because I think it goes along nicely

903
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:06,000
with this research where um he also

904
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,160
proposes that um yeah like crop yields

905
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,519
being limited by weeds yes there's like

906
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:12,480
a fertility and shading element but even

907
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:14,358
before any of that he proposes that the

908
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,679
primary thing that is limiting these

909
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:19,159
yields are just like a sensing of

910
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:21,719
somehow this weed or this crop is

911
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:24,199
sensing that there is another plant

912
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:26,159
vicinity and and I thought that was like

913
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:29,318
when you got into like exod dates and a

914
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:31,440
leathy and and also a lot of the weed

915
00:39:29,318 --> 00:39:33,119
biomass work that we do is like all

916
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,200
above ground but so much is happening

917
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,160
underneath I I fully agree yeah so it's

918
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:39,838
like plant plant interactions but also

919
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:42,279
like yeah crop weed interaction same

920
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:44,318
same kind of deal yeah and and that also

921
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,519
uh feeds into some work that's been done

922
00:39:44,318 --> 00:39:48,039
in penate with cover crops where they do

923
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:49,960
mixtures and those those mixtures

924
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:52,079
actually do better than monoculture so

925
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:55,599
maybe we should probably be looking

926
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:59,680
deeper into this excuse the pun but um

927
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:01,400
yeah yes um thanks thanks great talk uh

928
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:02,799
yeah so plant breeding is in part A

929
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,960
numbers game we have to we have to

930
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,240
measure lots of as many plants as we can

931
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,240
just to do

932
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:12,838
selection uh you you you mentioned

933
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:15,879
idiotypes I'm wondering if your research

934
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:20,000
suggests some kind of intercropping idot

935
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:23,838
type that is faster to measure than

936
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,719
say growing the intercrop and making a

937
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:28,199
biomass cut and separating out the

938
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:30,039
species you know like that's slow like

939
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:31,639
like is there something that that that

940
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:34,880
comes out of your work

941
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:39,719
that that we could select on that would

942
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,720
by indirect selection improve intercrop

943
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,440
performance I have to think about it for

944
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:47,200
a second no you're good um well for one

945
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,720
thing is as a way of making the

946
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:52,358
selection more high throughput and and I

947
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:55,000
S touch on that with Greg I think if we

948
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:57,679
did Hydroponics and we played around

949
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,960
with the species in there allowing for

950
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:04,239
greater interaction and looking at the

951
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,720
performance it's not the field it's very

952
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:10,598
artificial but it might give us a Way

953
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:12,799
Forward I think uh so the way I had

954
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:14,920
envisioned it is with the nft system

955
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,039
where the top length is the exuding one

956
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:21,280
and all of the rest are experiencing

957
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:24,639
some sort of a gradient of exposure

958
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,760
um I don't know the the the thing we

959
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:30,318
wanted to achieve with that solum work

960
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:33,040
was with we wanted to get uh RNA seek

961
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:35,079
data from before and after the exposure

962
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:38,838
to the exod dates in the exate transfer

963
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:40,680
thing as you know life happens we missed

964
00:41:38,838 --> 00:41:42,679
the deadline of one grand and then my

965
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:46,000
fellowship R out we did not end up doing

966
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:49,559
it I think we could see stuff there I

967
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,719
think if we did this in an environment

968
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:53,759
that had multiple nutrients availability

969
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:56,679
or varying nutrients availability we can

970
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,119
tease apart The receptors on the root

971
00:41:56,679 --> 00:42:01,358
that re respond to that specific element

972
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,240
and that might give us a a better Target

973
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:05,880
for breeding uh I definitely think it's

974
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:07,919
worthwhile I've been hearing that we are

975
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,680
running out of Al for a very long time

976
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:15,680
and the root is maybe an an resource I I

977
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:18,239
don't know but I do think it's it's a

978
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:21,000
possibility

979
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:23,639
Yeah question online David looks like

980
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:28,239
you have your hand raised did you have a

981
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:30,719
question there yes um so this sounds

982
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:33,399
like it's so I work with Clarence swon

983
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:34,919
quite a bit um and our hypothesis is

984
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,639
that you know the plants recognize each

985
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,599
other and that's why you get sort of

986
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:42,639
reduced yield and if that's the case

987
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:45,160
then it should be possible to identify

988
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:48,920
mutants that don't respond to those

989
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:50,399
chemicals right that just ignore them um

990
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:54,559
have you thought about looking for

991
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:58,280
mutants that uh uh do not respond to the

992
00:42:54,559 --> 00:43:02,440
the exate uh chemicals

993
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:05,760
um I have not we did hope that if we

994
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:09,318
grew land races we might see variation

995
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,960
in the direction of response we did see

996
00:43:09,318 --> 00:43:13,639
variation in the magnitude of the

997
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,480
response to exit dates so there could be

998
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:18,199
some differences there uh it was a very

999
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,119
small sample it was 10 lines and they

1000
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:22,199
were mixed between land races and Elite

1001
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:26,838
lines so it wasn't a really good panel

1002
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:28,960
to ask a question um I I would imagine

1003
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:33,159
it's there we've not done this I will

1004
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:36,480
say that uh we looked at or I looked at

1005
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:40,399
some strigolactone sensing mutants in in

1006
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,880
P doing some other work and I I'm less

1007
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:46,680
convinced that strigolactones are the

1008
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:49,680
key agent in this sensing but it I could

1009
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:51,558
be wrong about this and the with sorum

1010
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:54,159
those mutants Wen weren't readily

1011
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:57,800
available for us to use it will be a

1012
00:43:54,159 --> 00:44:01,399
logical Next Step um which were hoping

1013
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:03,720
to achieve you know grants becoming

1014
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,519
available again permitting and such

1015
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:08,719
excellent um just so you know we do have

1016
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:11,599
a lot of RNA seek data online uh for

1017
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:13,598
plant uh weed interactions you're you're

1018
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,519
welcome to to mine it for whatever you'd

1019
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,720
like

1020
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:17,719
so thank

1021
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:25,720
you all right any any other questions in

1022
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:29,040
the room I think that's it on all right

1023
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:29,039
so let's thank the speaker once again

1024
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:42,358
this has been a production of Cornell

1025
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:42,358
