00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,850
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:04,849
University

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:15,519
hello everyone so this is a photo of a

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:18,250
rora Musgrave field and the trials are

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,129
happening so it freaka days talk I'm

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:24,070
gonna first talk about the social

7
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:27,059
ecological perspective how I'm thinking

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:29,289
about this research I'm situating myself

9
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:33,489
then I'm going to talk about three

10
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:35,920
different research projects that I have

11
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,179
going on the first is plant competition

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,210
within mixtures

13
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:42,670
the second is mixtures within cropping

14
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:46,719
systems and the third is cropping

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:51,269
systems within New York's dairy farm so

16
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:55,600
the social ecological system perspective

17
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:58,238
with a - emerge from systems level

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,300
ecology people are studying landscape

19
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:03,369
level things Everglades whole watersheds

20
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:06,909
and they realize that you in action

21
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:09,730
shape the capacities of ecosystems and

22
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:12,519
humans are in fact part of the

23
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:14,530
ecosystems and this is the thinking that

24
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:17,590
I'm going about with all this research

25
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:21,969
that we are a part of the ecosystems

26
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:24,850
they're not just linked together so as

27
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:26,859
the actual specific definition for

28
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:29,349
resilience has three different

29
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:32,109
components the first is the amount of

30
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:35,649
disturbance a system can absorb and

31
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:39,489
still remain within the same state so

32
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:41,859
this is how much you can absorb the

33
00:01:39,489 --> 00:01:44,949
second is the degree to which the system

34
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:49,329
is capable of self-organization so you

35
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:51,640
might imagine if a farmer were to desire

36
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:53,799
to change a practice maybe they wouldn't

37
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,310
be able to because they've been there

38
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:59,709
locked in by certain regulations or the

39
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:02,320
market or they need to continue

40
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:05,829
something so they can't recreate

41
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:08,288
themselves and the third thing is the

42
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:11,229
degree to which the system can build and

43
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:15,158
increase its capacity for learning and

44
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:18,340
adoption so learning is a constantly an

45
00:02:15,158 --> 00:02:24,459
important thing improving on one

46
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:27,099
the the definition or a sentence but I

47
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:29,199
really like from somewhere if I keep did

48
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:35,370
fall over and Department of Natural

49
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:38,619
Resources between ecology economics

50
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,840
social structures that was great

51
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,469
ecosystem services and when we talk

52
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,479
about resilience this is really abstract

53
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:49,840
term it can mean whatever you want it to

54
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:53,439
mean and so for this I think of

55
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:56,319
resilience of a farm in the face of

56
00:02:53,439 --> 00:03:00,129
extreme weather events and the reason

57
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:04,650
I'm thinking about this is the Northeast

58
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:08,379
has got seen a 71 percent increase in

59
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:12,519
extreme precipitation events since 1958

60
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:14,379
this is a graph from the earth National

61
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:19,379
Climate Assessment that came out last

62
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:22,659
Friday uh and each bar is a year the

63
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:25,509
orange line is a nine year average and

64
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:27,519
so this is again extreme precipitation

65
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:29,319
events we can see that they're

66
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,819
increasing so although temperatures

67
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:36,639
might increase the growing season in the

68
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:39,099
Northeast which could lead to you know

69
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,889
longer growing season we are going to

70
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:46,539
have some really wet weather really

71
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:50,139
frequent intense rainstorms and also

72
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:53,439
short and medium-term droughts so I

73
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:57,159
think of practice of diversification as

74
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:59,799
a strategy to enhance resilience and I

75
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:02,319
just go back to the thing putting all

76
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:05,019
your eggs in one basket because

77
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,449
essentially this is what we're doing

78
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:11,289
with a lot of cropping systems and that

79
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:14,199
they're very simplified and we're maxing

80
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:17,288
out their productivity of them but crop

81
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:22,019
diversity as this variability and rid

82
00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:24,310
and redundancy so this variability can

83
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,918
diversity baguettes diversity if you

84
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,288
have more diverse pants likely that

85
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:31,799
you're going to have more diverse

86
00:04:28,288 --> 00:04:37,000
microbes or you'll have more diverse

87
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:39,879
insects and so this is pretty exciting

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,689
but it does come out of cost it isn't as

89
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:46,319
simple as all your eggs in one basket

90
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:48,639
and I want to make that clear because

91
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,740
because I would say that's probably the

92
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,819
biggest difficulty with crop

93
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,920
diversification as a strategy so if we

94
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:59,680
were to if I understand this as a

95
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:04,150
strategy then there's some things that

96
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,550
we need to figure out and so the first

97
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:09,699
question that I asked myself is how can

98
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:12,310
inter crop mixtures be optimized for by

99
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:15,819
oppressed production so how can these

100
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:19,870
and how can we improve these crop

101
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:22,000
diversification practices even more and

102
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,879
so I'm looking specifically at inner

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,629
crop mixtures so multiple species at the

104
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:31,209
same time the second question I asked

105
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:36,790
myself what are the effective diversity

106
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:39,039
over time and so if if they take some

107
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:42,490
time to take into effect are we doing

108
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,590
the right kind of experiments that would

109
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:47,620
allow us to see some of the benefits of

110
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:50,199
crop diversification and finally who's

111
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,889
going to use this strategy and why so

112
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,750
how does it fit in what is the context

113
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:58,149
so the first question how can inner crab

114
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:01,120
mixtures be optimized for a biomass

115
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:05,049
production I'm going to use cover crops

116
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,819
as an example for this so this

117
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:09,400
experiment that we did was on

118
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:12,699
semi-annual forges but if you were to

119
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:16,509
think of them as cover crops uh which

120
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:18,699
they could be at less than 5% of row

121
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:20,500
crop land in the United States its cover

122
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:23,829
crops so cover crops are getting a lot

123
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:26,290
of hype but if but we still have a

124
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:28,419
really limited adoption and a lot of

125
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:31,930
people have done studies as to why that

126
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:37,140
might be one of the one of the barriers

127
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:38,269
identified was this associated cost so

128
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:41,509
getting

129
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:43,788
buying extra seed having to take this

130
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:46,639
extra time so the purpose of this

131
00:06:43,788 --> 00:06:50,168
experiment is to examine enter an

132
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:53,150
interest rate competition to understand

133
00:06:50,168 --> 00:06:56,029
complementarity with the hypothesis that

134
00:06:53,149 --> 00:07:00,709
mixtures with greater complementarity

135
00:06:56,029 --> 00:07:03,288
will have greater cover crop biomass and

136
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:05,978
so for this experiment we had two

137
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:08,899
grasses and two legumes pearl millet

138
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:12,889
deviated with the MS sorghum Sudan grasp

139
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:15,008
with an S legumes word cow pew previa

140
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:18,550
did with the sea and Sun hemp

141
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:21,139
abbreviated with an H and I just want to

142
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:24,168
refer back to some previous work I've

143
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:26,150
done this came out of my Master's when

144
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:28,758
we published this paper on functional

145
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:31,848
diversity and summer annual legume inner

146
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:36,050
crops so we used the same exact same

147
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:38,569
species and we just seated a three

148
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:42,079
species mixtures using a replacement

149
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:44,960
rate design so you have a monoculture of

150
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:47,089
eight and then one third of that for a

151
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:52,339
three species mixture so one-third

152
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:54,649
one-third one-third and then it's a way

153
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:57,529
you assess of their the most common way

154
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:59,899
to assess inter crops it I would say

155
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:03,408
it's the land equivalent ratio which is

156
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:06,228
essentially the of that species their

157
00:08:03,408 --> 00:08:09,769
proportion of the biomass in the inner

158
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:12,860
crop divided by the biomass of that

159
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:15,589
species in the monoculture and so if

160
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:18,530
we're seating these species each had a

161
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:21,529
third of their monoculture rates our

162
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:24,799
breakeven point 4 lambda prevalent ratio

163
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:27,859
would be 1 we plant a third of the seeds

164
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,889
expected third of the biomass and so we

165
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,899
see from the results and the

166
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:36,560
abbreviations are down here the four

167
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:38,599
three species mixtures all had land

168
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,718
equivalent ratio is greater than one

169
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,940
which is awesome right it's like fate

170
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,430
there's intercropping work but what does

171
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:49,459
what does that mean what is really

172
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:51,889
happening within that number so what we

173
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:54,588
did with this paper is we took

174
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:57,980
the single term the partial lar so just

175
00:08:54,589 --> 00:09:01,250
one term of this model we made each a

176
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:03,740
point on a spider hi so these spider

177
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:07,399
plots have three species thus three

178
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:10,159
points and if you were to fill in this

179
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:12,259
inner strangle here that would be

180
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:15,439
one-third that would be your break-even

181
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:18,919
point and so we see that some mixtures

182
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,709
have le RS above one and there's mutual

183
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:24,409
over healing each species does better in

184
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:27,319
the inner prop than it would if it had

185
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:29,838
been planted separately but some of the

186
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,930
mixtures you see one species is really

187
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,839
pulling that biomass up and it comes

188
00:09:32,929 --> 00:09:39,500
with the consequence suppressing these

189
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,120
slower growing species so the one thing

190
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,940
we've learned is if your intercropping

191
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:48,528
with annuals in a mixture they gotta

192
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:50,959
have a similar growth rate they're gonna

193
00:09:48,528 --> 00:09:53,389
leave the gate at the same time or else

194
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:56,149
that kind of competition is gonna

195
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:57,588
continue and you won't see the benefits

196
00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:02,208
of these species because they won't

197
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:07,190
appear as Bunch so practical questions

198
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:10,069
for this experiment is the the question

199
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:13,880
is what is the optimal seeding rate for

200
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:17,420
each species to maximize the biomass and

201
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:20,088
then another question is how many

202
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:22,370
species should go into the mixture I'm

203
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:24,589
going to answer this second question for

204
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,589
you now it's two because this is the by

205
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:32,480
portrait data that I am presenting but

206
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:35,209
it still remains a question and so we

207
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,028
looked at how what the optimal seeding

208
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:40,549
rates were using this response surface

209
00:10:38,028 --> 00:10:43,039
design essentially it's a grid on the

210
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:45,379
x-axis you see the percentage of

211
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:48,409
standard seeding rates for one species

212
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:52,759
space work on there on the y-axis you

213
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:56,328
see a different species so this kind of

214
00:10:52,759 --> 00:11:01,309
design allows us to parse out inter and

215
00:10:56,328 --> 00:11:04,939
intra specific competition uh so it it

216
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:05,339
comes across it's more powerful so for

217
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,460
this

218
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:10,590
eight different seating rates of

219
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:12,840
monoculture so he goes from 40% of the

220
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:15,240
standard seating rate all the way up to

221
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:19,250
120 percent of the standard seating rate

222
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:21,990
which is this for the other species too

223
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:24,450
we do it for all the mono cultures and

224
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,759
then for the bike quarters what we do is

225
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:30,180
we also plant at eight different species

226
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:32,700
so here we have 20 percent sorghum

227
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:36,539
twenty percent the standard seeding rate

228
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:39,090
of millet 40 percent sorghum 20 percent

229
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:43,199
millet how does how does changing these

230
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:45,690
ratios change the outcome and so there

231
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,629
are six different bipolar combinations

232
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:51,210
with four species so we have the

233
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:55,439
original eight different seeding rates

234
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:56,850
for the monoculture 32 eight times six

235
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,610
forty eight so we have a lot of

236
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:04,440
different plots what we did how we

237
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:07,200
planted this happened a summer of 2014

238
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,510
and musgrave what we did is we borrowed

239
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,230
a cone cedar drill from the plant

240
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:12,569
breeding

241
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:15,539
we got the adventure and drive it around

242
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:18,629
and we seeded be small plots about eight

243
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:22,289
square meters and we had applied to the

244
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:26,700
field about how I recommended rate of

245
00:12:22,289 --> 00:12:29,759
nitrogen for storage MCG and grass so

246
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:32,160
we're splitting the fertility evenly

247
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:36,569
between the leggings and the grasses the

248
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:38,789
over for life more grasses would show up

249
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:44,340
if we under fertilize I don't know

250
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:48,120
everything would look bad so we uh after

251
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:50,730
about 50 days we all harvested we took 2

252
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:54,990
meter quadrats clipped all that biomass

253
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:59,789
off separated Robin weed species and we

254
00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:02,009
also collected density and so biomass

255
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:04,889
and density are the important things to

256
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:07,289
remember going into this next slide so

257
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:09,689
this is the bio mass density

258
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:12,509
relationship so as you increase density

259
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:14,520
of a species as you add more plants to a

260
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:17,340
place you're going to increase the yield

261
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,779
up until a point where you're not going

262
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,790
to increase the yield

263
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:24,149
your per plant wait it's gonna get

264
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:26,639
smaller and so what we did is we took

265
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:29,129
yield we have the biomass data so we

266
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,069
plugged it in there say the biomass the

267
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:35,639
millet we also have the density of milho

268
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:38,460
which is Nm and so we plug in the BA the

269
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:43,919
density for Nm and then we were able to

270
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:47,070
solve for a naught which is the weight

271
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:50,309
of a militant without other militants

272
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:52,470
around it and also for I which has this

273
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:58,469
measure of interest is the big

274
00:13:52,470 --> 00:14:02,820
competition and so bitter is in 1983

275
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:05,910
said if you add other species this

276
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:10,230
assumption this relationship still holds

277
00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:13,230
and so with additional species we just

278
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:16,379
added this extra term into the equation

279
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:21,389
so I is is the measure of interspecific

280
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:27,240
competition and well I should say NS is

281
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:30,419
the density for the sorghum so let's go

282
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,700
through this I don't know I find this

283
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:36,750
stuff really heavy so it's helpful for

284
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:39,200
me to go through it multiple times so

285
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,720
here we have this bio mass density

286
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,820
relationship and I've just given you

287
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,100
some numbers to do it so I am the intro

288
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:50,970
specific competition coefficient is

289
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:54,420
point one and then if we were to say

290
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:56,639
increased point one to point five we see

291
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:58,409
the shape of this curve changes quite

292
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,439
dramatically it's reaching that

293
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:03,809
asymptote much faster it's a sharper

294
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,910
curve now we're to add his second

295
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:09,269
species right this is only the mono

296
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:12,149
quarters we have a second species we see

297
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:15,120
that the curve changes even more with

298
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:18,269
this addition so the I am is back to the

299
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:22,200
the first petal set at that one but then

300
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:25,980
we have this extra term is and the NS

301
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,600
and so the shape it has changed and

302
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,938
that's due to the interspecific

303
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,908
competition

304
00:15:29,938 --> 00:15:34,948
so real-life data we did this for all

305
00:15:32,908 --> 00:15:38,158
the by cultures I'm only going to show

306
00:15:34,948 --> 00:15:40,918
you a couple of them so this is the

307
00:15:38,158 --> 00:15:43,379
millet sorghum steed and grass what we

308
00:15:40,918 --> 00:15:45,328
have on the x-axis is millet density

309
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:48,229
then we have millet biomass on the

310
00:15:45,328 --> 00:15:51,839
y-axis the blue circles are the

311
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:57,110
monocultures of the millet

312
00:15:51,840 --> 00:16:00,480
the green squares are the millet biomass

313
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:04,620
wind sort when it's in a millet sorghum

314
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,930
by culture and so this this curve is fit

315
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:11,909
with the equation that I showed you

316
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:18,028
before and then this dotted curve that's

317
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:20,879
a we use the average density of the

318
00:16:18,028 --> 00:16:25,740
sorghum when it's in the by portrayer

319
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:33,419
with millet we use that for the NS term

320
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:36,149
and we are able to see that the shape of

321
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:38,219
the curve changes quite a lot indicating

322
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:41,399
that there's high interspecific

323
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:44,399
competition when you add sorghum to

324
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:47,819
millet you're gonna reduce that millet

325
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,579
biomass and how much you might wonder

326
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:53,760
well then in this next graph I have

327
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:57,839
sorghum density on the x-axis still

328
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,759
millet biomass on the y-axis the wind

329
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,310
Milutin monoculture those are the blue

330
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,309
dots you see the yield the clients quite

331
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:08,970
a lot as you increase the density of the

332
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:09,990
sorghum Sudan grass but this is just one

333
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,350
side of the story

334
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:15,929
now always two sides to a story so what

335
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:18,409
happens with this sorghum when millet is

336
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:22,350
added to it if weird think about that

337
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:24,959
it's not really affected at all so when

338
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:27,559
these when these two curves match up

339
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:32,009
there's less interspecific competition

340
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:34,678
happening and we see that also with this

341
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:37,319
fourth graph here with millet density

342
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:40,290
you can add Miller density it's not

343
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:42,789
really affecting the sorghum Sudan grass

344
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:46,139
biomass

345
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:49,269
so this is same crash setup as before

346
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:51,640
but now it's really and sunshine

347
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:54,160
together we can see the differences

348
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,350
between these two curves there's slight

349
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,040
you know millet slightly affected

350
00:17:56,349 --> 00:18:03,579
somewhat affected by this in him and son

351
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:16,210
hemp is also slightly affected by the

352
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:18,579
millet so after putting the biomass the

353
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:22,150
density and solving for the competition

354
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:25,419
coefficient but we got royalties

355
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:27,640
competition coefficients and what what

356
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:30,940
do these numbers mean how do you relate

357
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:33,670
them to one another so one way this is

358
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:36,850
done is with their relative competitive

359
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:40,630
ability G taking this intraspecific

360
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:43,019
competition coefficient and dividing it

361
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:46,870
by the interspecific competition

362
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:48,819
coefficient so how this reads is you

363
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:52,119
have millet millet with sorghum millet

364
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:55,119
with Sun heavily with help you so this

365
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:58,809
basically says it takes point three

366
00:18:55,119 --> 00:19:03,699
seven sorghum plants to make up a millet

367
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:08,109
plant so when the RC is less than one

368
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:10,390
eye you have greater interest specific

369
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:13,750
competition right your denominators

370
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:16,240
larger there's like laughing numbers I'm

371
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:18,970
trying at you and we're trying to find

372
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,460
patterns within them what's happening

373
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:25,029
across these six different by quarters

374
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:27,039
so if we what I did was just separated

375
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:29,799
out and I went through and I said which

376
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:32,230
ones bigger inter intra inter intra and

377
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:35,049
some patterns did emerge we see with

378
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:37,890
sorghum Sudan grass intraspecific

379
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:41,319
competition was always greater than

380
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:44,500
interspecific competition and then with

381
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:48,519
khaki is like a whole different story

382
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:51,759
interspecific competition was greater if

383
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:53,619
you go out to a field and you you look

384
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:56,319
at the fields you can kind of get you're

385
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:59,258
like wow it's copy you planted

386
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:01,148
State New York it probably isn't growing

387
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:05,200
as well as the story against you Darren

388
00:20:01,148 --> 00:20:07,319
grass so the other jefes PC is Miller

389
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,819
and send him there a bit of a mixed bag

390
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:12,759
right and there are two sides to every

391
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:16,658
story so how do you weigh both sides of

392
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:20,470
the story how do you figure out you know

393
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:22,990
I had it with what the true story is

394
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:25,360
what the ultimate story is you can just

395
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:27,759
multiply the relative competition

396
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:33,339
coefficients together and you get the

397
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:36,940
nice differentiation index so if nice

398
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:40,000
differentiate index is above 1 then

399
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:43,629
retrace partitioning is occurring

400
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,960
because the interest is overall for both

401
00:20:43,628 --> 00:20:48,939
of the species both sides of the story

402
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:52,960
intraspecific competition is greater

403
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:55,659
than interspecific competition so this

404
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:59,129
means it's better to you know have

405
00:20:55,659 --> 00:21:02,049
different plant with different species

406
00:20:59,128 --> 00:21:04,959
maximize that resource partitioning get

407
00:21:02,048 --> 00:21:07,658
a more resources so any that is as I

408
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,788
multiplied the RCS I I got the ndis

409
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:13,028
I put them in chronological order and

410
00:21:09,788 --> 00:21:15,128
this other pattern emerged and I say

411
00:21:13,028 --> 00:21:17,950
it's so exciting Lee because I was so

412
00:21:15,128 --> 00:21:20,888
pumped to know Bible is like see

413
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:23,350
something come out of this is that the

414
00:21:20,888 --> 00:21:27,250
Miller plan throw it we're in the top

415
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:31,329
three so if they have a the highest NDI

416
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:34,898
so that tells me something about millet

417
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:37,058
millet plants and like they're good

418
00:21:34,898 --> 00:21:40,109
partners sort of saying good partner

419
00:21:37,058 --> 00:21:43,000
plant so results today relative

420
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:47,189
competitive ability going from high to

421
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,829
low sir again Sudan grass sunhemp millet

422
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:53,110
followed by copy then the mixtures with

423
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:58,158
the greatest complementarity contains

424
00:21:53,109 --> 00:22:00,868
millet that's great and then

425
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:04,799
the third thing overall just in general

426
00:22:00,868 --> 00:22:07,138
is that want people to use these kinds

427
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:09,868
of findings to recommend seeding rates

428
00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:13,288
they can maximize productivity of their

429
00:22:09,868 --> 00:22:13,888
mixture and perhaps and I haven't done

430
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:17,009
it yet

431
00:22:13,888 --> 00:22:18,868
because they the economics might tell

432
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:21,239
whole different side of the story but

433
00:22:18,868 --> 00:22:24,898
perhaps this could reduce the cost

434
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:31,229
barrier right if we improve the

435
00:22:24,898 --> 00:22:35,898
precision of these mixtures so the

436
00:22:31,229 --> 00:22:35,899
second question I'm going to ask is

437
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:43,620
what are the effects of crop diversity

438
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:48,000
over time movies did for this experiment

439
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:51,919
first in background this experiment was

440
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,250
funded by an organic research extension

441
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:58,710
initiative Thank You grant and so we're

442
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:01,069
looking at organic managed systems and

443
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:04,259
the reason this is important is because

444
00:23:01,069 --> 00:23:07,379
44% of certified organic producers are

445
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:09,509
in the Northeast and New York has the

446
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,850
most of all we're the largest producer

447
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:14,430
of milk organic milk in the Northeast

448
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:16,889
you know and the other competitors are

449
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:19,980
Texas and California right they're

450
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:23,610
operating at a whole different magnitude

451
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:26,940
of skill but since 2014 the number of

452
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:34,979
certified organic firms in New York has

453
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:37,289
doubled happening right now so in the

454
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:40,589
Northeast in the face of extreme weather

455
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:44,609
events farmers are having some trouble

456
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:48,299
meeting the Pastoral rule which requires

457
00:23:44,609 --> 00:23:54,179
that organic herds be out on pasture for

458
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:57,720
90 days 90 days of the growing season

459
00:23:54,180 --> 00:24:01,650
and so we think that farmers could

460
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:04,740
supplement their production with

461
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:07,019
planting crops by planting some annuals

462
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,440
be able to take stem that growing season

463
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:12,029
and so this is where we're

464
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,400
operationalizing resilience how the

465
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:16,230
resilience is an abstract term it's

466
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,040
great but how does it actually work in

467
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:21,930
real life there here we went

468
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,519
cropping systems that absorb risk so

469
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:26,430
we're going to look at different levels

470
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:29,970
of crop diversity and then we also want

471
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:31,620
to be able to adapt to change so we're

472
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:34,319
going to look at two different cropping

473
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:36,239
systems perennial and annual and this

474
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:37,829
would allow the farmer to pivot if

475
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,079
something should happen in their

476
00:24:37,829 --> 00:24:43,679
perennial field stay the summer slump

477
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:46,740
what could they do to feed their cows

478
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:48,450
now and then the third one which I'm not

479
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,038
talking about at all is

480
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:53,499
restoring production so what external

481
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:55,658
factors are out there does the farmer

482
00:24:53,499 --> 00:24:57,940
have access to capital can they get a

483
00:24:55,659 --> 00:25:00,159
loan from a bank that would help them do

484
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:05,440
these practices are they getting

485
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:07,629
disaster payments so what we did is we

486
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,149
looked at four different levels of

487
00:25:07,628 --> 00:25:13,868
diversity so first the low diversity

488
00:25:10,148 --> 00:25:16,628
level one specie is one variety then we

489
00:25:13,868 --> 00:25:18,788
looked at the con specific diversity so

490
00:25:16,628 --> 00:25:20,769
you still had one species but instead we

491
00:25:18,788 --> 00:25:23,378
have four different varieties

492
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:26,558
what we tried to do is max out the

493
00:25:23,378 --> 00:25:29,288
variety of those varieties so say for

494
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:31,690
all fawful we chose different

495
00:25:29,288 --> 00:25:34,148
characteristics one of them was crown

496
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:36,429
rooting one of them was branch rooted

497
00:25:34,148 --> 00:25:39,099
one of them had potato leaf hopper

498
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:43,149
resistance all of them claim to have

499
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:45,428
like the best forage quality uh but

500
00:25:43,148 --> 00:25:51,939
those are the characters and we tried to

501
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:55,149
look for different seed sellers to to

502
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:57,249
also max on that diversity in case

503
00:25:55,148 --> 00:26:01,028
they're developing lines from the same

504
00:25:57,249 --> 00:26:04,600
stock and so then for the high level of

505
00:26:01,028 --> 00:26:07,388
diversity so that sorry so that was con

506
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:09,428
specific one species four varieties then

507
00:26:07,388 --> 00:26:11,829
for the hetero specific we had four

508
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:14,919
different species each had one variety

509
00:26:11,829 --> 00:26:18,069
and then for the high level we have four

510
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:21,249
species four different varieties and we

511
00:26:18,069 --> 00:26:24,099
really tried although we tried to match

512
00:26:21,249 --> 00:26:27,308
variety out we did try for similar

513
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:31,269
winter dormancy we want our experiments

514
00:26:27,308 --> 00:26:34,089
to survive and we did try and line up

515
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:36,278
maturity because that's a big thing if

516
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:38,470
you have multiple species but then

517
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:41,138
you're gonna get an optimal forage

518
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:43,860
quality from that so then we have G

519
00:26:41,138 --> 00:26:48,479
different cropping systems and alfalfa

520
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:51,278
alfalfa based perennial system and then

521
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,798
alfalfa orchard grass Timothy and white

522
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:56,740
clover and then a double Kraft annual

523
00:26:53,798 --> 00:26:59,200
system so winter annuals I predict a

524
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:02,109
tree to Gale cereal rye winter pea red

525
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,720
clover and the summer annuals had CD

526
00:27:02,109 --> 00:27:07,839
grass seed and grass pearl millet

527
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:11,079
sorghum Sudan grass and rye grass the

528
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:14,769
other and this experiment took place in

529
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:17,740
our beloved must gray of farms in rora

530
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:20,619
but it also happened on other research

531
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:24,880
firms we were working with Heather Derby

532
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:30,069
up in Vermont and a rich Smith in New

533
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:31,750
Hampshire in library and we and you can

534
00:27:30,069 --> 00:27:35,168
imagine all these sites are quite

535
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:37,419
different right it would like you'll

536
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:40,960
have cooler climates different time is

537
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:42,730
different whether a different soil and

538
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,190
so there are a lot of differences when

539
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:48,339
you think about Oh planting date

540
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:51,640
harvesting date how much fertilizer to

541
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:54,789
apply so what we decided to do was to

542
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:57,970
manage each site independently but

543
00:27:54,789 --> 00:28:00,668
really get on the same track following

544
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:03,610
the same protocols going through the

545
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:07,419
same process and the decision-making the

546
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:10,240
how you know like what are choose where

547
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:12,970
for management so we established this

548
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,370
experiment in the summer of 2016

549
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:20,759
randomized complete block design with

550
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:23,349
four to five replications per site and

551
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:29,039
going into the management a little more

552
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:32,019
detail we manage each cropping system by

553
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:35,409
we manage the two cropping systems

554
00:28:32,019 --> 00:28:39,940
differently and we manage each cropping

555
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:42,340
system at the set by the needs of the

556
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:46,120
low diversity treatment so this is a

557
00:28:42,339 --> 00:28:49,209
more conservative approach because

558
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:52,000
you're adding diversity you're really

559
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:54,640
making it more difficult to see positive

560
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,058
results when you ride diversity so if we

561
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,790
see good things happening front or

562
00:28:57,058 --> 00:29:05,200
should be normative uh yes

563
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:08,589
so we also followed fertilizer

564
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:13,630
recommendations made by seasonal soil

565
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:16,449
test so each site had a different

566
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:21,309
phosphorous extraction rate and so we

567
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:23,049
all send things a grow one baby which

568
00:29:21,308 --> 00:29:25,509
wonder what crops we were going and then

569
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:28,779
we followed what they recommended for

570
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:32,440
fertilizer we were harvesting we site

571
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:33,819
similar thresholds for the harvest so al

572
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,190
fossil was harvest

573
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:39,189
Stage two when there were one to two

574
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:42,549
buds per node triticale was that swollen

575
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:48,330
foot stage seed and grass when it was

576
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:51,490
about three feet high great so this

577
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:54,579
figure was developed by Chris poser and

578
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:57,609
I really like it because they kind of

579
00:29:54,579 --> 00:30:00,308
mops out what the potential is so can

580
00:29:57,609 --> 00:30:03,009
you guys I think they're writing small

581
00:30:00,308 --> 00:30:05,799
so we have months at the the bottom and

582
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:08,529
these blue bars indicate winter annuals

583
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:11,289
yellow is summer and Wilson these black

584
00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:14,379
square sir or when we think we could

585
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:17,049
take a harvest so these are potential

586
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:19,960
harvest scenarios the annuals maybe we

587
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:22,269
only got one color for this summer

588
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:26,380
annuals but perhaps I'm going to get two

589
00:30:22,269 --> 00:30:28,569
you cut and then for the perennials

590
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:31,150
there are a whole myriad of options we

591
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:33,970
could do we were aiming to take three

592
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:37,900
cuts in the first year we only got two

593
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:42,700
cuts and this past year growing season

594
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:47,380
2018 we got it we got four cuts so that

595
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:49,600
was pretty you know this sort of shows

596
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:52,150
the flexibility that the difference I

597
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:57,009
have is to like what they're going to do

598
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:59,940
and and why they might do it so some

599
00:30:57,009 --> 00:31:03,039
hypotheses for these the animal system

600
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:06,400
will be more productive than the

601
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:09,369
perennial system and that productivity

602
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:12,519
and stability yield stability will be

603
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:14,769
greater in more diverse treatments here

604
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:16,869
we have this cool photo of just a

605
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:20,168
traditional monoculture and then the

606
00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:23,019
higher the mixture of those four species

607
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:25,930
and you can visually see the difference

608
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:29,129
there

609
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:32,920
so I'm just really gonna tell you about

610
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:34,630
results not from this most recent

611
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,700
growing few things I do not yet have

612
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:42,510
that data but from the growing season

613
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:44,289
before so 2017 2017 we have a cumulative

614
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:47,079
growing degree days

615
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:50,319
New York's a little bit warmer than

616
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:53,049
everyone the other two sites and then we

617
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:56,710
have cumulative precipitation as you

618
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:57,899
might remember mm and I will never

619
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:02,559
forget it

620
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:07,450
2017 was a very wet here it was hard for

621
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:12,940
us also to establish uh Vermont had a

622
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:15,670
little bit of a dryer season so data

623
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:18,570
collecting for this experiment and some

624
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:21,160
analyses that we're doing crop biomass

625
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:24,789
kneebar Moss will look at weed

626
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:27,730
communities forage quality we'll look at

627
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:30,190
the economics in a partial budget

628
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:31,990
analysis are they work that's happening

629
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:37,750
is we're looking at soil health

630
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:41,200
differences in soil microbial and then

631
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:44,220
also so that's with woody who the grad

632
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,740
student with mine and then also I had a

633
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:50,110
student to her honors thesis just this

634
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,910
past year with disease incidence and

635
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:56,039
severity in these plots so we're really

636
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:59,950
kind of fill out this information here

637
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:03,190
so basically is some results I did a

638
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:07,390
linear mixed model where I sum the crop

639
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:10,600
biomass up over the year so total crop

640
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:13,660
biomass and all for each treatment in

641
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:16,769
each system these location system

642
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:20,220
diversity and their interactions as

643
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:23,019
fixed effects and we did see a

644
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:26,829
significant interaction between location

645
00:33:23,019 --> 00:33:29,680
and system and also significance in a

646
00:33:26,829 --> 00:33:33,039
the different diversity as we see here

647
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:35,289
in this graph so this is the total crop

648
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:39,710
biomass and we see that the hetero on

649
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:43,398
high is he's higher more

650
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:47,659
first mixtures produce more biomass and

651
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:50,298
I think this was largely because alfalfa

652
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:53,210
didn't really like all this wet weather

653
00:33:50,298 --> 00:33:56,418
and so when you added grasses to it the

654
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:58,519
grasses or Geograph in the Timothy we're

655
00:33:56,419 --> 00:34:01,669
much more tolerant could produce a lot

656
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:07,009
more biomass so I think that's what's

657
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:10,039
driving the differences here but in this

658
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:14,500
past year I looked a lot different you

659
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:20,949
know y'all saw tha made a comeback

660
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:23,260
so 2017 the results between location and

661
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:26,618
cropping system New Hampshire and New

662
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:28,510
York the annuals cropping system

663
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:31,030
produced more biomass than the

664
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:33,250
perennials in Vermont we didn't see a

665
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:37,419
difference perhaps that was because

666
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:40,349
Vermont was a little drier also there is

667
00:34:37,418 --> 00:34:44,079
likely a knowledge factor I think

668
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:51,580
Heather has had a lot of experience

669
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:54,309
growing alfalfa whereas I had not so a

670
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:56,440
measure of stability so one measure of

671
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:59,829
stability is the coefficient of

672
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,809
variation and so this is a measure of

673
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:04,389
dispersal you know where the yield

674
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:07,840
similar were they were they quite

675
00:35:04,389 --> 00:35:10,059
different into the standard deviation

676
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,800
and divided by the means for those

677
00:35:10,059 --> 00:35:15,880
treatments and these are just the

678
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:20,910
averages across all the different sites

679
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:27,550
and they're not statistically different

680
00:35:20,909 --> 00:35:30,338
see that uh but in general the lower the

681
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:33,190
lower this to be the more stable the

682
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:36,250
crops yield and so we see that

683
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:38,800
perennials have numerically lower cv

684
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:42,550
than the annuals and we also see that

685
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:47,010
the high diversity treatments had a

686
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:49,420
lower cv well we also know that yeah

687
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:54,040
hello Laura

688
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:56,349
Stevie yes that's all I want to say so

689
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:58,509
results to date the annuals didn't look

690
00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:01,780
to be more productive than their

691
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:05,770
perennials more diverse treatments were

692
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:07,240
more productive for the 2018 growing

693
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:10,150
season

694
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:12,179
Yale father made this huge bounce back I

695
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:14,710
was really excited about an accident

696
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:19,000
wasn't sure if either of us were going

697
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:22,690
to make it we were able to get two cuts

698
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,358
of those summer annuals and we got four

699
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:27,659
cuts for the perennials we're going to

700
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:27,659
take

701
00:36:27,778 --> 00:36:33,579
one last harvest the winter annuals and

702
00:36:31,688 --> 00:36:37,058
one more cutted they're perennials and

703
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:41,920
then that'll be it for this experiment

704
00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:44,769
and my fieldwork so I know I don't have

705
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:56,709
a ton of time left but I want to talk

706
00:36:44,768 --> 00:36:59,978
about this third question science

707
00:36:56,708 --> 00:37:05,858
science doesn't happen in a vacuum and

708
00:36:59,978 --> 00:37:10,058
the context who are going to use crop

709
00:37:05,858 --> 00:37:11,798
diversification strategy and and why

710
00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:14,048
they're going to use them that's really

711
00:37:11,798 --> 00:37:18,630
important I think to consider and to

712
00:37:14,048 --> 00:37:23,619
keep in mind as I as I do this other

713
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:26,920
research so briefly this state of dairy

714
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:30,670
farms I collected these headlines and of

715
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:33,068
course you know I tell people I'm gonna

716
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:36,130
do interviews with dairy farmers and

717
00:37:33,068 --> 00:37:38,228
everybody like this me down and looks me

718
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:40,059
straight in the eye and they say you

719
00:37:38,228 --> 00:37:45,308
know it's a really terrible time for

720
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:48,519
dairy farmers right now and I get by and

721
00:37:45,309 --> 00:37:50,829
it looks really hard to be a dairy

722
00:37:48,518 --> 00:37:54,008
farmer so you have all kinds of

723
00:37:50,829 --> 00:37:56,709
headlines farmers are managing for their

724
00:37:54,009 --> 00:37:58,958
margins anytime they can make a couple

725
00:37:56,708 --> 00:38:03,518
cents extra that's what they're doing

726
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:07,389
we've seen a spate of bankruptcies New

727
00:38:03,518 --> 00:38:09,998
York being one of the larger ones and so

728
00:38:07,389 --> 00:38:13,118
this is some I just grabbed Diaz from

729
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:15,088
Winston at all these are dairy farmer

730
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,890
and I know their place

731
00:38:15,088 --> 00:38:20,938
these are dairy farmers in the Northeast

732
00:38:17,889 --> 00:38:25,858
so before in the 1960s we had about

733
00:38:20,938 --> 00:38:31,178
110,000 and now in 2000 it's about

734
00:38:25,858 --> 00:38:36,159
20,000 dairy farmers good so this is the

735
00:38:31,179 --> 00:38:38,499
milk the herd size so the number of

736
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:39,339
milking cows per thousand heads we've

737
00:38:38,498 --> 00:38:42,039
gone from 3

738
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:45,430
thousand it's declined we have less cows

739
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:50,610
and before what they are making more

740
00:38:45,429 --> 00:38:54,309
milk and this is to me an astonishing

741
00:38:50,610 --> 00:39:00,039
idea let since in 1960s you've gone from

742
00:38:54,309 --> 00:39:02,349
on average say eight thousand thousand

743
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:05,170
yeah eight thousand pounds per year all

744
00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:07,449
the way up to you about eighteen

745
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:12,639
thousand pounds per year so it's

746
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:15,309
incredible advancement when I I think

747
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:18,969
more specifically when am I trying to do

748
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:22,150
with this body of work I'm interested in

749
00:39:18,969 --> 00:39:24,929
what former characteristics influence

750
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:28,480
the adoption of crop diversification

751
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:32,919
practices I'm interested in how a

752
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:36,429
farmer's social network how that

753
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:39,190
influences adoption and more generally

754
00:39:36,429 --> 00:39:41,829
how farmers conceptualize resilience

755
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:44,470
because my idea of what resilience is is

756
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:46,989
probably quite different from from

757
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:49,239
somebody else's definition of resilience

758
00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:51,939
but I'm gonna deal with this here's my

759
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:54,609
plan and this link I haven't really been

760
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:56,500
done yet so it's still very much but

761
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:58,150
it's a pretty solid plan I'm gonna say

762
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,969
that much I haven't done it yet but I

763
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:04,480
think if the producer okay I'm looking

764
00:40:00,969 --> 00:40:07,750
at this Western production region which

765
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,389
is a big milk production region in the

766
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:13,269
state of New York it goes here so it's

767
00:40:10,389 --> 00:40:16,869
surrounding counties counties that are

768
00:40:13,269 --> 00:40:19,360
also some facing similar weather events

769
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:21,819
as I am with my eye fields I'm gonna

770
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:26,099
talk to you about I'm gonna try and talk

771
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:29,530
to 50 farmers a organic and conventional

772
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:32,799
management commercially managed farmers

773
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:35,290
across a range of herd sizes and these

774
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,990
interviews will take I would say about

775
00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:40,840
an hour each I've been a long time

776
00:40:37,989 --> 00:40:43,689
developing this interview guide and rich

777
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:45,550
fish knows from the beginning of draft

778
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:49,110
one and now I think it's like draft

779
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:49,110
twenty something

780
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:55,789
then we have three components it's

781
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:59,150
basically general firm questions how

782
00:40:55,789 --> 00:41:01,909
many acres do you have are you supported

783
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:05,570
by an all farm income how much land do

784
00:41:01,909 --> 00:41:10,369
you rent versus owned where do you sell

785
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:12,200
your milk to and then also have cropping

786
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:13,880
systems questions this is where the bulk

787
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:17,299
of it is because this is where my

788
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:21,230
research interests lie so what is your

789
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:23,750
typical crop rotation in the past five

790
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:26,090
years have you had significant yield

791
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:29,840
loss on your fields really trying to

792
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:32,030
understand what the farmer is going

793
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:37,329
through and how they consider their

794
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:41,150
cropping systems so ultimately I ask

795
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:44,389
about the awareness perception the

796
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:48,619
extent of adoption if they've started to

797
00:41:44,389 --> 00:41:51,379
adopt or considering adopting a practice

798
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:55,579
motivations and barriers for these

799
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:58,430
different crop diversification practices

800
00:41:55,579 --> 00:42:01,730
and a couple of extra ones thrown in

801
00:41:58,429 --> 00:42:03,889
because I think might be helpful to

802
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:08,409
enhance the resilience so if they have

803
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:08,409
reduced tillage they have tile drainage

804
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:17,360
yeah and then finally I am asking

805
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:20,150
farmers about their networks so this is

806
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:22,280
more like a survey portion of the

807
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:25,250
interview before the interview is like a

808
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:28,040
conversation and I'm talking to them and

809
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:32,329
then this is this reads like a survey

810
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:34,420
and farmers can check you know what

811
00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:37,699
events have they attended what

812
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:40,610
organizations do they belong to what

813
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:44,089
resources do they access when they're

814
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:48,829
looking for different kinds of crop

815
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:51,500
diversification information you know who

816
00:42:48,829 --> 00:42:53,659
do they turn to for advice

817
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:58,550
so far I've and I've done a few

818
00:42:53,659 --> 00:43:01,099
interviews so far every farmer has told

819
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:02,550
me they talk to their local Extension

820
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:04,500
agent

821
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:06,870
when asked when looking when seeking

822
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:13,980
advice which i think is a really

823
00:43:06,869 --> 00:43:17,549
important idea to not forget uh so I

824
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:20,699
have some hypotheses on this in general

825
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:24,660
I'm talking to organic and conventional

826
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:28,769
days I think there's a lot that can be

827
00:43:24,659 --> 00:43:31,049
said values judgments the different

828
00:43:28,769 --> 00:43:33,960
actors in these two spaces

829
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:36,990
I think the first equation I'll see a

830
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,750
more profit of rectification practices

831
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:41,939
in the organic managed system in part

832
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:46,619
because there's a regulation by requires

833
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:50,010
that the farms farmers a gooda pasture

834
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:56,279
where their herd and maybe it was so

835
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:58,230
unconventional what this means what this

836
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,620
means is that there's probably different

837
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:03,449
adoption pathways for adoption of these

838
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:05,969
practices you would use different

839
00:44:03,449 --> 00:44:09,379
language would interact with different

840
00:44:05,969 --> 00:44:13,199
groups if you wanted to get these ideas

841
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:17,039
diffused so another idea that I have is

842
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:18,659
do you measure aspects of resilience and

843
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:20,610
these are the three components I

844
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:23,069
introduced earlier the absorptive

845
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:25,170
adaptive restorative I've just listed

846
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:27,690
some of the things that I'm asking out

847
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:32,010
now so this is sort of a conceptual idea

848
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:35,099
in the work so if you have higher soil

849
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:38,970
organic matter and you might be able to

850
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:43,170
absorb more risk answer and if you have

851
00:44:38,969 --> 00:44:47,839
seen greater yield stability you know

852
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:53,220
less yield loss perhaps that's a greater

853
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:56,510
example of having resilience or a more

854
00:44:53,219 --> 00:45:00,599
resilient cropping system

855
00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:03,750
so progress so far on this project I I

856
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:06,569
did five pilot interviews during the

857
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:09,869
summer three with conventional farmers -

858
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:13,350
with organic farmers and every time it

859
00:45:09,869 --> 00:45:17,250
was like every time I talked to somebody

860
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:19,019
new I think oh here's a better way to

861
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:21,659
organize this you know like here's how

862
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:23,849
the flow could improve I've added new

863
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:25,639
questions as they have come up change

864
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:30,150
wording for things so it's a really

865
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:33,089
iterative process and just you know yeah

866
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:35,460
it's a it's a great learning process and

867
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:39,559
I'm going to continue to do the

868
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:42,389
interviews this winter and next spring

869
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:44,699
so to circle back around to what I

870
00:45:42,389 --> 00:45:47,670
talked about in the beginning understand

871
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:51,599
crop different crop diversification as a

872
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:54,059
strategy to enhance resilience I asked

873
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:56,549
how can inter crop mixtures be optimized

874
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:59,460
for biomass production we can design

875
00:45:56,550 --> 00:46:02,570
mixtures that maximize complementarity

876
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:05,099
using these competition models I see

877
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:07,860
people talking about digital a core

878
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:10,049
precision I like and I got very you know

879
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:14,610
that's where I see this fitting and it's

880
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:16,860
a really data intensive effort then what

881
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:19,800
are the effects of crop diversity over

882
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:22,170
time we need to study this and design

883
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:24,060
experiments that allow us to understand

884
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:27,210
some of these benefits that we're not

885
00:46:24,059 --> 00:46:30,150
going to see for a while or may not see

886
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:34,260
for a while right you can't plan an

887
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:37,789
extreme weather event all right guess

888
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,790
yep you can't

889
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:43,619
and then finally who's going to use this

890
00:46:40,769 --> 00:46:46,050
strategy and why and so at different

891
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:50,069
farms likely have different adoption

892
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:51,780
pathways who people are engaging with so

893
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:55,289
they finish this up but I'd like to

894
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:57,840
think this whole listing people by word

895
00:46:55,289 --> 00:47:00,300
of like honestly you couldn't have done

896
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:02,490
it without you and I appreciate all the

897
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:04,740
conversations that we've had at this

898
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:09,379
time and a big thank you to my lab

899
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:09,379
family guys are awesome

900
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:19,739
yes so thank you

901
00:47:12,489 --> 00:47:19,739
[Applause]

902
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:33,059
one one question is professor on that

903
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:35,099
first experiment with the intercom

904
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:37,619
position yeah what kind of note was it

905
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:42,509
and it was supposed to be used by what

906
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:45,530
species was it adapted our read it was a

907
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:49,230
wonder leaf pearl millet we got it from

908
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:53,610
Kings Agra seed and so they've been

909
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:55,559
selling this kind of millet farmers in

910
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:59,630
Pennsylvania in New York so I imagine it

911
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:59,630
was adopted yeah

912
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:07,410
honey thank you great great all the work

913
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:10,330
I really liked how you the rigorous

914
00:48:07,409 --> 00:48:13,389
mechanistic question that you try to ask

915
00:48:10,329 --> 00:48:14,949
in your your first section I was

916
00:48:13,389 --> 00:48:17,379
wondering whether you could shoot from

917
00:48:14,949 --> 00:48:19,299
the hip and say what were the reasons

918
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:22,450
that made millets are such a good

919
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:25,060
mixture buddy did you did you consider

920
00:48:22,449 --> 00:48:27,489
measuring route activity distribution or

921
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:30,730
light intersection or or any other

922
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:32,919
traits that would identify what it makes

923
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:35,949
such a good oh yeah that's a great

924
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:42,880
question and I love the term really as a

925
00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:46,269
planting buddy I spent days of my wife's

926
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:50,740
out in the fields with a point sensor in

927
00:48:46,269 --> 00:48:53,650
a white bar and it's really tough to

928
00:48:50,739 --> 00:48:55,059
take that kind of light interception but

929
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:57,700
just shoot for the hip

930
00:48:55,059 --> 00:49:01,049
I think millet is a good planting buddy

931
00:48:57,699 --> 00:49:05,319
because it's very plastic in terms side

932
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:06,880
it's pretty adaptable it it sees it I'm

933
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:09,340
going to answer it for more flies this

934
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,019
plant a little bit it sees the plant and

935
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:13,660
it says I know what your strengths and

936
00:49:11,019 --> 00:49:17,170
weaknesses are and I can sort of adapt

937
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:19,239
to this so that's how I think about it

938
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:21,820
but I haven't taken any mechanistic

939
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:23,769
stuff and the data with the white

940
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:43,000
interception didn't work out I haven't

941
00:49:23,769 --> 00:49:46,179
looked at what can you really recommend

942
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,190
to a farmer this time and and one of the

943
00:49:46,179 --> 00:49:53,619
questions that always kind of comes up

944
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:58,079
it is you have this location interaction

945
00:49:53,619 --> 00:50:01,719
and probably location is weather as well

946
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:03,219
whether soil and all that and and so and

947
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:07,169
I think that's always the challenge that

948
00:50:03,219 --> 00:50:09,849
we have in making recommendations

949
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:12,800
there's other factors that come into it

950
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:15,949
for example maybe you're feels did not

951
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:17,390
I received manure and on these farms

952
00:50:15,949 --> 00:50:20,329
they would have received manure would

953
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:22,670
have put the competitive ability of say

954
00:50:20,329 --> 00:50:23,900
a millipede changed if there was during

955
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:25,880
the environment

956
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:28,639
so are you at this point in time

957
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,340
comfortable standing up in firm of in

958
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:33,049
front of a crowd of farmers and say

959
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:36,350
these are some of the conclusions that I

960
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:40,750
can draw from my research and I can be

961
00:50:36,349 --> 00:50:40,750
pretty assured that this will work out

962
00:50:41,019 --> 00:50:48,739
yeah that's a great question so if I

963
00:50:46,489 --> 00:50:52,669
were to stand up in front of a group of

964
00:50:48,739 --> 00:50:55,489
farmers I would say millets three times

965
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:58,610
cheaper than any of the other stood then

966
00:50:55,489 --> 00:51:02,109
I use all right I think the economics of

967
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:05,000
this situation even though you know like

968
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:07,280
agronomically that's not movie just

969
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,940
talked about but I think economically

970
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:15,740
that's a pretty pressing concern and

971
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:21,710
then planting alfalfa with grasses seem

972
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:25,219
to be a great way to ensure more biomass

973
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:31,280
and I think farmers in New York tend to

974
00:51:25,219 --> 00:51:36,769
do that yeah but but I think crafty

975
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:38,620
versification will I think we'd be in a

976
00:51:36,769 --> 00:51:42,199
very scary place that there were

977
00:51:38,619 --> 00:51:45,859
prescriptions of yeah I don't think

978
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:48,710
these solutions are prescriptive I think

979
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:52,220
the ability to create this base for the

980
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:56,780
farmer to find out what exactly works

981
00:51:52,219 --> 00:51:59,619
for their farm I think that's the way to

982
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,620
go about it

983
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:23,920
yeah yeah so my plan is within this

984
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:27,190
western region within these counties so

985
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:30,130
what I would do is ask the County

986
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:33,490
Extension agents first my advice and I

987
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:37,769
how I would try and get a more even

988
00:52:33,489 --> 00:52:42,849
number cuz it's not I won't be able to

989
00:52:37,769 --> 00:52:45,940
not collecting a quantitative data on

990
00:52:42,849 --> 00:52:50,409
that I can it will be all nonparametric

991
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:54,670
it won't be a normal sample site so what

992
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:56,829
I can do is say oh extension agent do

993
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:59,950
you have some large farmers some small

994
00:52:56,829 --> 00:53:02,289
farmer is some some some these farmers

995
00:52:59,949 --> 00:53:04,359
some of those farmers and generate a

996
00:53:02,289 --> 00:53:07,269
list from that and try and ask for as

997
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:09,460
great a variety as possible really early

998
00:53:07,269 --> 00:53:11,710
on and then using a snowball sampling

999
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:13,990
method which i think is cool name for a

1000
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:16,690
sampling method if you get like a really

1001
00:53:13,989 --> 00:53:18,729
diverse bottom where's it was like

1002
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:20,650
across the range of slices and then you

1003
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:23,530
ask those farmers hey can you recommend

1004
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:26,590
somebody that's that's not like you to

1005
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:31,210
farm and you can sort of percolate those

1006
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:34,220
differences so I think we're out of time

1007
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:38,280
but thank you guys again

1008
