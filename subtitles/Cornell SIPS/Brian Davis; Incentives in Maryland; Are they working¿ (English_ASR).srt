1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:10,769
University so this is you know kind of a

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,109
comparison of the NRCS programs versus

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:16,138
what we're doing in just Maryland which

5
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:19,050
has a pretty robust program this is a

6
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:21,210
collaboration with my PhD advisor and

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,528
with Dean hive Lee and some folks at

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:29,219
USGS and ARS so it's it's developed out

9
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:31,289
of a larger program and we're just kind

10
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:32,780
of trying to add value to it I do want

11
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,850
to say that this was supported by

12
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:39,870
northeast sare so thanks to anybody

13
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:42,539
who's from Sara here so cover crops are

14
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:44,399
very regionally diverse in their

15
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:46,469
adoption you've got some areas

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,899
especially out in the Midwest where it's

17
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,939
you know zero one percent and you see

18
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,100
that these are zero to one percent one

19
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:57,599
to five percent five to ten percent and

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:00,420
then you see these red areas 15 to 56%

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,049
and that's where Maryland is leading the

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,790
way we have really high adoption rates

23
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,220
there's a couple other areas of the

24
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,939
country that you know localized pockets

25
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:15,118
but Maryland is really the star and I'll

26
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:17,158
talk about why so already this was my

27
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,900
title are they working and tell you yes

28
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:23,100
they're working really the question is

29
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,368
how well are they working so here in the

30
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:27,839
Northeast we're especially interested in

31
00:01:25,368 --> 00:01:30,269
protecting water quality because of the

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,219
Chesapeake Bay largest estuary in North

33
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:35,250
America it's very ecologically and

34
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:37,560
economically valuable to the area it's

35
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,310
also very densely populated as we know

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,530
as well as dense with agricultural land

37
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:46,200
and you know it's got ten billion

38
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:50,239
dollars of agricultural output so it's

39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,770
not it's not something to overlook and

40
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:56,039
Maryland is almost a hundred percent in

41
00:01:52,769 --> 00:02:01,578
the Chesapeake Bay watershed so there

42
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,579
was political will in Maryland to really

43
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:10,139
focus on protecting the bay and so about

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,378
ten years ago a little bit more they

45
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,859
came up with this program it's different

46
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:16,049
from

47
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,060
the way the NRCS programs work in that

48
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,370
it's available to every farmer every

49
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,069
year you know there's never a cap on how

50
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,960
many years you can do it there are caps

51
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:26,909
on how many acres but it's sort of like

52
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,990
an enormous number for a farmer so

53
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:37,009
that's not really an issue and the idea

54
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:40,080
is not so much to incentivize like the

55
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:42,599
real enthusiasts it's to get everybody

56
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,120
it's not just the true believers this is

57
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:48,469
just money in the pocket so compared to

58
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,659
the payments for equip in say Indiana

59
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:53,520
this is twice the amount of money I mean

60
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:54,810
this was my first time singing the New

61
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,200
York numbers that you just presented

62
00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:00,449
which are comparable to these numbers

63
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:02,250
but this is a lot more money than a lot

64
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:05,819
of other states are providing through

65
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:08,459
the NRCS programs and farmers like this

66
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:10,349
a lot more than you know some of the

67
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,439
other governmental programs about cover

68
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:16,349
crops for example in Denmark there are

69
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:20,729
mandatory cover crops and they don't get

70
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:22,949
much choice so farmers like to get money

71
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:25,798
instead of just being told you have to

72
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:29,250
do this so the way the program works is

73
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:33,090
the farmer in the fall will make their

74
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:35,009
plan for the coming season they'll go to

75
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,229
their so a water conservation district

76
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:39,840
and they'll say okay I've got this many

77
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:42,149
acres I'm going to plant and this is how

78
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,489
I'm going to plant it this is how I'm

79
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,310
going to terminate the crop you know

80
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:50,340
this is the species that I am planting

81
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,379
all of this information is entered into

82
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,289
a big database and then the payments are

83
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:57,479
scheduled based on that and it's really

84
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:58,919
simple compared to the NRCS programs

85
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,649
where there's like a bunch of different

86
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:05,309
options it's like just basically did you

87
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:07,200
plant it by October 1st if you did then

88
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,989
you get this extra bump in pay for being

89
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,789
early did you plant it by the 15th well

90
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:13,079
then you get a bump for being sort of

91
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:15,328
the standard type thing and then there's

92
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,549
a late time thing after that we really

93
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:19,259
incentivize cereal rye because it is

94
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:22,409
just so much more productive than all of

95
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:26,490
the other species so that gets an extra

96
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:27,720
$10 bomb but then the entire purpose of

97
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,879
this program is

98
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,250
just water quality it's just keeping

99
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:35,939
nitrate out of the Chesapeake Bay

100
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:38,310
so legumes and leggy mixes which we're

101
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:41,310
all really enthusiastic about as we're

102
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:44,120
proud you know true believers are not

103
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,560
really incentivized in the program

104
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,649
because that's adding nitrogen to the

105
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,329
soil yeah now the the sort of

106
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:55,169
interesting thing is this harvested

107
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:57,689
column for many years of the program but

108
00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:00,660
not this year the program

109
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:02,550
allowed you to plant a grass in the fall

110
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,520
as long as you did not fertilize it

111
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:08,009
until the spring and then harvest it for

112
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:11,490
green the following summer and so

113
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:12,060
obviously wheat is a big option in the

114
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,069
region

115
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,379
people are really enthusiastic about

116
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:19,079
that this is the first year that they

117
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:21,149
are cutting that side of the program out

118
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,819
now you get a lot less money for that

119
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:30,659
but you know that's just sort of on top

120
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:32,129
of I don't know probably read somebody

121
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,410
caught them basically is what you're

122
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:38,579
saying I'm not I'm not super sure about

123
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:39,780
every so kind of an update from the

124
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:41,579
numbers that we were just talking about

125
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:44,489
it's actually 22 and a half million

126
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:45,779
dollars this year so it's it's a good

127
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,750
chunk of change especially because

128
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:51,029
Maryland is a relatively small state you

129
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,610
know this money wouldn't go that far in

130
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:58,109
you know say Iowa but was really far in

131
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:59,879
Maryland yeah so the kind of questions

132
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,860
that we want to address in the project

133
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:04,589
that I'm working on are are these

134
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,910
incentives working sort of over time you

135
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:09,000
know since the inception of the program

136
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:11,729
has adoption increased

137
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,350
are these cover crops capturing and and

138
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:16,168
keeping me from getting into the bay and

139
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:22,320
are the payouts sort of on the level

140
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:23,879
with the amount and so we're gonna

141
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,709
tackle that in a couple different ways

142
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:28,228
and talk about a couple different data

143
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:30,478
sets that we have doable so like I said

144
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:34,168
spoiler alert our incentives working

145
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,360
well they absolutely are so this is a

146
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:39,039
trees over time

147
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,040
[Music]

148
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:46,450
and you see that has gotten to be the

149
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:50,139
largest drop in the state on a given

150
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:52,149
year and part of that is driven because

151
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:54,339
of the wheat program that and the other

152
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:56,109
small grain commodities that promote

153
00:06:54,339 --> 00:07:00,129
most of the programs you were able to

154
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:03,129
enroll those program but then it's also

155
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:09,370
just you know this is now you know 54%

156
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:15,670
of our entire state crop land program in

157
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:20,860
here in this 2016 it just keeps going up

158
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:24,780
every year but then the question is you

159
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:27,850
know what's the interaction between the

160
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:29,619
timing of these various operations or

161
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:32,050
the types of management that people do

162
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,449
and the amount of money that we're

163
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:39,550
spending so this is you know average

164
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:42,219
planting or each field across all of the

165
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,900
years and this is following corn and

166
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,720
orange and following soybeans in the

167
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:53,589
green and you can see that the dates are

168
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:55,780
very clumped together here the days are

169
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:58,539
coming together here where you know

170
00:07:55,779 --> 00:08:00,549
they're sort of a they go up then they

171
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,450
go up and then they and then they drop

172
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:11,170
off well

173
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:14,469
imagine those days by $5 you get an

174
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:17,220
extra five $10 and then the actual final

175
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:20,580
date of the program varies years

176
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:23,710
trailing off there so we see this real

177
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:25,209
incentivization for farmers to say I'm

178
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:27,159
gonna drop everything in make sure that

179
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:33,009
I get it planted on the very last day

180
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:35,800
possible you know money bump but that

181
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:37,659
pales in comparison to the fact that

182
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,909
they all want to kill it on the very

183
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:43,329
first eligible date I mean now all this

184
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:48,129
is you know like 10% but so come March

185
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:53,879
1st they're all up there spring under

186
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:53,879
this be then they just want to get out

187
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:10,779
but then after you know that first 10%

188
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:13,779
of folks you have this kind of long tail

189
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:16,689
of you know when the various kill dates

190
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:20,429
are some people are going all the way

191
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,430
into May and then the June and July is

192
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,170
[Music]

193
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:33,009
and so then the question is you know

194
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:35,009
over the years of the program have these

195
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:38,110
incentives that we really want people

196
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:41,080
with have they increased in popularity

197
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:42,970
so you recall that like early planting

198
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,000
gives you an extra 10 bucks since you

199
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:48,639
would expect that you know from the

200
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,519
second in 2004 when they were only

201
00:09:48,639 --> 00:10:01,720
offering $20 so now in 2016 where you

202
00:09:54,519 --> 00:10:04,000
get a maximum bonuses are people going

203
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,840
for that top rate and they're really not

204
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,580
there is either you know early plantings

205
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,649
are actually going down late plant

206
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:14,320
things are going up little change in

207
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:18,100
no-till and really no change in adoption

208
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:23,220
3 all right so I'm gonna take away from

209
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,220
this is if you allow

210
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:30,620
but they're not willing to change their

211
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:40,789
operations they're not willing to change

212
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:48,080
their so it's if the money is not really

213
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:51,559
driving and why are we so concerned with

214
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:57,340
early planting and late killing well the

215
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:57,339
programming problem from our perspective

216
00:10:57,429 --> 00:11:04,779
the policymakers so this is sort of like

217
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:09,980
your potential 23 days on the y-axis

218
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:14,230
versus and this is from the Y Research

219
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,230
Station on the Eastern Shore which is

220
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:22,639
and so I've got here the number of

221
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:27,830
growing degree days you might accumulate

222
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:30,169
until first and then the first date

223
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:32,540
you're eligible to kill March 1st and

224
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:38,269
then through sometime in the spring

225
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:42,199
maybe easily in the fall there isn't

226
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:46,279
very much we tend to have similar

227
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:51,860
weather every year and get a lot more

228
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:55,909
growing three days I plant early two to

229
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:58,519
four times but then we might have a warm

230
00:11:55,909 --> 00:12:00,079
winter where by March first you've

231
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:03,500
accumulated a lot of growing degree days

232
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:05,570
or we might have a cold winter where you

233
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,720
know you've had very little change from

234
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:11,379
January to March so you don't see a huge

235
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:18,170
increase we see them start to spread out

236
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:20,000
and then going into spring and we know

237
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:22,789
that is what really drives biomass

238
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,059
biomass is what's going to drive nitrate

239
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:27,860
accumulation the problem is the whole

240
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:31,569
point of the program is to accumulate

241
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,570
nitrogen in the fall

242
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:39,889
so that's part of why the program is not

243
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:39,889
really incentivizing later kill dates

244
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:55,070
already lost we not really the point of

245
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:55,069
the program

246
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:14,379
oh okay gonna set that time and start

247
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:16,000
playing with it so the way that we

248
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:18,490
wanted to answer some of these questions

249
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:24,039
we've got a combination of some field

250
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:25,659
studies and some remote sensing so we

251
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:27,759
identified a bunch of sites over on the

252
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:31,299
Eastern Shore this is near that Y

253
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:34,210
research station and these are all very

254
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:37,959
sandy soils they're almost all alton

255
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:40,090
soils like textured and like I said

256
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,650
these are the top counties that are

257
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:43,090
enrolled the number one County the

258
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:45,519
number four County in the number three

259
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:47,080
County and you see there a bunch of

260
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,169
other top tens you're on the Eastern

261
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:58,330
Shore as well as a few in central

262
00:13:50,169 --> 00:14:01,500
Maryland and so we went out anyway so we

263
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:04,580
went out and by we I actually mean

264
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,580
[Music]

265
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:21,909
technology alright so and see and then

266
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:27,549
in the spring after green out as they're

267
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:30,250
started took samples analyzed them for

268
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:32,169
CNN and here you can see the real

269
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,179
difference between a cold beer and a

270
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:36,370
warm here

271
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:39,699
a cold year you accumulate very little

272
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:42,460
biomass from December to March in a warm

273
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:44,890
year you can accumulate two to four

274
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:48,220
times as much biomass from December to

275
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:50,169
March so you know that's something that

276
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,149
we think is really valuable but that's

277
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:54,729
what farmers are afraid of a lot of

278
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:59,529
farmers who don't want to have that you

279
00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:02,050
know high residue and so as far as this

280
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:04,059
program is concerned as long as you're

281
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:08,409
getting something here that's a success

282
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:16,389
and the question is is that enough to

283
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:18,909
success for phosphorus loading and all

284
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:21,549
the other things that spring

285
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:23,620
are not being targeted by the program so

286
00:15:21,549 --> 00:15:26,319
the program you know has some diversity

287
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:29,889
in it there's radishes and there's like

288
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:36,370
you mixes but 90% of the farms enrolled

289
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:38,769
are cereal rye barley and so this is not

290
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:43,659
super important but basically this is

291
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:46,870
all of the management practices that the

292
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:49,000
farmers are reporting and did some

293
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:53,500
machine learning algorithms on it see

294
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,799
the big cluster together and so they end

295
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:59,769
up forming these clusters where people

296
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:03,549
who are planting after soybeans and the

297
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:06,250
plant late they have a variety of

298
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:08,589
establishment that this is a variety of

299
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:10,330
species but this is sort of one of the

300
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,840
clusters and then you've got people who

301
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:15,580
are camping we got people who are doing

302
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,590
broadcasting various varieties people

303
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:22,090
were planting barley and we're planting

304
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:23,340
right so those are sort of some short

305
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,690
hands to think about these different

306
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,879
clusters that came out in the data and

307
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:38,620
and it's reasonable to assume that these

308
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:40,240
management practices would vary so then

309
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:43,720
the question is how did these come from

310
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,940
perform in these clusters that I just

311
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,279
came out with and just as a reminder you

312
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:52,570
know after soybeans means late wheat

313
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:57,250
barley and rye drilled small grains and

314
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:59,980
then broadcast is often earlier by you

315
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:05,980
know either aerial or just broadcast

316
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:10,480
after the crop is harvested and you know

317
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:13,000
this is the details of the model so you

318
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,920
see that we've got these nice lines that

319
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,470
connect them and some are much deeper

320
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:20,460
than the others and in fact it's

321
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:23,319
statistically significant that rye

322
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:26,410
outperforms all the other clusters and

323
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:28,450
then our two small grains are next and

324
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:31,870
then we've got our broadcast owner after

325
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:32,740
soybeans pulling up the rear and so what

326
00:17:31,869 --> 00:17:36,298
that means is

327
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:40,778
Rai is just always going to be more

328
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:43,240
performant than just going to more

329
00:17:40,778 --> 00:17:47,500
biomass it's going to salvage more

330
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:50,440
nitrogen no matter when you but then

331
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,690
you've got and and you know you would

332
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,870
expect that you're really barley would

333
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,490
do well but not as well and what's

334
00:17:55,869 --> 00:18:00,038
interesting at out of this is you know

335
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:03,399
even if you plant after soybeans even if

336
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:05,980
you drill in if you plant a good species

337
00:18:03,398 --> 00:18:10,178
like right you're never going to get

338
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:12,399
that fuel performance because the slope

339
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:14,169
of this line just isn't high enough no

340
00:18:12,398 --> 00:18:16,209
matter how far out you go in these

341
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:16,980
growing degree days you're not going to

342
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:21,159
get there

343
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:22,839
and and that's a real challenge so it's

344
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:32,980
basically telling us that if you don't

345
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:35,349
get and likewise with the broadcasting

346
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:37,589
no matter how early you get it in if

347
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:40,808
you're not getting good soil seeds

348
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:43,599
you're not going to be getting good and

349
00:18:40,808 --> 00:18:46,480
it's never going to be able to catch up

350
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:50,969
to your you know sort of well-managed

351
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:55,120
species so then this is sort of the

352
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:59,200
final surgery date a bit if you look at

353
00:18:55,119 --> 00:19:01,869
this is kilograms of n that is in the

354
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:08,649
biomass in the spring divided by the

355
00:19:01,869 --> 00:19:10,658
number of dollars and very consistent no

356
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:12,939
matter whether it's in the commodity

357
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:15,190
program or if it's traditional ever

358
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,890
table doesn't matter if it's you know

359
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:20,440
between the different clusters here rise

360
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:22,600
a little bit better but you know the the

361
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:27,100
median this heavy black line is pretty

362
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:36,308
similar so that kind of answers our our

363
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:38,879
last question of are these payouts the

364
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,879
ones there

365
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:51,340
is one metric that you might use and so

366
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:52,930
the next step of this is that we're

367
00:19:51,339 --> 00:20:00,459
going to extend this analysis to use

368
00:19:52,930 --> 00:20:01,900
biomass estimates from and then we're

369
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:21,910
going to test these relationships across

370
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:24,460
soil and so just a quick conclusions to

371
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:27,180
drive performance and the small green

372
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:32,819
subsidy we're available in the program

373
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:32,820
achieved a lot of the singles of crops

374
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:41,550
so any other question that Extension

375
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:44,740
sociological component things like is

376
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:48,309
very variable among different areas

377
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:51,160
there some district agents who are going

378
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:55,179
to be very hands-on and and there are

379
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:58,090
others who you know are not right i I

380
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:01,299
don't know that the state has that on

381
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:02,949
their radar you know when I read through

382
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:05,289
the meeting or the yeah the meeting

383
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:07,870
notes those or the most recent planning

384
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:10,599
committees you know they're they're not

385
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:12,279
even thinking about trying to optimize

386
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:12,909
the program they're just trying to keep

387
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:16,240
it going

388
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,470
oh I don't know and based on what Dean

389
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,019
just told us

390
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,940
sounds like probably huh because if

391
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:25,529
they're sort of shifting it from an

392
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,529
incentive to a regulation

393
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:33,210
you

394
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:38,990
this has been a production of Cornell
