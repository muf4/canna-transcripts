1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:09,769
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:11,359
University well it's wonderful to be

3
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:13,940
here it's wonderful to see old friends

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:17,480
and and colleagues that I'm working with

5
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:19,820
now collaborating and also to to be in a

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,010
place with snow coming down you know I

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:25,448
came from nine inches and now I brought

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:28,160
it with me so you might get nine inches

9
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:30,259
it's really a pleasure to be here and I

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,020
obviously didn't do the math very well

11
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:35,539
when I accepted that international

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:38,690
typology Society presidency because I'll

13
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:40,729
be President in 2023 I'm a president now

14
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:42,799
but it'll be 2023 then when the meeting

15
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:46,339
is and obviously I'm not that young

16
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:48,409
anymore so I don't do math very well but

17
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,910
today I'd liked it I'm gonna talk to you

18
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:52,429
about something that I don't

19
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:53,839
I haven't often talked about so a lot of

20
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:57,649
people aren't aware that we're working

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:02,840
in this area but it stems from the fact

22
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:05,120
that we're we're very interested and I

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:09,469
have been for my whole career interested

24
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:12,079
in so I started my career at Kansas

25
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:13,700
State and back then for those of you who

26
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:17,420
are young it's a little bit different

27
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,730
because when I went into Kansas they

28
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,790
said that I could work on any system I

29
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:24,620
wanted to as a plant pathologist

30
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,600
understanding that as a plant microbe

31
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,630
interaction person we were called

32
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:33,140
disease physiologist at the time that we

33
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:36,560
would maybe choose model systems and so

34
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,900
I had worked in tobacco and fostonia so

35
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,140
on a serum for my PhD and then

36
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,940
verticillium in hops for my postdoc and

37
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:47,329
I thought well I really want to work in

38
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:50,179
what a choice to have to get to choose

39
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:52,489
what you want to work with I wanted to

40
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,620
work on an important crop and I wanted

41
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:58,129
to work on important diseases of an

42
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:59,990
important crop so I cast around and

43
00:01:58,129 --> 00:02:02,060
asked questions called my major

44
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:03,500
professor Louisa Cara and said what

45
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,070
would you do if you had it to do over

46
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,950
again

47
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:09,590
he said I'd work on sigatoka in banana

48
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,020
or I'd work in Xanthomonas arise Ian

49
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,240
Rice

50
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,820
about the time I started in Xanthomonas

51
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:19,900
Ric and rice they had discovered race

52
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:22,329
specificity so the idea that there might

53
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,210
be single dominant resistance genes

54
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:27,670
I knew that rice was a diploid so it

55
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:29,800
would be a tractable system relative to

56
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:33,609
wheat which is the state I was in Kansas

57
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:36,880
had a lot of wheat and that the bacteria

58
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:40,240
was Xanthomonas arise arise e that

59
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,519
causes bacterial blight would probably

60
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,830
be genetically tractable back then it

61
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,050
wasn't but it probably would be at some

62
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:50,050
point in evolution of the back of my

63
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:53,040
career so I started working in this

64
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:56,439
really important disease which is is

65
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:58,389
still B major disease in rice although

66
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:01,180
Xanthomonas are basically as you'll see

67
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:06,339
is emerging as an important disease of

68
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:09,490
rice so the idea the my interest was

69
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,189
could I apply my microbiology and my

70
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:16,180
plant physiology back then we were

71
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:18,639
called skills from my PhD to solving

72
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,189
this intractable problem well we haven't

73
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:24,779
done that yet but you know there are

74
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:28,810
still jobs out there for people because

75
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:31,120
the issue really is that this disease is

76
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:34,959
fairly well controlled by single gene

77
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,599
resistance and the single dominant genes

78
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,360
are sort of the the mainstay for

79
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,639
resistance but the problem is as you

80
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,010
well know in plant pathology I don't

81
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,809
need to tell people this that you plant

82
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:50,379
out sources of resistance they're

83
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:52,479
functional for many years then you vtec

84
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:54,969
virulence in the pathogen population the

85
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:59,049
pathogen changes to overcome that

86
00:03:54,969 --> 00:04:00,609
resistance so we have a continuous job

87
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:05,740
we have to keep identifying new

88
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:09,580
resistance in rice it can take up to 10

89
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:12,430
to 15 years to find and integrase a new

90
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:16,209
disease resistance gene so if we're

91
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:18,879
breaking down as can occur within five

92
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,949
or less years it's not really a

93
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:23,860
tractable system we need to come up with

94
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:24,879
other ways so I've spent a large part of

95
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,189
my career

96
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,379
trying to figure out what I call the

97
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:32,589
Holy Grail and many of other people call

98
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:35,589
it this too which is what how can we

99
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:39,849
identify disease resistance that is not

100
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:41,799
only long-lasting but ideally effective

101
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,650
against multiple pathogens either

102
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,810
multiple races of the same pathogen or

103
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:49,959
multiple pathogens like different

104
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:52,300
bacterial diseases or bacteria and fungi

105
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:54,339
or different fungal diseases and I think

106
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,949
the Holy Grail is a good example because

107
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:58,810
by definition it not only provides

108
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:01,449
happiness and eternal youth which of

109
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:07,089
course we'd all love but it is it also

110
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:09,399
provides food in infinite abundance so

111
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:13,479
today the story I'm going to tell you is

112
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:16,620
a story about identifying resistance in

113
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:19,689
different kinds of novel populations and

114
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:24,310
I'm going to tell you the story that

115
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:27,339
onna Bosa her PhD work where she was

116
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,889
looking for resistance in rice that is

117
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:31,509
effective against both two bacterial

118
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:31,839
pathogens which we'll talk about in a

119
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:35,099
minute

120
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:37,899
so broad-spectrum resistance and

121
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:41,620
specifically targeting Africa and the

122
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:43,959
reason is because both of these diseases

123
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:48,160
are emerging is really important in

124
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:50,469
Africa and not only that but there's no

125
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,760
single gene resistance for bacterial

126
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:57,940
leaf streak so it's a problem and and

127
00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:01,810
they're being because they're moving

128
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:04,269
rice in from China into Africa and the

129
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:07,360
those those types of rice are

130
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:09,759
susceptible to the African strains of

131
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,889
these pathogens and we're so they're

132
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,349
having a big problem with the disease in

133
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:16,449
Africa and then I'm going to move into a

134
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,340
second story because it uses the same

135
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:21,699
magic population I'll show you the power

136
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:25,589
of this magic population by a postdoc in

137
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:28,149
the lab Alejandra Huerta and Emily

138
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:33,189
DeLorean who was a master's student in

139
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:35,649
the lab so the two diseases that will

140
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:37,269
will be featured today are caused by

141
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:38,779
Xanthomonas array Ziggler which is

142
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:41,029
bacterial leaf streak of right

143
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:43,069
this is really an interesting disease

144
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:45,169
because and the difference between these

145
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:48,949
diseases is really interesting this is

146
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:50,449
an intercellular pathogen it enters the

147
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:52,579
plant through the stow mates and it

148
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:53,529
moves in the plant in the intercellular

149
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:57,079
spaces

150
00:06:53,529 --> 00:07:00,649
whereas Xanthomonas arise arise ii very

151
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:03,379
closely related genetically is a

152
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:04,969
vascular pathogen it enters the plants

153
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:06,980
either through wounds or the height of

154
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:09,080
food water forests which are located on

155
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:12,290
the edges of the leaf and it causes a

156
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:14,240
blight like symptom so two very similar

157
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:17,810
pathogens but two very different

158
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,480
lifestyles so finding resistance that's

159
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:23,060
effective against both could be a bit of

160
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,189
a challenge one might think as I

161
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,800
mentioned earlier bacterial leaf streak

162
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:30,978
is emerging as a major problem in parts

163
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:34,189
of Asia and in Africa it's actually

164
00:07:30,978 --> 00:07:36,199
thought that it used to be observed only

165
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:38,899
on one side of the ANSI River in China

166
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,728
now it's observed on both sides of the

167
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:44,049
ANSI River and they're thinking a lot of

168
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:47,149
it is because of climate variation and

169
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:50,840
impacts of weather on the on the on the

170
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:52,789
system in this case we don't have single

171
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:54,799
dominant resistance gene the only single

172
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:57,020
dominant resistance genes that we have

173
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,870
to this pathogen or one that we

174
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:02,240
identified from Mays years ago which is

175
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:06,110
we've introduced in the inter ice

176
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,060
controls the disease but otherwise they

177
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,788
usually use quantitative traits type

178
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:14,839
Louis I or quantitative trait governed

179
00:08:10,788 --> 00:08:16,819
resistance to control this disease so

180
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:19,759
there are limited resistant sources for

181
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:22,430
it not only in Asia but also in Africa

182
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,110
and it's a bacterial blight as I

183
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,750
mentioned as a vascular pathogens

184
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:29,030
controlled by single genes but there are

185
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,560
a few sources of resistance that have

186
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:32,478
been identified that are effective

187
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:40,940
against the African eye slits of this

188
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:43,580
pathogen so let me introduce you to the

189
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:46,640
population that we used to identify

190
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,870
sources of resistance so my colleagues

191
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,860
at the International Rice Research

192
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,860
Institute

193
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:55,649
few years back developed what are called

194
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:58,379
rice magic populations and these

195
00:08:55,649 --> 00:09:01,409
populations are multi parent advanced

196
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:03,450
generation populations and and folks may

197
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:06,120
have worked with them in there there are

198
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:10,259
now magic populations not only in rice

199
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:15,330
but also in in wheat and other also

200
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:18,149
Arabidopsis the this population has

201
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:20,370
eight parents so you can imagine you can

202
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:22,439
imagine the genetics that you're

203
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,149
scrambling when you're intercrossing

204
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,280
eight parents and we'll talk about how

205
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:28,230
it's done but I want you to notice this

206
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:30,689
is the population there are two thousand

207
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:33,180
lines planted out at Erie where they're

208
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:36,330
propagating it I want you to notice how

209
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:38,989
even the pop how beautifully even it is

210
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:41,850
it's because in this particular case

211
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:44,759
eight of the parents that were selected

212
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:47,730
our elite varieties but they have

213
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:50,159
different traits of interest so what

214
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,259
that means and importantly what that

215
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:55,769
means is that anything that we identify

216
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:57,659
in this population is very close it's

217
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:59,939
like a pre breeding material it's very

218
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:03,089
close to what the breeders can use to

219
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,950
integrate into other elite varieties you

220
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:09,480
don't have a lot of genetic drag from

221
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:13,710
other things so the other reason it's

222
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,750
nice is because not only did they select

223
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:18,840
those eight parents for useful traits

224
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:23,250
like disease resistance drought

225
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:27,360
tolerance salt tolerance phosphorus

226
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:30,360
utilization but the population is huge

227
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,000
there are 21,000 magic lines so when you

228
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,070
map in that population you're you're

229
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
almost getting down to the genes of

230
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:40,650
interest and the offspring as I

231
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,460
mentioned can be integrated directly

232
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:46,139
into breeding programs so I'm not going

233
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,970
to spend a lot of time on this because

234
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:50,100
I'm not the person that developed it and

235
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:53,700
it's a pretty complicated process and

236
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:56,639
long term process but you take the eight

237
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,890
parents and you do a series of crosses

238
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,799
and in fact you've crossed at least

239
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:02,610
three times to develop this particular

240
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:05,578
population and

241
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:07,739
and after you've done you've finished

242
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:11,099
crossing you start selfing and then

243
00:11:07,739 --> 00:11:17,040
yourself in our case we use the s8 so

244
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:21,048
you get rid of any other extraneous

245
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:24,928
information but you have really a single

246
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:31,230
that is a true line once you get it so

247
00:11:24,928 --> 00:11:34,409
essentially you have 21,000 isogenic

248
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,269
lines once you get down to this and they

249
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:40,368
breed true because rice is a selfing

250
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:44,039
population so this is really powerful

251
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:47,489
but we but really they hadn't explored

252
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:49,110
the utility of it for disease resistance

253
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:50,160
they had a little bit of work on that

254
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:54,419
but not much

255
00:11:50,159 --> 00:12:01,350
so when Anna came into my lab we wanted

256
00:11:54,419 --> 00:12:04,169
to ask the question of could we use this

257
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:06,209
magic lines the series of magic lines to

258
00:12:04,169 --> 00:12:09,389
identify disease sources of disease

259
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:12,659
resistance that are novel and that are

260
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:14,579
effective against both Xanthomonas arise

261
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:17,009
arise either bacterial blight pathogen

262
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:19,469
and Xanthomonas tricyclic the bacterial

263
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:22,318
leaf straight pathogen and we focused on

264
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:24,989
the African strains because we had this

265
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:28,289
issue of the disease being prevalent in

266
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:32,040
Africa but no sources of resistance so

267
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:34,860
the first step was to genotype the

268
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:38,269
materials and that was done by

269
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:41,159
genotyping by sequencing so we have a

270
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:44,399
14,000 snips that we were using so not

271
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:47,909
the entire suite of snips but 14,000 and

272
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:52,769
we screened a subset of the s8

273
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:56,308
population so really fixed lines and we

274
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:58,198
did about 330 lines and the importance

275
00:12:56,308 --> 00:13:00,719
of that is that's not a huge population

276
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:02,969
to screen but you'll see it's very

277
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,528
effective so we could identify sources

278
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:10,528
of resistance in a very small population

279
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:12,659
we phenotyped with the two diseases the

280
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:15,960
vascular disease we use a scissor clip

281
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:18,209
to introduce it into the vessels the the

282
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:21,180
intercellular pathogens we infiltrate

283
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:24,180
into the space and so the experiment was

284
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:26,009
done with 20 different very diverse

285
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:29,519
anthem on a tricycle and a rise II

286
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:31,649
strains 10 each and we not only did this

287
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,009
in the greenhouse replicated in the

288
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:37,289
greenhouse over time but we also with

289
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:39,600
our colleagues in Africa screen in the

290
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:41,370
field because obviously if you're

291
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,509
looking for resistance it has to be

292
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:47,970
effective in the field then all of that

293
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:52,169
data is taken and integrated and

294
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:54,420
analyzed and because we're using a huge

295
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:56,879
population with multiple parents you can

296
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:59,699
started you can do G wasps analysis or

297
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:02,639
genome-wide Association analysis as well

298
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:06,080
as interval mapping so what did we find

299
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,669
and I'm not going to give you the whole

300
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,290
experimental process that Ani used to

301
00:14:08,669 --> 00:14:15,120
get to the steps because I want to move

302
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:18,329
into the second set of work but this is

303
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,960
an example of one set of strains you can

304
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:23,700
see that the indica was segregating or

305
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:27,960
resistance and you can see typically

306
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:30,990
that you have transgressive segregation

307
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:33,030
where you have lines that are more

308
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,970
susceptible than the eight parents and

309
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:38,039
in often cases we have lines that are

310
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:42,060
more susceptible or more resistant than

311
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:44,579
the most resistant parent and this is

312
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:46,589
just two of the different pathogens that

313
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,590
were used in the inoculation one or Z

314
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:51,720
and one a right siccola so that's good

315
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:54,629
we know that the population oh I forgot

316
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,670
to tell you an important point the other

317
00:14:54,629 --> 00:15:00,360
good thing about the magic because

318
00:14:56,669 --> 00:15:03,529
you're scrambling the genomes you you

319
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:06,089
can do two things you can create new

320
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:09,389
novel resistances because you get

321
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:11,790
recombination and you can uncover

322
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:13,679
resistances that you might not have seen

323
00:15:11,789 --> 00:15:16,649
in a particular parent because of its

324
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:20,179
genetic background so with a population

325
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:23,429
like this you have many obvious

326
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:25,489
opportunities for creating new sources

327
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:30,019
of resistance

328
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:34,068
so onna in the jiwa studies was able to

329
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:36,528
identify sources of resistance to not

330
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:39,849
only Xanthomonas arise arise e bacterial

331
00:15:36,528 --> 00:15:42,769
blight as you can see from this but also

332
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:46,999
when she did identify those sources of

333
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:49,399
resistance we what was wonderful was

334
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:52,159
this doesn't always happen and it's it's

335
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:54,740
in general true but not always true

336
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:57,828
we couldn't confirm what we identified

337
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:00,198
in g wasps by the interval mapping that

338
00:15:57,828 --> 00:16:02,419
doesn't always happen but that's a good

339
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:07,118
indicator that what we're seeing is

340
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:10,368
really real and in fact the most

341
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:13,879
important piece of information is that

342
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:16,910
we saw we were able to recapitulate what

343
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:20,509
we saw in the greenhouse in the field in

344
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:26,419
mali so in the end what she ended up

345
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:29,869
with was a map and there and that map

346
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:33,139
includes resistances so she identified

347
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:35,928
14 different QTL that were effective to

348
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:38,899
multiple Xanthomonas arise east rains

349
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:41,269
and both Xanthomonas arise E and arise

350
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:43,879
Achilles she got eleven broad spectrum

351
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:46,818
resistances that those regions conferred

352
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:49,159
resistance to both pathogens with very

353
00:16:46,818 --> 00:16:51,019
different lifestyles and then she was

354
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:58,129
able to identify three paths of our

355
00:16:51,019 --> 00:17:00,558
specific QTL so this is great but what's

356
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:03,470
most interesting is this one here on

357
00:17:00,558 --> 00:17:06,109
chromosome 4 because the stars indicate

358
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,759
and the bars indicate different eye

359
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:10,818
slits and you can see that the one on

360
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:13,338
chromosome four hit a lot of eye slits

361
00:17:10,818 --> 00:17:14,898
so that is a source of resistance that

362
00:17:13,338 --> 00:17:17,688
we had never observed in any other

363
00:17:14,898 --> 00:17:21,469
population and what's interesting about

364
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:25,759
it is that when we look at that region

365
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:28,250
we can see because we can map this with

366
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:31,720
both gos and integral mapping we can

367
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:34,159
actually get down to what snips are

368
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,220
important for resistance and which snips

369
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:38,659
are important for susceptibility

370
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,200
relative to the different eye slits so

371
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:41,480
that helps

372
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:46,250
narrow into the region with the jeans

373
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:49,130
and it was effective against many of the

374
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:51,679
eye slits that we had screened it with

375
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:55,940
from the field in the field and in the

376
00:17:51,679 --> 00:18:01,100
greenhouse so a major contribution in

377
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:04,610
that particular aspect so to summarize

378
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:06,500
this part using the magic population

379
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:08,599
which we didn't know if we were going to

380
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,638
be able to see sources of resistance to

381
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:12,168
either the pathogens really I mean there

382
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:14,298
were there were a few single dominant

383
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:17,120
resistance genes in the population we

384
00:18:14,298 --> 00:18:22,788
saw them but we we were able to pull out

385
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:26,319
11 different genes that were effective

386
00:18:22,788 --> 00:18:29,058
against both pathogens which is huge and

387
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,829
that one on chromosome four is one that

388
00:18:29,058 --> 00:18:32,599
were focused on still and again it was

389
00:18:30,829 --> 00:18:36,638
confirmed in both the greenhouse in the

390
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:40,009
field again this is important because

391
00:18:36,638 --> 00:18:42,619
now that we have this line these lines

392
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:46,129
with for example this chromosome for QTL

393
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:48,408
or this region of resistance we can

394
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,830
begin to integrate this into varieties

395
00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:56,750
that are useful in both Africa and in

396
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:59,480
Asia for that matter so with that as a

397
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:02,269
backdrop we now knew that this

398
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,028
population was manageable and we could

399
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:08,569
we didn't have to screen all 2100 lines

400
00:19:05,028 --> 00:19:10,398
in order to identify something we we

401
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:13,069
thought okay let's start to see if we

402
00:19:10,398 --> 00:19:15,018
can begin to ask questions with that the

403
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:18,710
population that we've been interested in

404
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:21,200
for some time and so Alejandra led this

405
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:25,399
project with the help of Anna I want to

406
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:28,100
point out mapping with eight parents

407
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:30,229
that are scrambled up is not trivial

408
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:33,079
and the program's the analytical

409
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:35,750
programs to do the G wasps and interval

410
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:38,449
mapping we're just being developed as

411
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:41,450
Anna was doing this project so she was

412
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:45,440
on the phone with this this molecular

413
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:47,808
mapper the the bioinformatics person who

414
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,509
originally was in the Philippines then

415
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:53,119
was in Australia and now is it a company

416
00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:55,160
in California Anana was continuing

417
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:56,689
they were wonderful about working with

418
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,058
her so she became a really valuable

419
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:02,900
resource for the rest of the work in the

420
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:06,349
lab and learned a lot more than she

421
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:09,769
expected to about these populations so

422
00:20:06,349 --> 00:20:12,949
the next question was can we use this

423
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:15,200
population to identify rice varieties

424
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:17,509
that target specific effectors in

425
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:22,100
pathogens and why would we want to do

426
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:24,670
that why is that of interest so many of

427
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:29,419
you especially in this department where

428
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:33,289
Adam Bogdanov is know that tally factors

429
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:36,110
are the dominant effector families in

430
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:38,210
Santha moments and in fact Xanthomonas

431
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:40,250
arrays and Xanthomonas anthem ELISA

432
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,890
Rosie Rosie and Xanthomonas arrays ERISA

433
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:45,319
Cola have multiple copies of tally

434
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:47,809
factors so these are transcription

435
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:50,359
activator like effectors there the major

436
00:20:47,808 --> 00:20:52,339
virulence factors for these pathogens

437
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:54,349
they have other effectors but these are

438
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:56,899
the major ones the effectors are

439
00:20:54,349 --> 00:20:59,149
produced in the bacteria pumped into the

440
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:01,309
plant cell using a type 3 secretion

441
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:04,610
system once in the plant cell they're

442
00:21:01,308 --> 00:21:07,639
mobilized into the nucleus they bind to

443
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:10,308
the promoters of genes in the plant and

444
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,350
they activate the transcription of those

445
00:21:10,308 --> 00:21:14,230
genes we'll come back to that in a

446
00:21:12,349 --> 00:21:17,419
little bit

447
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:19,250
the Xanthomonas arise e strains that we

448
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:22,670
work with have multiple copies of the

449
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:26,589
tally factors they can have up to 20 or

450
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:29,150
more copies of these effector genes and

451
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:31,779
again they bind to these sequences in

452
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:34,160
the plant and activate their expression

453
00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:37,160
now there are several important factors

454
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:40,460
here not all of the tally factors

455
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:43,880
function and not all of them function

456
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:46,190
equally in the plant so a number of

457
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:49,790
years ago but Gionta by when he was in

458
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:53,299
the lab showed that if you knock out one

459
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:56,558
gene a ver XA 7 you reduce virulence of

460
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:59,720
the pathogen significantly and

461
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:02,359
interestingly if he knocked if you knock

462
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,240
that gene out it's a major effect tally

463
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:06,990
effector so in order to see the effect

464
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,210
of other tally factors we had

465
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:11,069
to work with that mutant and knock out

466
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:13,679
other genes so this is a double mutant

467
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:17,450
and you see that there's no additional

468
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,679
effect when he knocked out a ver x8 n we

469
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:23,009
continued to work with that particular

470
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:25,679
set of isolates and we also did field

471
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:28,049
studies nollie veracruz when she was in

472
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,690
the lab and we showed that at the field

473
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:35,970
level a number of years back back in

474
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:39,058
2000 that if you lose a VXR a

475
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:42,509
sevenfunction in the field not only do

476
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:45,629
you lose the effector function the a

477
00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:47,490
virulence function the but you also lose

478
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,710
the Offit's of the pathogen or the

479
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:51,720
aggressiveness and reduce fitness in the

480
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:54,269
field so it doesn't persist in the

481
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:59,400
population so it seems to be a very very

482
00:22:54,269 --> 00:23:03,660
very important Fitness factor so with

483
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:07,070
that work we at that time proposed a

484
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:11,370
hypothesis that you could predict the

485
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:15,990
durability of a resistance gene based on

486
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:19,049
its contribution to pathogen fitness so

487
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:21,750
Ava X a7 is a very important effector

488
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:25,440
and therefore if a resistance gene

489
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:27,799
targets that that fit that resistance

490
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,019
gene is probably going to be more

491
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:33,389
effective and durable in the field than

492
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:36,179
one that targets a 4x a 10 and in fact

493
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:39,059
nolle showed that in fields experiments

494
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:42,240
and in greenhouse experiments that that

495
00:23:39,058 --> 00:23:44,490
if you lose a TRX a sevenfunction in the

496
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,549
field if there's mutation in the field

497
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:49,740
to that you lose the pathogen doesn't

498
00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:56,308
persist and that is a very effective

499
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:58,829
resistance gene so we thought well there

500
00:23:56,308 --> 00:24:01,678
are other effectors in Xanthomonas arise

501
00:23:58,829 --> 00:24:03,990
e and we had looked at a number of these

502
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,240
other effectors doing similar studies

503
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:10,620
like this and one of them stood out

504
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:13,079
because it was called tau 7b it's also a

505
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:16,109
tally factor it's it's found in the

506
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:19,289
genomes of many different the

507
00:24:16,109 --> 00:24:20,459
Xanthomonas arise e but this one has

508
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:22,859
only an increment

509
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,169
or a minor contribution tubulin so if

510
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:27,508
you knock it out as well as a 4x a seven

511
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:33,409
you get an incremental increase decrease

512
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:33,409
in the virulence so our question was

513
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:39,690
also this one is found in almost all the

514
00:24:36,778 --> 00:24:42,089
sequence anthem Anasazi genomes so it's

515
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:46,038
present everywhere it has a minor

516
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:50,689
contribution to resistance so if we

517
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:54,720
identify sources of resistance to tau 7b

518
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:56,700
could that be added to our gene pool for

519
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,558
resistance to help stabilize and make

520
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,679
the resistance more durable since so

521
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:03,450
many bacteria have it even if it's only

522
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,580
contributing a little bit to virulence

523
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:11,009
is it contributing more to other things

524
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:15,058
like fitness in the field so Alejandra

525
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:18,659
and her colleagues set up an experiment

526
00:25:15,058 --> 00:25:21,839
similar to what Allah had done we took

527
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:25,528
the genotype lines we phenotype them in

528
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:28,378
this case we sub cloned and confirmed

529
00:25:25,528 --> 00:25:31,230
first that we had tell 7b they put it

530
00:25:28,378 --> 00:25:33,298
into a strain where we were over

531
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:34,919
expressing it purposefully because it's

532
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:37,740
a minor effect and we're screening a

533
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:40,889
population you need to have a pretty

534
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:43,230
hefty gene product in order to do that

535
00:25:40,888 --> 00:25:50,008
and then went through the mapping

536
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:53,759
process so importantly the magic lines

537
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:56,519
segregate for resistance initially you

538
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,440
can see that they segregate we have a

539
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:01,679
transgressive segregation again we're

540
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:04,470
seeing higher levels of susceptibility

541
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,240
so I'm going to talk to you in a minute

542
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:09,058
about the function of tau effectors and

543
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,609
so that's not surprising but you have

544
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:14,428
the population has lines that are more

545
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:17,609
susceptible than the parent that also

546
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:19,528
implies importantly that you can map for

547
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:22,558
susceptibility if you want to understand

548
00:26:19,528 --> 00:26:26,038
virulence in a population the other

549
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:29,220
interesting point to this is that we

550
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:33,839
were able to identify resistance to both

551
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:38,610
p XO 2 p XO 99 with

552
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:41,250
the empty vector so this is the control

553
00:26:38,609 --> 00:26:43,649
strain so we have lines that are more

554
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:46,589
resistant than the parent as well as

555
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:50,509
lines that are more resistant to the PX

556
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:52,980
o99 the strain with the Tau 78 vector so

557
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:55,920
importantly for us to move forward the

558
00:26:52,980 --> 00:27:00,920
magic population contains lines with

559
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:04,529
resistance and susceptibility to tell 7b

560
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:07,529
now it's not surprising that tell 7b

561
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:09,889
showed like showed that virulence

562
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:12,899
function that it's headlines that would

563
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:15,180
it caused more disease because we knew

564
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,890
it was a variance factor before we

565
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:21,690
started and we confirmed that in this

566
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:24,420
study so this the bottom line on this

567
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:28,230
one in the G wasps analysis we saw

568
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:31,740
resistance to arise e PX o99 with the

569
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:35,549
empty vector so the population shows

570
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:37,710
resistance to the strain that we were

571
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:40,019
using to screen with not surprising in

572
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:41,160
fact we know that this is the AVR I'm

573
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:43,920
sorry the xa5

574
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:47,880
locus which Susan the couch worked with

575
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:50,370
a number of years ago and that those you

576
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,950
can see those same low sigh were

577
00:27:50,369 --> 00:28:00,719
identified when we put the towel 7b into

578
00:27:52,950 --> 00:28:03,420
the strain and also we found that there

579
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,610
was resistance that was unique to the

580
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:09,600
strain carrying towel 7b so we

581
00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:13,319
identified two low sy that conferred

582
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:16,259
resistance to tell 7b specifically if it

583
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:19,950
was in the strain that had 99 the strain

584
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:22,829
px on 99 and also importantly for us

585
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:25,470
this was confess all these QTL or these

586
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:30,869
regions were confirmed by interval

587
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:35,069
mapping so what's so interesting about

588
00:28:30,869 --> 00:28:38,129
tally effectors well there are there are

589
00:28:35,069 --> 00:28:41,279
different ways and how is tell 7b

590
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:43,740
potentially acting in this line and can

591
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:46,170
we predict something about how this

592
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,410
might be how this resistance might be

593
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:51,160
functioning by understand

594
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:56,140
something about tell 7b this is so tell

595
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:58,330
7b our tally factors in general are

596
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:59,980
known to interact with plants in

597
00:28:58,329 --> 00:29:03,460
generally in three different ways

598
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:06,339
in one case they bind to the promoter of

599
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:09,039
what we is called a death gene a typical

600
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:11,049
resistance gene type function and they

601
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,339
activate expression of that gene and you

602
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:15,700
get cell death something like a

603
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:19,470
hypersensitive response and the x8n AVR

604
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:22,990
x8n interaction is an example of that

605
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:24,730
another example of how Tali effectors

606
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:26,250
interact with plant genes is that they

607
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:29,740
bind to the promoter of the

608
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:31,630
susceptibility genes and when they bind

609
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,730
they activate expression of that

610
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:36,670
susceptibility gene and you get

611
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:39,370
increased disease the hypothesis is for

612
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:41,920
example that these sweet genes might be

613
00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:45,849
did the delivering helping to deliver

614
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:48,400
sugar out to feed the bacteria the other

615
00:29:45,849 --> 00:29:50,709
hypothesis or other mechanism that's

616
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,680
been demonstrated is where you have

617
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:56,890
instead of activation of a death gene

618
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:59,740
you have mutations or changes in the

619
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:02,500
promoter or the nearby the promoter that

620
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:05,339
don't allow the Tile effector to bind

621
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:08,109
and you don't get activation of

622
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:12,220
susceptibility and therefore you have

623
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:14,559
resistance by loss of susceptibility so

624
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:16,559
it's not a hypersensitive type of

625
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:20,409
resistance it's just the lack of disease

626
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:22,899
so we asked the question how is the

627
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:25,180
resistance to tell 7g functioning in

628
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:27,130
these plants can we develop a hypothesis

629
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:32,410
and predict what's happening by looking

630
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:35,460
at this interaction so if you look at a

631
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:38,769
number of the magic lines as well as a

632
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:40,690
control line again this is the empty

633
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:45,269
vector this is the overexpressed house

634
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:49,470
7b you can see that we have an enhanced

635
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:53,019
susceptibility or enhanced virulence

636
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:55,390
enhance disease longer lesions in these

637
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:57,509
lines that we're not showing resistance

638
00:30:55,390 --> 00:31:00,910
and this is most of the population right

639
00:30:57,509 --> 00:31:04,269
so this would suggest

640
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:06,490
the Tao 7b is activating a

641
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:10,119
susceptibility gene is one hypothesis

642
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:14,170
that we can test if we look at the lines

643
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:18,579
that and it's it and it's consistent

644
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:21,100
with the whole population if we look at

645
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:24,429
the lines where we saw resistance

646
00:31:21,099 --> 00:31:26,919
especially related to this QTL that we

647
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:30,430
identified on chromosome 8 that

648
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:36,009
conferred resistance to tell 7b we see

649
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:39,160
that there's no enhanced appearance how

650
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:43,000
7b is not increasing the virulence of 99

651
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:46,779
as it did as it did on the other lines

652
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,630
and in this case we would predict or we

653
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:51,879
would hypothesize that we have either a

654
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:55,180
change in the promoter region or a

655
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:57,550
nearby the promoter region that is where

656
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,289
the tabie cannot enhance virulence

657
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:04,480
because it's not activating the

658
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:08,649
susceptibility gene so the lines that

659
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,930
have the QT l8 in them are consistent

660
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:15,370
with a loss of susceptibility for the

661
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:18,549
for the mechanism for resistance well

662
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:21,939
the beauty of the towel effector world

663
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:25,629
is that you can predict where what the

664
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:27,880
target is in the plant because the towel

665
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:30,910
effector code has been broken by a

666
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:34,240
demand and other work people and we know

667
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:39,279
how to predict what tell 7b should bind

668
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:41,140
to based on the code and in fact using

669
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:45,149
several bioinformatics tools that have

670
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:46,600
been developed to ask what it binds to

671
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:50,290
Alejandra

672
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:52,179
pulled out a set of putative targets

673
00:32:50,289 --> 00:32:55,668
that it might be binding to and

674
00:32:52,180 --> 00:33:00,179
activating in the plant

675
00:32:55,669 --> 00:33:03,149
and as you can see she hit on a lot of

676
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:06,210
the genes that you would predict might

677
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:08,459
be true but she also hit on some other

678
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:11,870
ones that are known to be involved in

679
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:15,360
defense responses but not necessarily

680
00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:17,278
had shown to be involved in these

681
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:20,189
interactions and these are genes that

682
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:22,558
lie within the QTL that she identified

683
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:26,130
and one of the interesting ones for

684
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:29,548
example is that's not a sweet gene is

685
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:33,659
this search gene because she sees a snip

686
00:33:29,548 --> 00:33:35,819
in the pin in the EBE the potential

687
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:38,669
effect your binding domain that's

688
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:41,668
actually close to the start but not in

689
00:33:38,669 --> 00:33:50,370
the promoter but very close to it in

690
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:53,070
that particular gene so I hope I've

691
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:55,609
convinced you that magic is a powerful

692
00:33:53,069 --> 00:33:58,638
tool for discovery of resistance and

693
00:33:55,609 --> 00:34:02,038
characterization of novel tali vectors

694
00:33:58,638 --> 00:34:05,638
we screened these 330 lines and

695
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:08,849
interestingly we were working with the

696
00:34:05,638 --> 00:34:10,799
s8 generation which means that they had

697
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:13,349
taken the lines and self them eight

698
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,659
times eight generations we actually

699
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:18,088
performed the analysis in an earlier

700
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:21,990
generation the s4 generation and

701
00:34:18,088 --> 00:34:24,449
essentially they landed on the same low

702
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:25,979
sigh so what that means is we maybe

703
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:28,138
don't have to go out eight generations

704
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:32,608
to fix the lines and discover the things

705
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:34,950
that we mean we identified novel

706
00:34:32,608 --> 00:34:39,059
broad-spectrum resistance sources that

707
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:44,699
target both XO c and XO o in those

708
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:47,279
populations and we also identified QTL

709
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:49,439
that target a specific effector two

710
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,659
regions that target a specific effector

711
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,940
and we proposed that the resistance

712
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:56,070
mechanism we have a hypothesis that we

713
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,108
can now test is that the resistance

714
00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:02,220
mechanism for one of those is through a

715
00:34:58,108 --> 00:35:04,920
loss of susceptibility so the other

716
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:08,219
important point is that all of these

717
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,920
sources you know as a plant breeder you

718
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:12,759
don't know

719
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:14,500
barely care what what the mechanism is

720
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,080
they're more interested in getting a

721
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:19,389
useful and dynamic source of resistance

722
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:21,880
that a little stand stand up in the

723
00:35:19,389 --> 00:35:27,460
field and so now we can introduce these

724
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:30,099
effectively into not into elite

725
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:33,159
varieties and then we can begin to ask

726
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:35,559
the question do they in fact increase

727
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:40,179
the durability in the field populations

728
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:44,460
and are they broad-spectrum at a field

729
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:44,460
scale in the elite variety backgrounds

730
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:51,250
so I maybe talked a little faster than I

731
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:53,349
intended or a little sore but I want to

732
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:57,610
thank our many collaborators especially

733
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:59,889
our colleagues at in Mali in Africa who

734
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:04,650
did the field screening led by Valery

735
00:35:59,889 --> 00:36:08,230
vedere from France Alejandra and Anna

736
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:10,329
here and I and my lab group along with

737
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:13,809
Herman who comes to my lab in the summer

738
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:16,150
to get out of Texas and many of you

739
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:18,460
recognize him and also to our many

740
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:21,400
funding sources Anna was supported by a

741
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:23,920
becha Borlaug scholarship and Alejandra

742
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:38,460
by an NSF scholarship so with that I'm

743
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:38,460
happy to take any questions yeah

744
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:53,710
transcriptomic changes yes yes and

745
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:55,960
that's that's what she's doing right now

746
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:58,630
absolutely yeah because that's the next

747
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:01,210
step is to test which of those genes is

748
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:03,849
involved by the way I neglected to say

749
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:05,590
I'm not surprised that we have multiple

750
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:07,210
genes I mean we're talking about

751
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:10,750
quantitative traits and we've got two

752
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:12,460
different ones these tally factors could

753
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:17,380
target multiple genes in fact they

754
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:19,300
probably do and so I and and so I'm not

755
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,970
at all surprised about that in fact I

756
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,769
would bet that

757
00:37:20,969 --> 00:37:25,349
we will see more of that as we move

758
00:37:22,769 --> 00:37:27,420
through looking at each gene and then

759
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:29,190
she's doing that right now she she's got

760
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:32,159
the lines growing and getting everything

761
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:44,730
out to test fit hypothesis so it'll be

762
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:47,029
really exciting yeah there was sort of

763
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:49,860
natural I'm not sure no in fact it was

764
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:51,930
inoculated they had the pots and they

765
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:56,519
inoculated the pots from the outside

766
00:37:51,929 --> 00:37:58,019
yeah same group of strains with a few

767
00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:00,750
exceptions we couldn't put any

768
00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:02,849
Philippine strains in Mali we could only

769
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:08,119
put the Malian strains so we only had

770
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:08,119
two agents in our study anyway so yeah

771
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:21,089
focus was effected against both strains

772
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:25,139
but against all individuals of those

773
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:29,280
things the the one locus on chromosome

774
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:31,619
four was effective at a statistic level

775
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,769
against all I'm not all almost all I

776
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:36,569
think it was like 18 or so out of it out

777
00:38:34,769 --> 00:38:40,139
of the 20 18 or something like that

778
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:42,000
probably the statistics it probably

779
00:38:40,139 --> 00:38:43,980
showed some level of resistance remember

780
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,329
this is quantitative and we're measuring

781
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:50,820
lesions the other Louis I were against a

782
00:38:48,329 --> 00:38:52,469
few strings of each so that's why we're

783
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:55,530
we're more interested in that one on

784
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:57,629
chromosome four I don't know what to say

785
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:59,340
about the ones that are effective

786
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:01,470
against a few strains of arising a few

787
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:03,510
strains of erisa Cola because the towel

788
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:07,230
effect are compliments in ERISA and

789
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:09,000
ERISA Clah are different so I wouldn't

790
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:14,610
expect that to be a reason I would

791
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:18,179
expect it to be something else yeah I

792
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:20,090
was your your laboratory phenotyping you

793
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:22,889
are seeing resistance phenotype with

794
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:25,200
lesion lengths the third last half plus

795
00:39:22,889 --> 00:39:27,359
or whatever in the field is that just as

796
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:30,179
that resistance magnified much more in a

797
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:33,120
field setting or is it is it a partial

798
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:34,710
kind of resistance it's a partial

799
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:39,118
resistance

800
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:44,639
I don't know how it compares I can't I

801
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:46,500
had forgotten them yeah yeah yeah oh is

802
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:51,420
it would it be effective in the field if

803
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:54,119
it was just a partial yeah yeah yeah you

804
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:59,490
know I don't remember the numbers now

805
00:39:54,119 --> 00:40:02,400
but I know that it was it it was clearly

806
00:39:59,489 --> 00:40:05,639
resistant more resistant but I don't

807
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,380
know I don't know how it compared

808
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:08,608
proportionately that's a good question

809
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:23,510
I'll have to go back and look at that

810
00:40:08,608 --> 00:40:26,130
data yeah you can do both with magic

811
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:28,650
yeah we use the same population it's

812
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:31,619
just two different mapping strategies

813
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:34,619
with two different premises so G vas is

814
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:36,300
a population you're looking at a sort of

815
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:39,750
looking for a population where as

816
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:42,740
interval mapping is and again this is

817
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:45,300
where I'm the weakest I'm not the plant

818
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:47,759
geneticist but an interval mapping

819
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,740
you're looking for Association of a

820
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,290
trait with a particular region of the

821
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:55,078
genome rather than comparing across to

822
00:40:52,289 --> 00:40:58,259
the population does that make sense yeah

823
00:40:55,079 --> 00:41:00,990
yeah but that's one of the nice things

824
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:03,480
about this because we can do both types

825
00:41:00,989 --> 00:41:06,328
of mapping because it's really a

826
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:09,869
population as you have 8 genotypes

827
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:13,349
scrambled so you can do both types but

828
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:15,660
you can't use the standard mapping tools

829
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:19,230
that are developed for a by parental

830
00:41:15,659 --> 00:41:20,759
population that's why we had to work

831
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:24,318
with the folks that we're developing the

832
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:28,380
tools for the eight parent populations I

833
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:30,300
should say this is an indica population

834
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:32,930
so those of you who know rice there's

835
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:35,839
also a japonica magic population and

836
00:41:32,929 --> 00:41:38,929
there's what's called a global

837
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:41,309
population which is they took the eight

838
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:43,848
from the japonica and the eight from the

839
00:41:41,309 --> 00:41:47,429
indica and cross them so sixteen parents

840
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:47,940
now there are a lot of genetic problems

841
00:41:47,429 --> 00:41:50,219
when you

842
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,358
but japonica an indica together and so

843
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:54,149
there are some problems with that

844
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:56,578
population but it's still useful for

845
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:59,190
these kinds of things identifying these

846
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:01,410
kinds of traits because it doesn't

847
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:04,079
matter if you're missing parts of the

848
00:42:01,409 --> 00:42:06,719
chromosome didn't recombine you don't

849
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:21,030
really care if you identify something

850
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:24,269
useful create efficiency well

851
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:26,039
interesting you should ask that there

852
00:42:24,269 --> 00:42:28,199
are a couple well I'm sorry

853
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:31,130
so yes if there are attempts to create

854
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:36,210
artificial gene sequences that would

855
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:37,740
increase the resistance so I you notice

856
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:39,420
that you may or may not have noticed I

857
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:42,479
took promoter amount of the title

858
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:44,039
because I had a another part that I was

859
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,630
going to present that would have

860
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:48,750
increased the link that are talked

861
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:50,970
considerably we know a lot about the

862
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:54,210
activation of defense responses

863
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:57,000
downstream of these events and it's

864
00:42:54,210 --> 00:43:00,990
common whether it be single ETA single

865
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,880
gene resistance governed versus QTL

866
00:43:00,989 --> 00:43:04,709
govern there's a lot of commonality of

867
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,289
what's induced those are the defense

868
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:12,588
response genes downstream and a graduate

869
00:43:07,289 --> 00:43:17,670
student in my lab Brad identified

870
00:43:12,588 --> 00:43:19,548
conserved structural regions in the

871
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:22,650
promoters of the genes that have

872
00:43:19,548 --> 00:43:24,869
elements that are ins that are conserved

873
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:30,480
in defense response genes several of

874
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:33,480
them and that if the genes are

875
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,690
co-expressed they often have these

876
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:39,929
elements in them and our hypothesis is

877
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:43,679
that we can use those pieces of

878
00:43:39,929 --> 00:43:45,960
information either to edit genes so that

879
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:49,019
they're better soldiers they're better

880
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:53,460
respond responders to the resistance

881
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:56,219
genes or we can breed genome-wide for

882
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:59,740
more effective defense responses that

883
00:43:56,219 --> 00:44:02,500
are governed by these upstream genes

884
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:10,389
so yeah I took it out because it would

885
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:19,539
have taken a long time so with a

886
00:44:10,389 --> 00:44:22,269
chromosome before well you know that's a

887
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:23,500
if Anna hadn't had to graduate and leave

888
00:44:22,269 --> 00:44:27,039
the lab that would have been the next

889
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:29,858
steps to she she had a start on cloning

890
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:31,779
the the target genes there because we've

891
00:44:29,858 --> 00:44:33,489
also got target genes there that we're

892
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:35,609
interested in and the other thing was to

893
00:44:33,489 --> 00:44:38,139
screen for Magna for thee so I've just

894
00:44:35,608 --> 00:44:39,519
come back from China on Saturday and

895
00:44:38,139 --> 00:44:41,799
I've arranged with some folks there I'm

896
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:44,170
going to send it to them and have them

897
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:46,089
screen because we did we don't have the

898
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:48,159
expertise for Magna forthey in the lab

899
00:44:46,088 --> 00:44:49,539
anymore and rhizoctonia I'm really

900
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:51,699
interested because we don't have single

901
00:44:49,539 --> 00:44:53,980
gene your assistance for rhizoctonia I'm

902
00:44:51,699 --> 00:45:18,669
really interested in weather because it

903
00:44:53,980 --> 00:45:20,500
might know it could be one of the as I

904
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:23,079
mentioned it could be that we we've

905
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:25,300
created a new gene through recombination

906
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:27,940
that's one possibility or that we've

907
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:30,190
uncovered resistances that didn't show

908
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:34,179
up in the parents because we've got them

909
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:38,108
in two new parent backgrounds there

910
00:45:34,179 --> 00:45:40,059
there may be you know you know QTL so

911
00:45:38,108 --> 00:45:41,679
they can stretch across a half an arm of

912
00:45:40,059 --> 00:45:44,139
the chromosomes through the old mapping

913
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:47,529
so they're very likely are regions that

914
00:45:44,139 --> 00:45:49,420
were identified for blast this was novel

915
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:51,550
for a rising in a race ago there were

916
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:54,280
not there's nothing in that region there

917
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:57,400
some single genes on chromosome four but

918
00:45:54,280 --> 00:46:00,970
not underneath that qtls so it's it is

919
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:04,030
novel in that region and it most of the

920
00:46:00,969 --> 00:46:06,368
resistances to that most single gene

921
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:08,950
resistances to bacterial blight are not

922
00:46:06,369 --> 00:46:11,200
in BL are ours they're not the

923
00:46:08,949 --> 00:46:12,529
traditional to blast they're a lot of

924
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,649
NBL are ours

925
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:23,180
that region does have NBL R's in it so

926
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:25,550
it's possible yeah but you just don't

927
00:46:23,179 --> 00:46:28,879
know one of the things that we will also

928
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:31,430
do if if I survived long enough to do it

929
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,530
will be to sequence those regions to see

930
00:46:31,429 --> 00:46:36,649
and compare them across the different

931
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:38,930
lines to see how they what they actually

932
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:42,920
have changed but the the snip profiles

933
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:51,649
clearly show that they're unique yeah

934
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:53,480
yeah Andy I knew you have to it can be a

935
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:56,119
little challenging but I'm wondering

936
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:58,159
what the genetic resources are for the

937
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:00,980
parents you have available and how large

938
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:05,960
structural variation at this region

939
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:09,260
could impact your mapping locus because

940
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:13,909
you end up mapping back tomorrow and I

941
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:17,150
are 64 yeah we have the snip genotypes

942
00:47:13,909 --> 00:47:20,239
for the parents as well but that you

943
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:22,910
know that's that's crude we know we can

944
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:24,799
predict which parent for example some of

945
00:47:22,909 --> 00:47:27,319
those QTL we can predict which parent

946
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,600
they came from it's not trivial when you

947
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:32,059
have 8 parents to do that but we can and

948
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:44,599
we up but we can predict because of the

949
00:47:32,059 --> 00:47:49,730
if I can just quickly back up to this if

950
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:52,819
you go to honest paper the full version

951
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:56,900
of this is in there and you can we can

952
00:47:52,820 --> 00:48:00,740
predict based on the haplotype LeTip ik

953
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:02,269
block which parent they came from what

954
00:48:00,739 --> 00:48:04,099
that region came from it doesn't mean

955
00:48:02,269 --> 00:48:07,519
it's identical to that parent because it

956
00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:09,589
could have collected some some small

957
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:13,599
recombination that we don't measure with

958
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:16,300
my map but we know by the on the block

959
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:19,250
approximately which region is is

960
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:20,450
contributing from which parent does that

961
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:23,630
answer your question

962
00:48:20,449 --> 00:48:24,339
if you look at honest paper and in the I

963
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:26,059
think it's in the Supplemental

964
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:50,990
information that's made

965
00:48:26,059 --> 00:48:53,029
much more clear thank you wonderful this

966
00:48:50,989 --> 00:48:58,599
has been a production of Cornell
