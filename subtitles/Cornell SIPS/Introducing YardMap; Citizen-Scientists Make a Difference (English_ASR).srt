1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,339
my name is Jacob Johnston I'm with the

4
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:11,798
project yard map at the Cornell Lab of

5
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:13,929
Ornithology a citizen science program

6
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:16,089
aimed at creating habitat in your yard

7
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:18,250
yard maps essentially allows scientists

8
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:20,379
to better understand how landscape use

9
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:23,320
and gardening choices affected birds and

10
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:27,579
wildlife populations in a residential or

11
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,439
urban settings now most of us have yards

12
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:31,118
that were at one time a wild space

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,679
before it was a yard before it was a

14
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:35,049
city before was a neighborhood before

15
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:36,519
was anything and so we're sort of

16
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:39,099
getting back into this culture we're

17
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:43,359
looking at ways that we can share the

18
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:46,749
space with ecological term ecological

19
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:49,899
sort of concepts and techniques using

20
00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:52,809
ecology it in the way that it was has

21
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:56,439
been proceeding through you know

22
00:00:52,808 --> 00:00:59,768
centuries of time in order to coexist

23
00:00:56,439 --> 00:01:02,140
basically there's been a new

24
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:03,850
understanding of sharing spaces and a

25
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,320
new concern for their you know a greater

26
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,540
concern for the environment over time

27
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:12,519
and so you know the yard map seeks to

28
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:15,490
you know help I guess use that concern a

29
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:16,989
little bit but also nurture it and and

30
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:20,019
help people to make better decisions

31
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:21,939
based on education and that's one thing

32
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:25,000
that citizen science is really all about

33
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:26,829
is using the public to not only teach

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,109
them more about what they're doing and

35
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:30,789
what they're interested in but also to

36
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:34,510
provide better data back for us so that

37
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:36,520
we can create better best use practices

38
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,320
best practices and things like that to

39
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:40,989
send back out to those citizen sciences

40
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,669
and to the community so in a sharing

41
00:01:40,989 --> 00:01:44,439
ecologically sharing this space you

42
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,700
would have room for you you you would

43
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:47,409
have your yard you would have you know

44
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,570
vegetable garden or something like that

45
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:51,519
and you have some wild areas and some

46
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:52,839
cones some structure and some some

47
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,519
native lands around it to you like

48
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,560
forest edges so a lot of us are our

49
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:58,989
backyard conservationists these days

50
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,740
it's you know nature is becoming a very

51
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:04,299
big part of the environmentalism is

52
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:05,799
becoming a very big part of our culture

53
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:07,170
and society and we know that there's a

54
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:09,508
lot of people out there that are

55
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:13,209
enthusiastic about it that they want to

56
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:16,899
participate in protecting and protecting

57
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:18,878
nature and conserving while birds wild

58
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,640
flowers trees and now there's this great

59
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:24,248
big push for pollinators like bees and

60
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:26,108
butterflies and hummingbirds so how do

61
00:02:24,248 --> 00:02:29,468
we engage the backyard conservationists

62
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:31,659
how do we get people to put forth the

63
00:02:29,468 --> 00:02:35,979
effort and collaborate and work together

64
00:02:31,658 --> 00:02:41,199
and join knowledge and essentially be a

65
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:42,729
more refined and robust tool well that's

66
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,188
what that's what the cone a lab of

67
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:47,649
ornithology excels at and what we do

68
00:02:45,188 --> 00:02:51,248
here is a focus collective attempt

69
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:53,370
collective talents to you know to solve

70
00:02:51,248 --> 00:02:56,098
problems

71
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:59,340
that people in urban and residential

72
00:02:56,098 --> 00:03:00,628
areas maybe maybe noticing we have lots

73
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,299
of programs at the Cornell Lab of

74
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:05,158
Ornithology that monitored different

75
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:07,260
types of environments different types of

76
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:10,469
habitats and different types of

77
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:12,840
activities that birds and other of

78
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:15,628
course another wildlife engage in and

79
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,289
the more citizen scientists we have out

80
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:21,060
there telling us what you know is going

81
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:22,699
on in the backyards and the

82
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,140
neighborhoods and things like that of

83
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:27,149
places then the more we can understand

84
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:29,488
how those animals are using it what they

85
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,500
need and what is not working and what is

86
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:34,280
working at the lab we revolve around

87
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,259
bird conservation currently there's over

88
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,789
350,000 people engaged in bird

89
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,189
conservation activities those are

90
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:43,949
citizen scientists mostly so why birds

91
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:47,068
why are we interested in birds what is

92
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:50,369
it special about birds that has such a

93
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:54,000
draw and has such an engagement with the

94
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,849
public and they're very charismatic your

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,430
indicators of environmental health their

96
00:03:56,848 --> 00:04:02,280
migration patterns and distributions and

97
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,469
tell us a lot about the environments

98
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,979
that they use the habitats there that

99
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:11,159
they utilize and where they where they

100
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:13,530
can and can't go basically they tell us

101
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,209
that the population densities and their

102
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,620
abundance and diversity can tell us a

103
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,199
lot about the environmental health as

104
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,680
well they occur in all different types

105
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,269
of habitats this is a greater prairie

106
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,110
chicken that occurs in a very small

107
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:30,870
year-round range and from about Kansas I

108
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,509
think up through North Dakota just in a

109
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:38,038
small band there then you've got the

110
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:40,379
arctic tern who has a 24,000 25,000 mile

111
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:43,110
migration range from pole to pole it

112
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:46,439
takes an entire year so this bird here

113
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:49,139
is you know circum global whereas the

114
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:52,228
other one if it's a very small niche

115
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:54,840
habitat that's pretty pretty specific to

116
00:04:52,228 --> 00:04:56,759
what it needs the arctic tern as well on

117
00:04:54,839 --> 00:05:00,259
the coasts and in the polls where it has

118
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,909
where it breeds and over winters

119
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:03,920
you know requires a certain type of

120
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,990
habitat but also all the spaces in

121
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,490
between every connecting point that it

122
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,560
lands and stops on its year-round

123
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,780
migration needs to be some sort of

124
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,000
habitat and some sort of space for it so

125
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:15,909
we use the birds because they encompass

126
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,220
the entire globe and they encompass

127
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:23,350
almost every aspect of our lives they

128
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,350
have really unique inning

129
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:30,690
amazing behaviors this killdeer is known

130
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:33,030
for its impressive display of being

131
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:35,519
broken or wounded when you approached

132
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:38,219
its nest it builds a nest here in the

133
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,810
gravel you might even be able to find a

134
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,970
nest if you look closely in the gravel

135
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,370
but it's very camouflaged and when a

136
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:47,160
predator or a threat approaches the nest

137
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,439
they sort of limp away with a broken

138
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,380
wing they bend their wing funny so it

139
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,889
looks broken so these intricate and

140
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:57,360
unique habits the birds have you know

141
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,599
interest people they really grab

142
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:04,500
people's attention you become these

143
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:07,010
charismatic fauna that gained support

144
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,009
from the public

145
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,660
they can be anything from meat to

146
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:17,770
majestic like this red tail hawk here

147
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:19,389
it's found across the country

148
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:21,939
and they're very integrated into our

149
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:24,490
into our lives into our urban and rural

150
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:25,569
landscapes we share the whole we share

151
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,430
our world with them whether we know it

152
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:30,490
or not if you can see the snowy owl in

153
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:32,439
this picture there it is which is a you

154
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,720
know not all that you see very often but

155
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:36,699
they do incorporate themselves into our

156
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,610
landscape and so what we want to know is

157
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:41,139
how can we best coexist with them

158
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,550
because you know they incorporate

159
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:45,069
they're going to live there they're

160
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:47,650
going to be around how many they are and

161
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:49,900
how healthy they are is sort of up to us

162
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:56,370
now that we understand what their needs

163
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:58,629
are so birding is a very very popular

164
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,788
recreational pastime 85 million

165
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:04,329
Americans across the country participate

166
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:06,818
yearly nine hundred million dollars are

167
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:09,218
invested annually in bird watching and

168
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:10,419
birding and support like this one of our

169
00:07:09,218 --> 00:07:12,189
biggest programs at the lab of

170
00:07:10,418 --> 00:07:14,649
ornithology here in citizen science is

171
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:17,918
the e bird program we also have the

172
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:20,679
project feeder watch with head which has

173
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:22,418
17,000 users that participate in a

174
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,550
four-month eater watch study through the

175
00:07:22,418 --> 00:07:26,829
winter in the early spring where they

176
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:29,189
watch they put out bird feeders and

177
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:32,228
without different types of feed and

178
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:34,839
different types of feed food for the

179
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:36,278
birds and that then they collect the

180
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:38,968
data they count the birds and they

181
00:07:36,278 --> 00:07:42,639
report that data through online tools

182
00:07:38,968 --> 00:07:45,879
nest watch crew 32 percent in 2013 and

183
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,699
it's on track now to break the 20,000

184
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:52,319
nest record I'm sorry to break a record

185
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:55,090
of 20,000 nests protected so they're

186
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,098
there they're really getting big and

187
00:07:55,089 --> 00:08:00,728
popular and this is a program that you

188
00:07:57,098 --> 00:08:01,959
can participate in where you locate

189
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:04,359
nests you actually have to take a

190
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:06,370
training course and learn how to be a

191
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,050
part of this citizen science project so

192
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,639
that you don't infringe on the safety or

193
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,668
the health of these birds while they're

194
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:15,778
nesting and so a lot of people really

195
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:18,519
appreciate that and learn a lot of

196
00:08:15,778 --> 00:08:20,889
appreciation and respect and have a lot

197
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:23,599
of gained admiration through projects

198
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:26,720
like this another one that

199
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:29,780
really popular is Cubs celebrate urban

200
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,560
birds this one boasts over 250,000

201
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:37,490
members from 23,000 urban areas they

202
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:40,219
mentor disadvantaged kids and they even

203
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:44,210
have a program where they teach birding

204
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:45,529
by ear to blind youths so we have all

205
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:49,190
these programs and they're all online

206
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:50,779
and they have some of the Cornell Lab of

207
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:55,540
Ornithology has some of the best tools

208
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:55,539
for engaging citizen scientists

209
00:08:56,059 --> 00:09:00,519
but there's one

210
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:02,319
that's missing something that's a little

211
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:03,919
more personal a little more closer to

212
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,980
all of us

213
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:09,019
and that's our yard now why would we

214
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:12,200
want to focus on yards what exactly is

215
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:15,139
about is it with yards that drew our

216
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,009
attention it made us want to reach out

217
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:18,009
to people

218
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,169
well if we take a look at the average

219
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:26,509
American yard we see that it's not

220
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:28,669
really bird friendly in fact it's not

221
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:31,100
really environmentally friendly so the

222
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:35,139
average American lon is about sixty

223
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:37,670
percent of the sixty percent grass and

224
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:40,100
it contains a lot of impervious areas

225
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:42,589
like the grass like the driveway here

226
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,110
and the rooftops there's usually a small

227
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:47,930
area for maybe a flower or vegetable

228
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:49,820
garden but most of our are your heart

229
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:52,609
most of our property our American yard

230
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,620
is lon and that lawn is not a very good

231
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:57,289
habitat so we try to encourage a

232
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,179
reduction in lon it's actually one of

233
00:09:57,289 --> 00:10:00,620
our nation's biggest crop and it's not

234
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:04,059
very good habitat so with this

235
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:06,679
increasing growth of urban and

236
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:09,319
residential areas across the country

237
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:11,739
every day or every year I'm sorry about

238
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,530
the size of West Virginia becomes

239
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:18,649
settled urbanized for somehow turned in

240
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:22,730
from wild habitat into human habitat so

241
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:25,399
the growth is is growing at a rate that

242
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:28,190
is hard to keep up with and so what we

243
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:30,169
want to do is instead of changing that

244
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:33,570
habitat into something else we want to

245
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:35,669
work with that habitat with yard man

246
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:38,129
which I encourage people to think small

247
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:42,750
with their lawns be environmentally

248
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:45,309
friendly use other type of landscaping

249
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:48,220
in your yard

250
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:51,219
besides a lawn that is more effective

251
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:54,129
and more efficient in providing habitat

252
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,769
for birds and wildlife something like

253
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:58,539
this there's a be there there's a

254
00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:00,909
collection of wildflowers this is

255
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:03,189
obviously much more bountiful and

256
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:05,889
plentiful and environmentally friendly

257
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,779
for any sort of creatures that may be

258
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:12,549
wandering through your yard or flying

259
00:11:07,778 --> 00:11:15,309
overhead so how do we create habitat for

260
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:16,809
birds and wildlife in our yard what are

261
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:23,079
the main ingredients what is it that we

262
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:24,489
need to focus on well the main

263
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,840
ingredients is our food water and

264
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:29,060
shelter just like anything

265
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:32,240
and freedom from danger which is

266
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:34,819
something that isn't always at the top

267
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,269
of the list or the front of our thoughts

268
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,680
when we're creating habitat in our yards

269
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:43,699
food water shelter and freedom from

270
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:46,899
danger creates the habitat but what do

271
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,900
we mean when we talk about food

272
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:53,000
bird feeder with seed is good

273
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:54,799
food for birds in that sense most people

274
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,840
don't realize though or maybe they don't

275
00:11:54,799 --> 00:12:02,319
realize that birds eat more than seed

276
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,320
they eat bugs most birds eat mostly bugs

277
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:09,639
here's a stern blue bird doing the

278
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,850
caterpillar thwomp I think they call it

279
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:15,769
are they it's a high for smash on to

280
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:19,190
something that breaks the skin apart it

281
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:20,690
makes it easier to digest and what are

282
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:23,149
the e caterpillar is a single pair of

283
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:27,709
breeding chickadees need 75,000

284
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:30,429
caterpillars per season to raise 325

285
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,429
nestlings

286
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:37,060
so how do we get these caterpillars how

287
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:41,139
do we bring in the bugs to feed the

288
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:43,629
birds well if we look at some data that

289
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:46,059
was produced shortly ago we really see

290
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:47,919
that caterpillar richness the diversity

291
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:51,239
of caterpillars the number of

292
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:57,279
caterpillars and the number of species

293
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:59,310
are greatly outnumber the number of

294
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:04,149
caterpillars in the number of species on

295
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:07,779
non native or introduced invasive plants

296
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:11,590
as compared to native plants if you look

297
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:16,029
and then woody plants are even much

298
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:18,360
greater attracted to butterflies and

299
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:22,499
anything else that lays eggs and

300
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:24,558
produces caterpillars or larvae

301
00:13:22,499 --> 00:13:24,558
you

302
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:30,008
so to provide food we need to provide

303
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:32,188
plans that provide bugs that provide the

304
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,188
food

305
00:13:33,058 --> 00:13:36,718
we also need to provide water for birds

306
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:39,869
they get water out of the food they eat

307
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:41,519
and they get water flying around of you

308
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:43,908
know over lakes and ponds and things

309
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,810
they're there they move around a lot but

310
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:50,029
they don't always

311
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:53,189
they don't move a lot every day or

312
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:55,250
see I'm sorry mixed up here

313
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,250
you

314
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:06,759
so providing water in strategic places

315
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:06,759
across the landscape such as yards

316
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:12,329
really makes this connectivity across

317
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:17,350
the landscape and increases their

318
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:20,020
chances of finding habitats

319
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,610
so when we when we talk about water so

320
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:23,500
it could be anything if you don't have a

321
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,810
pond or a creek running through your

322
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,970
yard if you do then you're providing

323
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:31,899
water if you don't save here in a

324
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:32,980
suburban area or a dense urban area then

325
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:34,899
there's a lot of other ways you can

326
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:38,409
provide water for birds like bird baths

327
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:41,769
and here are some tips that we provide

328
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:43,698
on yard map for the you know for ideal

329
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:45,769
birdbath

330
00:14:43,698 --> 00:14:47,719
because we want them to be safe we want

331
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:51,289
them to be clean and we don't want them

332
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,480
to be traps if you have too deep of a

333
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:57,349
bird bath or if it's not clean on a

334
00:14:53,480 --> 00:15:00,470
regular basis or if it's shrouded by

335
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:06,350
shrubs or trees then it can be preyed on

336
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:07,790
by cats things like that so we one of

337
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:11,509
the great things about citizen science

338
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:13,608
is this back and forth this call and

339
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:16,129
response is you know put water in your

340
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:18,259
yard well then we get this you know

341
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:20,209
response back well you know I put water

342
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:21,918
in my yard but you know these birds

343
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:24,678
drowned in it well why did they drown in

344
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:26,389
it so we understand you know what better

345
00:15:24,678 --> 00:15:29,208
and more effective and efficient types

346
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:32,230
of water can provide for birds you know

347
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:32,229
and it goes back and forth

348
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:37,659
sure is another thing was very important

349
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:40,089
to provide a new yard for birds in

350
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:42,789
structure to perch on to display from

351
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:44,769
from mating to call from they need

352
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:47,289
structure to build nests in and

353
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:50,379
structure can be any number of things

354
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:55,618
structure means anything from vertical

355
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:55,619
height to horizontal width to texture

356
00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:00,649
here's a little

357
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,590
advertisers that we put out through yard

358
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:05,840
map that talks about the diversity of

359
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:07,399
structure in your yard birds aren't

360
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,960
taxon unless they don't necessarily know

361
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,419
the species of the plants in your yard

362
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,340
but they do know the texture of the

363
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:15,500
needles or the leaves they do know the

364
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:18,530
density of the branches that you know

365
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,600
the height of the tree or the quality of

366
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:22,009
the wood that is being built they know

367
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,840
that they're building their nests out of

368
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:27,289
or something like that and so having a

369
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:31,280
diversity their items sorry they're

370
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:32,990
actually experts at what they need we're

371
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,179
and we are the ones that are capable of

372
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,519
providing it or not taking it away say

373
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:40,429
if we're building a new home somewhere

374
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,679
and instead of clearing all the trees

375
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:46,549
from an area you could leave them adjust

376
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:48,649
and even this is another thing that we

377
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:51,789
promote here is dead trees sometimes

378
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:55,639
dead trees are more productive and more

379
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:59,299
provide more to have more species using

380
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:01,669
them then a live tree does these uh

381
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:03,559
these are called snags and they're

382
00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:05,959
rotting wood and they provide homes for

383
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:08,088
all kinds of bugs which provides foods

384
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:13,400
for the birds they also provide holes

385
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:14,779
like cavities for nesting birds I mean

386
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,089
the other thing that we need besides

387
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:19,490
food water and shelter is freedom from

388
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:22,129
danger and this could be a number of

389
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:26,900
things freedom from danger is uh refers

390
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:30,560
to anything that may draw your your drug

391
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:34,550
or attract birds or wildlife your yard

392
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:37,460
but then hides or disguises some danger

393
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:42,379
there that you may not know of yourself

394
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:44,150
well we hear a lot about cats and oh my

395
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,040
cat would never you know never heard a

396
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:48,110
bird or maybe only get one or two here

397
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:50,420
and there something like that but the

398
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:52,159
reality is birds killed billions of

399
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:55,190
birds every year because there are

400
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,500
millions of cats maybe killing several a

401
00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:00,490
year so it may not seem like much but in

402
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:04,750
the end it is a very powerful force

403
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:08,089
against bird populations like this is a

404
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:10,640
graphic that shows freedom from danger

405
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:11,970
from windows some new recent studies

406
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,259
have come out through

407
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:18,240
Peter watch would that show that feeders

408
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:22,529
that have are placed in the wrong space

409
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:25,099
or close too close to I'm sorry too

410
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:27,509
close to a house but not close enough

411
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:29,609
create a deadly collision zone where

412
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:32,129
Birds frightened from a feeder or

413
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:35,039
startled from a feeder will gain enough

414
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:37,950
speed but not have enough i guess

415
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,589
agility to to clear the house or clear a

416
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:43,500
window if they're closer to the house

417
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:45,389
their speed is not that great if they're

418
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,849
farther from the house and they have the

419
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,650
the distance to make the adjustments but

420
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:52,649
there is a zone that we found through

421
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:55,710
citizen science that you know is is more

422
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:58,590
deadly for placing feeders also when to

423
00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:02,370
mow sometimes if you have large yards

424
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:05,879
mowing can endanger fledglings or

425
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:07,619
nestlings that haven't pledged yet so

426
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,590
all these things work together and they

427
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:14,250
all need to work together with us as we

428
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:17,099
all are integrated in this coexistence

429
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:21,000
that we're discovering more and more

430
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:22,709
about over time in terms of coexistence

431
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,750
were realizing also that a greater

432
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:27,930
diversity of birds and greater diversity

433
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:30,119
of plants and wildlife around a

434
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:32,759
neighborhood or around a group of people

435
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:36,599
improves their well-being this is true

436
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:39,450
in almost any demographic in almost any

437
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:43,949
society and so what yard map seeks to do

438
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:47,610
is collaborate with groups of people to

439
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:50,880
join people together and to create a

440
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:53,159
community of yard mappers a community of

441
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,150
people making connections or connecting

442
00:19:53,160 --> 00:20:00,600
points connectivity is a very big

443
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:03,570
concept in ecology that connects large

444
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:06,509
expanses of wild areas through small

445
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:08,569
expenses of while there is like yards

446
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:08,569
you

447
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:15,719
one yard that's yard mapped and is being

448
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:18,690
managed for wildlife is great two yards

449
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,880
is even better because that provides

450
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:23,490
stepping stones from say a National

451
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,890
Forest to you know like Saranac or

452
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:30,390
something then you have you have these

453
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:32,759
stepping stones of habitat and when you

454
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:34,950
have stepping stones connected you have

455
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:38,308
corridors so you have corridors and

456
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:40,110
stepping stones and all of this you know

457
00:20:38,308 --> 00:20:42,690
when a community works together to

458
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:45,479
provide all the necessity necessary or

459
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:47,759
essential parts of a habitat across the

460
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:52,349
landscape that's when we can all make a

461
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:55,379
really big difference this has been a

462
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:58,730
production of Cornell University on the

463
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,730
web at cornell edu
