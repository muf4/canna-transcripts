and um

8
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:28,640
we're here to

9
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,839
highlight some of the services that are

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,839
available through the library

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,439
and

12
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,078
to make sure you know that i'm the

13
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,519
liaison to this department and

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,520
i'm essentially

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,120
the go-to guy if you're not sure who to

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,879
approach within the library about

17
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,079
something but hopefully some of the

18
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,000
things we're going to be telling you

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,160
today will get you to think about the

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,799
library perhaps

21
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,398
at times or in ways that you haven't in

22
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,558
the past

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,640
and so

24
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,718
we're just going to i'm going to

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,000
highlight a few different

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,000
resources and projects

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,719
kelly paschen

28
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,680
one of my colleagues will be talking a

29
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:14,158
bit about library instruction

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,680
keith jenkins another colleague will be

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,400
talking about

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,880
geospatial information and services that

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,840
we provide and then sarah wright will be

34
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:23,679
talking

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,680
more about

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,759
data services that we have data

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,080
management services that we have

38
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,000
within the library

39
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,319
so i've been around mann library for a

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,478
little while i know

41
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,399
many of you in fact i know many of my

42
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,640
colleagues in geneva as well since i was

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,040
the librarian at geneva for about 12

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,040
years

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,920
well some of you that may be the way you

46
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,239
think about the library and

47
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,320
in fact that view may be a little bit

48
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,879
fuzzy for you

49
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,478
but we still do do books

50
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,199
though it's sort of starting to fade

51
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,200
away a little bit

52
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,159
but we do many things in addition to

53
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,959
providing information resources in print

54
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:14,799
form as well as in electronic forms

55
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,439
so one of the things we

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,120
do in the library is we have public

57
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,439
gallery space and i know that some of

58
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,200
you have actually utilized

59
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,239
that in the past and that's available

60
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,399
for

61
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,920
faculty and students to to do group

62
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,400
presentations or individual

63
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:33,119
presentations so to give you a sense of

64
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,360
the space and some of the the different

65
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,080
uses so here on the right you see some

66
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,840
of the individual study rooms that can

67
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,319
you can

68
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,239
sign out for a period of time if you

69
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,000
need some quiet space

70
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,120
in the upper left you see that we have

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,560
also some presentation practice spaces

72
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,560
so if you as a student

73
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,598
or anyone for that matter need a space

74
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,000
to practice that presentation we have a

75
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:03,119
separate room for that kind of thing or

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,039
it can be used as a group study room

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,080
and in the lower left you can see some

78
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:11,519
of the collaborative space that we have

79
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,239
created mostly on the second floor

80
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,599
increasingly classes as well as just

81
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,560
individuals

82
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,479
need to work together on projects and so

83
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,239
you can see there where

84
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,799
several students can cluster around a

85
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,280
single monitor to share

86
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,959
work on a project

87
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,000
there's also a wide variety of

88
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,759
seating types or study space types for

89
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,639
anybody to use in the library and this

90
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,479
is in the bessette also in the bessette

91
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,839
collaborative

92
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,119
space

93
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,680
you can see

94
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,719
comfortable chairs you can see

95
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,360
sort of

96
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:52,799
bar type stools you can see

97
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,319
bean bags there's a wide variety of

98
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,000
study spaces

99
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,958
and there you can get a sense of how

100
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,120
they

101
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,959
get used

102
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,560
we also have this

103
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,280
monitor in the in the lobby space which

104
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,000
um is available for you to promote

105
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,878
things that that you have an event

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,280
perhaps a new class that you're offering

107
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,959
you can use that contact us and you can

108
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,959
get a slide and it cycles through the

109
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,120
size i'm sure that many of you have seen

110
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,120
that and some of you have used that

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,800
another

112
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:28,719
service that i want to point out is the

113
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,000
copyright information center and again

114
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,040
i'm just highlighting a few of the

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,199
services and projects that we have

116
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,040
and this the copyright information

117
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,560
center is a collaborative effort with

118
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,759
the library the university council

119
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,759
the campus store and cit

120
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,479
and you can bring any of your copyright

121
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,000
questions um to this either by

122
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:51,918
contacting

123
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,918
using the contact form that's found on

124
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,159
the website

125
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,839
or you can you can email them or just

126
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,600
contact me and i can help you get

127
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,079
connected but you may be wanting to

128
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,320
publish a chapter in a book or perhaps a

129
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,079
whole book and you're wondering about

130
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,839
whether or not you can retain the

131
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,079
copyright to that rather than turning it

132
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,239
over to the commercial publisher and

133
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,079
people in this group can advise you on

134
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,199
that and in fact we highly recommend

135
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,758
that you do

136
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,919
retain your your copyright whenever

137
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,840
possible there have been stories on

138
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:25,359
campus of faculty members who have

139
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:28,399
published an article and the copyright

140
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,639
belonged then to the journal in which it

141
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,799
was published and later wanted to be

142
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,038
able to reuse one of the tables or

143
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,759
graphs that was in that and had to pay

144
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:40,000
300 in order to reuse his own work

145
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,639
because he had given up his copyright

146
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,038
when he published it in that in that

147
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,038
journal

148
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:50,399
we can also do individual consultations

149
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,160
so each of the librarians here have

150
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,839
their own specialty and would be glad to

151
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,720
meet individually

152
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,198
with

153
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,680
faculty or students and you can see a

154
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,319
list of some of the ideas uh some of the

155
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,160
uh areas that um

156
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,519
we'll be glad to meet one-on-one and

157
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,840
consult

158
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,599
with you on and this is just a copy of

159
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,478
the web page

160
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,479
where you can submit that request and

161
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,038
it'll get passed on to the appropriate

162
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,959
person with expertise in the area that

163
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:21,519
you need

164
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,519
i'd like to mention just briefly teal

165
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,439
some of you may be familiar with teal

166
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,478
it's a project that was started by mann

167
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,759
library

168
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:32,478
oh i guess probably 10 years or so ago

169
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,560
teal stands for the essential electronic

170
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:38,318
agricultural library

171
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,240
and it's an effort to make scholarly

172
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,800
works particularly in agriculture but

173
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,439
other related subjects as well

174
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,478
available in the developing world so

175
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:50,959
this is an offline system many of the

176
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:54,159
research institutions in developing some

177
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:57,599
of the developing countries don't have

178
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,120
regular and consistent

179
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,039
internet access and so this is an

180
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,319
offline system there's special

181
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:08,079
arrangements with the publishers

182
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,039
a total of 80 more than 80 publishers

183
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,478
and

184
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:13,199
this is something that's been going on

185
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:15,598
in mann library for a while and it's

186
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,520
been received very well and you may have

187
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:20,719
also noticed a recent press release

188
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:24,000
where we received a gates foundation

189
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,479
grant in an area of 4.9 million dollars

190
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,199
to continue to build this and expand

191
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:32,240
both the content that's there as well as

192
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:35,038
the number of uh sites where it is

193
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,879
available is it distributed on hard

194
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,199
drives yes at this point it's

195
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,279
distributed on hard drives it originally

196
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,038
when we started this we were sending out

197
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:47,519
many cds

198
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:47,519
but it's now on on hard drives

199
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,038
so at this point um

200
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,599
400 institutions scattered around the

201
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,959
world the concentration has been africa

202
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:00,639
there's more effort

203
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,918
with this new grant to reach out to

204
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,879
south asia

205
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,240
and

206
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,080
southeast asia i believe as well

207
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,519
and the the eligible when mentions

208
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:13,279
eligible countries the

209
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,198
gross domestic product i believe it is

210
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,799
is what what is measuring whether or not

211
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,120
they're eligible so

212
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,879
um if if it's high enough the the

213
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,720
country's not eligible and they they'd

214
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,199
be expected to purchase the from the

215
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,759
commercial publishers

216
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,240
but if it's low enough then then it's

217
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,919
country wide available and it's still

218
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,000
there's a fee associated with it but

219
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:39,478
it's substantially reduced from what

220
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,479
commercial subscription prices would be

221
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,240
so that's

222
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,680
an example of some of the international

223
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,720
work that we're doing here in the

224
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:48,559
library

225
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,800
this is uh one more project that i would

226
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:54,479
just like to mention real briefly this

227
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:56,479
is one that i'm directly involved in

228
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,240
the bailey auditorium has a very large

229
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,240
collection of seed and nursery catalogs

230
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,320
a large portion of that is actually

231
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,839
housed in man library in the special

232
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,399
collections

233
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,920
they they go back to i think the

234
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,919
earliest catalog

235
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:16,000
is actually a broadside from about 1771

236
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,639
and

237
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,278
we in collaboration with three other

238
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:24,000
institutions did receive a grant

239
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:26,559
recently which will allow us to digitize

240
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,320
some of our seed and nursery catalogs

241
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,719
we are doing this in conjunction with

242
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,200
the biodiversity heritage library which

243
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,480
is a consortium of about 15 different

244
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,360
libraries

245
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,159
mostly in botanical garden libraries and

246
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,639
natural history museum libraries cornell

247
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,639
and harvard are the two

248
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,039
academic institutions that are

249
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,559
collaborators in this and the goal here

250
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,639
is to

251
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:53,439
make the biodiversity literature very

252
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,759
broadly um conceived basically life

253
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,959
sciences literature available

254
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:00,799
for free open access on the web

255
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:03,039
and this gives you some sense of the the

256
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,278
size of it anybody heard of biodiversity

257
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,838
heritage library before okay a couple of

258
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:07,838
you great

259
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,320
so um the collaborators in this case are

260
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,839
um

261
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,079
missouri botanical garden and they're

262
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,320
taking the lead and what what we're

263
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,519
actually the main point of the whole

264
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,278
project

265
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,919
the leading point is

266
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:26,399
to create

267
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,719
crowdsourcing and gaming on this

268
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,120
biodiversity heritage site so that

269
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,399
participants can actually contribute to

270
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,399
the correction of ocring of the text so

271
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,078
these old texts that are in here many of

272
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,078
them are old not all of them there's

273
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,679
varying fonts there's varying languages

274
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:45,199
with different characters so when the

275
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,479
when the text itself is is ocr it's read

276
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,440
by the computer

277
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,519
the accuracy level is not real high

278
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,279
and so a game will be developed that

279
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,360
will allow

280
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,480
users to actually

281
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,919
correct

282
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,959
that

283
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:03,919
text error and to improve the the full

284
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:06,159
text discovery in the system so new york

285
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,319
botanical garden and

286
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:10,159
cornell are

287
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,720
involved in this mainly to contribute

288
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,879
yet another sort of genre or format of

289
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,040
material to biodiversity heritage

290
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,439
library which is mainly journals and

291
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,679
books and so we're adding seed catalogs

292
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,399
sort of as a different a different type

293
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,958
of material that this gaming

294
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,399
will be applied to as well

295
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,759
and so we're coordinating with new york

296
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,320
botanical garden

297
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,919
on um digitizing some from both of our

298
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,278
collections they have a very significant

299
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,278
collection there as well

300
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,078
and that's the those are the highlights

301
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,560
that i wanted to provide and i'll turn

302
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:45,919
it over to kelly and

303
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:47,439
unless there's one or two questions

304
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,120
right now we'll take questions at the

305
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,839
end

306
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,839
okay kelly

307
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,120
hello my name is kelly i just want to

308
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:56,639
talk to you a little bit about

309
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,399
instruction and the types of instruction

310
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,399
that we have at man

311
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,839
it doesn't necessarily have to deal just

312
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,600
with faculty and faculty teaching

313
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,000
classes we do have some graduate groups

314
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,759
contacting us to maybe set up workshops

315
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,519
that we could

316
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:10,720
demonstrate some of our services or

317
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,440
things that can help them in their own

318
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,959
research so

319
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,279
um we are your partner in seeking

320
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:19,278
information

321
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,120
and i kind of styled my slides after

322
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,320
like a paper like a

323
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,839
science paper that you might have your

324
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,200
students writing so here's a little

325
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,959
abstract of what happens when you

326
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,639
partner with the libraries

327
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,799
when we set up instruction if you're

328
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,200
doing a session that's in person with us

329
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,958
it's librarian-led instruction you

330
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,399
partner with us to develop different

331
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,399
types of assessment of the student

332
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,320
learning and the whole goal is to

333
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,600
improve the types of informational

334
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,440
resources the students use and can find

335
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,759
and it comes from

336
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,279
these questions have you ever thought

337
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:50,799
that students should be finding better

338
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,320
quality sources

339
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:53,759
do you ever wish that your students or

340
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,519
even yourself could break away from

341
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,838
google or even google scholar and find

342
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,440
better quality sources or even more

343
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,200
sources that are that are available on

344
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,279
google or have you ever wanted to help

345
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,040
students build a better research paper

346
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:06,799
if these questions have ever come up to

347
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,719
you or maybe they've just now come up to

348
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,479
you you might want to schedule some

349
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,519
instruction

350
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,680
here's a little review of some

351
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,440
literature this is taken from the

352
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,399
cornell strategic

353
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,399
uh plan and you can see that information

354
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,559
literacy is the sixth one down

355
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,559
and that's specific to the library

356
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,799
students will be able to access evaluate

357
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:28,719
and use a relevant a variety of relevant

358
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,240
information sources but if you look

359
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,160
through several of them there are

360
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,919
several that kind of relate to looking

361
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:34,879
for information such as communication

362
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,439
skills

363
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,639
be able to um speak articulately i know

364
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,839
that seems like a stretch but if they

365
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,600
can find the information they can

366
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,360
research and they have more to say about

367
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,800
the subject

368
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,560
reasoning

369
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,078
self-directed learning that's a huge one

370
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,078
the whole goal of our library

371
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:53,278
instruction is also to be partnering

372
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:54,879
with you to make lifelong learners

373
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,958
okay so here are the materials you'll

374
00:13:54,879 --> 00:14:00,759
need you'll need the request form

375
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,759
and i will go to that

376
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,879
okay so the request form is found on the

377
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,639
mann library's website under workshops

378
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:11,519
and instruction

379
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,120
uh and request instruction right here

380
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,600
and it's just a single form for any

381
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,519
request you want

382
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,600
and you just quickly fill it out and

383
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,959
once you fill it out the big thing you

384
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,959
need to worry about is the preferred

385
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,518
date of the session don't just put fun

386
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,359
if you can help it um and you want to

387
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,360
schedule this as early as possible you

388
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,759
may think a month is enough time

389
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,079
and it usually is but if it's during our

390
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,399
peak season a month is not enough time

391
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,239
and you may not get the preferred

392
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,120
session so the best time to do it is

393
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,399
probably

394
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,839
if you're going to do it for spring

395
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,519
december is the best time to make a

396
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,000
request or if you're going to make the

397
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,919
request make in april because january

398
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,360
february and even into march peak times

399
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:51,360
and it's really hard to get instruction

400
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,079
okay and the other materials you'll want

401
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,320
to have ready and available will be the

402
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,078
assignment for the class that way when

403
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,600
we have a meeting you know what you want

404
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:03,039
from us so we can actually give you the

405
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,800
information you need instead of have

406
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:06,639
just a general service

407
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,799
you want your calendar calendar to

408
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,240
schedule your class you want a syllabus

409
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,919
for the course so you can share it with

410
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,720
us so we can make sure we're providing

411
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:16,240
the best services possible and we do ask

412
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,440
and you don't have to we ask that you

413
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,519
allow us to partner with you on

414
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,120
blackboard so we can create a folder and

415
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,560
we can flip the classroom as much as

416
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,000
possible so that when the students come

417
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,919
in and meet with us

418
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,440
they can actually have more hands-on and

419
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,078
we can answer questions instead of just

420
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,480
talk at them

421
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:34,719
okay so after you make the request

422
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,480
usually what i will do is i will partner

423
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,959
you with your liaison librarian in your

424
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,039
case your liaison librarian is marty but

425
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,838
he is not always available so all the

426
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:46,078
librarians at man are actually able to

427
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,480
take your request and provide the same

428
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,919
level of service as marty and

429
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,680
in fact we would actually partner with

430
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,278
him during the meeting so that he could

431
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:54,638
bring up any other sources that me may

432
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:56,240
not be aware of

433
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,680
and then when you do the meeting you're

434
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,198
going to determine the outcome of the

435
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:00,799
collaboration and the assignment so

436
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,319
you've given them an assignment and you

437
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,958
want to collaborate with us but we want

438
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,240
to make sure we have the right outcome

439
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,078
and you want to determine the type of

440
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,360
instruction

441
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:11,198
and i'm going to talk about the types of

442
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,560
instructions so library led instruction

443
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:14,319
would just have us be in front of the

444
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:17,119
class and go through all the different

445
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,278
services that we have available

446
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,000
we also offer libguides i'm going to

447
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:24,078
give you an example of a libguide for a

448
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,240
professor that is new and she's in

449
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:28,239
animal sciences and she's actually not

450
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,600
teaching a research paper but she was

451
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,959
like oh my goodness when she heard about

452
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,720
this she's like this is the best thing

453
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,799
ever can you create a libguide that's a

454
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,199
repository of stuff related to animal

455
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,719
genetics even though she's not teaching

456
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:40,319
a research paper she thought it would be

457
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,720
great to have all these informations

458
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,680
available to the students in one place

459
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,278
and

460
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:47,039
we're it's in progress so we're

461
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,278
continuing to add to it and i'm going to

462
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:53,439
curate it myself or marty may curate it

463
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:54,958
himself and she has some

464
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,399
collaboration in there where she tells

465
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,078
us some new things that she finds and

466
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,600
adds and then we're continuing to add

467
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:01,359
things ourselves

468
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,640
so ian if you're not teaching a research

469
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,400
paper libguides are great for you

470
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,000
and then we also have these two um

471
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,679
samples of tutorials i'm going to show

472
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,720
you the first one

473
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,640
uh this is a series of classes that have

474
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,558
been developed over has it been 10 years

475
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,038
that they've been doing this around 10

476
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:22,000
years so this is high level takes about

477
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:24,000
10 years to develop um honestly it does

478
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,240
and if you look at it the instructor of

479
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,400
the library sessions works closely with

480
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,720
the professor and it's kind of like a

481
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,559
sequence series of um

482
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,798
tabs that relate to

483
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:37,279
um assignments that are related to the

484
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:41,119
agricultural what's it aim agriculture

485
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,119
engineer economics management

486
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,400
applied economics sorry i'm newer here

487
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:48,798
it's only my sixth month um right so he

488
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,798
works with the professor to develop all

489
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,319
these tabs and there are some library

490
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,400
instructions that are actually created

491
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:57,279
and some that are not and it just walks

492
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,798
students through each section of

493
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:00,160
the library research they need to do

494
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:01,759
that specific type of paper or

495
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,919
assignment for the class

496
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:05,200
so if you want something like this yes

497
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,480
we can do it but it's going to be a lot

498
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,480
of partnership and it's going to take a

499
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,960
lot a lot of time the live guide i

500
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,640
showed you before took us about an hour

501
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,759
to get together

502
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:19,120
so you can see um but it's not done yes

503
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,119
can you explain a little bit more

504
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,280
which one are you there's two this one

505
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,279
right now right so this one

506
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:31,679
they just go to there's a url right here

507
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,160
which is guides.library.cornell.edu

508
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,880
animalgenetics so we kind of kept it

509
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,480
simple so they go here and she had

510
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,320
specific browsers she wanted them to be

511
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:45,120
able to use so i put them in here um and

512
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:46,720
then some tutorials we also are going to

513
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,798
do it i don't think i have the pubmed

514
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,000
tutorial in there i have to add a pubmed

515
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:52,558
tutorial because a lot of students have

516
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,400
problems with pubmed and how to use it

517
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,038
um we're going to add more major

518
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,360
associations and we aren't finished yet

519
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:02,720
yeah um i found some online i was a

520
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:05,279
teacher before so i found some online uh

521
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,120
tutorials and simulations for genetics

522
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,038
so the university of utah has an

523
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:10,798
excellent site and it's kind of i know

524
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:12,720
it's animal genetics but it's for basic

525
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:13,918
genetics too so we kind of added that

526
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,038
information did that answer your

527
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,480
question

528
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:18,319
kind of

529
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,798
is there a specific question you want to

530
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:23,279
get okay so it's just a repository of

531
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:25,279
stuff for all the students to use

532
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,359
related to animal genetics so we're

533
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:28,480
going to add major associations for

534
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,719
different

535
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,038
like the dairy cattle and

536
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,360
goats and all the animals that they

537
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,400
might study in animal genetics related

538
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,479
to

539
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,720
the pre-vet program and the agricultural

540
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,160
side of it

541
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,360
and in this

542
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,798
libguide

543
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:47,119
sorry

544
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:48,960
this one is just uh

545
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,119
they're doing a financial analysis so

546
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,640
they're going to go to the databases

547
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:56,319
they need and then there are videos that

548
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,840
they can watch that the

549
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:59,918
librarian has made that walks them

550
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:02,079
through how to do it and the librarian's

551
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,880
very much embedded in the class and has

552
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,480
a lot of review sessions with them and

553
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,640
then tells them how to calculate ratios

554
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,000
so it's basically

555
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,600
kind of supplemental to what the

556
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,119
instructor is teaching them and then i

557
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,119
have one more i was going to show you

558
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,199
real quick and this is a nutrition

559
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:19,119
tutorial this one i think is

560
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,120
about five years in the making and you

561
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,199
can see it's much simpler looking

562
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,959
so what it actually does is thanks to

563
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,798
tutorials that can be embedded into

564
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,600
blackboard i believe

565
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:29,359
and

566
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:33,480
it's just uh

567
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,479
let's see if i haven't done it yet

568
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,359
okay so basically it's related to a

569
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,119
topic of choosing a nutrition

570
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:45,119
controversy and it leads them through

571
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,199
how do you evaluate sources

572
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,798
how do you find a controversy that you

573
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,679
want to look for where do you find the

574
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:52,879
information it has blogs it has cq

575
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,440
researcher

576
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,720
it's basically a tutorial that walks

577
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,759
them through and then gives them a quiz

578
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,360
at the end so it's part of the

579
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:03,319
assessment process

580
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,319
any questions on that

581
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,000
okay so the results after you've had the

582
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,519
class we will do a post assessment of

583
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,759
the session because we want to make sure

584
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,440
the students learn what we had set up in

585
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:14,640
the beginning so we're working on

586
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,159
developing different classroom

587
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,840
assessment tools that would be embedded

588
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,960
in the class so it doesn't seem like

589
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:20,158
they're being assessed again but they

590
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,079
actually are

591
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,360
and then we receive feedback from you on

592
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:24,639
what worked and what did not work

593
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,079
because the goal is to kind of keep

594
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,840
fine-tuning the class until it gets

595
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:29,599
better and better and we're more

596
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,199
efficient in what we're doing so the

597
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,359
assignment will be reworked based on the

598
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,880
assessment um every one of us does this

599
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,199
and the more information you can give us

600
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,840
to change the better

601
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,360
so conclusion um

602
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:42,959
we're your partners in improving the

603
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:46,079
information seeking behaviors of

604
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,840
yourself of students anyone you know

605
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:50,399
we're driven by desired outcomes and

606
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:52,798
assessments and we are linked to the

607
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,679
academic competencies as outlined in the

608
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:55,679
strategic plan

609
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,119
our future research because we're

610
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:01,599
growing and we don't have as many

611
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,119
librarians as needed for

612
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,558
uh the kind of classes we're getting

613
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,279
asked to do we're trying to look for

614
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,879
ways to make more embedded

615
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:12,079
library instruction and use different

616
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,960
technologies that are online so we can

617
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:18,720
expand our services and any other ideas

618
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,720
you might have we're open to those ideas

619
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,120
all right so my name is keith hello

620
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,440
everyone um so i'm the gis librarian and

621
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,959
everyone who's not using gis as the

622
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,798
technology doesn't have any idea what

623
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,798
gis is so i should start with that

624
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,558
basically geographic information systems

625
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:40,879
which is why i think they put another

626
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:43,279
word in my title that actually is a for

627
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,159
geospatial maybe that gives a clue that

628
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:49,200
uh what sorts of things i deal with um

629
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,840
so gis at man library um i provide the

630
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,080
main support i also have a colleague who

631
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,839
helps folks out with

632
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,240
the workshops data and consultations and

633
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:00,079
i'll walk through each of these

634
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,000
so with the workshops we offer

635
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,839
introductory workshops and i say

636
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,558
introductory because it's like two hours

637
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:07,199
just

638
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:09,918
the tip of the iceberg for various gis

639
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,880
software we've done arcgis for a long

640
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,360
time

641
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,039
some of you might be familiar with that

642
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,038
it's the one that tends to be used by

643
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:18,558
the cornell courses there's a gis course

644
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:20,319
in crop and social science for example

645
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:22,000
and they all use art giants a few years

646
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:23,759
ago they used to use manifold and i know

647
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,079
there's a lot of grad students hanging

648
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,839
around who still use manifold so we do

649
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:30,558
introductory workshops for that and then

650
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,079
qgis is an open source gis program all

651
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:33,359
these do the same thing by the way more

652
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,720
or less but the interfaces are

653
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:36,240
completely different

654
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,079
so sometimes if you use one it's helpful

655
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,440
to go to the other workshop but qgis is

656
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:40,399
an open source

657
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,200
program

658
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,919
um

659
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,480
and i'm hoping to offer a new workshop

660
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,559
later this spring date to be determined

661
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,480
but the other two uh programs where we

662
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,399
have the workshops up on the workshop

663
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,079
schedule that i think marty

664
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,440
someone's pointed towards on on the main

665
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,158
library website we have a whole bunch of

666
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,159
workshops there

667
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:03,119
in terms of data mann library has hosted

668
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,720
for about 15 years a repository of

669
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:05,678
geospatial data

670
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,319
that's

671
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,159
focused on new york state

672
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:13,278
so we have data in here across the state

673
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:15,360
things like agricultural districts

674
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:18,319
the usgs

675
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:20,558
topographic maps elevation data all

676
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:22,480
sorts of things we have a lot of data

677
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:23,918
specific to tompkins county because we

678
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,240
have a pretty close relationship with

679
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,360
the tompkins county folks in the city of

680
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,440
ithaca

681
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:31,759
so we have a lot richer data sets for

682
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,159
tompkins than the rest of the state

683
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,759
but then we also have some research

684
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,440
oriented data sets that were created

685
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,038
here at cornell

686
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,519
there was a study of french creek

687
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:42,879
watersheds in western new york and

688
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,038
just knowing that

689
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,400
we had this repository there was a

690
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:48,879
connection made with the researchers

691
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,919
doing that and we now host that data for

692
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,520
them so if you're generating data um

693
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,880
especially if it's in new york state um

694
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:56,240
i'd be interested in talking with you to

695
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,480
see if it's the sort of thing that would

696
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,159
be useful to to distribute to the public

697
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,159
um if do something like this

698
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:05,439
in the long term we are also interested

699
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,278
in

700
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,278
migrating to a new technology which will

701
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:10,720
also enable us to move beyond new york

702
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:11,839
state because i know there's a lot of

703
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,200
research that's being done here at

704
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,599
cornell that's not focused on new york

705
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,440
state so it'd be nice to

706
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,319
provide a home for that as well this

707
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,080
newer

708
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,918
portal it's called open geoportal is

709
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:23,918
originally developed at tulsa university

710
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,159
and basically we'll be migrating our

711
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,759
servers being set up today i think

712
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,400
migrating our data over into this format

713
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,919
so

714
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,000
you'll be able to just zoom into an area

715
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,600
and get a list of all the

716
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,440
data sets that apply that you can uh you

717
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,439
know narrow it down by keywords and then

718
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,440
you can even preview the data this is an

719
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,798
example of a streets

720
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,320
street center lines for somerville

721
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:43,599
massachusetts

722
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:45,278
and you can kind of preview that click

723
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:47,199
on things and get see what data is

724
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:48,640
available for each street segment

725
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,480
so you can imagine previewing other data

726
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,679
sets maybe it's a tree data set you

727
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,440
could click on the tree and see what

728
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,278
data is about is it the species is it

729
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,720
the diameter of the tree what other

730
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:58,159
information is available in that data

731
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,079
set so it gives you a good opportunity

732
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,200
to preview the dataset for downloading a

733
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:02,879
giant thing and

734
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,798
booting up your arcgis or whatever you

735
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,080
have

736
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:07,599
i've also been working on something i

737
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:08,639
call the geo load this is for people who

738
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,038
are looking for the mother lode of

739
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,520
geospatial data

740
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:15,038
and the idea is basically a catalog of

741
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:17,839
websites

742
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:20,158
on the internet anywhere in the world

743
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,918
that host geospatial data so just

744
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,520
describing them basically you know what

745
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,759
so this covers

746
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:27,759
china it's historical gis data and it's

747
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:29,839
mainly boundaries for example

748
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,359
that's the sort of level of detail

749
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:33,119
so the idea is that you come in here

750
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,359
limited to your particular area of

751
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,399
interest or particular topic like

752
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:40,558
transportation or

753
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,240
forests or whatever it might be

754
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,158
to narrow down to a few websites that

755
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,000
you have to go search out

756
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,440
rather than just doing google searches

757
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,880
and coming up with all sorts of

758
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,960
irrelevant things that you have to wait

759
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,440
through

760
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,679
so um the bulk of what i do tends to be

761
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,880
one-on-one consultations with students

762
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,640
staff faculty um and

763
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,880
there are four boxes on this

764
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,000
slide template so these were the top

765
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,720
four things i do troubleshooting

766
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,038
software converting data mapping and

767
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,038
geospatial analysis

768
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:12,798
so troubleshooting software whenever you

769
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:14,400
try to use arcgis does anyone here use

770
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,240
arcgis

771
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,519
have you ever come up with errors before

772
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,038
ever

773
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:20,240
okay

774
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:22,319
and a lot of times you get these weird

775
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,960
messages it doesn't make any sense what

776
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,960
does this mean what can i do um so just

777
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,558
uh even if i don't even know what the

778
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,000
tool is supposed to do

779
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:31,278
i can probably help you figure out how

780
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,880
to get it to go through the process

781
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:34,640
without coming up with the error at

782
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,559
least that's my help

783
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,400
so there's so many tools in arcgis and

784
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,079
the other gis programs i don't know

785
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,759
every single thing in there

786
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:44,158
so you know there's sometimes a limit to

787
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,839
how much help i can provide but basic

788
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,080
troubleshooting is definitely something

789
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:50,079
that i cover try to cover

790
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:52,319
converting data is a whole nother thing

791
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:54,960
in this case someone had a

792
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:55,759
an excel spreadsheet of farms i believe

793
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,919
that

794
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,558
we're all producing fibers

795
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,640
so like llama farms and sheep and goats

796
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:03,839
and all that sort of thing and they only

797
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,000
had the street addresses they wanted to

798
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,599
see where that was geographically

799
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,679
so that involved some conversion to

800
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:10,959
geocode those addresses to get latitude

801
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,880
and longitude coordinates so then they

802
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,558
could do further analysis or mapping

803
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,840
with that data set

804
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:18,720
another form of converting data um

805
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:20,798
i was trying to remember what the

806
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,240
original data set was up there it was

807
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:27,359
basically a database of trees um and the

808
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,359
amount of um

809
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,120
forested area of different species so

810
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,960
first of all i had to isolate all the

811
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:34,798
oak trees and then the person was

812
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,880
interested in aggregating that by county

813
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:38,720
so to get a total count of

814
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,720
approximate acreage of oak trees in each

815
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,919
county so that then they could pick out

816
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,558
selected

817
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,320
counties for like a random sample or for

818
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:49,440
further research

819
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,439
or interventions

820
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:54,480
mapping is a very time consuming process

821
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:56,319
if you've ever tried to create a

822
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,000
completed map with lots of labels notice

823
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:59,439
there's no labels on here that made it a

824
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,480
lot easier right

825
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,159
because as soon as you have different

826
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,278
layers of data and lots of different

827
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,760
labels and you want everything to be

828
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:07,759
legible and clear and it's a static

829
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:08,960
image that you can't zoom into anymore

830
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,359
because it's going into your published

831
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,840
journal paper

832
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:15,119
it can be very time consuming um

833
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:17,038
and

834
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,199
i don't do mapping myself but i can help

835
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:20,640
advise you on what tools you might need

836
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,000
how you might be able to get the labels

837
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,520
to work out the way you want this was

838
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,200
the case someone was studying coral

839
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:26,558
reefs in the caribbean and

840
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,360
needed a way to

841
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:30,960
depict the direction and velocity of

842
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:32,798
ocean currents in different times of the

843
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,159
year so we worked with manifold to

844
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:35,839
figure out how to get the symbology to

845
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,600
work to get the arrows at the right

846
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:40,319
angles at the right uh

847
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:42,319
the right sizes

848
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:43,839
this was another example someone was

849
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:45,038
studying i believe

850
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:47,278
frogs

851
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:49,119
particular species in central america

852
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:50,720
they had done all this genetic testing

853
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:52,319
and they knew the genetic distances

854
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,079
between these and they wanted to see how

855
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,879
that compared with the um

856
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:57,839
the geographic distances and the the

857
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,960
thing that was interesting is that

858
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,480
there's this mountain range but there's

859
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,919
no way these frogs would have ever gone

860
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,519
over those mountains so they had to try

861
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,038
to look at the genetic distances and

862
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:09,480
geographic distances to figure out which

863
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:09,480
way they may have migrated historically

864
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,360
and this is

865
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:17,520
tajikistan

866
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:20,079
a map of ethnic regions in that area

867
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,599
so there's just some examples

868
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:23,519
this is one that actually did involve

869
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:25,278
with helping with the labeling a lot

870
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:28,398
boy was that time consuming um so if

871
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:28,398
you're going to do a mapping um

872
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:33,038
besides some nice time

873
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:35,919
uh in terms of analysis the sky's the

874
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:37,919
limit in terms of what you want to do

875
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,278
and as i mentioned

876
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,120
there's these three different programs

877
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:43,519
that i'm familiar with and they each

878
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:44,719
have different ways of doing things and

879
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:46,879
but more or less they have the same

880
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,240
sorts of tools and sometimes you have an

881
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,520
idea in your head about what you want to

882
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,679
analyze

883
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,599
and maybe just crunch you know get some

884
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,798
data out of the art out of the gis

885
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:56,079
program and bring it into your

886
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:57,759
statistics package that you might be

887
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:58,639
more familiar with

888
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:00,480
so

889
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,399
the question is well what function do i

890
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,319
need to run so i can help you identify

891
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:06,719
what tools you might actually want to do

892
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:08,798
what one to use

893
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,640
this was an example of crime in

894
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:11,839
washington dc it was a terrifying data

895
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,520
set when you opened up and there's these

896
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:16,158
points everywhere across it was just one

897
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:19,278
year of data of arrests

898
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,440
but this was a basic density analysis to

899
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:22,960
see where the hot spots were

900
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,320
i think the researcher on this was

901
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,919
looking at

902
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:28,558
arrest before and after they made some

903
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,640
policy change about how late the subway

904
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:31,599
ran and what times the bars had to close

905
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,038
and

906
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,038
that's been an interesting project

907
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,278
this is a little more to the natural

908
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:40,479
sciences here this is a geospatial

909
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:42,720
analysis of

910
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,480
viper species richness in the western

911
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,600
hemisphere

912
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,000
so someone was looking at um

913
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:50,879
analyzing where are there more or where

914
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,919
there are

915
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,960
more species of vipers in

916
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,640
each

917
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,720
region and this is just sort of a heat

918
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,559
map of that and then he was comparing it

919
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,000
with various other factors environmental

920
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:03,519
factors try to understand what would

921
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
help to lead to

922
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,759
this rich diversity

923
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,200
and so to do that you have to figure out

924
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,720
what tools you need

925
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,000
i'm not an expert on all these tools by

926
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,880
any means but i can help you point you

927
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,919
to the correct tools to use

928
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,200
but really it's more about

929
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,278
troubleshooting than just trying to do

930
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,278
it

931
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:25,320
so if you need any help with any of that

932
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,320
come see me

933
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,240
good i'm glad somebody put my name on

934
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,000
this line because i realized i forgot to

935
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,919
put my name on

936
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,359
these slides that i provided so i'm here

937
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,960
to talk to you about research data

938
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:40,798
management services

939
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,759
um at the library and at cornell

940
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,759
university so as a slide before this

941
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:47,519
said my name is sarah wright and i'm the

942
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:49,759
life sciences librarian so i'm from the

943
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,679
library but i'm also part of this

944
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,038
research data management service group

945
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,640
which is

946
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,319
campus wide and i'll tell you a little

947
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,080
bit more about that later on in this

948
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:59,359
presentation

949
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,439
but first

950
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:04,798
why all the buzz about data management

951
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,038
why are we talking about data management

952
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:08,879
funders are increasingly encouraging

953
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:10,720
researchers to share their data so this

954
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,519
report was put out

955
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,839
way back in 2008 at this point and this

956
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,599
was the work of

957
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:19,918
almost two dozen different federal

958
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:20,959
agencies who got together and and talked

959
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,640
about

960
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,399
what we needed to do to harness the

961
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,720
power of digital data for science and

962
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:28,879
society the title of the report

963
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,360
and they in this report described data

964
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,600
management plans pretty thoroughly and

965
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:35,759
the plans that have since

966
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,599
the requirement that has since come out

967
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,119
from the national science foundation

968
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:40,319
that you have to have a data management

969
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:43,038
plan

970
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:44,798
with every grant proposal really mirrors

971
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:46,158
the the guidelines that they put out in

972
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:48,480
this report

973
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,480
so the nsf already has that requirement

974
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,880
and we're increasingly seeing and

975
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,120
hearing about other

976
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,600
other agencies that are requiring it in

977
00:33:55,119 --> 00:34:00,798
fact

978
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:02,000
last january the ostp put out this

979
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:04,720
mandate

980
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,519
that any uh any federal agency that

981
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,398
spends over 100 million in their conduct

982
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,398
of research needs to develop a plan to

983
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:14,719
support increased public access to the

984
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:17,519
results of research funded by the

985
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,959
federal government so this is happening

986
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:23,119
we're going to see this from more and

987
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,119
more agencies this would be the usda

988
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,079
lots of agencies

989
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:30,078
publishers are also requiring or

990
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,399
suggesting data sharing so nature and

991
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,280
science are very high profile but a lot

992
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:36,960
of other journals also require that you

993
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,960
submit your data along with your

994
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,760
publication so there are requirements

995
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,760
from publishers

996
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:47,199
so what funders generally want to see in

997
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:49,358
a data management plan this is very

998
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,519
broad this isn't necessarily specific to

999
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:53,759
the national science foundation

1000
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:55,519
but generally in a data management plan

1001
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,119
you should describe what data you expect

1002
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:58,719
to collect in

1003
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,880
the course of the project

1004
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:03,199
what data or metadata formats will you

1005
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,039
be using will you be using any standards

1006
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:06,799
or

1007
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:09,039
data formats that are particularly good

1008
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,280
for preservation et cetera details like

1009
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:13,519
that why are you using those data and

1010
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:17,280
metadata formats that you're choosing

1011
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:19,199
it's always good to explain why

1012
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,519
there also would like to hear about your

1013
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:22,559
plans for storing and preserving your

1014
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:24,320
data

1015
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:26,880
and how are you going to preserve access

1016
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,440
to that data after beyond the course of

1017
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,119
the grant

1018
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,880
how long do you plan on keeping your

1019
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,800
data you know maybe your data is only

1020
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,320
valuable for five years and so that's

1021
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,079
okay explain that you're only going to

1022
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,920
keep this data set for five years and

1023
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,320
it's not important beyond that

1024
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,240
um alternatively maybe your data is very

1025
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,160
important for a very long time a period

1026
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:48,399
of time so you want to explain that and

1027
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:51,440
how you plan on making sure that it's

1028
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,079
available for that long period of time

1029
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,000
and how do you plan on sharing your data

1030
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,560
and disseminating it so this is like

1031
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,358
broader impacts

1032
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:03,119
so but this is a very quick presentation

1033
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:05,440
so i'm really not here to tell you about

1034
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,400
the details of how to

1035
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,320
create a data management plan or or plan

1036
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,680
really i'm here to let you know that

1037
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,559
there is support for cornell

1038
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:16,239
investigators so i mentioned the

1039
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:17,279
research data management service group

1040
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:18,159
earlier

1041
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,920
who

1042
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:21,759
a group that i'm part of

1043
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,440
we are a virtual organization and we

1044
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,200
include people from the center for

1045
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,679
advanced computing

1046
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:30,559
the library cornell institute for social

1047
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:31,519
and economic research it cornell and

1048
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:33,358
others

1049
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:35,119
and basically what we are is we're just

1050
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:36,559
a single point of contact so if you have

1051
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,480
a question

1052
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:41,119
related to data management plans you can

1053
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,960
ask us if you have a question related to

1054
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,559
where should i store my data what's the

1055
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,960
best solution

1056
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:48,799
short time short term or long term you

1057
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,358
can come have a conversation with us

1058
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,880
about that

1059
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:56,159
if you want us to come and talk to your

1060
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,079
department about data management plan

1061
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,559
for longer than 10 minutes we'll also

1062
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,039
come and talk to you or your lab maybe

1063
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:05,279
your lab is concerned with how to best

1064
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:08,239
foster collaboration and sharing of data

1065
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,000
sets with another lab or

1066
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:12,159
something like that and so we're happy

1067
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,838
to come and talk to groups about

1068
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:15,838
about issues like that as well

1069
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,639
i don't have cards with me today but i

1070
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,560
would like to point out that the url for

1071
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,679
our website is down at the bottom of

1072
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:26,320
each of these slides so it's

1073
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:28,559
data.research.cornell.edu

1074
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:32,680
and if at any point you want to contact

1075

1081
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,079
keith he just saw his face um these are

1082
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,559
some of the experts that will be able to

1083
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,640
help you with your your data so we have

1084
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,000
a wide range with different kinds of

1085
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:56,879
expertise

1086
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,880
and for the most part we are all human

1087
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,960
except for maybe wyman miles down there

1088
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,559
from i.t

1089
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,240
we can't get a picture of him for some

1090
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,480
reason

1091
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:08,479
um so i mentioned really quickly we have

1092
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,400
a website with lots of different data

1093
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,079
management services info and we're

1094
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,320
increasing the amount the amount of

1095
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:17,119
training material on the website so i

1096
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,800
invite you to go check out our website

1097
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,039
as you just saw we have a consultant

1098
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,880
pool so we have a ticketing and triage

1099
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:24,480
system so if you send that email to

1100
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,480
rdmsg help

1101
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,280
it will go to one of those human beings

1102
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,800
and they will respond to you

1103
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,400
and be able to sit down and actually

1104
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,519
have a conversation with you about your

1105
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,639
your needs

1106
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:38,719
we also do information sessions on nsf

1107
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:40,480
data management plans as well as other

1108
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:42,799
questions you might have

1109
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,880
for example

1110
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,960
if you're thinking about depositing data

1111
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,160
into the institutional repository

1112
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:53,119
e-commons then we can do an information

1113
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:55,759
session on depositing information and

1114
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:59,119
depositing into e-commerce so

1115
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,119
different information sessions

1116
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:05,599
we do have operating principles

1117
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,680
we pledge that we will provide timely

1118
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,480
and professional assistance

1119
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:13,039
we frequently get

1120
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,599
questions the night before the grant is

1121
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:17,679
due and we will do our best to respond

1122
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,519
to that but if you give us a little bit

1123
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:21,118
more lead time we can definitely do a

1124
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:22,800
better job with helping you with your

1125
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,039
data management plan

1126
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,880
we do encourage best practices in data

1127
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:29,199
management

1128
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,838
and we do treat the information that you

1129
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:33,199
give us as confidential so we might

1130
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:35,039
share information with another

1131
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:38,480
consultant so if you have questions

1132
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:41,199
about gis data in addition to some other

1133
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,358
type of data i might consult with keith

1134
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:44,719
to help answer the gis question so we

1135
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:46,799
will consult

1136
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:48,559
inside the group but we will treat your

1137
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,599
information as confidential and we won't

1138
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:53,679
share it outside of the group

1139
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,000
and we refer you to the most appropriate

1140
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:57,759
services at cornell or elsewhere so if

1141
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,519
the most appropriate service is not a

1142
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,520
cornell service we'll refer you out

1143
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,838
and that's it for me i was worried about

1144
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:11,400
time but i think i made it so questions

1145
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:11,400
for any of us

1146
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,400
hi marty it's mike hey mike

1147
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,838
um i was wondering if for our people

1148
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,320
here if somebody could talk a little bit

1149
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:28,000
about the form for requesting uh an

1150
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,160
instruction session and if they would

1151
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
use that if they wanted a session here

1152
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:35,118
at jailer

1153
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,800
thanks mike um

1154
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,920
they're certainly welcome to use that

1155
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:42,480
form

1156
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:44,960
and we would always then make the

1157
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,280
the connection with the right person for

1158
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,358
leading that instruction

1159
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,040
and i should have pointed out earlier

1160
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:52,799
that

1161
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:54,480
i'm the liaison

1162
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,720
to the horticulture department and that

1163
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,800
includes the people who are based here

1164
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:02,239
in ithaca as well as those who are based

1165
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,359
in geneva but mike is really the

1166
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:05,838
the

1167
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,519
first point of contact

1168
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,838
in geneva

1169
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:11,679
in almost all cases

1170
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:14,078
it's the easiest just to to be in touch

1171
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:16,000
with mike and and he can either handle

1172
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,920
the question or

1173
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,199
refer it to me or somebody else in man

1174
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,039
library

1175
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:22,159
so there's a lot of collaboration back

1176
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:24,159
and forth

1177
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:25,759
mike has been teaching some sessions in

1178
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:27,519
geneva

1179
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,040
not just for

1180
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:31,519
cornell students because there aren't a

1181
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:33,679
lot of cornell students in geneva but

1182
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:35,759
actually teaching sessions for the

1183
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:37,118
enology and viticulture program that's

1184
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,800
part of the finger lakes community

1185
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,920
college because they come to the library

1186
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:44,160
there to use use that material

1187
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,440
since geneva has the bulk of the enology

1188
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:47,199
and viticulture

1189
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,800
literature within the cornell library

1190
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:53,679
system so um feel free geneva people to

1191
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,400
use that platform

1192
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:59,279
or the research consultation form but

1193
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,559
also feel free to contact mike directly

1194
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,800
one of the things like uh

1195
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:06,480
some of our newer students will uh

1196
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,400
graduate students will say okay have you

1197
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,280
used web of science

1198
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,680
to

1199
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,920
search for resources and a lot of times

1200
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:15,440
they haven't so then

1201
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,440
we'll just spend five or ten minutes

1202
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,720
going through that but i'm wondering if

1203
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,200
you offer kind of an entry-level

1204
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:26,559
session for grad students that we could

1205
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:29,559
send to you or invite them to

1206
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:29,559
um

1207
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,719
oh that's great

1208
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,318
and

1209
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,519
that would be an example where you could

1210
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:39,199
refer them to the library for

1211
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:42,318
consultation we'll be glad to do that

1212
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:45,439
for a graduate student in particular

1213
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:47,358
who's ready to dig into the literature

1214
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,760
wanting to know you know what resources

1215
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:51,759
might be most appropriate for

1216
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,280
their particular research

1217
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,680
and so we'd be glad to sit down for an

1218
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,839
hour with somebody on that um kelly do

1219
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:59,598
we have any general sessions on research

1220
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:00,719
we don't have any workshops to live with

1221
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,760
clients

1222
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:06,559
but that's something you could request

1223
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,720
and see how many people show up

1224
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:09,599
we have had general

1225
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:11,519
sort of

1226
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,599
introductory courses to doing library

1227
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,838
literature research in the past just

1228
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,559
open workshops that weren't

1229
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:20,078
integrated into the into a course

1230
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:22,480
and over time

1231
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,880
the interest in that had diminished

1232
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,800
and so but if there's demand for that we

1233
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,760
could consider doing that again we do

1234
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,560
have some

1235
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,800
other

1236
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:32,799
open workshops that aren't course

1237
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,640
specific um but i don't know that we

1238
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,960
have one specifically on that go ahead

1239
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:38,000
sarah we have one called med but on

1240
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,240
pubmed

1241
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,679
yeah we're doing that on a trial basis

1242
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:43,679
so we do have one

1243
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:44,559
later this semester

1244
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:46,239
uh

1245
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:48,639
somebody has come and taken away the

1246
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:50,959
fourth floor of the library for us or is

1247
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:53,759
the third floor going to be

1248
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,318
available in the years to come i are you

1249
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,079
looking for space well you know

1250
00:43:56,318 --> 00:43:59,920
well i used to enjoy working on the

1251
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:04,640
fourth floor now i'm down on the third

1252
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:07,280
floor but i'm just hoping that over time

1253
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:09,838
all of the books don't you know go out

1254
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,760
to the annex and we we end up with just

1255
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:12,559
a big server sitting there in the middle

1256
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,599
of it

1257
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:18,000
i i love all the electronic access but i

1258
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,760
also and i think a lot of people like

1259
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,880
you know having having some space up

1260
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,400
there too

1261
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,400
so i hope the third floor doesn't go

1262
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,880
away i guess well we hope so too and

1263
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,880
we've been assured at this point that um

1264
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,079
that we've uh given up as much space as

1265
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,039
we're going to be giving up in the

1266
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,359
library

1267
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:35,279
and what he's alluding to

1268
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:36,799
is that we did consolidate the

1269
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,560
collection substantially the print

1270
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,119
collection

1271
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:43,279
and a significant portion of that

1272
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,800
collection went to the annex there's

1273
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,079
still a lot of print material in the

1274
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,160
library so the the library

1275
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,720
space is primarily the first second and

1276
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:55,279
third floor at this point and what is

1277
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:57,199
going to change um perhaps the most is

1278
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,519
we're going to be increasing the amount

1279
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:01,919
of collaborative and study space for

1280
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:04,318
students um of course anybody can use it

1281
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,240
but that's our target audience for for

1282
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:08,559
the library so you saw some of the

1283
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:10,879
different types of space um that we have

1284
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:12,880
been providing and we we see

1285
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,680
uh enormous amount of use of that and

1286
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,160
we'll be continuing to expand that some

1287
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:20,159
of you may remember or know that some of

1288
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:21,598
the second floor space is

1289
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:23,920
currently being occupied by

1290
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,960
non-non-library

1291
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,800
staff

1292
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,760
from human ecology

1293
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,920
and

1294
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,079
from the cals and human ecology business

1295
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,480
offices and they will be moving out in

1296
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,400
the next little while to other space and

1297
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,000
we will be regaining what's on the

1298
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,639
second floor

1299
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,719
non-library office right now and that

1300
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:44,719
will be increasing the amount of space

1301
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:47,118
available for for study space and

1302
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:48,799
collaborative workspace and the like

1303
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,519
i feel strongly and i think it's fair to

1304
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,839
say that the library feels strongly that

1305
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:55,599
we're a residential institution and we

1306
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:58,000
really need to make that student

1307
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:00,640
experience maximize that student

1308
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,280
experience in the library as well as

1309
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:05,358
throughout the campus i think that

1310
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,119
many students particularly undergraduate

1311
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:08,239
students

1312
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,400
are

1313
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:11,598
taking increasingly taking online

1314
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,838
courses

1315
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,359
and if we're going to really compete

1316
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:17,838
with that we need to make that

1317
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:20,719
residential experience substantially

1318
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:23,440
better than an online experience

1319
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:25,598
can be and so

1320
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:29,519
on the part of the library having a

1321
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:31,760
diversity of study and activity spaces

1322
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:33,920
research spaces is very important thank

1323
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,920
you

1324
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:45,559
this has been a production of cornell
