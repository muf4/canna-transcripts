00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:12,638
University and welcome to this uh

3
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:15,518
Symposium and honor Peter Davy's

4
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:18,600
contributions to Cornel over the last 46

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,719
years my name is Fred Beringer uh back

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,480
in the last Millennium I was a student

7
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:26,598
with Peter I was here from 85 to 90 and

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,759
I'm delighted to be here today to help

9
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:33,558
them see this event um first thing I'd

10
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:36,520
like do is introduce uh the chairman of

11
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:39,199
the section of plant biology Dr K have a

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:42,480
few words to thank

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,520
you okay uh I guess my job was to talk a

14
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,919
little about Peter and not to talk too

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,039
long about Peter and I made a few notes

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,760
to myself to make sure I covered every

17
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,558
aspect of of my interactions with Peter

18
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:58,280
I knew about Peter before I knew Peter I

19
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:00,479
missed him by a couple of years at Yale

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,239
but I knew of his eminence in the area

21
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,399
of plant physiology so I was delighted

22
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,719
to meet him here when I got to Cornell

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,640
Peter was then the chair of or soon to

24
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:12,959
be the chair of the plant biology

25
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:16,680
section u sounds the same but it's

26
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:18,359
different it was a smaller unit I did

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,680
then knew Peter as a member of The

28
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:24,400
Faculty of plant biology and ultimately

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,200
I got to know Peter as a of course as a

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,560
colleague and a friend I got to know

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,799
that he had a remarkable wife Linda who

32
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,399
was in intellectual force in her own

33
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,118
right I got to know that Peter was a

34
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:40,719
heck of a dad but twoo extremely

35
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:41,719
remarkable and accomplished children uh

36
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,200
and

37
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:46,438
uh their their

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,320
accomplishments exceed those that anyone

39
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:50,319
could have rationally hoped for in

40
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:56,319
life I'm still in a that most of my

41
00:01:53,478 --> 00:02:00,478
colleagues it seems put pressure on my

42
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:04,038
kids I guess uh I know Peter as a a very

43
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:06,799
interesting teacher he has courage he

44
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:10,080
takes uh he was a good and Effective

45
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,319
Teacher in PL physiology for years but

46
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,440
toward the end of his uh plant

47
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,159
physiology teaching career he introduced

48
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:19,759
a course where he covered major events

49
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:23,079
in biology and the pop based on the

50
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:25,159
popular press and on things that were

51
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:30,200
happening at the

52
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:32,680
time I um I sat in on the course I to

53
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:34,919
reintroduce the course I was very

54
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,879
impressed by the courage Peter exhibited

55
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,598
in covering issues that are highly

56
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:42,039
controversial at times I was quite

57
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,560
impressed by the guests and the guest

58
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:46,479
lecturers we had in the course including

59
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,239
one of my favorite old Yale professors

60
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:52,919
who it turns out as a good friend of

61
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:56,000
Peter dick gold so uh that was a nice

62
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:58,639
thing about knowing Peter I also knew

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,280
Peter in the role as a wonderful host

64
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:04,518
and a fine colleague I like very much I

65
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,400
think today we'll see that I'm not the

66
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,719
only one that shares that very positive

67
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,840
view of Peter and his contribution with

68
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:14,120
Cornell and I'm happy to turn it over to

69
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,120
the

70
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,360
program thank you we're going to hear a

71
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:30,438
lot of nice things being said about

72
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:33,319

73
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:36,120

75
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:43,920
see quite a few familiar faces but some

76
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:47,438
don't recognize um so I I think it's

77
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:50,359
um it's fair to say that uh all of you

78
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:53,359
have U benefited from from Peter in some

79
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,360
way or another in your career and uh

80
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,799
he's helped us learn and

81
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,599
grow different ways but if it was just

82
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,599
that I don't think we have this uh this

83
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,078
seminar here today because it wasn't

84
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:06,199
just how Peter helped us with our our

85
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,519
careers and learning profession it was

86
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:09,719
it was the way he did it and the simple

87
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:14,239
word for it it was just it was a lot of

88
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:18,879
fun to work with Peter um Peter brought

89
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:22,560
a lot of energy and positive uh thoughts

90
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:23,800
to all the work that I did with him um

91
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,120
he was

92
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,280
uh he made it fun to work he he uh was

93
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,079
open to new ideas and supported trying

94
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,799
new things

95
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:33,800
he

96
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,399
um gave everything did everything with a

97
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,120
healthy dose of humor and I think his

98
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,839
Hospitality to the people who have come

99
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,680
through his lab over the years is is

100
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:47,478
well know so um and the last thing is I

101
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,240
know that he kept the best interest in

102
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:51,159
mind of all the people he worked with

103
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,160
over the years so um those are my

104
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,560
Impressions that I think he'd share

105
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,600
those as well so um it's great that

106

you're all here as a way of showing some

107
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:05,000
gratitude to Peter for what he's done

108
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:07,199
for our careers and also um be thankful

thankful for the way he's be learning

110
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,680
and collaborating on science working in

111
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,120
the lab and fun thing to do so thank you

112

00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:21,519
bio about Peter so hang on there

115
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,399
apparently Peter uh got a

116
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:28,120
very um I got an early Head Start in

117
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:31,519
plant biology when he um took a class in

118
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,319
high school uh PL class high school and

119
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,478
U his textbook at that time was by erns

120
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,160
and Daniels who were two carel

121
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:41,680
professors so they didn't snow small no

122
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,800
circumstance K endel after all these

123
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,038
years and it was at that point that he

124
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,879
learned about gibberellin which become a

125
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:50,439
lifelong

126
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,560
passion Peter uh has been a member was a

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,959
career so with that I'd like to

191
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,519
introduce our first Speaker who is

192
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,518
Professor Jim

193
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,879
Reed Jim is a plant geneticist has

194
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,600
identified genes that regulate plant

195
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:56,039
pron synthesis

196
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,000
reception he's shown how gibberellin

197
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,559
grassin steroids oxin and ethylene

198
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,200
regulate plant development from the

199
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:05,399
molecular to the whole plant

200
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,800
level he's currently working on the role

201
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,919
of plant hormones role of plant hormones

202
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:13,278
play and

203
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:15,838
symbiosis Jim is isi highly cited

204
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:18,200
researcher and former dean of science

205
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,640
engineering and Technology at the

206
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,000
University of

207
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:24,559
Tasmania he's a fellow of the Australian

208
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,480
Academy of techn technological sciences

209
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,759
and

210
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,120
Engineering Jim spent two sabatical here

211
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:31,559
I was fortunate to be a student here

212
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,600
during one of those and can attest to

213
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:36,518
how much fun it is to work with Jim but

214
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,200
more importantly Peter and Jim have

215
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,720
collaborated over the years and have

216
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,800
made significant contributions to the

217
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,000
field with plant

218
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:46,240
mons so Jim thank you very much for

219
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,720
making a truck here from Tasmania all

220
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,519
the way to Upstate New York the floor is

221
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:55,440
yours and the title of Jim's talk is

222
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,440
hormones and plant development

223
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,120
thanks very much Fred it's absolutely

224
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,519
great to be here and thanks very much

225
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,720
for the invitation and the organization

226
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:11,078
Sarah and Fred G um put on the show over

227
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,440
the next couple of

228
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:16,078
days when I was asked to come I was

229
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,120
asked to talk to a titled something like

230
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:20,078
this which was to talk and give an

231
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,639
upto-date version overview of where

232
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,399
plant hormones are at and then thinking

233
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,919
about it I thought that field is just

234
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,879
huge these days it's just enormous

235
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,919
there's no way to give a contemporary

236
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:33,679
overview of that whole area so I thought

237
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:35,240
that I would actually focus a little

238
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,679
instead of trying to cover the whole

239
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,680
area on areas and questions that Peter

240
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:43,278
had asked back in his early career and

241
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:45,519
tried to show you how over the last 30

242
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:48,278
40 years those questions have been asked

243
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,278
so I apologize if some of the d a few

244
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:53,000
years old some of it will be quite up to

245
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:55,320
date but um I think it's important to

246
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,399
actually address the questions that

247
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,320
Peter posed back in the' 70s and see

248
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,839
where they come today we not being able

249
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,839
to be

250
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,240
answered who has been engaged with

251
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,000
hormones for a very long period of time

252
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:19,079
he this is a conference

253
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,958
1967 so he's been working for 950 years

254
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:24,759
on plant hormones that's Peter DAV is

255
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:27,039
there and probably about mid 20s early

256
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:30,078
20s so he's been working in this area

257
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:32,360
for a very long period of time and

258
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:35,159
I would like to Define three areas of

259
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,079
research which I think he's made a a

260
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:38,919
critical contribution to over that very

261
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:41,838
long

262
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:43,559
career there are areas that I think are

263
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,200
close to his heart he's worked

264
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:47,799
extensively in these areas and he's

265
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,639
really been at the Forefront of the

266
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:53,679
field when some of the discoveries were

267
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:55,120
made the first one is a perhaps an odd

268
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,799
one for somebody to prod up he's been a

269
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,959
champion of hormone physiology and I'd

270
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:02,919
say that because he influenced me in the

271
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,679
early days to be interested in for

272
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:07,240
physiology and I think he's done that

273
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:09,159
through being the author and editor of

274
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,839
key texts over a very long period of

275
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:15,519
time to enthuse people to actually get

276
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,120
involved with the field and at times

277
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,039
there's been a real need for that the

278
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,399
second area that I'll talk and probably

279
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:24,078
talk more about in terms of length are

280
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,600
the growth promoting hormones orans and

281
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:27,919
gerin the things he worked on and

282
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:33,600
particularly their control of the

283
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:35,439
elongation sh ation plants and he did

284
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,120
early work where he identified Au and

285
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,519
transport patterns and gerell metabolism

286
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,198
and some of the Jon intermediates with

287
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:45,159
bioses in a number of key

288
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:47,958
species sorry I probably should have

289
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:50,439
said but the first area is highlighted

290
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:54,119
perhaps by this paper horal regulation P

291
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:56,920
plants with Arles in back um in science

292
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,440
in 1969 so this perhaps shows that he

293
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:01,120
was interested in this overview because

294
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,920
this was a a large review in science at

295
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,240
that time second one is highlighted by

296
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,519
this early review in the panical review

297
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,278
about the current modes of action of

298
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:13,440
orgm and the third area I talk about and

299
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,399
Pet's made a major contribution is the

300
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,120
genetic control of development the use

301
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:20,039
of gen to understand development and in

302
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,120
his particular case it was about AG in

303
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:24,599
essence and that was before people

304
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,720
started to work on arox and have all the

305
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,480
model species that we have today so it

306
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,000
may again appear why are we saying this

307
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,959
you assume that's the way people do

308
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,519
research no not that in the 70s and the

309
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,879
key paper there is this PO periodic

310
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,039
control of in essence the genetic line

311
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:46,838
ofes which he did with Jer Marx who was

312
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:49,439
at Geneva perhaps Mentor as a geneticist

313
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:52,720
plant geneticist and Bill Pro one of his

314
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,759
PhD students and I think in each of

315
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,079
these areas think has made a major

316
00:13:54,759 --> 00:14:00,240
contribution I'd like to show you how

317
00:13:57,078 --> 00:14:02,958
over the next little while

318
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,480
my first involvement with Peter came as

319
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:08,078
I said through that first area and that

320
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,720
was this text which came out in 1970

321
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:13,319
with art gon presumably based upon that

322
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,278
review in science and this came out in

323
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,360
my final year as an undergraduate

324
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:21,958
student and so I was introduced to the

325
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,600
area through this text and we used it

326
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:25,838
for a number of years in our third year

327
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:30,079
course in our

328
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:32,680
teaching more recently he's produced

329
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:34,039
this these texts on plant hormones the

330
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:36,078
titles changed a little bit over the

331
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:39,679
years there been various additions of

332
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:42,278
them between 1987 and

333
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,359
2010 and this is really the major

334
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:46,519
graduate level text in my opinion in the

335
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,000
field over the last 20 or 30 years there

336
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:51,839
are chapters by the experts in the field

337
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,879
have been invited to write this text

338
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,320
Peter put it together you can see his

339
00:14:53,879 --> 00:15:00,000
interesting J because the molecule is on

340
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,480
the front cover of pH and he in genetics

341
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,198
because here are some drawings in this

342
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:09,519
case of various P mutants that syes and

343
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,519
in the

344
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:18,078
same when Peter started his work that

345
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:21,240
science paper had these five plastical

346
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:24,519
group of hormones were n and since that

347
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:27,079
time the complexity has expanded and his

348
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:29,879
texts have expanded along with that the

349
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:31,638
chapters on new hormon groups like

350
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:34,639
steroids that became defined as a

351
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:37,600
hormone group in 1996 the L groups St

352
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,079
lactones in 2008 there are a bunch of

353
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,480
other hormones that have also been

354
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:44,278
identified over those years

355
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:47,240
polyam yes or no some of the defense

356
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:51,039
hormones chlorogen been identified we

357
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:53,440
know that's ft protein other signaling

358
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:56,559
proteins like CLE peptides have been

359
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,399
identified these control roou

360
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,119
shoot information flows during processes

361
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,240
like

362
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,440
modulation and there are still hormones

363
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,240
to be identified there a carak like

364
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:10,279
hormone carak is a substance you find in

365
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:13,159
Smoke and bufes which has affects plant

366
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:15,799
development but it's fairly clear that

367
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:18,000
there are signaling Pathways within um

368
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:20,799
the plant and there's probably a natural

369
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,318
hormone that's great to so the field is

370
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:25,318
grown and there is still more to

371
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,199
go why do we need a champion of plant

372
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,799
hormones why do we need somebody to

373
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:34,958
stand up and publish the texts write the

374
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:36,439
Books edit the books it's hard work and

375
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,599
perhaps doesn't get you the high

376
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,959
citations that you may get out of some

377
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,639
of the papers in a high-profile journal

378
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:49,719
and my view is because of some work that

379
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:53,240
happened during the 1980s largely led by

380
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,800
Anthony who questioned whether planned

381
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,519
hormones really did

382
00:16:54,799 --> 00:17:00,198
exist he was suggesting that hormone

383
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,839
sensitivity was the key controller of PL

384
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:05,359
development and in the more popularist

385
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:08,519
issues of new scientists here in

386
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,719
1984 you see that that there really was

387
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:13,759
a question do plant plants really have

388
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,679
hormones and what I'd like to show you

389
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:17,959
over the next little while is indeed

390
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,439
they do and show you that the evidence

391
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:23,400
that was put forward against them and

392
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:25,400
there were seven reasons given by ders

393
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,679
against the role of

394
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,200
plan some of the key ones I just shown

395
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,919
here in Black they are the FAA to

396
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:36,120
correlate hormone levels with

397
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:37,480
development FAA to show localized sites

398
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:39,319
of

399
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,679
production and the effects of the

400
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:45,159
environment on hormone levels were simp

401
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,919
be trivial if in fact hormones really do

402
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,360
system play a key role in plant

403
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,799
development then we must be able to find

404
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,558
evidence that shows those statements are

405
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:56,400
not correct and what I would like to

406
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:59,200
show you is that in working with Peter

407
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,759
over the last 30 years we will see

408
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,679
evidence that contradicts each of those

409
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:05,079
statements I won't go back to these

410
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,960
statements so it might be wise just to

411
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:09,720
remember them but I hope that I can

412
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,038
convince you these criticisms that were

413
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,839
there in the 1980s have been overcome

414
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:17,960
and Peter played a key role in champing

415
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:20,959
the role plan through the T that he

416
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:25,440
edited to move to the second um section

417
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:28,960
of the tour the growth a Jons and

418
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,519
El and this is where I've worked with

419
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,279
and collaborated with him um during some

420
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:36,400
wonderful sabatical that we've had and

421
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:39,279
my family have had at Cornell and that

422
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,679
he has had while he worked in our lab

423
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:43,440
back in

424
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:45,640
Tasmania we used a range of techniques

425
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,558
over the years the early years it was

426
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:51,159
great physiology PL physiology and the

427
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:53,279
forward genetics approach as the

428
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:56,880
analytical techniques became better we

429
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:59,918
use GCM lcms techniques and of course

430
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,120
the last 20 years the molecular ology

431
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,120
but I hope again I can show you that we

432
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:05,918
need all of these range of techniques if

433
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:08,158
we're really going to understand plant

434
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:11,360
development from the molecular level

435
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,360
right through the whole plant

436
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:18,480
level why work on shooting elongation

437
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:20,519
why look at it as a process that we want

438
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,360
to understand and I hope this graph

439
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:24,279
gives you some idea why we thought it

440
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:26,479
was an interesting area of working if

441
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:28,759
you look at yield in serial crops are

442
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,759
just wheat crops over the period of

443
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:34,319
about 1963 to about 2000 there's a very

444
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,879
dramatic increase in yield and this

445
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,119
increase in yield is obviously

446
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,960
contributable to improved agronomic

447
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:43,678
processes and arra of other things at

448
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:46,038
that level farming practices but the key

449
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,759
thing was that the Breeders produced

450
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:52,319
dwarf varieties new dwarf varieties that

451
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:54,919
had substantially improved

452
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,759
yield they they used the genes but they

453
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:58,880
didn't know what they did and it was

454
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:00,640
important to understand how we're modif

455
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,120
our crop plant at the molecular level

456
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,440
and understanding um therefore being

457
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:08,319
able to potentially use those same

458
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,320
processes in other

459
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:14,240
crops why are the DW varieties so

460
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:15,959
important well lodging is a major

461
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,558
agricultural problem lodging is when you

462
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,440
get the crop heavy crop of seeds on top

463
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:24,558
and heads and it falls over due to wind

464
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,400
rain whatever and the dwarf

465
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:29,558
varieties especially with good

466
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,440
fertilizer application lodged to a much

467
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:34,678
lesser extent than po varieties and of

468
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,798
course the putting less carbon into the

469
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:40,240
stems there's they a partition a great

470
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:41,759
proportion of carbon so you've all heard

471
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,000
of the Green Revolution and that's the

472
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:46,599
one of the key elements behind

473
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,480
it we wanted to understand what the

474
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:54,158
jeans's controlling height actually

475
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,759
did so back in the early 80s um I

476
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,159
started to collect a whole range of

477
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:00,359
dwarfing mutants and I was using P of

478
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:02,799
the

479
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:05,519
model and I could classify them into a

480
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:06,240
range of groups so there were ones that

481
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:08,440
were

482
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,038
short responded very well to the

483
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:15,200
application ofic

484
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:16,400
acid and I speculated that they were G

485
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,400
deficient

486
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,960
mutant there were some that were

487
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,440
elongated

488
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:26,319
like that responded very well to gors

489
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,679
speculated they were G over producing

490
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:32,960
plants there were ones that were the L

491
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,600
elongated didn't respond to the

492
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,278
inhibitor classifi those as G

493
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,879
constitutive LA and C have subsequently

494
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:41,919
been shown to control what are known as

495
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,400
the Dela proteins the production of Del

496
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,360
proteins which are in the signal

497
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,360
transduction pathway

498
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:54,039
from the V efficient

499
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,558
mutant short war they don't respond well

500
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:58,839
to GA they respond very well to

501
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:02,079
application steroids they have a

502
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:04,599
discrete phenotype you their lead color

503
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:09,319
Le shape stem structure is different

504
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:10,959
from the ones and these are all G

505
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:12,038
subsequently being shown to control

506
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,759
steps

507
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:16,200
Andoid

508
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:17,960
biosynthesis there are ones that control

509
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,080
the receptor

510
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:23,200
steroids and we have other mutants that

511
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:26,879
have a short bushy phenotype and are

512
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,640
involved with orm metabolism or orm

513
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,720
dection in various ways

514
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:35,480
so we we could guess at what the mutants

515
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:38,759
did but we needed to prove

516
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,360
it so if I take that first group The J

517
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:44,200
bios synthesis mutants here's the wild

518
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:47,639
type this is mle's dwarf mutant has been

519
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:50,519
used in as in crop the P crop for at

520
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:53,720
least 500 years and there are a bunch of

521
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:55,918
other ones that control other steps J bi

522
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,480
synthesis we wanted to understand

523
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,559
initially what controlled this

524
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:03,880
difference between men

525
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:03,879
dwar dant and this wild

526
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:08,519
type apologize for this slide this was a

527
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,360
first computer generated slide I ever

528
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:12,839
had made just a copy of it obviously I

529
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,678
hope my taste has improved a little

530
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:18,158
since the color those days but in the

531
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,640
literature at that time the explanation

532
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,120
for how mle's Gene was working was that

533
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,919
it could affect J levels could affect J

534
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:26,079
and

535
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:29,840
sensitivity it could be affecting a

536
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:31,038
levels another growth M hormone

537
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:33,558
it could be affecting the level of a

538
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:35,599
growth inhibitor and because of the big

539
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:37,599
difference you get during de ulation of

540
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:40,038
the plants it could be affecting po

541
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:42,000
receptor function and particularly p p

542
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:46,240
function so these were the Alternatives

543
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,240
that were in the literature in about

544
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:55,080
1982 at that stage we knew the J B

545
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:59,039
pathway went fromy phosphate through

546
00:23:55,079 --> 00:24:01,119
onine Caro acid g12 and then out um

547
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,879
through the G20 that was established

548
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:06,239
Peter worked on that and identified some

549
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,440
of the mediat in that work but we didn't

550
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,640
know anything more about it now I want

551
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,759
to talk about this little bit at the end

552
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,159
we added to this

553
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:17,960
pathway and show that in fact this these

554
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,000
are the steps that are controlled by

555
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,640
mle's Le and then I'll talk a little bit

556
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,038
about

557
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:28,840
this so the first question was were the

558
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:32,038
JS involved took the dwarf mutant apply

559
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:35,079
ga1 to it get very rapid elongation so

560
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:37,599
ga1 strongly promotes elongation but the

561
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:40,639
precursor molecule the molecule that was

562
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:42,719
at the end of the N path that stage G20

563
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,559
would not cause this

564
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,720
elongation bias which is all we had at

565
00:24:45,558 --> 00:24:52,440
that stage suggested that that the menal

566
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:55,120
mutant lacked a G1 might Peak that was

567
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,038
present in the wild type fact so that

568
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,959
was the

569
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:59,278
hypothesis and then we started to be

570
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,240
able to to

571
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:06,159
measure the levels of the hormones

572
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:09,480
using C13

573
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:12,559
labeled internal standards and indeed we

574
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:15,120
found that wild type had about 30 nog

575
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:19,440
Grand press weight of G1 and about a

576
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:22,038
tenth of that in the m so that suggested

577
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,200
to us that instead of the bio pathway

578
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:28,079
coming through here G20 and being

579
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:30,080
deactivated by two Hydrox to G29 that

580
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:32,038
there it was also possible for three of

581
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:35,119
Hydrox relation this position on the

582
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:37,558
molecule which was n to activate the

583
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:40,798
molecule and then can be subsequently

584
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:43,359
deactivated by 2 Hydrox so the

585
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:46,918
hypothesis was that mle's Gene was

586
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:46,918
blocking M was blocking this

587
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:55,640
skin so we tried to apply radio Lael G20

588
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:58,439
for the plants and then looked at what

589
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,880
was produced and the mutant G20 is

590
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,360
produced just to

591
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:07,320
G29 whereas in the wild type ga20 not

592
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:09,759
only went to G29 but it also G1 and G8

593
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:13,439
were also ched so suggested we had the

594
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:15,640
the right step the question was what was

595
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,840
the mutant doing this mutant could be

596
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,960
just a regulatory Gene could be in the

597
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:22,959
structural gene so we had to try and

598
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,960
identify the gene product of that lus

599
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,240
and now we might do this and we probably

600
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,640
give a student a month or so to get the

601
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:33,120
job done back then wasn't quite so

602
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,120
simple took us many many

603
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:38,918
years

604
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:40,639
so Dian Lester who was a postto in the

605
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:43,399
lab at the time Peter was with us on

606
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:46,399
sabatical Peter was on his paper back um

607
00:26:43,398 --> 00:26:48,398
he was with us in 9697 and this his work

608
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:51,000
that D headed up the theer was working

609
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:55,479
with us at that stage we isolated the

610
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:58,319
three o days gen by scen and then show

611
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:02,240
that the mutation in that Gene Co

612
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:06,038
segregated with M Clean so here's the

613
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:09,038
parents tall has one band dwarf has a on

614
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:13,359
mutation in it which causes two bands

615
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:16,240
pl2 and 1 K Band and then in the

616
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:19,959
segregating F3 proy and pleas that takes

617
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:22,599
about five six years to generate we um

618
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,440
could show that all the dwarf types

619
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:29,158
Offspring had the two bands whereas the

620
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,720
tall ones either had three bands hetus

621
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:34,559
or just a s band that were

622
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,240
H so it suggested we actually found the

623
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:37,440
right

624
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:40,200
Gene the final proof of course is

625
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,640
showing that that what that Gene can do

626
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:49,080
and here's um that Gene the wild Gene

627
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:54,159
was expressed in me coli with G20 and

628
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:58,480
indeed the wild typ Gene G20 to G1 but

629
00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:00,360
in mle's mutant there was some activity

630
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,399
only about a tenth of the activity you

631
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:07,359
found wild so M Le gen is a leaky three

632
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:12,278
oxid gen and we had other mutants that

633
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:12,278
in that were completely null for example

634
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,319
le2 so that's we added this step to the

635
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:23,200
pathway but nobody knew much about the

636
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:24,960
regulation of the

637
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,038
deactivation and I'd like to talk a

638
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,038
little bit about the es engine

639
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:35,039
here here it is here's wild type

640
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:37,398
seedlings they elongate very

641
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:38,919
rapidly and we identified the

642
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:42,639
appropriate

643
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:45,640
Gene and we beg ga1 in this case

644
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,759
metabolize the G8 the wild time but in

645
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:51,080
the mutant the

646
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:54,240
G1 had no activity at

647
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:56,199
all the this is for the um the genes

648
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,720
expressed in E

649
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,159
coli and reason

650
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,960
I'm talking about that this afternoon is

651
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:06,640
that was the first Gene known to affect

652
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,640
G deactivation known to control the

653
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,480
level of the bioactive molecule by

654
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,080
regulating its degradation rather than

655
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,038
its biosyn so it was an important step

656
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:19,519
at that time now of course we get takeen

657
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:19,519
for granted we just assume those

658
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:28,200
steps the question really then began we

659
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:29,960
took this slend mut

660
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,519
and crossed it to one of these jell

661
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,919
deficient mutants this one it's a very

662
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:36,640
severe mutant

663
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:39,038
na what phy would get this one over

664
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,519
producer and this one has a block on the

665
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:47,038
bi synesis when we produced

666
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:50,359
the F2 um seed and looked and selected

667
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:53,519
the double mutant it was elongated just

668
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:56,319
like the time and the question was how

669
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:59,519
could that be if this has a blockage and

670
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:01,960
biosynthesis how how this be the

671
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:05,319
hypothesis we came up with was that the

672
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:08,200
na mutation is s specific in its action

673
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:11,359
does not block G synthis of maturing

674
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:15,000
seeds and therefore these double mutant

675
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:18,398
seeds contain plenty of a

676
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,278
ga20 when they are mature and on the

677
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:24,518
germination that ga20 is metabolized to

678
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:26,319
ga1 because the foundation if that's the

679
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:28,679
case we should get a a quite strange

680
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:32,879
phenotype we grow on these lands Bel

681
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:35,200
long we did that this is what you get

682
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,320
the dou grows on it's very elongated

683
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,480
early on but then the effect from the G

684
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:45,439
carried over the seat wears

685
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:48,919
off and you get this very short to Old n

686
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,919
spe towards the

687
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:57,359
a at that time we assumed that each of

688
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,919
these steps was controlled by one G we

689
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:02,678
didn't know anything about Gene families

690
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:06,600
controlling steps in hormone

691
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:10,360
B and when we looked at the na like

692
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:12,278
genes and PS we found here's the normal

693
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:14,158
na Gene it's expressed in the stem but

694
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:17,000
it's not expressed in the developing

695
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,639
seeds and there's a second DNA like Gene

696
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,720
that is not expressed in the stem but

697
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:23,119
it's expressed heavily in the developing

698
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:27,399
seeds that explains why the seeds could

699
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:31,319
produce G but the stem couldn't and in

700
00:31:27,398 --> 00:31:34,038
the reason I put it in today is because

701
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:35,519
the NAC is to produce G and it confirmed

702
00:31:34,038 --> 00:31:37,839
the suggestion I made in that first

703
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,798
edition of that book that I Peters

704
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:43,480
published on plant hormones

705
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:46,278
that genes controlling plant hormone

706
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,200
bies can have precise tissue and AOG

707
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:49,398
geneic

708
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,679
specificity we now know that we take it

709
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:54,000
for granted most of the biosynthetic

710
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,200
pathways that control plant hormones are

711
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,159
multi have Gene families controlling

712
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:02,319
individual steps and they quite often

713
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:04,039
had quite specific um sites of action or

714
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:06,000
points in which they operate in the life

715
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:08,319
cyle it's why a small number of plant

716
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,440
hormones can control complex plan

717
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:13,398
development quite

718
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,798
precisely this piece of evidence was

719
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:17,798
important in

720
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:17,798
M

721
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,960
identification the other hormone hormone

722
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:30,679
P has been intered in right through the

723
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:33,840
early 70s was Oren and IA indic acid is

724
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:36,759
the major Oren in both

725
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:41,038
plants and the question was if I'm

726
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:42,879
saying G1 controls elongation and Peter

727
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:44,798
would have said in the early 70s that a

728
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,720
was involved in elongation how do they

729
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:49,440
interact and what I want to describe is

730
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:53,200
a little bit of work by a colleague of

731
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:55,798
mine worked in the lad H for many years

732
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:59,399
John Ross and he came up with a

733
00:32:55,798 --> 00:33:00,200
hypothesis how at least one they one of

734
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:04,319
the

735
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:08,360
way his hypothesis was that a was being

736
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:10,638
produced the leaves where it was loaded

737
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:13,759
onto the basic pedal transport stream

738
00:33:10,638 --> 00:33:18,719
for aen and flows down the stem and but

739
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:23,720
in the elongating in node Oren

740
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:27,399
controls the level of G1 by increasing

741
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:30,720
the conversion of G20 to G1 and blocking

742
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:34,678
the activation of G1 either from G1 to

743
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,679
G8 or PR from G20 to

744
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,440
G25 and he tried to test that hypothesis

745
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,600
to see I'll try to just describe it into

746
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,639
this experiment um we need to look at he

747
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:51,319
had three treatments an intact

748
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:54,839
plant plants where you

749
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:58,240
decapitated just below the Apex plants

750
00:33:54,839 --> 00:34:00,918
be decapitated and then reapply or and

751
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,720
in L and past to the cut Stu and he

752
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:07,519
measured the IIA level in those tissues

753
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,480
and if you decapitated the the pl the or

754
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:13,000
level dramatically reduced and you put

755
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,159
or back on in that on the paste as you

756
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,079
would expect the level of GA was

757
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:22,559
elevated as a

758
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:26,720
tri the question was was there a a

759
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:30,480
subsequent change also in the level of

760
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:33,118
ga1 if you look at this panel you find

761
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,000
almost exactly the same pattern as you

762
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,960
find here supporting John's view that

763
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,519
the change in a levels seen in these

764
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:46,119
treatments are affecting J G1 levels in

765
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:49,960
sh

766
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:52,639
or how's that occurring well if you look

767
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:55,720
at the two genes I described earlier the

768
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,838
L and sln gen the G3 oxid and the G2

769
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:02,159
oxid gen

770
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:03,838
intact plant in L wild typ it's highly

771
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:06,598
expressed you decapitated it's down

772
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:09,400
regulated P walks them back it's uppr

773
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:11,880
regulated and the reverse happens for

774
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,400
the deactivation Gene it's low in the

775
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,480
intact plant elevated in the decapitated

776
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:21,680
plants and then goes back down when

777
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:26,079
you apply or B to cut stum cut stump of

778
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:29,639
the um and as you can see G1 endogenous

779
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,640
level follows that pattern

780
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,839
so the point from that is that the two

781
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:37,679
growth hormones that been a lot of work

782
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:40,400
have been done treating them separately

783
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,799
they interact and one is operating

784
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,760
through the other in that particular

785
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:49,039
instance the Oren is affecting

786
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:52,280
J another question that was posed by

787
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:55,279
tavas and posed by Peter over a long

788
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:59,280
period of time was interest in how light

789
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:01,480
controls elongation during de de

790
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,560
which hormones are involved in the mid

791
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,119
1990s it considered to be the steroids

792
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:08,440
were opposed to be the ones that are

793
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:10,119
involved but it could be the jome could

794
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,880
be the AL I'll try to show you some

795
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:14,720
results and show you that it is in fact

796
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:18,680
the jome that are the primary of this

797
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:20,879
early change duration and if so how is

798
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:23,239
the plant deceiving the environment what

799
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,800
photo receptor is involved I'll try to

800
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:28,000
answer that question you remember travas

801
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,519
suggested that the environment didn't or

802
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,079
wasn't the pick for grack I try to show

803
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:33,079
you that

804
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:40,039
St I got interest in that work when I

805
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:43,159
was here on study League back in 1989

806
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:44,920
with Fred um and in Peters at that time

807
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:47,279
you had some wonderful trans jues that

808
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,920
could measure the change in PL plant

809
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,359
growth at very fine intervals and so you

810
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,920
could actually measure the change in

811
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:56,159
growth over those first 2 to 4 hours

812
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,838
after exposure of red light so the dark

813
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:01,159
plant walking on here and in red light

814
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:04,519
continuous red

815
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:07,559
light growth rate is reduced to about a

816
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:07,559
quarter of that in

817
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:14,960
the so we want to know how that happened

818
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:18,799
so I looked at again the same couple of

819
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,880
genes the deactivation Gene here in the

820
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:25,200
dark it's low and it's elevated within

821
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:27,039
half an hour transfer of light and then

822
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:30,439
stays up for a couple of hours and then

823
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:32,960
drops back to normal after about 4 hours

824
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:35,318
and the reverse happens for the menal

825
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,318
gene the synthesis Gene it's high in the

826
00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:40,279
dark half there's two dark controls here

827
00:37:38,318 --> 00:37:41,920
just to make sure the safe light is

828
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:45,400
weren't causing a

829
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:47,599
problemin half an hour drops down

830
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,400
exposure to light and then gradually

831
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,119
builds back up to normal after about 4

832
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,079
hour so there's a very rapid

833
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:57,280
transcriptional change over those first

834
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:57,280
couple first half hour

835
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:02,719
does that CH does that Ty mean there's a

836
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:05,519
change in G or in the hormone levels and

837
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:08,318
indeed here you are the hormone level

838
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:11,159
after 4 hours in red light and the wild

839
00:38:08,318 --> 00:38:12,880
type plant here it's dropped to about 1

840
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:18,358
of what it was

841
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:21,480
in and if we look at a h v mutant a 5

842
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:23,279
mutant the difference is the same but

843
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,679
you a fire a

844
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,440
m the difference has been removed

845
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:31,759
there's no signific difference in that

846
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,880
the environment is affecting

847
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,640
elongation by being perceived by

848
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:40,240
photocom a and then that changes the

849
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:43,480
level of the ga1 of hormone which then

850
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:46,039
results in change in impation so p is

851
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,719
the PO receptor involved and the reg

852
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:50,239
regulation of Light by light is

853
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:50,239
occurring

854
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:57,960
transcription and just to show you if

855
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,280
you're interested in V DRS here's the

856
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,240
cell the

857
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:05,319
manot cell here's the nucleus stain for

858
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:07,118
those same cells and we're looking here

859
00:39:05,318 --> 00:39:11,719
Pome Pi

860
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:16,240
a been labed in mon body and in the dark

861
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:17,199
in round dispersed through the cytoplasm

862
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:19,919
not

863
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:24,199
nucleus after a half an hour of red

864
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:26,559
light it has formed into Speckles and be

865
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:27,879
transported into nucleus and subsequent

866
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:30,799
sh of that's

867
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,440
part of the pathway for action and then

868
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,160
the f is

869
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:38,119
degraded and it's nearly gone by 42

870
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:40,399
hours so the pattern of change in what's

871
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:43,318
happening to P is completely consistent

872
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,318
with those other

873
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,640
results now I'm going I'm talking

874
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:51,639
probably too long but I was going to

875
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:53,519
take these this this group of slides out

876
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,719
yesterday until Peter told me that he

877
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:58,599
still wasn't absolutely convinced about

878
00:39:55,719 --> 00:40:01,399
our ultimas

879
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:03,160
so he didn't necessarily believe all the

880
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,960
all the evidence that

881
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:08,799
people so back in 2009 one of the

882
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,519
students in the lab um had this diagram

883
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,599
and there were at least five ways in

884
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:17,079
which Orson was proposed to be bi

885
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:20,760
synthesized IND 3ic acid from either

886
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:23,039
indol or tryp and the predominant

887
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:26,920
pathway in the literature at that time

888
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:29,079
was through triamine Andy Trine that was

889
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:31,639
the prop

890
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:32,920
and that was based upon the fact that

891
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:36,400
the yaka

892
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:38,480
jeans arabis have been shown or

893
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,880
suggested control the conversion of

894
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:45,280
tryptamine to an hyox

895
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:47,400
triamine and that came from work by Z in

896
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,760
2001 in science where they published

897
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,680
that this is where the yaka were

898
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,319
operating and there was a paper in MA by

899
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:56,440
declair all in

900
00:40:53,318 --> 00:41:00,318
2010 also suggesting and providing

901
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:03,159
evidence that this was the Maj part well

902
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:04,880
we tried to have a bit of a a book at

903
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:07,559
this and see whether it was the

904
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,838
same and this is one of our Brad

905
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:12,039
students na

906
00:41:08,838 --> 00:41:15,639
ti and he applied triamine and he could

907
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:18,239
not find a getting metabolized to I now

908
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:21,078
Nathan was a good synthetic chemist as

909
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:24,000
well as being a plant physiologist so he

910
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:28,240
said he set out to actually make in

911
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:31,719
hydroxy synthesiz it and didn't looked

912
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:35,118
at its mass and when you this is theic

913
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:39,598
in a hydroxy and be checked by

914
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:41,160
NR and when you look at it major and it

915
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,318
fragments to

916
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:46,279
144 when you look at say clear our paper

917
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:49,519
is

918
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:52,319
the fragment M main ir and then it

919
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:55,759
fragments give these are clearly not the

920
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:58,199
same compa so the suggestion that we

921
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:01,440
were getting was not only couldn't we

922
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:03,519
find it being metabolized me metabolized

923
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:07,240
to this compound

924
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:09,679
piece the Spectre on which this hypothy

925
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:13,358
was based appear to be

926
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:15,960
incorrect and some excellent work by a

927
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:18,639
couple of major groups elect biology

928
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:21,480
groups in the following year actually

929
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:23,799
moved the yak jees from here over to

930
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:27,760
this point controlling the conversion

931
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:31,119
indo3 gas to I with the Copan

932
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:33,160
I IA pathway being proposed as a

933
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,760
dominant

934
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:39,558
pathway and now it's s to be that

935
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:42,839
AR we wanted to again therefore check

936
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:45,800
whether this occurred in PE our model

937
00:42:42,838 --> 00:42:48,960
and John Ross again working in the lab

938
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:52,839
um collected genes to control this step

939
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:57,358
the first step of this Pathway to

940
00:42:52,838 --> 00:43:00,119
I and he obtained mutant in them and I

941
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:03,078
just want to show you that indeed this

942
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:05,640
is in developing seeds and here in the

943
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:07,000
green is the wild type and here is the

944
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:10,558
mutant in

945
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,559
purple and as you can see indeed

946
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:17,040
mutation in that a gene in that um Step

947
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:20,519
has a major effect on Oren

948
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:24,400
bios there's a complication because in

949
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:27,639
PCS the major or is in fact a for plated

950
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,240
compound not just the simple I but the

951
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:31,118
same thing is happening for a p at the

952
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:35,439
same

953
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:38,160
time so it indeed appears that the IP

954
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,159
pathway is the predominant pathway for

955
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,239
or biosythesis not only in some of the

956
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:46,239
models like arsis but it certainly

957
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:46,239
appears to be the case in Le such

958
00:43:47,318 --> 00:43:54,159
as well enough about the growth motive

959
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:57,119
hormones the other area I'd like to talk

960
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:59,838
about is the use of genetics to study PL

961
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,720
development and this is just a slide

962
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:05,318
just grab some information from the

963
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:07,759
literature over Web of Knowledge and

964
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:10,880
looked at the number of papers that were

965
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,920
talking about plant mutant by decade and

966
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,519
how they were controlling plant

967
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:18,119
development and you know back to the 50s

968
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:20,920
and 60s it was a very very small number

969
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:23,800
it was a rare techn people didn't use

970
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:27,680
it and it built during the

971
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:30,000
1970s has rapidly expanded um

972
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:32,159
you know since until these days of

973
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,838
course we take it as a matter of fact

974
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:38,239
that it's a the technique of

975
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:41,880
choice Peter and myself I started

976
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:43,719
working back in the' 70s when it was a

977
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:46,200
relatively rare technique and I'd just

978
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:48,118
like to show you and this piece of

979
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:52,039
information may only be of interest to

980
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:54,720
Peter but Peter and I I Dre my PhD I

981
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:59,039
worked on flowering control flowering

982
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:59,039
and Peter um worked on

983
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,319
genes controlling a in the end it turned

984
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,480
out that the genes were exactly the same

985
00:45:05,318 --> 00:45:10,599
je the genes that control the photo

986
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:13,240
response whether it beesing or flowering

987
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:15,800
are these genes HR

988
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:19,479
and here's a wild type plant very

989
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:22,680
similar to the wild wild relative it

990
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:24,079
branches it has no Rel Essence and it

991
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:28,279
plows very

992
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:31,480
L you mutate HR it becomes a the

993
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:33,440
branching is reduced the essence occurs

994
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:36,679
at an earlier no you can't see it here

995
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:40,400
and it flowers as a quanti day plant

996
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:43,598
this is almost a qual day and if you you

997
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,599
take s the plant becomes early flowering

998
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,318
day neutral and it will only put on a

999
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:51,039
couple of PODS before its

1000
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:52,880
nence and so these were the jeans that

1001
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:55,480
pza and a whole lot of people in this

1002
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,599
lab have worked on for many many years

1003
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,440
and we' all tried to work out what they

1004
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,800
would do and it's only really quite

1005
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:05,159
recently

1006
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:08,559
um that we have actually been able to

1007
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:12,000
find evidence out this is done by jimer

1008
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:15,000
one of my former gr students who

1009
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:18,559
worksart and we were looking he was

1010
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,719
looking and tried to isolate um the HR

1011
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:26,000
Gene and see what it did and when

1012
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:28,919
he uh looked at the expression of plot

1013
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,920
jeans

1014
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:35,599
Gene when he looked at the rhythms you

1015
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,720
got the rhythms in the wild type one

1016
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,880
transfer to constant life the Rhythm

1017
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:41,000
will keep going in constant life but in

1018
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,640
the HR

1019
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,480
mutant it is ding out almost

1020
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:49,239
immediately when you do the same thing

1021
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:52,240
and you transfer not to constant light

1022
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:55,439
but constant dark the rhym in both types

1023
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:58,838
contined so HR is needed to maintain the

1024
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,838
Rhythm under constant life

1025
00:46:59,719 --> 00:47:05,598
when he found that Gene isolated he

1026
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:09,680
found it was an or of an

1027
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:12,920
Arab Gene called early flowering free

1028
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:15,719
and you can prove that he proved that

1029
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:19,039
here we got Columbia arabidopsis elf3

1030
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:23,919
the3 mutant in arabidopsis here he's

1031
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:27,679
transformed those elf3 mutants with HR

1032
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:31,400
p and as you can see the wild time HR

1033
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:35,519
compliments the mutant and they look

1034
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:38,760
just like colb wild type if you trans

1035
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:41,280
form the three mutant with an HR mutant

1036
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:44,160
then they maintain this clearly

1037
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:47,599
demonstrating that he had the right gen

1038
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:51,159
so one of Pet's gen that was there to

1039
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:53,680
control phot peric response is in fact

1040
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:53,679
um

1041
00:47:54,760 --> 00:48:02,079
3G it's actually quite important because

1042
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:04,480
if you look at um PL genes of peas going

1043
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,920
from Wild relatives through the land

1044
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:10,358
races in Afghanistan through to those

1045
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:12,920
that are in Mediterranean and Northern

1046
00:48:10,358 --> 00:48:16,358
Europe originally you find that this

1047
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:17,639
only a single mutation that has occurred

1048
00:48:16,358 --> 00:48:21,679
in

1049
00:48:17,639 --> 00:48:24,279
HR right across that range and that HR

1050
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:27,480
mut that single hype containing the HR

1051
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:31,079
mutation has become widespread is the

1052
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:34,358
key that has allowed P to be adapted to

1053
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:37,440
Spring sign in high latitudes so it is

1054
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:39,558
actually an important Gene and it's been

1055
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,400
fundamentally used

1056
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:45,400
in the other Gene I'll go through even

1057
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:50,559
more briefly that's the day neutral Gene

1058
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:53,240
SN Wild Table with SN and again what you

1059
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:56,798
find here is the cing rhythms have been

1060
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:58,679
modified by mutation mutation in purple

1061
00:48:56,798 --> 00:49:01,000
and the Rhythm has been Advanced by

1062
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:05,399
about 6 hours

1063
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:07,880
in and when you go through the normal

1064
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:10,838
when you go through the process and

1065
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:14,280
isolate the gene you find SN is the

1066
00:49:10,838 --> 00:49:15,920
ortholog of the arabis pl Gene LS so

1067
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,240
those two genes that were controlling

1068
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:21,079
and Peter worked on right through the

1069
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:24,399
70s and 80s about % actually control

1070
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:27,280
genes fundamental to the cadan

1071
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:31,220
RH is that right Peter

1072
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:34,590
convinced yeah I'll you I'll talk you up

1073
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:34,589
[Music]

1074
00:49:34,798 --> 00:49:38,318
good the other thing that now I'm

1075
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:40,399
getting a bit more up to date with some

1076
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:42,719
of the more recent work um I've been

1077
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,200
doing in the lab my interest in the last

1078
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:47,159
few years have moved to using the

1079
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:49,399
hormone genes that we isolated and

1080
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:52,759
identified back through the 70s ' 80s

1081
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:54,838
and '90s to looking at how they affect

1082
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,319
and using them to see how other hormonal

1083
00:49:54,838 --> 00:50:00,719
processes are regulated in

1084
00:49:57,318 --> 00:50:03,480
um for example the N I talked about the

1085
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:05,719
the roots of the N quite clearly the

1086
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:09,199
roots are smaller and Shor we expected

1087
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:12,639
that but the nodulation is dramatic it's

1088
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:14,078
almost eliminated and showing that g are

1089
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:17,318
absolutely essential for some of the

1090
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,318
early stages in

1091
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:23,719
modulation we also look at other my

1092
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:27,318
horiz other soses in plant groups for

1093
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:29,480
example Bas horiz here instead of being

1094
00:50:27,318 --> 00:50:33,079
depressed as it was in that last slide

1095
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:36,318
in the na mutant the number of muscules

1096
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:38,839
to P significantly elevated that can be

1097
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:41,400
reduced or returned to normal by

1098
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:44,119
application so the gibons play a key

1099
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,240
role in regulating both nodulation and

1100
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:47,318
the muscular micro Rizal development and

1101
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:49,358
they're operating in different

1102
00:50:47,318 --> 00:50:51,079
directions so we presume they are not

1103
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:52,318
operating in the common pathway the

1104
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:54,839
controls

1105
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:57,880
both um I haven't got time to go into

1106
00:50:54,838 --> 00:51:01,039
any more details

1107
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:05,880
St most recently isolated group of

1108
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:09,759
hormones this is work done by L my so if

1109
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:14,079
you take a mutant CCV just a mutant

1110
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:17,760
Pathway to the they Branch down the

1111
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:21,160
Bas show they contain no

1112
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:23,920
me look the fungal

1113
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:25,759
structures substantially reduced aular

1114
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,760
micro Rizal development in the that's

1115
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:30,839
been known for a long that's not new to

1116
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:33,280
us but certainly what is is are also

1117
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:35,159
affecting modulation we're working on

1118
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,680
how the spaid are affecting the

1119
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:39,960
communication between the root and the

1120
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:42,078
um the Rises here and how that then

1121
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:44,318
results from different levels of

1122
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,240
modulation so that's work we're

1123
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:49,039
currently

1124
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:50,558
doing another M we just isolated

1125
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:53,239
recently P it's been know in other

1126
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,400
species but some time is line to ethine

1127
00:51:53,239 --> 00:51:56,838
in

1128
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:01,119
sensitive and as you can see here is the

1129
00:51:56,838 --> 00:52:03,000
wild type here's the I2 nodules all over

1130
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:06,400
it's almost

1131
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,599
super which is a discreete phenotype so

1132
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,079
it affects

1133
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:13,000
that that that been determined by other

1134
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:15,760
people in things like medicard before

1135
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,159
but what we were interested in is how

1136
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,960
that effect of ethine interacted with

1137
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:23,519
things like um other some other hormone

1138
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:27,559
gen for example LK is a steroid

1139
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:30,079
deficient un because of blocking steroid

1140
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:32,798
so you get a significant decline in

1141
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:36,160
nodulation when you get rid of or reduce

1142
00:52:32,798 --> 00:52:40,440
thein steroids but when you recombine it

1143
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:40,440
with the Ion 2 unit is the

1144
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:46,880
double the implication is that you get

1145
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:51,318
an elevation of nodulation back to what

1146
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:54,240
you see in i2u words I2 is static cave

1147
00:52:51,318 --> 00:52:55,079
and when we look at that and try to work

1148
00:52:54,239 --> 00:53:00,000
out

1149
00:52:55,079 --> 00:53:02,240
why it's because this plant um this

1150
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,400
plant the LK

1151
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:09,519
VI has elevated levels which would

1152
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:13,119
normally be um retarding modulation and

1153
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:18,159
when you introduce an eth sensitive M

1154
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:18,160
then the difference between the and

1155
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:26,000
wild so my current work is concentrating

1156
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:27,200
really on how the root interacts with

1157
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,079
the rise

1158
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:31,519
spere and how the hormones that we've

1159
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:34,519
looked at for a whole lot of other

1160
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:35,318
processes in the choot how they interact

1161
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:39,400
to

1162
00:53:35,318 --> 00:53:42,400
control that symbos development within

1163
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:45,720
the plant group the power and this is

1164
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:49,200
important for nut nutritional Gathering

1165
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:51,358
by the plant since the mizal development

1166
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:54,078
leads to increased phosphoros uptake and

1167
00:53:51,358 --> 00:53:56,598
the modulation leads to increased

1168
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:59,599
nitrogen uptake so we're trying to piece

1169
00:53:56,599 --> 00:54:02,000
together inside the bral plant hormones

1170
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,960
regulate these processes so that they

1171
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,358
are effective for the plant and but

1172
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,679
don't become parasi don't become get to

1173
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:11,440
the point where too much carbon is being

1174
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:11,440
lost to the

1175
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:19,440
m that's probably at least 5 minut so

1176
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:21,679
this is a photograph taken in our lb

1177
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:26,440
back our building h when Peter was with

1178
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:28,399
us back in 1996 97 um and some of the

1179
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:30,400
key people who have done the experiments

1180
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,440
that I've been going through there Dian

1181
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,798
leester did the one of the molecular

1182
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:37,318
work with the El M John Ross did a lot

1183
00:54:34,798 --> 00:54:42,039
of the or work I've been talking about

1184
00:54:37,318 --> 00:54:45,679
Jim is there did the work um on the snhr

1185
00:54:42,039 --> 00:54:47,920
the fling jeans the clock jeans um I

1186
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:51,118
think that's probably the Ian Mur is

1187
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:53,318
there who was my mentor he was the

1188
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,559
person who collected together some of

1189
00:54:53,318 --> 00:54:57,759
the mutants that I worked on the smhr

1190
00:54:55,559 --> 00:55:00,920
mutant that I worked on way back in my

1191
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:04,240
PhD so he was you know my mentor in

1192
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:06,760
getting into the use of jeans and how

1193
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:08,959
they

1194
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,960
also he well you want to go into the

1195
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,280
story he

1196
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:16,599
didatics up in Geneva and with Corell he

1197
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:19,640
met Peter at that time and in fact Peter

1198
00:55:16,599 --> 00:55:21,519
ended up being I believe my PhD examiner

1199
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:23,598
which I of course wasn't allowed to know

1200
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:26,038
at that time they have done conviction

1201
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:30,039
but subsequently obviously found out

1202
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:32,359
many many years later so it's a long

1203
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:35,520
engag and of course there's been a huge

1204
00:55:32,358 --> 00:55:40,159
number of collaborators um at Utz in our

1205
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:41,838
lab Utz as well as people all around the

1206
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:44,679
world but particularly in this audience

1207
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:46,400
obviously beat up the top and PR but I

1208
00:55:44,679 --> 00:55:50,358
had some absolutely great times out in

1209
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:53,039
Ken State uh doing some work in um down

1210
00:55:50,358 --> 00:55:55,719
cosos lab while I was here over that

1211
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:56,880
period of time so it's been a it's been

1212
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:59,639
a great

1213
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,920
um I've enjoyed the career and the work

1214
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:04,440
with Peter and it's been at the heart of

1215
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:07,480
a lot of those studies over those last

1216
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:09,639
20 or 30 years and I thank him very much

1217
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:12,960
for his contributions he's made to he's

1218
00:56:09,639 --> 00:56:15,759
been me over that time I should

1219
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,639
acknowledge the sponsors um clearly our

1220
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,200
university has supported me over a long

1221
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:22,960
period of time and the Australian

1222
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:25,118
research Council um has been like said

1223
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,960
has been providing funding to allow us

1224
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:31,559
to do this many many years so thank you

1225
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,559
very much for listening thank

1226
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:39,880
you thank you very much Jim for the

1227
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:43,000
worldwind tour through the history of

1228
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:44,838
plant hormones toxins jellin bring us up

1229
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,039
to stre with some the latest

1230
00:56:44,838 --> 00:56:49,719
developments of rhms those are all

1231
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:52,079
topics that have been GE to comp for

1232
00:56:49,719 --> 00:56:53,318
many years so that was a really great

1233
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:56,480
talk very

1234
00:56:53,318 --> 00:56:58,400
fation um we're going to take a break in

1235
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:02,318
a few minutes but anybody has any

1236
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:05,599
questions you have to entertain I got a

1237
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:05,599
comment or

1238
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:12,400
comments well I never believed the trip

1239
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:15,159
story anyway sounds like

1240
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,079
Stewart we we're coming we're coming

1241
00:57:15,159 --> 00:57:20,960
back to the

1242
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:24,839
pathway that was proposed in the

1243
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:28,838
1940s so you got all I say go and grab a

1244
00:57:24,838 --> 00:57:31,078
text from 20 8 2009 2010 and see what

1245
00:57:28,838 --> 00:57:32,920
they were talking about um it yeah

1246
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:34,720
you're absolutely right there had been

1247
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:36,480
evidence and people supporting each of

1248
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:39,279
those Pathways and that each kind of had

1249
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,400
their turn in the sun I think the

1250
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:43,400
difference is we've now isolated the

1251
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:46,358
genes in some of those Pathways we've

1252
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:47,920
been able to put those mut put mutations

1253
00:57:46,358 --> 00:57:50,598
in those genes and place them in the

1254
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,480
pathway and actually not only follow a

1255
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:54,160
change in the phenic development of the

1256
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:57,079
organism but actually monitor the

1257
00:57:54,159 --> 00:58:00,318
hormone levels and show their change and

1258
00:57:57,079 --> 00:58:03,039
um while we did that in the 80s um for G

1259
00:58:00,318 --> 00:58:05,558
and the '90s for steroids it really has

1260
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:07,799
only been in the last 8 or 10 years that

1261
00:58:05,559 --> 00:58:09,720
we've been able to do that in the same

1262
00:58:07,798 --> 00:58:13,199
way for all so even though it was the

1263
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:15,239
first hormone identified and we we

1264
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:17,480
really should have known how it was

1265
00:58:15,239 --> 00:58:19,879
biosynthesized years ago it's really

1266
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:23,920
only in the last few years it's become

1267
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:27,000
an hour I'm just going to do a quick

1268
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:29,760
introduction uh first person really show

1269
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:33,039
the pathway of Orin in Roots which is

1270
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:35,119
now Central and he also did orx in

1271
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:37,960
biosynthesis in Roots my first

1272
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:39,160
undergraded student Eric Mitchell you

1273
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:43,119
stand up

1274
00:58:39,159 --> 00:58:43,118
Eric who's now come

1275
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:52,400
back Eric Eric is an

1276
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:55,039
MD pathologist but uh we nearly got him

1277
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,720
to go into plant Sciences but medicine

1278
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:59,839
called

1279
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:02,719
well I I actually did I I was another

1280
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:04,199
student and I collaborated and we

1281
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:06,679
decided that if I went into medicine and

1282
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:10,879
got the money we can start our own

1283
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:10,879
land but then I get married

1284
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:22,798
and I probably not qualified to ask

1285
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:25,599
questions about plant

1286
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:26,599
biology when I left a while ago grabing

1287
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:28,599
o

1288
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:30,798
key model organism so I'm interested to

1289
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:32,680
hear how much work you've done with P to

1290
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:37,119
elate these

1291
00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:39,159
mechanisms some of that workis as well

1292
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:41,880
okay genetic

1293
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:44,118
genetics um there was a period of at

1294
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:46,640
least a decade where the field was

1295
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:48,838
dominated by the molecular advantages of

1296
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:51,440
arabidopsis and there's no doubt for

1297
00:59:48,838 --> 00:59:54,239
example when we pulled out that G3 oxid

1298
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:56,358
Gene I talk about M gene the there had

1299
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:57,798
been we would not have been able pull

1300
00:59:56,358 --> 01:00:00,318
that Gene out unless somebody had

1301
00:59:57,798 --> 01:00:02,559
identified previously in our that there

1302
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:05,719
was in fact a gene that controled free

1303
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:08,240
oxidation um and so we were able to to

1304
01:00:05,719 --> 01:00:10,399
pull it out so um a lot of with Jim

1305
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:12,598
Will's work um the recent work there on

1306
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,599
the flowering as I said they were had

1307
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:17,280
already been been identified as CL gen

1308
01:00:14,599 --> 01:00:20,000
and arabidopsis we now have a we have a

1309
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:23,200
sequence for metac cargo he he got the

1310
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:26,199
SE P sequences out of met of cargo and

1311
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:28,798
then bought the sequences out of P we

1312
01:00:26,199 --> 01:00:30,639
had the mutants um we didn't know what

1313
01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:33,000
the J structure was but he was able to

1314
01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:36,558
prove it by actually going back and

1315
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:39,119
finding mutations in the homo Arab so

1316
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:41,880
Arab opsis in terms of being able to

1317
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:45,838
allow us to advance this molecular front

1318
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:47,480
was fundamental for at least 10 15 years

1319
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:49,440
we're getting to the stage now we've got

1320
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:52,679
enough other genome sequences that we

1321
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:55,240
can start to um work from those species

1322
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:56,798
in their own right and if you might ask

1323
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:59,239
why do I work on

1324
01:00:56,798 --> 01:01:03,038
symbiosis what don't Arab what doesn't

1325
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:05,199
Arab dois do it doesn't form symbiosis

1326
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:08,599
so the obvious reason if you want to

1327
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:10,519
stay working on your favorite model is

1328
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:12,400
to actually look at developmental

1329
01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:14,639
processes that are important in

1330
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,318
agriculture important um developmental

1331
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:18,838
process but things that do not happen in

1332
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:21,440
AR I guess you'd have to say that's why

1333
01:01:18,838 --> 01:01:24,279
we're now working in that area of my

1334
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,639
it's an area that um you have to have

1335
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:30,160
theuts and you have to be working in a

1336
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:32,759
species that um has the symbos and leg

1337
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:35,679
units have the advantage they have both

1338
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:38,680
modulation and

1339
01:01:35,679 --> 01:01:40,679
mizon therefore they are a really good

1340
01:01:38,679 --> 01:01:43,078
model to doing some of the basic um

1341
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:45,118
moleular work so that's why we that's

1342
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:47,559
why we where we are at one well some of

1343
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:49,400
us are very attached to PE I've work

1344
01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:53,278
with P soes it's good to see that

1345
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:53,278
they're robust to be used in

1346
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,599
research any other questions

1347
01:01:56,599 --> 01:02:00,000
thoughts

1348
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:03,318
comments okay we have about 25 minutes

1349
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,838
or so to have some refreshment and uh

1350
01:02:03,318 --> 01:02:07,038
each other so let's take a break and

1351
01:02:04,838 --> 01:02:09,599
we'll get

1352
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:12,480
back it's my pleasure now to introduce

1353

Cales plenty of water and an unbeatable

1368
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:54,480
intellectual environment who can argue

1369
01:02:51,798 --> 01:02:57,358
with that she remain in

s's interacted with

1395
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:02,119
Peter first time was as a grad student

1396
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:05,679
Peter's plant growth regulator's

1397

graduate level module in the fall of

1398
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:10,639
2001 she's gone on to work with Peter in

1399
01:04:08,318 --> 01:04:12,519
international programs as well has

1400
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:15,118
contributed to lectures for Peter's

1401

social issues and biology

1402
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:21,240
class and she's also been on the faculty

1403
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:23,119
team along with Peter Ron hering that

1404
01:04:21,239 --> 01:04:25,719
has explored the

1405
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:28,079
GMO Sarah with your common interest

1406
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:30,838
interest in collaboration with Peter on

1407
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:33,599
his activities written to act byot Tech

1408
01:04:30,838 --> 01:04:34,519
policy public understanding it's big to

1409
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:37,599
add here

1410
01:04:34,519 --> 01:04:40,318
today and your talk to as you can see

1411
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:42,039
global aspects of PL biote technology

1412
01:04:40,318 --> 01:04:45,719
thank you

1413
01:04:42,039 --> 01:04:49,160
br it's an honor to be here and to be

1414
01:04:45,719 --> 01:04:51,199
asked to celebrate um fin retirement in

1415
01:04:49,159 --> 01:04:54,598
this capacity and this is an area that

1416
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:57,439
Peter and I share a real interest in um

1417
01:04:54,599 --> 01:05:00,359
Peter has been a great mentor and source

1418
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:02,039
of support for me as Fred mentioned uh

1419
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:05,759
for many years and in many different

1420
01:05:02,039 --> 01:05:08,480
capacities both as a graduate student um

1421
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:10,160
he was always that faculty member who

1422
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:12,599
made sure all the graduate students had

1423
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:14,798
a place to go for Thanksgiving um

1424
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:18,240
invited us over to his home Etc and that

1425
01:05:14,798 --> 01:05:20,440
means a lot to our students and it's

1426
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:24,038
been an honor to teach with Peter in

1427
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:26,400
more recent years and of

1428
01:05:24,039 --> 01:05:29,599
course of course

1429
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,599
the remote doesn't work

1430
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:39,960
right okay and of course he was also one

1431
01:05:36,159 --> 01:05:43,519
of our um real supporters as a fellow

1432
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:46,798
graduate student involved T La Ashley M

1433
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:49,519
and I uh delayed and procrastinating

1434
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:51,599
procrastinated writing our PhD Theses

1435
01:05:49,519 --> 01:05:56,159
and launched a roller

1436
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:59,838
derby Peter was one of our founding fans

1437
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:01,519
always a great um color of support it is

1438
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:04,000
a little bit overwhelming and maybe

1439
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:07,000
humbling to speak on this particular

1440
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,239
issue because Peter is probably one of

1441
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:12,039
the most

1442
01:06:09,239 --> 01:06:14,639
um well one of the best people in the

1443
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:17,559
world to address this very topic Global

1444
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:22,038
aspects of biology so I'm I'm a little

1445
01:06:17,559 --> 01:06:24,519
um humbled but I will la in here so I

1446
01:06:22,039 --> 01:06:26,359
think um many of you can appreciate the

1447
01:06:24,519 --> 01:06:29,440
genetically engineer crops are being

1448
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:31,798
grown around the world 12% of the crop

1449
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:34,559
land globally is zwn with genetically

1450
01:06:31,798 --> 01:06:36,119
engineered crops there's about 10 crops

1451
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:39,119
that have been commercialized and are

1452
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:41,559
out there eight of them are GR in the US

1453
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:44,680
the US is the largest producer of

1454
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:47,278
genetically engineered crops um we we

1455
01:06:44,679 --> 01:06:49,399
produce the most Brazil follows that

1456
01:06:47,278 --> 01:06:52,960
Argentina India which Ron will probably

1457
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:55,240
talk a bit about today and then

1458
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,240
Canada you can see in this graph that

1459
01:06:55,239 --> 01:06:59,558
many of you may be familiar with um

1460
01:06:57,239 --> 01:07:03,038
there's about 180 million hectares stwn

1461
01:06:59,559 --> 01:07:05,599
toic engineer crops today in about 28

1462
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:07,359
different countries and about 5 years

1463
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:09,480
ago the number of Hector grown in

1464
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:12,199
developing countries exceeded developed

1465
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:14,519
countries and of those 18 million

1466
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:17,838
Farmers growing engineered crops the

1467
01:07:14,519 --> 01:07:21,559
majority are farmers in developing

1468
01:07:17,838 --> 01:07:25,038
countries however um despite this

1469
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:27,039
widespread um relative success of CH

1470
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:29,039
engineer CRS there really aren't very

1471
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:32,079
many genetically engineered crops out

1472
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:35,680
there in terms of diversity so soybean

1473
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:38,240
comprises 50% of that heage um maze is

1474
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:40,919
30% add in cotton and you're at

1475
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:42,779
95% and uh if you add canola that

1476
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:44,318
comprises 99% of the

1477
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:46,839
[Music]

1478
01:07:44,318 --> 01:07:48,199
totals that are planted today and so

1479
01:07:46,838 --> 01:07:52,000
what this suggests to me is that there's

1480
01:07:48,199 --> 01:07:54,239
a real lost opportunity to um use these

1481
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,599
tools of plant science and plant

1482
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:59,399
breeding to improve some of the

1483
01:07:56,599 --> 01:08:01,880
important crops that are out there in

1484
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:03,519
security crops and really highly

1485
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:07,000
nutritious

1486
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:09,960
crops in a similar vein too few traits

1487
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,639
have actually been deployed so uh over

1488
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,639
half of the jally engineered crops that

1489
01:08:12,639 --> 01:08:15,199
have

1490
01:08:13,639 --> 01:08:18,920
cultivated

1491
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:21,880
are haveing to tra herbicide tolerance

1492
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:26,279
Round Up ready as we s commonly hear it

1493
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:28,319
um and the um other uh dominant trait is

1494
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:31,400
herbicide tolerance and if you combine

1495
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:34,480
those two things together you have

1496
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:38,238
covered about close to 100% of the props

1497
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:40,238
that so again two uh little diversity of

1498
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:43,519
CRS that have been able to benefit from

1499
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:48,718
these tools and too few traits um that

1500
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:52,880
are actually look some Farmers I think

1501
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:52,880
yeah what is the reason for the

1502
01:08:53,679 --> 01:09:00,759
dip uh developed resistance is probably

1503
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:02,359
overall the um the the uh number of

1504
01:09:00,759 --> 01:09:04,198
hectors of genetically engineered crops

1505
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:05,838
di this year for the first time from

1506
01:09:04,198 --> 01:09:10,358
2014 to

1507
01:09:05,838 --> 01:09:13,880
2015 and um there of course uh Earth

1508
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:16,550
crops have we heard a lot

1509
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:18,319
about taking overt field for

1510
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:21,079
[Music]

1511
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:23,000
example

1512
01:09:21,079 --> 01:09:26,439
[Music]

1513
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:29,479
sou away

1514
01:09:26,439 --> 01:09:32,198
to Sarah can I

1515
01:09:29,479 --> 01:09:35,039
jump now that we've had the wine you can

1516
01:09:32,198 --> 01:09:37,000
jump in all you want and and and and if

1517
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:41,238
you and if we had more wine we can start

1518
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,238
to debate whether or not plant hormones

1519
01:09:42,198 --> 01:09:49,479
exist that diagram or this graph is

1520
01:09:46,198 --> 01:09:52,879
herbicide tolerance only insect

1521
01:09:49,479 --> 01:09:56,839
resistance only and more and more now

1522
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:59,640
are combining the two that is stack

1523
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:02,199
trades that means both together so

1524
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:05,079
you'll see stack trades things by to

1525
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:07,559
jump up as the other two go down that's

1526
01:10:05,079 --> 01:10:10,439
because they're growing combination much

1527
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:12,400
more oh more there were price changes

1528
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:15,319
over time so a lot of cornland went to

1529
01:10:12,399 --> 01:10:16,559
wheat so there's every year Farmers that

1530
01:10:15,319 --> 01:10:19,039
and we don't have any genetically

1531
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,039
modified

1532
01:10:19,319 --> 01:10:27,359
wheat so I think um most people in our

1533
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:28,479
society today know um the reasons um why

1534
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:30,279
we don't have more genetically

1535
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:32,158
engineered crops out there in the hands

1536
01:10:30,279 --> 01:10:34,079
of farmers um there's been a lot of

1537
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:36,839
controversy around this technology and

1538
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:39,198
unlike the field of plant hormones not

1539
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:41,560
much has changed uh over the last decade

1540
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:44,000
or two in terms of conversations around

1541
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:46,600
act biot technology and this is despite

1542
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,800
that nearly every highly reputable

1543
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:51,880
scientific organization in the world has

1544
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:54,679
um endorsed the safety of genetically

1545
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:56,760
engineered crops um over and over again

1546
01:10:54,679 --> 01:10:58,840
for s years not the least of which is

1547
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:01,039
the recent study by the National Academy

1548
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:03,480
of study of Sciences that came out a

1549
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:05,719
couple of weeks ago that again

1550
01:11:03,479 --> 01:11:07,479
emphasized that there's no substantiated

1551
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:09,439
evidence of a difference in risks to

1552
01:11:07,479 --> 01:11:11,759
human health between conventionally DED

1553
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:13,559
props and genetically engineered props

1554
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,760
and they did not find in this study any

1555
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:18,719
conclusive cause and effect evidence of

1556
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:21,800
environmental problems from

1557
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:24,399
props even the Girl Scouts have taken a

1558
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:27,400
strong stand for science on this issue

1559
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:29,879
when they were Meed um a year and a half

1560
01:11:27,399 --> 01:11:31,960
or so ago to remove genetically

1561
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:34,159
engineered ingredients from their

1562
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:36,158
cookies that they're so famous for they

1563
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:38,399
took a stand and cited worldwide

1564
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:40,158
scientific support to safety of

1565
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:42,158
currently commercialized ingredients

1566
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:44,679
derived from genetically agricultural

1567
01:11:42,158 --> 01:11:47,439
props and they went on to say that in

1568
01:11:44,679 --> 01:11:49,719
the future GMOs may actually offer a way

1569
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:53,279
to help feed our ever increasing

1570
01:11:49,719 --> 01:11:56,158
population Hill girls um there have been

1571
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:58,039
a few studies published that have

1572
01:11:56,158 --> 01:11:59,719
suggested that there are risks to

1573
01:11:58,039 --> 01:12:01,800
genetically engineered CRS and I think

1574
01:11:59,719 --> 01:12:06,279
the most famous of which is the serini

1575
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:09,119
study um but that study was retracted um

1576
01:12:06,279 --> 01:12:12,559
after it was published in 2012 it got

1577
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:15,519
some it got some play it um had Major

1578
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:17,520
Impact on some policy in in in various

1579
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:20,040
countries around the world and then was

1580
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:22,639
later retracted but it wasn't retracted

1581
01:12:20,039 --> 01:12:25,359
before as I say it had some some pretty

1582
01:12:22,639 --> 01:12:27,639
serious implications um not the least

1583
01:12:25,359 --> 01:12:30,759
which was the effect it had on policy

1584
01:12:27,639 --> 01:12:33,400
making in Kenya where there was a b put

1585
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:35,679
into place on import of genetically

1586
01:12:33,399 --> 01:12:38,638
engineered um props and genetically

1587
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:41,600
engineered food and despite the fact

1588
01:12:38,639 --> 01:12:42,719
that the serini paper has um been

1589
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:45,239
retracted

1590
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:49,719
in there's a long list of ways in which

1591
01:12:45,238 --> 01:12:51,919
it was flawed um this B remains in place

1592
01:12:49,719 --> 01:12:54,960
it's also had impact in countries like

1593
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:59,039
Uganda where um groups like a that have

1594
01:12:54,960 --> 01:13:02,560
been campaigning against the um uh the

1595
01:12:59,039 --> 01:13:07,880
use of genetically engineered crops um

1596
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:10,039
have cited this study and I will and and

1597
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:12,440
and they even go further um so I'm going

1598
01:13:10,039 --> 01:13:14,639
to play this action a is an

1599
01:13:12,439 --> 01:13:16,919
international charity raising tens of

1600
01:13:14,639 --> 01:13:18,920
millions of pounds a year to alleviate

1601
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:21,880
poverty and end

1602
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:25,158
Hunger in Uganda as a bill was being

1603
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:29,119
debated to allow GM crops action a ug

1604
01:13:25,158 --> 01:13:31,679
Ganda ran this radio act for a week in

1605
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:34,479
2013 did you know that genetically

1606
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:36,880
modified organisms are organisms made in

1607
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:39,359
the laboratory by Crossing genes from

1608
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:43,639
different species such products cause

1609
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:47,639
health risks such as cancer infertility

1610
01:13:43,639 --> 01:13:50,159
Etc single study Ling G with cancer in

1611
01:13:47,639 --> 01:13:53,119
rats was discredited by the European

1612
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:56,439
Food Safety Authority a different study

1613
01:13:53,119 --> 01:13:59,639
suggesting a link to infertility withraw

1614
01:13:56,439 --> 01:14:03,119
so this gentleman in the red sweater is

1615
01:13:59,639 --> 01:14:04,199
the former director of Green Peace UK

1616
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:06,000
the course Green Piece is an

1617
01:14:04,198 --> 01:14:09,158
organization that's campaigned against

1618
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,719
jally engine CRS for a number of

1619
01:14:09,158 --> 01:14:14,719
years this message is brought you by

1620
01:14:11,719 --> 01:14:18,800
action a Uganda protecting our health

1621
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:18,800
environment and Farmers right to

1622
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:26,359
seed

1623
01:14:20,679 --> 01:14:30,359
well that is really shocking to be

1624
01:14:26,359 --> 01:14:31,880
scare muming about health risks

1625
01:14:30,359 --> 01:14:36,639
particularly

1626
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:40,960
cancer with no scientific justification

1627
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:40,960
for me that is

1628
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:49,119
totally so I I share that example of a

1629
01:14:46,279 --> 01:14:51,880
way in which the serini paper has had

1630
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:55,158
impact on um policy and decision making

1631
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:56,920
in Uganda but I also share it because I

1632
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:59,279
think it's really encouraging that

1633
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:02,239
people like the former director of

1634
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:05,359
Greenpeace are actually starting to come

1635
01:15:02,238 --> 01:15:08,559
around um and nuan their position on G

1636
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:11,399
crops and I think I think we're at a t

1637
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:14,400
point and we may we may be experiencing

1638
01:15:11,399 --> 01:15:16,479
um a turning of the ties if you will um

1639
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:20,359
around around the conversation around G

1640
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:21,879
crops globally I'm also encouraged by

1641
01:15:20,359 --> 01:15:24,198
people like this woman in this

01:15:24,198 --> 01:15:30,279
she's the minister agriculture there and

1644
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:32,800
she has stood very firm um in in her in

1645
01:15:30,279 --> 01:15:34,679
her support of uh genetically engineered

1646
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,159
props and ensuring that farmers in

1647
01:15:34,679 --> 01:15:39,440
Bangladesh one of the world's most

1648
01:15:36,158 --> 01:15:41,920
vulnerable countries um have access to

1649
01:15:39,439 --> 01:15:44,079
this technology so she pushed for the

1650
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:46,760
approval of BT bringel in

1651
01:15:44,079 --> 01:15:49,279
2013 and that uh material was made

1652
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:52,199
available to Farmers a small group of

1653
01:15:49,279 --> 01:15:54,599
farmers of about 20 farmers and you can

1654
01:15:52,198 --> 01:15:57,000
see see that ceremony here and this

1655
01:15:54,600 --> 01:16:01,159
gentle in Monsour SAR car was one of the

1656
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:03,000
first farmers one that first 20 um who

1657
01:16:01,158 --> 01:16:06,960
received the seed for genetically

1658
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:10,520
engineer uh BT brel so the eggplant as

1659
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:13,719
we call it here so in 2014 he planted a

1660
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:16,120
small quar hectare plot of this ET

1661
01:16:13,719 --> 01:16:18,119
bringel and was rewarded shortly

1662
01:16:16,119 --> 01:16:20,840
thereafter with a prop that he could

1663
01:16:18,119 --> 01:16:22,158
then Market as CTI side free BT of

1664
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:26,360
course

1665
01:16:22,158 --> 01:16:29,799
um is um the that reduces insecticide

1666
01:16:26,359 --> 01:16:32,079
use in in these in these

1667
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:35,159
contexts so when growing conventional

1668
01:16:32,079 --> 01:16:38,079
eggplant he had to spray his crop twice

1669
01:16:35,158 --> 01:16:40,119
a week um sometimes as much as twice a

1670
01:16:38,079 --> 01:16:42,238
day under heavy um

1671
01:16:40,119 --> 01:16:45,399
infestations and now he doesn't have to

1672
01:16:42,238 --> 01:16:47,158
do that and so he sees this both um as

1673
01:16:45,399 --> 01:16:49,679
an economic benefit as well as an

1674
01:16:47,158 --> 01:16:51,479
environmental benefit he and his wife

1675
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:53,840
and his daughter E eggplant two to three

1676
01:16:51,479 --> 01:16:55,839
times per week and the money that they

1677
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:58,000
earn from eggplant um helps him to

1678
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:00,800
support his family and importantly send

1679
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:03,479
his girls to school his neighbor's

1680
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:05,880
eggplant at this time I'm sure he has

1681
01:17:03,479 --> 01:17:08,718
better seed now but at this time um when

1682
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:10,400
the seed was originally released um he

1683
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:12,840
was still growing conventional eggplant

1684
01:17:10,399 --> 01:17:16,719
in this roock was little bit p and not

1685
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:18,880
fit for sale or for eating so the stakes

1686
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:21,000
here are are pretty high I plan the

1687
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:23,600
South Asia's first uh genetically

1688
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:25,719
engineered food crop it was developed by

1689
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:28,239
public sector scientists and really

1690
01:17:25,719 --> 01:17:29,560
intended for resource cor Farmers like

1691
01:17:28,238 --> 01:17:32,399
monster

1692
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:34,440
SAR and his story I think is really

1693
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:37,759
remarkable because it's a case where one

1694
01:17:34,439 --> 01:17:41,238
single a Innovation and strong political

1695
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:43,239
will uh on the part of NAA chav um have

1696
01:17:41,238 --> 01:17:45,678
really offered him the chance to greatly

1697
01:17:43,238 --> 01:17:47,599
improve his livelihood and the lives of

1698
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:49,639
his daughters and that could ultimately

1699
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:53,000
break their poverty

1700
01:17:49,639 --> 01:17:55,199
cycle his story however should not be so

1701
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,119
exceptional and the case of BT br that

1702
01:17:55,198 --> 01:17:59,439
we all like to talk about and celebrate

1703
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:01,880
should not be so exceptional there are a

1704
01:17:59,439 --> 01:18:03,879
lot of products um in the pipeline in

1705
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:05,840
late stages of development that have

1706
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:07,560
been developed not by the Monsanto of

1707
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:09,800
the world but by public sector

1708
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:13,080
institutions in the US and around the

1709
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:15,279
world um that that that that that are

1710
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:17,760
quite promising so products like

1711
01:18:15,279 --> 01:18:18,439
biofortified bananas being developed um

1712
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,960
in

1713
01:18:18,439 --> 01:18:22,559
Uganda products like these nutrient-rich

1714
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:25,600
Tomatoes being developed by a public

1715
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:28,080
sector institution in the UK plant dried

1716
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,880
fish oils being Abed in camelina another

1717
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:33,319
project happening in the public sector

1718
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:36,199
in the UK Lake light resistant

1719
01:18:33,319 --> 01:18:38,158
potatoes cold cows so these are cows

1720
01:18:36,198 --> 01:18:40,399
that have been genetically changed to

1721
01:18:38,158 --> 01:18:42,719
not grow horns which eliminates the

1722
01:18:40,399 --> 01:18:45,839
inhume process of dehorning so this

1723
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:48,920
addresses a real animal welfare issue

1724
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:51,920
insect resistant cow this is a a major

1725
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:55,158
food security crop in countries of West

1726
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:58,679
Africa and biofortified or virus res in

1727
01:18:55,158 --> 01:19:02,119
casava to name just a few examples um so

1728
01:18:58,679 --> 01:19:05,158
it's it's my hope that while we in in

1729
01:19:02,119 --> 01:19:07,279
this country sit around um the luxury of

1730
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:10,399
debating whether or not we want to label

1731
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:12,479
our Foods as containing GM or non GM

1732
01:19:10,399 --> 01:19:16,079
this technology doesn't bypass Farmers

1733
01:19:12,479 --> 01:19:17,119
like Jima uh this pav farmer in Uganda

1734
01:19:16,079 --> 01:19:20,238
who in

1735
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:22,519
2016 still struggles to cultivate a crop

1736
01:19:20,238 --> 01:19:25,638
that is technically under domestication

1737
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:28,840
it could use um Improvement

1738
01:19:25,639 --> 01:19:32,400
tools it's my hope that in four years or

1739
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:35,400
5 years I can be telling jima's success

1740
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:38,000
story um in which she's had the option

1741
01:19:35,399 --> 01:19:39,839
to choose whether or not she wants to

1742
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,439
grow genetically engineered products and

1743
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:43,679
whether she thinks it's technology is

1744
01:19:41,439 --> 01:19:46,039
something that will benefit her family

1745
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:48,679
and that that choice isn't made by

1746
01:19:46,039 --> 01:19:52,079
organizations uh like action a and that

1747
01:19:48,679 --> 01:19:55,039
are based to wellfed countries like the

1748
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:56,880
UK I think it's also really important um

1749
01:19:55,039 --> 01:20:00,039
and particularly in the context of

1750
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:02,039
Cornell that we ensure that scientists

1751
01:20:00,039 --> 01:20:04,600
around the world have access to the

1752
01:20:02,039 --> 01:20:07,158
tools that they need to innovate to meet

1753
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:09,679
the great challenges that we face today

1754
01:20:07,158 --> 01:20:11,279
um we we've seen what's happened with GM

1755
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:13,399
and there's new tools coming along and

1756
01:20:11,279 --> 01:20:16,039
we need to make sure that we don't uh

1757
01:20:13,399 --> 01:20:17,599
lose access to those tools as well so we

1758
01:20:16,039 --> 01:20:19,560
need to make sure the public sector

1759
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,400
scientists can use these tools to

1760
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:23,960
innovate scientists like Ellison Ben

1761
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:26,559
enman from UC Davis who's been

1762
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:29,239
responsible for the the old C work that

1763
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:32,679
I mentioned scientists like Chuck mayard

1764
01:20:29,238 --> 01:20:34,718
and Bill Powell up the road at sunf and

1765
01:20:32,679 --> 01:20:36,719
they've taken a gene from wheat and

1766
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:39,399
moved it into Chestnut to protect

1767
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:41,800
Chestnut from the devastating BL that

1768
01:20:39,399 --> 01:20:44,079
has for the last 100 years or so

1769
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:46,600
decimated nearly every American chestnut

1770
01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:49,760
tree on the planet so they're using this

1771
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:52,159
technique to hopefully reintroduce a

1772
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:54,960
near extinct species into the forest of

1773
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:57,719
the eastern US scientists like Tony

1774
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:59,960
Shelton one of our own entomologists

1775
01:20:57,719 --> 01:21:02,480
here at Cornell who's using genetically

1776
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:04,359
engineered insects to reduce past

1777
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:07,119
populations for cavage growers in New

1778
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:08,238
York state without the need for

1779
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:10,920
excessive

1780
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:13,399
insecticides again real environmental

1781
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:15,600
benefit scientists like Andrew kagundu

1782
01:21:13,399 --> 01:21:18,238
from the national agricultural research

1783
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:19,920
program in Uganda and he's taken a gene

1784
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:22,399
from sweet pepper to protect his

1785
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:25,639
country's starchy banana staple b m

1786
01:21:22,399 --> 01:21:28,599
banana from bacterial will

1787
01:21:25,639 --> 01:21:30,639
disease so it's scientists and Farmers

1788
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:32,600
like these who I've I've talked about in

1789
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:34,440
in the first few minutes of my talk that

1790
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:36,400
have really inspired us to build the

1791
01:21:34,439 --> 01:21:38,359
Cornell Alliance for science um the

1792
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:40,359
initiative that frig mentioned that

1793
01:21:38,359 --> 01:21:42,439
we're leading there and our mission

1794
01:21:40,359 --> 01:21:45,079
really is to promote access to

1795
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:47,399
scientific innovation access to choose

1796
01:21:45,079 --> 01:21:49,238
to use these Innovations as a means of

1797
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:51,479
enhancing food security improving

1798
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:55,119
environmental sustainability and really

1799
01:21:51,479 --> 01:21:56,678
improving lives globally

1800
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:59,079
and we think biotechnology is an

1801
01:21:56,679 --> 01:22:00,840
important part of that so in our first

1802
01:21:59,079 --> 01:22:03,920
year we're relatively new organization

1803
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:06,039
just 2 years old founded in 2014 and in

1804
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:08,359
our first year we really um focused our

1805
01:22:06,039 --> 01:22:10,719
efforts around this Central pillar of

1806
01:22:08,359 --> 01:22:14,599
access to Innovation um but following

1807
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:17,119
the success of cop 21 we um are now

1808
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:20,360
launching a new uh Global dialogue

1809
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:24,760
around the climate change and Central to

1810
01:22:20,359 --> 01:22:28,399
this dialogue is is um helping explore

1811
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:29,880
how this technology or new um Precision

1812
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:33,158
breing Technologies that are coming

1813
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:36,920
online might help us mitigate and adapt

1814
01:22:33,158 --> 01:22:41,399
to climate change so we we Face a steep

1815
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:45,158
climate challenge that of um improving

1816
01:22:41,399 --> 01:22:48,960
um improving the environment uh reducing

1817
01:22:45,158 --> 01:22:51,279
poverty and increasing food security uh

1818
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:52,800
while ensuring that the global

1819
01:22:51,279 --> 01:22:55,000
temperature does not increase by more

1820
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:57,079
than 1.5 to 2°

1821
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,920
and that's impossible if we don't make

1822
01:22:57,079 --> 01:23:02,079
major strides in agricultural

1823
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:04,760
Innovation so we are out there in the

1824
01:23:02,079 --> 01:23:07,600
world our Communications team um talking

1825
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:09,600
to to Farmers to scientists to Consumers

1826
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,679
to policy makers about how they think

1827
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:14,039
this technology is playing a role in

1828
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:15,679
helping them deal with climate change

1829
01:23:14,039 --> 01:23:18,238
and there's some really interesting

1830
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:20,760
stories out there stories of adaptation

1831
01:23:18,238 --> 01:23:23,079
like the BT bringel that I talked about

1832
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:25,239
um water efficient maze for Africa is

1833
01:23:23,079 --> 01:23:27,158
another great case but there's also

1834
01:23:25,238 --> 01:23:29,399
stories of mitigation so projects that

1835
01:23:27,158 --> 01:23:32,719
are looking at developing nitrogen use

1836
01:23:29,399 --> 01:23:36,079
efficient props or nothing reducing

1837
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:39,079
rice the other piece of this um climate

1838
01:23:36,079 --> 01:23:41,840
for change initiative that we're leading

1839
01:23:39,079 --> 01:23:44,639
is to continue to use our training

1840
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:46,600
programs to develop champions for Change

1841
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:48,960
and we have um two different training

1842
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:51,320
approaches with the alliance for science

1843
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:53,719
one is a 12we program that happens here

1844
01:23:51,319 --> 01:23:55,679
for now many of you probably met our our

1845
01:23:53,719 --> 01:23:59,239
two our Ina World cohort when they came

1846
01:23:55,679 --> 01:24:00,639
last year these are champions from all

1847
01:23:59,238 --> 01:24:02,119
kinds of different walks of life

1848
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:04,480
different countries 10 countries who

1849
01:24:02,119 --> 01:24:06,479
were represented last year who all feel

1850
01:24:04,479 --> 01:24:09,238
passionate about um this issue of

1851
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:11,959
ensuring choice and and access to to

1852
01:24:09,238 --> 01:24:14,718
improve modern act Technologies and they

1853
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:17,520
want to ensure that they can bring that

1854
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:19,920
house to their own home countries so who

1855
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:23,080
are these people um a few examples this

1856
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:24,719
is re Reverend father no El par he was

1857
01:24:23,079 --> 01:24:26,559
one of our fellows that came here to

1858
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:29,279
Cornell last fall he's a priest of the

1859
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:30,880
Roman Catholic church and he came to

1860
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:33,000
this issue of of

1861
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:36,199
biotechnology um when he asked himself

1862
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,880
the question how can I expect people to

1863
01:24:36,198 --> 01:24:40,759
come to church on Sunday and praise and

1864
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,880
worship God when they're hungry admired

1865
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:45,159
in

1866
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:48,039
poverty this is clui Mas Masa from

1867
01:24:45,158 --> 01:24:49,920
Uganda he's a sorghum breeder and he was

1868
01:24:48,039 --> 01:24:51,960
also one of our fellows last year and he

1869
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:54,760
asserts that every other field every

1870
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:57,319
professional field is taking advantage

1871
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:58,960
of scientific advancements and there

1872
01:24:57,319 --> 01:25:00,840
should be no exception in plant breeding

1873
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,840
so why is it that the tools plant

1874
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:04,960
breeders have or plant scientists have

1875
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:06,480
are are being so politicized to the

1876
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:10,920
point where they aren't able to use them

1877
01:25:06,479 --> 01:25:13,599
to serve um as Farmers or jie Kamya

1878
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:16,399
she's um the daughter of a farmer from

1879
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,920
Hawaii one of the first farmers to adopt

1880
01:25:16,399 --> 01:25:19,519
the genetically engineered virus

1881
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:22,760
resistance papaya that was developed

1882
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:25,719
here at Cornell and growing up she saw

1883
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:28,560
firsthand how does technology could

1884
01:25:25,719 --> 01:25:30,560
positively impact small Family Farms

1885
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:32,280
like hers and she wants to ensure that

1886
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:35,000
other small Family Farms are around the

1887
01:25:32,279 --> 01:25:37,759
world and also benefit from this

1888
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:39,880
technology so that's a sense of who our

1889
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:42,480
fellows are I was going to show a short

1890
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:44,039
film about them I'm not sure if I have

1891
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:46,309
time

1892
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:48,319
um

1893
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:51,800
[Music]

1894
01:25:48,319 --> 01:25:53,799
yeah and the the your job in this film

1895
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:57,679
is not only to enjoy it but to try to

1896
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:57,679
find Peter davies's Cameo

1897
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:02,260
[Music]

1898
01:26:12,198 --> 01:26:22,000
appearance money my name

1899
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:26,158
is I'm father Al par my name is James

1900
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,158
FY from the

1901
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:35,010
my name is Li I am Jason Merkley my name

1902
01:26:32,118 --> 01:26:39,279
is a my name

1903
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:43,079
[Music]

1904
01:26:39,279 --> 01:26:45,960
is when I was a student in college uh I

1905
01:26:43,079 --> 01:26:48,840
became an activist fighting a

1906
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:51,679
dictatorship I was with flight farmers

1907
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:53,520
and laborers and they were so poor so I

1908
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:57,399
kept on thinking how could I help these

1909
01:26:53,520 --> 01:27:00,320
people it's um really very painful when

1910
01:26:57,399 --> 01:27:02,359
you see families that cannot afford to

1911
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:06,198
feed themselves at least three

1912
01:27:02,359 --> 01:27:08,759
times it's ironic that farmers the very

1913
01:27:06,198 --> 01:27:10,599
people who tilt the soil to produce food

1914
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:12,600
are the same people who experience

1915
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:14,800
hunger we're not just talking about

1916
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:16,800
American consumers here that have plenty

1917
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:19,360
to eat we're talking about people in

1918
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:22,360
food insecure regions who have nothing

1919
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:25,920
to eat but a small handful of rice every

1920
01:27:22,359 --> 01:27:30,559
day my story is De my story she's one of

1921
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:33,920
those small older casaba Farmers casaba

1922
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:38,199
a major food security C is under Threat

1923
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:42,000
by two major viruses this is very

1924
01:27:38,198 --> 01:27:44,638
devastating all the treat all the had

1925
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:48,000
virus in his heartbreaking for him he

1926
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:50,520
said I was so scared Jo I was so scared

1927
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,000
that we l everything traditional ways of

1928
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:54,840
farming in my

1929
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:57,399
country are just not enough to be able

1930
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:59,800
to Fe the many and I think the science

1931
01:27:57,399 --> 01:28:04,158
and technology that is happening our

1932
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:07,760
midst could be a solution to that indeed

1933
01:28:04,158 --> 01:28:10,039
biot technology can be of help to

1934
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:13,800
solving some of these problems and

1935
01:28:10,039 --> 01:28:17,719
therefore if this technology is adopted

1936
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:21,800
by the I think it can help them BR and

1937
01:28:17,719 --> 01:28:26,118
it's my from conviction that is a

1938
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:29,600
fundamental right Farmers to have access

1939
01:28:26,118 --> 01:28:32,679
to various farming options it seems very

1940
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:35,199
cruel to deny that technology those

1941
01:28:32,679 --> 01:28:37,279
people who are in such desperate need

1942
01:28:35,198 --> 01:28:39,719
access to biotechnology is really a

1943
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:42,599
social justice

1944
01:28:39,719 --> 01:28:44,439
issue being a part of the first batch of

1945
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:47,079
cohorts of the Corell Alliance for

1946
01:28:44,439 --> 01:28:50,118
science is truly a very rewarding

1947
01:28:47,079 --> 01:28:53,039
experience for me this is a

1948
01:28:50,118 --> 01:28:56,039
completely unique problem as they say

1949
01:28:53,039 --> 01:28:58,039
here in America a there was really a

1950
01:28:56,039 --> 01:29:00,238
science to communication and I knew that

1951
01:28:58,039 --> 01:29:01,760
I needed to learn that so when I found

1952
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:03,879
out about this program and that

1953
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,600
opportunity to learn more about how to

1954
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:07,800
communicate science I couldn't do

1955
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:10,360
anything but jump at the opportunity and

1956
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:11,119
there was a completely new approach how

1957
01:29:10,359 --> 01:29:13,799
what

1958
01:29:11,118 --> 01:29:15,719
theying I got interested in this program

1959
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:17,960
because it was an Avenue for me to

1960
01:29:15,719 --> 01:29:20,800
improve on my communication skills in

1961
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:22,679
the area of Agriculture bi technology my

1962
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:25,960
participation in this is hopefully to

1963
01:29:22,679 --> 01:29:28,359
empower need to speak up and get others

1964
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:31,359
to speak up in support of this

1965
01:29:28,359 --> 01:29:34,519
interacting with experts agronomists

1966
01:29:31,359 --> 01:29:36,960
scientists forers policy makers

1967
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:39,840
journalists commitment and

1968
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:43,158
dedication can actually help someone to

1969
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:45,400
get father and proove a point and

1970
01:29:43,158 --> 01:29:48,319
there's such a rich exchange of

1971
01:29:45,399 --> 01:29:52,399
knowledge and wisdom and the friendship

1972
01:29:48,319 --> 01:29:52,399
we're becoming like um brothers and

1973
01:29:52,479 --> 01:29:58,638
sisters because I strongly believe that

1974
01:29:55,359 --> 01:30:02,759
science can be a key in solving hunger

1975
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:06,279
malci and poverty I can do it alone I

1976
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:09,520
cannot succeed on my own all by myself

1977
01:30:06,279 --> 01:30:12,439
this why I realize the need to unite the

1978
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:14,040
need to engage in the need to empower a

1979
01:30:12,439 --> 01:30:16,759
network of

1980
01:30:14,039 --> 01:30:19,920
Partners right now I really feel

1981
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:22,960
empowered right now I am more confident

1982
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:25,480
in engaging the public in scientific

1983
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:27,920
undertakings isn't Fascination and

1984
01:30:25,479 --> 01:30:30,599
Discovery wonderful this is one of the

1985
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:33,199
best experiences that I will ever had in

1986
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:33,199
my entire

1987
01:30:33,479 --> 01:30:41,718
life so um that was the 2015 cohort they

1988
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:44,279
went home in November and we've just

1989
01:30:41,719 --> 01:30:46,198
selected and invited the 2016 cohort

1990
01:30:44,279 --> 01:30:48,319
will come here in August they're coming

1991
01:30:46,198 --> 01:30:52,198
from there's 10 coming from countries

1992
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:54,799
across Latin America um three um fellows

1993
01:30:52,198 --> 01:30:56,399
from China and about team fellows coming

1994
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:58,560
from different countries in subsaharan

1995
01:30:56,399 --> 01:31:00,879
Africa so I hope that those of you who

1996
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:03,560
are on campus will come out and and meet

1997
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:06,079
them when when they arrive so since

1998
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:08,600
returning home fellows like Modesta who

1999
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:10,760
you saw in the video have gone home and

2000
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:13,039
they've recruited five to six um

2001
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:15,000
additional Champions who share her

2002
01:31:13,039 --> 01:31:17,479
mission of ensuring the Nigerian Farmers

2003
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:20,439
have access to biotechnology access to

2004
01:31:17,479 --> 01:31:24,158
choose this she's recruited them in into

2005
01:31:20,439 --> 01:31:26,079
her um her her initiative um these six

2006
01:31:24,158 --> 01:31:28,399
Champions then attended our short course

2007
01:31:26,079 --> 01:31:29,920
in Tanzania that we held in March and

2008
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:31,638
then they went home and and recruited

2009
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:33,719
two three four more people and so you

2010
01:31:31,639 --> 01:31:36,279
can see how very quickly someone like

2011
01:31:33,719 --> 01:31:38,880
Modesta becomes a very catalytic um

2012
01:31:36,279 --> 01:31:42,039
Champion for change through this um

2013
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:43,960
program so as the alliance for science

2014
01:31:42,039 --> 01:31:46,198
here at Cornell we're really trying to

2015
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:48,920
engage um individuals and organizations

2016
01:31:46,198 --> 01:31:52,238
who share our mission and want to extend

2017
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:54,480
and lend their voice to um to our our

2018
01:31:52,238 --> 01:31:57,000
Global um Collective

2019
01:31:54,479 --> 01:31:59,158
and so I encourage any of you who share

2020
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:01,359
who share this Mission and passion that

2021
01:31:59,158 --> 01:32:03,879
that Peter and I do um to to join our

2022
01:32:01,359 --> 01:32:05,719
alliance we have now engaged people

2023
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:08,079
through our efforts in over half of the

2024
01:32:05,719 --> 01:32:09,800
world's countries um and I and I think

2025
01:32:08,079 --> 01:32:11,760
we're really building something um

2026
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:13,920
that's important in ensuring that

2027
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:16,039
science and evidence guide decision-

2028
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:19,920
making

2029
01:32:16,039 --> 01:32:22,198
globally that said the reality still is

2030
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:23,480
that too few products have come out of

2031
01:32:22,198 --> 01:32:24,960
the public sector and we're still

2032
01:32:23,479 --> 01:32:27,678
dealing with that situation that only

2033
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:29,239
four cops have been using those tools

2034
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:30,960
and of course we like to talk about

2035
01:32:29,238 --> 01:32:33,718
Dennis and and the papaya that was

2036
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:35,359
developed Cornell that's the only case

2037
01:32:33,719 --> 01:32:38,880
where something has come out of the US

2038
01:32:35,359 --> 01:32:41,079
land gr system and I hope that that that

2039
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:42,159
will change um because that's I think

2040
01:32:41,079 --> 01:32:43,800
this is really something that's

2041
01:32:42,158 --> 01:32:45,479
consistent with our land gr Mission and

2042
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:47,440
I think as scientists it's really

2043
01:32:45,479 --> 01:32:49,559
important to step up and can take a

2044
01:32:47,439 --> 01:32:51,678
stand for Science and not get run over

2045
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:54,039
by people who are making a living um

2046
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:55,600
spreading fear about biotechnology so we

2047
01:32:54,039 --> 01:32:57,639
need to invest in the research we need

2048
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:59,159
to invest in capacity building both in

2049
01:32:57,639 --> 01:33:01,239
terms of scientists as well as

2050
01:32:59,158 --> 01:33:03,479
communicators we need to engage with our

2051
01:33:01,238 --> 01:33:05,000
communities and hopefully we can

2052
01:33:03,479 --> 01:33:07,959
ultimately improve the policy

2053
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:09,920
environments um that will inspire a

2054
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:12,399
change in the conversation around I

2055
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:13,960
technology and ultimately more of this

2056
01:33:12,399 --> 01:33:17,198
technology can be in the hands of

2057
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:19,039
farmers so my appeal to you scientists

2058
01:33:17,198 --> 01:33:21,158
in the room is to really you know look

2059
01:33:19,039 --> 01:33:22,719
up from the bench and and realize that

2060
01:33:21,158 --> 01:33:25,879
we need to do things differently so we

2061
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:28,560
sort of lost it on on GM and there's all

2062
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:30,800
of these really exciting

2063
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:32,760
transformational uh Technologies coming

2064
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:33,840
down the pipeline or that are here and

2065
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:36,079
and we need to make sure that those

2066
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:38,600
don't get demonized in the same way that

2067
01:33:36,079 --> 01:33:41,359
GM has and I think this is where we can

2068
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:43,320
all get inspiration from Peter because

2069
01:33:41,359 --> 01:33:45,639
he's done a remarkable job in the last

2070
01:33:43,319 --> 01:33:48,039
few years of doing just this both on

2071
01:33:45,639 --> 01:33:51,079
campus through his courses it's been

2072
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:53,359
said a few times today how much impact

2073
01:33:51,079 --> 01:33:55,279
he's had in in wrestling with and the

2074
01:33:53,359 --> 01:33:56,719
the tough issues with students here on

2075
01:33:55,279 --> 01:33:59,880
campus through the social issues in

2076
01:33:56,719 --> 01:34:01,039
Biology class and also the GMO debate

2077
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:03,000
but also through his Jefferson

2078
01:34:01,039 --> 01:34:05,039
fellowship and through his volunteer

2079
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:07,840
work after the Jefferson Fellowship he's

2080
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:10,880
really circled the globe from lvia to

2081
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:12,440
botsuana to India helping people

2082
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:14,000
understand this technology so that they

2083
01:34:12,439 --> 01:34:15,919
can make their own informed

2084
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:19,520
science-based choices about whether it's

2085
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:21,440
good for their country or not so I take

2086
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:23,199
inspiration from Peter I encourage you

2087
01:34:21,439 --> 01:34:26,519
to join the alliance and then I wouldn't

2088
01:34:23,198 --> 01:34:29,238
be doing my job if I didn't promote our

2089
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:31,880
new moo massive open online course that

2090
01:34:29,238 --> 01:34:33,559
Ron and I have been um developing in

2091
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:35,400
connection with Patrice from ma of

2092
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:39,520
Technologies who's here and Becca

2093
01:34:35,399 --> 01:34:42,000
Harrison who's here um in the third grow

2094
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:45,119
also members of the Muk team so this is

2095
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:47,960
a massive open online course that uh

2096
01:34:45,118 --> 01:34:49,559
we've been develop developing over

2097
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:52,600
several months that'll launch September

2098
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:55,239
13th and anybody anywhere in the world

2099
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:58,199
can take this Cornel course an internet

2100
01:34:55,238 --> 01:34:59,799
connection and access to a computer um

2101
01:34:58,198 --> 01:35:02,719
so I'm going to play our trailer and

2102
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:02,719
this is going to be the perfect

2103

01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:44,158
this the GMO Muk team has come together

2114
01:35:42,118 --> 01:35:46,039
from different backgrounds bringing

2157
01:37:47,238 --> 01:37:52,799
ignited by the intense controversy

blls with Peter's interest in public in

01:38:39,319 --> 01:38:43,679
the policy and public

2178
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:45,719
perception it's very fitting that you're

2179
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:48,599
speaking today and thank you very much

2180
01:38:45,719 --> 01:38:48,599
for contributing to the

2181
01:38:51,118 --> 01:38:57,439
S can we do a hand off for a little

2182
01:38:55,399 --> 01:39:00,279
T

2183
01:38:57,439 --> 01:39:02,678
um well it's a it's a real honor and

2184
01:39:00,279 --> 01:39:05,359
privilege to be here uh I didn't I

2185
01:39:02,679 --> 01:39:08,840
wasn't told to would be molecules but

2186
01:39:05,359 --> 01:39:11,000
otherwise I'm okay um you know Peter and

2187
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:13,319
Sarah as well as shantu shant who

2188
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:16,238
sitting right here have helped me as a

2189
01:39:13,319 --> 01:39:19,519
social scientist understand what is one

2190
01:39:16,238 --> 01:39:23,598
of the more bizarre political phenomena

2191
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:25,400
in the world and that's the GMO debate

2192
01:39:23,599 --> 01:39:27,440
that it's really very interesting that

2193
01:39:25,399 --> 01:39:29,559
there should be a debate about

2194
01:39:27,439 --> 01:39:33,238
biotechnology and everybody asked are

2195
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:35,320
you Pro or anti and students have

2196
01:39:33,238 --> 01:39:38,559
decided to drop the course in part

2197
01:39:35,319 --> 01:39:39,799
because all the profs are pro GMO it's a

2198
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,760
very bizarre thing you think like

2199
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:43,639
there's a course on like uh I don't know

2200
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:45,880
computer technology or cell phone

2201
01:39:43,639 --> 01:39:48,039
technology or something and people say

2202
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:51,159
are you for it or get it it's a very

2203
01:39:48,039 --> 01:39:53,719
bizarre position but Sarah and Peter and

2204
01:39:51,158 --> 01:39:56,079
people like shantu off Cornell campus

2205
01:39:53,719 --> 01:39:58,719
have helped me as a social scientist

2206
01:39:56,079 --> 01:40:01,359
understand this now my position on this

2207
01:39:58,719 --> 01:40:05,920
is kind of the obverse of

2208
01:40:01,359 --> 01:40:09,479
s Sarah is a very hopeful person and I

2209
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:12,158
cheer on her hopefulness and indeed uh

2210
01:40:09,479 --> 01:40:15,198
contribute periodically to being uh part

2211
01:40:12,158 --> 01:40:19,479
of a hopeful campaign um for Farmer

2212
01:40:15,198 --> 01:40:21,479
Choice informed choice and defeating Mis

2213
01:40:19,479 --> 01:40:24,399
information that is contrary to public

2214
01:40:21,479 --> 01:40:27,559
good all for all of those good goals I

2215
01:40:24,399 --> 01:40:30,799
periodically write such things um in

2216
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:33,360
that regard on the other hand I don't

2217
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:36,960
think the picture is quite as rosy and

2218
01:40:33,359 --> 01:40:39,279
I'm going to give the flip on right uh

2219
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:41,079
what Sarah told you about the advantages

2220
01:40:39,279 --> 01:40:44,399
and the possibilities and the science

2221
01:40:41,079 --> 01:40:46,399
communication runs counter to a lot of

2222
01:40:44,399 --> 01:40:48,679
what we know about science communication

2223
01:40:46,399 --> 01:40:51,039
and risk so I'm going to talk more about

2224
01:40:48,679 --> 01:40:53,960
the flip side there's benefit side to

2225
01:40:51,039 --> 01:40:56,158
biotechnology there's also a course of

2226
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:58,800
risk and that discourse is politically

2227
01:40:56,158 --> 01:41:00,479
powerful so I'm doing plant politics and

2228
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:03,320
I hadn't thought about plant politics

2229
01:41:00,479 --> 01:41:07,879
much till as asked to uh to be part of

2230
01:41:03,319 --> 01:41:09,840
this um so here's Michael pollen who

2231
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:11,319
really thinks plants have politics

2232
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:13,400
Michael po must to tell us that all

2233
01:41:11,319 --> 01:41:15,359
these plants have convinced human beings

2234
01:41:13,399 --> 01:41:17,960
to give them special privileges Politics

2235
01:41:15,359 --> 01:41:20,198
as who gets what and how so all of these

2236
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:22,359
plants have qualities like sweetness

2237
01:41:20,198 --> 01:41:25,719
Beauty intoxication that have caused

2238
01:41:22,359 --> 01:41:28,799
human beings to to protect them and

2239
01:41:25,719 --> 01:41:30,599
invest in them and improve them uh and

2240
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:32,159
of course he periodically backs off from

2241
01:41:30,599 --> 01:41:33,440
that CU he knows a little bit of Science

2242
01:41:32,158 --> 01:41:35,158
and so he backs off and says well

2243
01:41:33,439 --> 01:41:37,638
actually plants don't have much

2244
01:41:35,158 --> 01:41:39,638
Consciousness but this is the the burden

2245
01:41:37,639 --> 01:41:42,079
of a botney of desire and then Michael

2246
01:41:39,639 --> 01:41:44,480
Colin's great question of the battle

2247
01:41:42,079 --> 01:41:47,319
between the trees and the grasses the

2248
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:49,118
dominance of the earth is human beings

2249
01:41:47,319 --> 01:41:51,399
that of course have intervened on the

2250
01:41:49,118 --> 01:41:52,880
side of the grasses uh to defeat the

2251
01:41:51,399 --> 01:41:54,679
trees and that that is kind of the

2252
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:57,880
nature of the development of nature on

2253
01:41:54,679 --> 01:42:00,440
the planet now plant politics though you

2254
01:41:57,880 --> 01:42:03,279
know my a palici side human beings do

2255
01:42:00,439 --> 01:42:06,118
plant politics and there have always

2256
01:42:03,279 --> 01:42:08,439
been kind of demon plants this is this

2257
01:42:06,118 --> 01:42:11,639
is there are dozens of such things I

2258
01:42:08,439 --> 01:42:14,198
didn't know you injected THC but but uh

2259
01:42:11,639 --> 01:42:17,199
this is the um weed with fots in hell

2260
01:42:14,198 --> 01:42:19,799
and there have always been kind of a

2261
01:42:17,198 --> 01:42:22,079
classification of plants politics of

2262
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:24,760
categorization of plants as uh

2263
01:42:22,079 --> 01:42:26,559
unacceptable or acceptable and of course

2264
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:29,760
the British Empire I did this because

2265
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:33,920
Peter of course uh British Empire um

2266
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:38,000
profited enormously by using opium as uh

2267
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:40,880
and its progeny for control of much of

2268
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,840
Asia um so but here I want to point out

2269
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:46,599
we're talking about the effects of

2270
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:48,960
plants so both marijuana and opium have

2271
01:42:46,599 --> 01:42:52,119
definable effects that you may approve

2272
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:53,679
of or disapprove of but uh we have a new

2273
01:42:52,118 --> 01:42:57,319
set of plant Poli

2274
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:59,760
this is the new set the J GMOs it's an

2275
01:42:57,319 --> 01:43:01,359
apocalyptic version oh by the way I'm

2276
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:03,440
Sarah talked about the alliance for

2277
01:43:01,359 --> 01:43:05,960
science I'm actually wearing thei for

2278
01:43:03,439 --> 01:43:07,638
Science and uh I'm wearing a jacket

2279
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:10,000
because Peter every time I se him

2280
01:43:07,639 --> 01:43:14,400
lecture wees wears a jacket I thought i'

2281
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:17,279
don't be dressed can't wear a tie this

2282
01:43:14,399 --> 01:43:20,559
so anyway um so this is the the new

2283
01:43:17,279 --> 01:43:23,800
plant controversy and what's important

2284
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:27,280
is that unlike opium or marijuana the

2285
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:30,719
entire category of GMOs what is a GMO

2286
01:43:27,279 --> 01:43:33,238
anyway the entire category turns on how

2287
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:36,118
the plant got the traits that it had

2288
01:43:33,238 --> 01:43:39,198
it's not the products of the plant or

2289
01:43:36,118 --> 01:43:41,759
the safety of the plant per se it's the

2290
01:43:39,198 --> 01:43:43,279
process that produced it and two of the

2291
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:46,400
most important elements here of course

2292
01:43:43,279 --> 01:43:47,880
are the hubris they're playing God uh

2293
01:43:46,399 --> 01:43:50,799
and they're shoving it down your throat

2294
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:52,199
it's just a dimension of power so that's

2295
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:54,880
the kind of opposition this is a

2296
01:43:52,198 --> 01:43:58,839
Biblical response genic in Third Edition

2297
01:43:54,880 --> 01:44:01,520
by the way um now there's the darker

2298
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:03,400
side which is an attack on science this

2299
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:05,280
is biotech genocide Monsanto

2300
01:44:03,399 --> 01:44:07,879
collaborators there's a list of Monsanto

2301
01:44:05,279 --> 01:44:09,359
collaborators who are targeted for death

2302
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:12,199
and the Nazi Legacy of science

2303
01:44:09,359 --> 01:44:15,920
justification for murder um and this is

2304
01:44:12,198 --> 01:44:17,678
a health Ranger in natural news right so

2305
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:19,800
that dichotomy of the natural and the

2306
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:21,599
unnatural and the health Ranger who

2307
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:26,760
watches out for dangerous things like

2308
01:44:21,599 --> 01:44:29,039
plate is part the discourse now um this

2309
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:31,960
is this is of course the the other kind

2310
01:44:29,039 --> 01:44:34,079
of critique that GMOs in the third world

2311
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:36,359
cause Farmers to commit suicide this is

2312
01:44:34,079 --> 01:44:39,519
a very very powerful discourse and it it

2313
01:44:36,359 --> 01:44:41,920
won't go away it turns out that um it's

2314
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:43,920
it's simply changing its form and

2315
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:47,639
changing its shape but this discourse of

2316
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:49,639
farmer disaster will not going okay so

2317
01:44:47,639 --> 01:44:52,279
here's our University course and we we

2318
01:44:49,639 --> 01:44:54,400
took this question on and it's evolved

2319
01:44:52,279 --> 01:44:56,800
over time but uh you see the the

2320
01:44:54,399 --> 01:44:59,158
different departments that have have

2321
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:01,960
sponsored this course and we try to take

2322
01:44:59,158 --> 01:45:04,759
on the GMO debate to talk about science

2323
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:07,000
in society and how science is accepted

2324
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:08,920
in society what are the cost and

2325
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:11,000
benefits of technological change so

2326
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:14,399
that's the core of the

2327
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:16,599
course now uh the props diverge in this

2328
01:45:14,399 --> 01:45:19,920
course but the students fail to notice

2329
01:45:16,599 --> 01:45:22,279
this is not surprising Peter Davies says

2330
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:24,880
um people just don't understand the

2331
01:45:22,279 --> 01:45:26,800
science this is his his shtick with the

2332
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:28,520
state department right you guys have got

2333
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:30,880
to understand the science and he has

2334
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:33,040
huge amounts of science behind him it

2335
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:36,118
says there's really nothing to worry

2336
01:45:33,039 --> 01:45:38,880
about no problem here right Ron Herring

2337
01:45:36,118 --> 01:45:42,839
says it's not about the science it's

2338
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:44,800
about politics and that the whole debate

2339
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:47,719
has more an Nation remember the uh the

2340
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:50,239
notion of of truthiness remember coar to

2341
01:45:47,719 --> 01:45:52,599
coar whe there truthiness rather than

2342
01:45:50,238 --> 01:45:56,079
facticity so it's not about facts it's

2343
01:45:52,599 --> 01:45:59,400
not about evidence is about truthiness

2344
01:45:56,079 --> 01:46:02,679
now this is this is a much stronger

2345
01:45:59,399 --> 01:46:04,319
claim to make right now do you realize

2346
01:46:02,679 --> 01:46:05,880
what's happening to the Republican party

2347
01:46:04,319 --> 01:46:08,679
in this

2348
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:11,039
country right has anyone ever stopped to

2349
01:46:08,679 --> 01:46:12,319
ask um whether or not Mexican

2350
01:46:11,039 --> 01:46:13,840
immigration in the United States is

2351
01:46:12,319 --> 01:46:16,960
increasing or decreasing it's decreasing

2352
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:19,159
dramatically right has anyone ever asked

2353
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:23,198
this guy well anyway I w't go on about

2354
01:46:19,158 --> 01:46:25,039
it but the fact is that the facticity

2355
01:46:23,198 --> 01:46:26,919
has completely disappeared from the

2356
01:46:25,039 --> 01:46:30,840
majority of Republican primary voters

2357
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:34,079
believe Barack Obama is not an American

2358
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:36,599
Citi 70% believe Muslims should be

2359
01:46:34,079 --> 01:46:39,399
banned from this country so there's

2360
01:46:36,599 --> 01:46:42,000
there's an incredible amount

2361
01:46:39,399 --> 01:46:44,799
of truthiness substitute me for

2362
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:47,960
facticity where so the first plant

2363
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:50,360
causes whole politics is why did rdna

2364
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:53,239
crops become framed as a separate

2365
01:46:50,359 --> 01:46:55,039
category law trade social movements

2366
01:46:53,238 --> 01:46:57,399
consumer Behavior international

2367
01:46:55,039 --> 01:46:59,238
relations where other applications of

2368
01:46:57,399 --> 01:47:01,079
the same technology were normalized

2369
01:46:59,238 --> 01:47:04,799
Pharmaceuticals vaccines Industrial

2370
01:47:01,079 --> 01:47:07,559
Products evaluated by product not by

2371
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:10,079
process right so what I want to claim

2372
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:13,000
here is the GMO was a brilliant

2373
01:47:10,079 --> 01:47:15,399
political invention it loaded one

2374
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:17,920
concept with all of the risk and

2375
01:47:15,399 --> 01:47:19,238
disutilities that you could imagine and

2376
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:21,800
Sarah mentioned some of them there's

2377
01:47:19,238 --> 01:47:24,519
sort of cancer and there's there's

2378
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:26,199
sterility and and all all the incredible

2379
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:30,599
numberers of things that GMO has caused

2380
01:47:26,198 --> 01:47:33,198
autism so I'm spectum down um but

2381
01:47:30,599 --> 01:47:37,159
excludes all of the clearly definable

2382
01:47:33,198 --> 01:47:42,238
benefits such as higher Farm deals or uh

2383
01:47:37,158 --> 01:47:44,079
in recant fical um improve products so

2384
01:47:42,238 --> 01:47:47,678
science and plan

2385
01:47:44,079 --> 01:47:50,118
politics what do we know about politics

2386
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:51,359
um science across the board is

2387
01:47:50,118 --> 01:47:54,960
inherently

2388
01:47:51,359 --> 01:47:57,000
L the think about global warming classic

2389
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:59,439
science commits itself to tentative

2390
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:01,399
conclusions it won't give you a bumper

2391
01:47:59,439 --> 01:48:04,279
sticker the certainty of kind of bumper

2392
01:48:01,399 --> 01:48:06,679
sticker epistemology is restricted to

2393
01:48:04,279 --> 01:48:08,359
the non-scientific Community uh

2394
01:48:06,679 --> 01:48:10,639
scientists expensive and scientists are

2395
01:48:08,359 --> 01:48:13,118
not this interested right uh scientists

2396
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:15,480
disagree the inevitability of fringe

2397
01:48:13,118 --> 01:48:18,399
science we saw sarin's work it's been

2398
01:48:15,479 --> 01:48:21,279
tremendous if you ask how many citations

2399
01:48:18,399 --> 01:48:23,638
are there to sarin's article about rats

2400
01:48:21,279 --> 01:48:26,000
with tumors compared to Peter work on PL

2401
01:48:23,639 --> 01:48:29,118
home hormones I'll tell you a secret

2402
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:31,800
serini wins hands down by huge

2403
01:48:29,118 --> 01:48:35,479
quantities so scientists disagree in the

2404
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:37,880
inevitability of fringe science makes it

2405
01:48:35,479 --> 01:48:39,519
possible for people to say well not all

2406
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:41,480
scientists think global warming is

2407
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:46,560
happening not all scientists think it's

2408
01:48:41,479 --> 01:48:49,598
human induced um and then finally um is

2409
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:52,880
policy makes impossible knowledge hands

2410
01:48:49,599 --> 01:48:55,760
to disprove negatives no scientist will

2411
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:57,639
tell you there cannot be a Black Swan no

2412
01:48:55,760 --> 01:49:00,159
scientist is going to tell you no one

2413
01:48:57,639 --> 01:49:02,239
will ever discover an allergen in some

2414
01:49:00,158 --> 01:49:04,960
trans Gene that was produced that was

2415
01:49:02,238 --> 01:49:06,919
put into a crop the fields that cannot

2416
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:08,960
happen simply because the nature of the

2417
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:11,560
epistemology and science so you're

2418
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:13,639
disadvantaged politically you know uh

2419
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:16,480
the the environment Minister of India

2420
01:49:13,639 --> 01:49:18,840
and turning down BT bringel said I want

2421
01:49:16,479 --> 01:49:20,399
absolute certainty that nothing could go

2422
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:23,319
wrong with this plant and of course you

2423
01:49:20,399 --> 01:49:25,879
can never have absolute certainty in any

2424
01:49:23,319 --> 01:49:28,439
scientific process then finally

2425
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:30,840
institutions are not trusted um Nina

2426
01:49:28,439 --> 01:49:32,598
feder off probably many of you know n

2427
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:36,840
federov said in her presidential address

2428
01:49:32,599 --> 01:49:38,679
the tri a that I am scared to death of

2429
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:42,920
the anti-science movements all around

2430
01:49:38,679 --> 01:49:45,158
the world and it's it's true okay so um

2431
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:47,920
so this is this is the kind of worry

2432
01:49:45,158 --> 01:49:51,319
about science is sort of using people as

2433
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:53,560
guinea pigs right that what we know is

2434
01:49:51,319 --> 01:49:56,880
based on a knowledge that is not

2435
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:59,440
complete every scientist being honest

2436
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:01,239
admit it's not complete it's tenative

2437
01:49:59,439 --> 01:50:03,719
tomorrow a new study could show that we

2438
01:50:01,238 --> 01:50:05,799
were wrong about something so this this

2439
01:50:03,719 --> 01:50:08,920
cute kid is he's not a scientific

2440
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:11,000
experience stop do those now here this

2441
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:14,118
gets back to the serini

2442
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:17,479
sty people are also convinced that there

2443
01:50:14,118 --> 01:50:19,920
are thumbs on the scales right that

2444
01:50:17,479 --> 01:50:22,118
professional journals are edited by

2445
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:24,199
people who are part of networks which is

2446
01:50:22,118 --> 01:50:26,559
true part of networks I made it in two

2447
01:50:24,198 --> 01:50:28,879
journals we're part of networks in which

2448
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:32,159
we know who to send papers to to get the

2449
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:34,118
response we want right so peer review

2450
01:50:32,158 --> 01:50:36,638
doesn't necessarily tell us very much

2451
01:50:34,118 --> 01:50:39,439
sarin's work on rap tumors which is

2452
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:41,920
total rubbish total rubbish was

2453
01:50:39,439 --> 01:50:43,839
peerreview a peerreview journal not a

2454
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:47,239
high status Journal but a peerreview

2455
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:49,560
journal so this this goes uh this is in

2456
01:50:47,238 --> 01:50:50,279
from the Harald in Edinburgh a couple

2457
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:53,079
years

2458
01:50:50,279 --> 01:50:55,639
ago study suggesting genetic modified

2459
01:50:53,078 --> 01:50:57,639
food kill of rats has been suppressed by

2460
01:50:55,639 --> 01:50:59,840
lobing and Multinational biotech

2461
01:50:57,639 --> 01:51:02,359
corporations environmental campaigners

2462
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:04,840
claim so there's a thumb on the scale

2463
01:51:02,359 --> 01:51:06,920
that that science is produced by the

2464
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:09,279
very corporations that benefit from the

2465
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:12,319
bad science that they produce that's a

2466
01:51:09,279 --> 01:51:16,039
widely shared uh view of how science

2467
01:51:12,319 --> 01:51:18,559
Works uh so let's just think about this

2468
01:51:16,039 --> 01:51:21,439
Division I made between green biotech

2469
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:23,000
which is food and red biotech which is

2470
01:51:21,439 --> 01:51:25,118
medicine

2471
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:27,920
Pharmaceuticals and vaccines things of

2472
01:51:25,118 --> 01:51:31,559
that sort so look about the the risk

2473
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:33,480
utility balance virtually all of

2474
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:35,960
Technology change and Technology

2475
01:51:33,479 --> 01:51:38,559
politics revolves around some balance

2476
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:40,639
between risk and utility think about

2477
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:42,079
flying an airplane or surgery or any of

2478
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:43,760
those things do we know the risk try to

2479
01:51:42,078 --> 01:51:45,880
figure the risk you know the utilities

2480
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:48,520
and try to figure the disutilities and

2481
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:52,319
then you make a decision so the risk in

2482
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:54,639
red biotech is balanced by high utility

2483
01:51:52,319 --> 01:51:56,759
uh doctor prescribes a drug you may die

2484
01:51:54,639 --> 01:51:59,920
if you don't take it the comparative

2485
01:51:56,760 --> 01:52:01,800
safety of these drugs is vetted by

2486
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:04,440
authoritative knowledge certified

2487
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:07,279
experts that work through certified

2488
01:52:04,439 --> 01:52:09,158
organizations State science right so we

2489
01:52:07,279 --> 01:52:11,759
have state science either trust the FDA

2490
01:52:09,158 --> 01:52:14,519
or you don't but there's a state

2491
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:17,599
scientific process that vets certain

2492
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:19,440
kinds of of uh safety there are

2493
01:52:17,599 --> 01:52:22,679
voluntary acceptance of risk being

2494
01:52:19,439 --> 01:52:24,359
benefits unlike biotechnology in which

2495
01:52:22,679 --> 01:52:26,399
what's growing in fields whatever

2496
01:52:24,359 --> 01:52:28,639
effects it has you don't sign on

2497
01:52:26,399 --> 01:52:31,000
voluntarily to be part of that you don't

2498
01:52:28,639 --> 01:52:33,118
sign on voluntarily to consume the food

2499
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:35,198
that's produced if it's not labeled so

2500
01:52:33,118 --> 01:52:37,960
there's a kind of

2501
01:52:35,198 --> 01:52:40,519
involuntary subjection to risk which we

2502
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:42,359
all know by scientific studies shows

2503
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:44,560
that people will enhance their

2504
01:52:42,359 --> 01:52:46,559
assessment of risk if they believe that

2505
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:48,880
they haven't signed on to the risk they

2506
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:51,280
voluntarily subjected themselves to the

2507
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:55,078
risk unlike drugs or surgery or air

2508
01:52:51,279 --> 01:52:58,599
traffic right and so green politics bi

2509
01:52:55,078 --> 01:53:00,719
Tech GMOs produc a very different

2510
01:52:58,599 --> 01:53:04,078
politics but it's quite variable now

2511
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:05,800
Sarah presented this this uh map after

2512
01:53:04,078 --> 01:53:07,319
telling me we should never use this map

2513
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:10,400
again because everybody's bored with it

2514
01:53:07,319 --> 01:53:12,479
but this is the map so the world sort of

2515
01:53:10,399 --> 01:53:14,399
divided between GMO and non GMO

2516
01:53:12,479 --> 01:53:17,279
countries Sarah gave you a nice overview

2517
01:53:14,399 --> 01:53:18,719
of how few crops there are how few

2518
01:53:17,279 --> 01:53:21,118
traits there are but one thing she

2519
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:23,078
didn't say well maybe she didn't say but

2520
01:53:21,118 --> 01:53:25,799
uh one thing that that people often Miss

2521
01:53:23,078 --> 01:53:30,359
is how little of this is direct food

2522
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:33,079
props right mostly mostly these CRS are

2523
01:53:30,359 --> 01:53:35,238
either for fiber or feed so you have

2524
01:53:33,078 --> 01:53:38,960
this remarkable thing where the in the

2525
01:53:35,238 --> 01:53:42,559
EU um all of the farm animals that are

2526
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:45,560
used for uh for consumption all those

2527
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:47,920
animals are fed GMOs but somehow going

2528
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:51,079
through the gut of a pig removes the

2529
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:55,078
Stigmata of the being a Cho right even

2530
01:53:51,078 --> 01:53:57,519
even the euro is made BT cotton fber so

2531
01:53:55,078 --> 01:54:01,000
in the EU there's a kind of an odd kind

2532
01:53:57,520 --> 01:54:03,760
of transmogrification in the world of

2533
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:05,840
growing food crops that are that are

2534
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:09,800
transgenic or genetically modified in

2535
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:12,119
some way and the world of safety and

2536
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:13,880
nonrisk and somehow animals stand

2537
01:54:12,118 --> 01:54:18,319
between human beings and the crops that

2538
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:21,118
way but very little of this of this

2539
01:54:18,319 --> 01:54:23,679
graph uh is food crops for direct

2540
01:54:21,118 --> 01:54:26,679
consumption gringle Bangladesh being a

2541
01:54:23,679 --> 01:54:29,679
dramatic example of an an exception to

2542
01:54:26,679 --> 01:54:32,520
that rule since bringel are eaten in in

2543
01:54:29,679 --> 01:54:35,520
Bengal two or three times a day often so

2544
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:38,280
it's a major vegetable crop India is the

2545
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:42,119
second largest produc world these are

2546
01:54:38,279 --> 01:54:45,158
major vegetable crops and uh but mostly

2547
01:54:42,118 --> 01:54:48,479
biote crops do not go into that kind of

2548
01:54:45,158 --> 01:54:51,559
circuit so this is sort of when Sarah

2549
01:54:48,479 --> 01:54:56,078
gave the example from the US Academy of

2550
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:58,440
Science um this is a European study um

2551
01:54:56,078 --> 01:55:00,359
and I think in a way it's it's good

2552
01:54:58,439 --> 01:55:02,158
because nobody trusts the Americans

2553
01:55:00,359 --> 01:55:04,238
globally nobody trusts Americans because

2554
01:55:02,158 --> 01:55:06,198
they well Monsanto does the studies

2555
01:55:04,238 --> 01:55:08,959
Monsanto has his finger on the

2556
01:55:06,198 --> 01:55:12,359
scale so um this is a conclusion from

2557
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:14,560
the EU studies for a huge Set uh of

2558
01:55:12,359 --> 01:55:18,479
studies they funded themselves

2559
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:21,960
metaanalysis there's just no difference

2560
01:55:18,479 --> 01:55:24,559
in Risk profiles between transgenic

2561
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:26,439
plants or genetic engineer plants and

2562
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:28,520
any other kind of plants but what's

2563
01:55:26,439 --> 01:55:29,919
important about that is that tells us

2564
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:33,840
going back to our earlier thing on

2565
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:35,920
Plants the entire GMO debate is a

2566
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:38,719
political debate the entire

2567
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:41,039
classification is political there is no

2568
01:55:38,719 --> 01:55:43,319
difference here except that created by

2569
01:55:41,039 --> 01:55:45,840
political entrepreneurs there's no

2570
01:55:43,319 --> 01:55:49,359
evidence of any difference except that

2571
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:52,960
created by what so it's not about the

2572
01:55:49,359 --> 01:55:55,719
science it's about risk politics okay

2573
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:58,198
now um think about the benefit side of

2574
01:55:55,719 --> 01:56:00,000
that we said there's kind of an equation

2575
01:55:58,198 --> 01:56:02,198
technology policy there a risk there's

2576
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,840
benefit there's a regulator that weighs

2577
01:56:02,198 --> 01:56:05,919
the risk and benefits and decides

2578
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:09,199
whether we can go forward or not you at

2579
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:11,158
nuclear power very complicated risk

2580
01:56:09,198 --> 01:56:13,960
benefit calculations they got global

2581
01:56:11,158 --> 01:56:15,839
warming they got Fukushima very

2582
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:18,639
complicated calculations in the risk

2583
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:20,639
benefit so in the benefit side of this

2584
01:56:18,639 --> 01:56:23,279
equation the benefits to Farmers have

2585
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:25,279
been quite obvious and country where

2586
01:56:23,279 --> 01:56:27,279
biotech crops have been made available

2587
01:56:25,279 --> 01:56:29,719
they've been adopted pretty

2588
01:56:27,279 --> 01:56:31,439
rapidly in fact the dotion curve in

2589
01:56:29,719 --> 01:56:35,719
India for things like BT cotton is just

2590
01:56:31,439 --> 01:56:39,719
sort of 45° angle astonishingly rapid

2591
01:56:35,719 --> 01:56:43,239
adoption down like 98% of BT C in India

2592
01:56:39,719 --> 01:56:45,480
um so farmers they have a risk benit

2593
01:56:43,238 --> 01:56:47,879
calculist too but all adoption of

2594
01:56:45,479 --> 01:56:49,959
cultivars involves risk for Farmers if

2595
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:52,239
you can't if you don't adopt a new

2596
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:55,599
cultivar you're taking a risk as well so

2597
01:56:52,238 --> 01:56:58,078
farmers are continually at risk but the

2598
01:56:55,599 --> 01:56:59,840
GM crops important to American farmers

2599
01:56:58,078 --> 01:57:01,399
are much less important to European

2600
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:04,078
Farmers so you get this difference in

2601
01:57:01,399 --> 01:57:05,519
the US and and Europe because European

2602
01:57:04,078 --> 01:57:09,078
Farmers don't really eat certainly not

2603
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:11,560
Beach cotton they don't grow on soy the

2604
01:57:09,078 --> 01:57:13,679
the corn rootworm doesn't show up very

2605
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:16,360
much far north of Mich so Spain and

2606
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:18,239
Portugal are heavy users of B corn but

2607
01:57:16,359 --> 01:57:21,039
not much of Northern Europe so they have

2608
01:57:18,238 --> 01:57:22,718
a different kind of utility calculus and

2609
01:57:21,039 --> 01:57:24,679
they're protected by

2610
01:57:22,719 --> 01:57:27,760
government policy that provides them

2611
01:57:24,679 --> 01:57:30,920
with pretty substantial livelihood uh

2612
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:33,880
independent market and banning GMOs of

2613
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:35,840
course reduces competition from American

2614
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:38,159
uh products so there's a there's a

2615
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:41,239
different kind of benefit Matrix for

2616
01:57:38,158 --> 01:57:45,039
European Farmers compared to Americans

2617
01:57:41,238 --> 01:57:47,839
um and the final the final point I want

2618
01:57:45,039 --> 01:57:50,078
to make here about farmer adoption is

2619
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:54,000
that farmers on every continent have

2620
01:57:50,078 --> 01:57:56,599
taken very high risk to grow illegal

2621
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:59,520
crops that are biotech whenever the

2622
01:57:56,599 --> 01:58:02,679
prices are too high sometimes the case

2623
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:05,280
or access is restricted so virtually all

2624
01:58:02,679 --> 01:58:07,359
over the world you'll find instances of

2625
01:58:05,279 --> 01:58:09,279
farmers taking up the technology there's

2626
01:58:07,359 --> 01:58:11,359
an underground defusion Network for

2627
01:58:09,279 --> 01:58:13,960
biotech seeds even when they're not

2628
01:58:11,359 --> 01:58:15,559
approved by government so the benefit

2629
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:18,039
side of this equation is pretty simple

2630
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:21,480
for Farmers producers and of course

2631
01:58:18,039 --> 01:58:24,238
firms uh most firms have made money on

2632
01:58:21,479 --> 01:58:26,839
these products um not all firms they

2633
01:58:24,238 --> 01:58:28,919
sometimes go out of business but but

2634
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:32,199
firms and Farmers have some

2635
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:34,800
benefits um the risk how do you

2636
01:58:32,198 --> 01:58:36,759
calculate risk this is the hard part

2637
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:39,840
benefits are easy to measure and they're

2638
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:42,400
very clear to a farmer um the risk side

2639
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:45,000
of this equation is

2640
01:58:42,399 --> 01:58:46,920
completely politically determined and

2641
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:50,560
that's because of what we call NY and

2642
01:58:46,920 --> 01:58:52,880
uncertainty when you can't measure risk

2643
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:55,400
or you don't find any evidence of

2644
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:57,719
specific hazard there's no specific

2645
01:58:55,399 --> 01:59:00,078
hazard you can't measure the risk

2646
01:58:57,719 --> 01:59:02,480
precisely then you're in the world of

2647
01:59:00,078 --> 01:59:04,840
uncertainty and that uncertainty means

2648
01:59:02,479 --> 01:59:07,238
that that you have to construct some

2649
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:09,679
kind of risk calculus even though you

2650
01:59:07,238 --> 01:59:12,959
have no Hazard as I mentioned with the

2651
01:59:09,679 --> 01:59:17,118
uh euu studies there is no Hazard

2652
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:19,960
demonstra so any kind of risk you have

2653
01:59:17,118 --> 01:59:22,639
with regard to GMOs is entirely

2654
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:25,840
anticipatory and hypothetical

2655
01:59:22,639 --> 01:59:27,679
okay now most paration explanation

2656
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:29,719
variant and outcomes this classical

2657
01:59:27,679 --> 01:59:31,719
political economy right you wake the

2658
01:59:29,719 --> 01:59:33,118
beneficiaries how many farmers are they

2659
01:59:31,719 --> 01:59:34,760
do they have organizations do they have

2660
01:59:33,118 --> 01:59:37,078
access to the Ministries do they have

2661
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:39,880
some political CL then you look at the

2662
01:59:37,078 --> 01:59:41,439
opponents do they have large numbers do

2663
01:59:39,880 --> 01:59:43,760
they have resources have they mobilize a

2664
01:59:41,439 --> 01:59:46,158
lot of people do they have media access

2665
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:48,440
and then they they interact some kind of

2666
01:59:46,158 --> 01:59:51,519
vector some comes out a regulator which

2667
01:59:48,439 --> 01:59:53,839
we'll just call for now a government

2668
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:56,360
this is critical because part of the

2669
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:59,440
variance around the world is explained

2670
01:59:56,359 --> 02:00:01,279
by the character of this regulat that is

2671
01:59:59,439 --> 02:00:04,799
the political structure of the

2672
02:00:01,279 --> 02:00:08,078
evaluation of science so in the EU you

2673
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:11,159
have multiple veto points and multiple

2674
02:00:08,078 --> 02:00:12,960
veto players public opinion about GMOs

2675
02:00:11,158 --> 02:00:15,559
is about the same in the US as it is in

2676
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:17,439
Europe in both countries people are very

2677
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:20,079
suspicious percentage of people saying

2678
02:00:17,439 --> 02:00:21,559
it's unnatural it may be dangerous it's

2679
02:00:20,078 --> 02:00:23,158
roughly similar everybody asked the

2680
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:25,039
questions different ways so it's hard to

2681
02:00:23,158 --> 02:00:26,960
compare public opinion surveys but

2682
02:00:25,039 --> 02:00:29,599
there's not a huge amount of difference

2683
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:31,599
across the EU and the United States the

2684
02:00:29,599 --> 02:00:33,800
difference is that very small numbers in

2685
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:35,319
Europe can make a big difference we have

2686
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:37,079
multi-party governments in which the

2687
02:00:35,319 --> 02:00:39,198
greens often have Ministry of

2688
02:00:37,078 --> 02:00:41,559
environment or have at least a clout

2689
02:00:39,198 --> 02:00:44,000
with the ministry of environment and

2690
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:46,280
those Coalition governments can be

2691
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:48,639
blocked by the action of very small

2692
02:00:46,279 --> 02:00:52,039
numbers of players so there's a there's

2693
02:00:48,639 --> 02:00:54,480
a this regulator who who is in charge of

2694
02:00:52,039 --> 02:00:57,118
agree between the beneficiaries and the

2695
02:00:54,479 --> 02:01:00,759
opponents what kind of risk a society

2696
02:00:57,118 --> 02:01:03,759
should take now empirically around the

2697
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:05,880
world uh ministries of Agriculture have

2698
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:08,840
supported biotechnology Sarah gave you

2699
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:10,359
an example minister of Agriculture inesh

2700
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:13,679
supported BT

2701
02:01:10,359 --> 02:01:15,559
brel the Indian BT brenal from which

2702
02:01:13,679 --> 02:01:18,359
they the same trans gen it's actually

2703
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:21,039
the same genetic event the cry AC that

2704
02:01:18,359 --> 02:01:23,598
came out of India donated to Bangladesh

2705
02:01:21,039 --> 02:01:25,359
that very same Eugene was not approved

2706
02:01:23,599 --> 02:01:28,199
in India and it was still put on

2707
02:01:25,359 --> 02:01:32,799
moratorium in 2010 it's still on

2708
02:01:28,198 --> 02:01:34,960
moratorium in 200 16 now and why is that

2709
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:38,320
because in India the minister of

2710
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:40,319
Agriculture did not have say the Prime

2711
02:01:38,319 --> 02:01:41,679
Minister did not have say the entire

2712
02:01:40,319 --> 02:01:43,920
decision was made by the minister of

2713
02:01:41,679 --> 02:01:45,599
environment ministries of environment

2714
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:48,639
all over the world are much more risk

2715
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:50,520
averse for reasonable reasons but also

2716
02:01:48,639 --> 02:01:52,359
because their political constituency is

2717
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:54,320
environmental groups the political

2718
02:01:52,359 --> 02:01:57,319
constituency of Agriculture ministers is

2719
02:01:54,319 --> 02:01:59,479
Farmers and Farmers expect progress so

2720
02:01:57,319 --> 02:02:01,599
they have a different kind of system

2721
02:01:59,479 --> 02:02:03,519
between those places where the Ministry

2722
02:02:01,599 --> 02:02:05,000
of Agriculture dominates and those

2723
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:06,760
places where the ministry of environment

2724
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:10,679
dominates so India doesn't have BT

2725
02:02:06,760 --> 02:02:12,679
bringel uh and Bangladesh does now since

2726
02:02:10,679 --> 02:02:15,880
Sarah brought this up I do have to

2727
02:02:12,679 --> 02:02:18,560
mention the hazards you know we say risk

2728
02:02:15,880 --> 02:02:21,599
is Hazard times incidents or Hazard time

2729
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:23,960
exposure the hazards in India are very

2730
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:26,119
well documented they're very well

2731
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:29,239
documented the spraying of bringel

2732
02:02:26,118 --> 02:02:30,799
presents hazards to both the consumers

2733
02:02:29,238 --> 02:02:33,839
and to the people who are doing the

2734
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:35,440
spring we have evidence it's very clear

2735
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:38,039
that the current system of producing

2736
02:02:35,439 --> 02:02:40,879
bringel is quite hazardous I I talked to

2737
02:02:38,039 --> 02:02:43,319
some farmers in Maharashtra 2 years ago

2738
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:44,960
and I was asking about BT bringel and

2739
02:02:43,319 --> 02:02:47,399
they said yeah we spray two or three

2740
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:49,800
times a week and I look kind of

2741
02:02:47,399 --> 02:02:51,920
horrified I said but not up to 5 days

2742
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:54,360
before Harvest right because all of the

2743
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:56,639
these these bottles of poison saying do

2744
02:02:54,359 --> 02:02:58,238
not spray within 5 days of harvest and

2745
02:02:56,639 --> 02:03:00,599
they said oh yes up to the hour of

2746
02:02:58,238 --> 02:03:04,439
harvest if we have to the worms are

2747
02:03:00,599 --> 02:03:06,319
there and uh I look horrified again and

2748
02:03:04,439 --> 02:03:08,238
and they they saw they saw my reaction

2749
02:03:06,319 --> 02:03:12,198
they said oh but we wouldn't feed this

2750
02:03:08,238 --> 02:03:15,598
to our families this just goes to the

2751
02:03:12,198 --> 02:03:20,198
market so uh but there's a genuine

2752
02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:22,319
Hazard involved in the current use of uh

2753
02:03:20,198 --> 02:03:23,960
current ways of growing r

2754
02:03:22,319 --> 02:03:27,279
that would be alleviated to a large

2755
02:03:23,960 --> 02:03:29,359
extent by growing BT brid but that's but

2756
02:03:27,279 --> 02:03:31,399
the regulator was of course risk averse

2757
02:03:29,359 --> 02:03:34,598
rather

2758
02:03:31,399 --> 02:03:36,078
than so I've kind of already said this

2759
02:03:34,599 --> 02:03:39,800
uh and the reason that science has a

2760
02:03:36,078 --> 02:03:42,840
hard time is rum spells unknown unknowns

2761
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:46,520
Black Swan phenomenon right and in human

2762
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:49,159
behavior we have tons of loss dominates

2763
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:51,199
game right so if you're healthy you're

2764
02:03:49,158 --> 02:03:53,238
walk in the supermarket you do not want

2765
02:03:51,198 --> 02:03:56,719
to do anything thing that might cause

2766
02:03:53,238 --> 02:03:58,759
some small no matter how small the the

2767
02:03:56,719 --> 02:04:00,960
risk you don't want to take a risk if

2768
02:03:58,760 --> 02:04:03,559
you don't have to and so you get very

2769
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:06,000
powerful risk politics uh I guess the

2770
02:04:03,559 --> 02:04:09,079
most impressive way to and science has

2771
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:12,679
no no answer to this right so there you

2772
02:04:09,078 --> 02:04:15,279
there is no answer to uncertainty if you

2773
02:04:12,679 --> 02:04:16,800
don't know you don't know I want to give

2774
02:04:15,279 --> 02:04:19,359
one example of this in the in the

2775
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:22,119
vaccine debate you know

2776
02:04:19,359 --> 02:04:24,799
that most people that can read would

2777
02:04:22,118 --> 02:04:26,519
know that um all of the official signs

2778
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:29,199
says there's no risk of autism from a

2779
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:31,119
vaccine but suppose there's a shadow of

2780
02:04:29,198 --> 02:04:32,960
a doubt suppos there a tiny tiny chance

2781
02:04:31,118 --> 02:04:34,519
that the studies aren't adequate or they

2782
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:37,480
haven't done enough studies or they'll

2783
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:40,559
change the studies next month you you

2784
02:04:37,479 --> 02:04:42,678
have absolutely no risk in not

2785
02:04:40,559 --> 02:04:44,920
vaccinating your children so long as her

2786
02:04:42,679 --> 02:04:47,359
immunity is maintained in your area

2787
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:48,719
right so if her immunity is maintained

2788
02:04:47,359 --> 02:04:50,719
even though you're free writing on

2789
02:04:48,719 --> 02:04:53,399
everybody else's vaccinations there's no

2790
02:04:50,719 --> 02:04:56,439
risk to you but the fact that her

2791
02:04:53,399 --> 02:04:58,799
immunity is being lost in many areas and

2792
02:04:56,439 --> 02:05:02,118
vaccination rates are declining this

2793
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:04,279
indicates that this risk discourse is

2794
02:05:02,118 --> 02:05:07,158
very very powerful even though it's a

2795
02:05:04,279 --> 02:05:08,800
tiny tiny tiny tiny risk one other

2796
02:05:07,158 --> 02:05:12,319
example is interesting one of our former

2797
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:15,400
students um did a study of raw milk

2798
02:05:12,319 --> 02:05:17,319
consumption that there 13 more states

2799
02:05:15,399 --> 02:05:20,279
allowing raw milk consumption now than

2800
02:05:17,319 --> 02:05:22,000
there were like 10 years ago and I was I

2801
02:05:20,279 --> 02:05:24,719
was kind of stunned by this I we were

2802
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:26,880
getting more rather than less health

2803
02:05:24,719 --> 02:05:30,000
conscious right uh CDC has these big

2804
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:32,920
block capitals do not treat raw milk um

2805
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:35,719
90% of the of the the illnesses from

2806
02:05:32,920 --> 02:05:37,078
drinking milk come from raw milk so I I

2807
02:05:35,719 --> 02:05:40,439
asked this student who comes from a

2808
02:05:37,078 --> 02:05:42,319
dairy farm in in California you I just

2809
02:05:40,439 --> 02:05:44,638
asked her about her farm and her feeling

2810
02:05:42,319 --> 02:05:45,880
about raw milk this stud said this is

2811
02:05:44,639 --> 02:05:47,118
terrible this is really horrible all

2812
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:48,719
these people drinking raw milk I said

2813
02:05:47,118 --> 02:05:50,158
have you ever drunk any raw milk said

2814
02:05:48,719 --> 02:05:52,599
well of course we all drink raw milk on

2815
02:05:50,158 --> 02:05:55,039
my farm but it's my cow

2816
02:05:52,599 --> 02:05:57,800
right so she trusts the raw milk on her

2817
02:05:55,039 --> 02:05:59,719
Farm just like the farmers gr brel that

2818
02:05:57,800 --> 02:06:01,639
I talked to they're not going to use

2819
02:05:59,719 --> 02:06:03,198
poison on the brils if they eat they're

2820
02:06:01,639 --> 02:06:06,520
going to use poison on the bringel for

2821
02:06:03,198 --> 02:06:09,039
the market okay so I mentioned cell

2822
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:11,040
phones early on right it's a classic

2823
02:06:09,039 --> 02:06:14,198
case there's no debate about safety of

2824
02:06:11,039 --> 02:06:16,319
cell phones actually from the time cell

2825
02:06:14,198 --> 02:06:18,558
phones came out there has been a certain

2826
02:06:16,319 --> 02:06:22,639
amount of debate this is from science

2827
02:06:18,559 --> 02:06:25,119
May 27th as last week or two weeks ago

2828
02:06:22,639 --> 02:06:27,599
um tumors in rats from cell phone

2829
02:06:25,118 --> 02:06:30,118
radiation that's non ionizing radiation

2830
02:06:27,599 --> 02:06:32,279
so you think how can there be tumors

2831
02:06:30,118 --> 02:06:35,238
well no one's quite sure but the

2832
02:06:32,279 --> 02:06:37,800
critical question here is and as usual

2833
02:06:35,238 --> 02:06:41,319
it comes with a caveat that studies of

2834
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:42,960
rodents can mean little for humans so

2835
02:06:41,319 --> 02:06:46,639
rational person says I don't care how

2836
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:49,599
many rats you've killed with a transed

2837
02:06:46,639 --> 02:06:51,159
crop in how many studies it may not

2838
02:06:49,599 --> 02:06:53,679
apply very well to humans and in fact

2839
02:06:51,158 --> 02:06:56,679
the rat is not a very good model for

2840
02:06:53,679 --> 02:07:00,399
human physiology so we had this problem

2841
02:06:56,679 --> 02:07:01,920
of of cell phones all adopted everybody

2842
02:07:00,399 --> 02:07:05,319
adopts cell phones why is it because

2843
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:07,920
utility is so high that even as the risk

2844
02:07:05,319 --> 02:07:09,960
goes up people's risk utility balance

2845
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:12,118
stays on the side of utility you don't

2846
02:07:09,960 --> 02:07:13,719
see any campaigns against cell phones

2847
02:07:12,118 --> 02:07:15,799
there are no demands to label cell

2848
02:07:13,719 --> 02:07:18,359
phones although Scandinavia they do

2849
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:20,920
label the the output radiation but

2850
02:07:18,359 --> 02:07:22,598
basically uh We've accepted the risk

2851
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:25,679
utility

2852
02:07:22,599 --> 02:07:30,078
Matrix for cell phones and we don't for

2853
02:07:25,679 --> 02:07:32,800
GMO food okay so what divides

2854
02:07:30,078 --> 02:07:34,799
politics there's no single Dimension

2855
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:37,760
this is unusual somebody studies

2856
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:39,599
International politics uh they're not

2857
02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:42,480
variations of a North South pattern

2858
02:07:39,599 --> 02:07:45,400
developed underdeveloped Rich poor or

2859
02:07:42,479 --> 02:07:48,279
Democratic authoritarian they cross all

2860
02:07:45,399 --> 02:07:50,558
of those lines there is no Dimension to

2861
02:07:48,279 --> 02:07:52,279
This Global Rift unlike all the rest of

2862
02:07:50,559 --> 02:07:54,279
international politics

2863
02:07:52,279 --> 02:07:56,559
so I want to talk a little bit about

2864
02:07:54,279 --> 02:07:58,759
risk politics in food so we've said

2865
02:07:56,559 --> 02:08:00,960
there are a number of claims about GMOs

2866
02:07:58,760 --> 02:08:03,599
and the risk and find their benefits

2867
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:06,679
talk a little bit about food because we

2868
02:08:03,599 --> 02:08:09,039
know from prior to GMOs that pervasive

2869
02:08:06,679 --> 02:08:11,920
anxiety about food drives politics this

2870
02:08:09,039 --> 02:08:14,359
is a longstanding issue and it comes up

2871
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:17,559
every year CDC at one point said 5,000

2872
02:08:14,359 --> 02:08:18,759
people a year die of of uh food safety

2873
02:08:17,559 --> 02:08:20,239
in fraction the United States they've

2874
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:22,480
reduced that to 3,000 these are

2875
02:08:20,238 --> 02:08:24,319
epidemiological estim nobody knows how

2876
02:08:22,479 --> 02:08:25,799
good they are we know lots of people die

2877
02:08:24,319 --> 02:08:28,679
from problems with food safety in the

2878
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:30,679
United States um there's a distrust of

2879
02:08:28,679 --> 02:08:33,199
Institutions and of course in the EU

2880
02:08:30,679 --> 02:08:34,880
this was especially TR man cow disease

2881
02:08:33,198 --> 02:08:38,678
and several other catastrophes where

2882
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:40,520
State science got it wrong okay and then

2883
02:08:38,679 --> 02:08:42,719
there's this capacious political opening

2884
02:08:40,520 --> 02:08:45,119
for risk entrepreneurs if you have high

2885
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:48,000
anxiety and it's almost impossible to

2886
02:08:45,118 --> 02:08:50,359
convince people of safety then you have

2887
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:53,039
a capacious political opening the risk

2888
02:08:50,359 --> 02:08:55,960
entrepreneurs here's one so what do we

2889
02:08:53,039 --> 02:08:57,880
do we rely on epistemic Brokers this is

2890
02:08:55,960 --> 02:08:59,239
one of my favorites this is food bab

2891
02:08:57,880 --> 02:09:02,319
people know food

2892
02:08:59,238 --> 02:09:04,678
bab yeah okay so food bab it's time to

2893
02:09:02,319 --> 02:09:07,198
break free from the toxins in your food

2894
02:09:04,679 --> 02:09:09,039
now food bab she looks very friendly for

2895
02:09:07,198 --> 02:09:11,919
somebody who's taking toxins out of your

2896
02:09:09,039 --> 02:09:14,359
food um but this is what I call an

2897
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:17,840
epistemic broker people all over the

2898
02:09:14,359 --> 02:09:20,198
world are in networks looking for cues

2899
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:23,880
about who do you trust nobody out there

2900
02:09:20,198 --> 02:09:25,399
reads cell nature or science right so

2901
02:09:23,880 --> 02:09:28,719
what they're looking for is epistemic

2902
02:09:25,399 --> 02:09:31,359
Brokers that they can get cues from that

2903
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:35,480
crystallize the information they need

2904
02:09:31,359 --> 02:09:35,479
and so here's EP broker one the

2905
02:09:36,039 --> 02:09:42,519
food here's Science

2906
02:09:39,078 --> 02:09:45,920
Guy we going to trust right

2907
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:48,960
so here's a science guy this kind of

2908
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:52,520
dingy ill lit room talking

2909
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:55,399
to small crowds with some kind of cheesy

2910
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:57,880
PowerPoint you know and he's got he's

2911
02:09:55,399 --> 02:09:59,920
got a rat here looks like it's got It's

2912
02:09:57,880 --> 02:10:04,840
a Ser rat you

2913
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:06,399
know store so that this guy and look at

2914
02:10:04,840 --> 02:10:08,199
this right he represents the Department

2915
02:10:06,399 --> 02:10:10,558
of State goes around the world trying to

2916
02:10:08,198 --> 02:10:12,879
convince people and this looks kind of

2917
02:10:10,559 --> 02:10:14,360
like a a gray bureaucratic are they

2918
02:10:12,880 --> 02:10:17,319
really on the side of food safety I

2919
02:10:14,359 --> 02:10:19,399
don't think so right so um so this this

2920
02:10:17,319 --> 02:10:22,639
is the broker number two and they're

2921
02:10:19,399 --> 02:10:25,039
many like days um and here look this is

2922
02:10:22,639 --> 02:10:27,599
love the food B way so who are you going

2923
02:10:25,039 --> 02:10:29,359
to trust in this kind of competition you

2924
02:10:27,599 --> 02:10:31,440
social media networks who are you going

2925
02:10:29,359 --> 02:10:33,598
to follow you going to follow Peter the

2926
02:10:31,439 --> 02:10:36,799
food bab well food bab does very well

2927
02:10:33,599 --> 02:10:40,480
okay um so does she this is V Shea now

2928
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:43,199
her Advantage is not being as attractive

2929
02:10:40,479 --> 02:10:44,678
as the food babe her Advantage is that

2930
02:10:43,198 --> 02:10:48,000
she claims to be a scientist which is

2931
02:10:44,679 --> 02:10:50,520
not true she is has the advantage of

2932
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:51,920
indigeny the authority that comes from

2933
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:54,920
indigen

2934
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:57,399
Indian female woman right there amid

2935
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:59,118
some kind of grain problem so this is

2936
02:10:57,399 --> 02:11:00,759
this is a different kind of epistemic

2937
02:10:59,118 --> 02:11:04,439
broker but you'd be

2938
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:08,320
astonished how powerful she is she gets

2939
02:11:04,439 --> 02:11:12,039
$50,000 a lecture in the United States

2940
02:11:08,319 --> 02:11:12,039
astonishing what am I being paid

2941
02:11:15,439 --> 02:11:21,319
today I'll have another

2942
02:11:17,639 --> 02:11:24,039
chip this is one of Peter's favorites

2943
02:11:21,319 --> 02:11:26,198
she's the one that tells us then finally

2944
02:11:24,039 --> 02:11:28,439
we said it institutions there is

2945
02:11:26,198 --> 02:11:31,198
empirically evidence that the the

2946
02:11:28,439 --> 02:11:33,519
perception of mass publics compared to

2947
02:11:31,198 --> 02:11:36,279
perception of scientists is diverging a

2948
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:37,960
bit more than it had before so if you

2949
02:11:36,279 --> 02:11:40,960
ask scientists about global warming and

2950
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:44,520
GMOs the Divergence has increased and

2951
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:46,559
the public is less scientific than it

2952
02:11:44,520 --> 02:11:49,639
used to be relative to the scientific

2953
02:11:46,559 --> 02:11:52,639
community so the FDA uh the power

2954
02:11:49,639 --> 02:11:55,440
Monsanto dominates the FDA so in fact we

2955
02:11:52,639 --> 02:11:57,840
can't trust anything the FDA says right

2956
02:11:55,439 --> 02:12:01,558
and of course there the these incredibly

2957
02:11:57,840 --> 02:12:03,119
powerful campaigns sweet kid and and

2958
02:12:01,559 --> 02:12:05,960
he's he's being killed along with the

2959
02:12:03,118 --> 02:12:07,759
bees and he's he's in a bee protest GMOs

2960
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:10,279
killing all it's such a sweet picture

2961
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:12,920
you don't see his face and maybe start

2962
02:12:10,279 --> 02:12:15,800
okay uh so let me Su up the

2963
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:17,559
wrist there are very few general laws

2964
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:19,800
because there's great volatility of time

2965
02:12:17,559 --> 02:12:23,000
and place and population if somebody had

2966
02:12:19,800 --> 02:12:25,279
told me two years ago or even 6 months

2967
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:28,158
ago that Donald Trump would be heading a

2968
02:12:25,279 --> 02:12:31,359
major American political party I mean

2969
02:12:28,158 --> 02:12:34,598
seriously seriously how can that happen

2970
02:12:31,359 --> 02:12:39,039
so politics is inherently

2971
02:12:34,599 --> 02:12:41,319
unpredictable okay um but celebrity

2972
02:12:39,039 --> 02:12:43,279
predictably drives a lot of politics

2973
02:12:41,319 --> 02:12:45,519
think the food babe has his treat she

2974
02:12:43,279 --> 02:12:48,279
she has absolutely no background in

2975
02:12:45,520 --> 02:12:50,760
Science Biology food anything but she

2976
02:12:48,279 --> 02:12:53,359
has this kind of presence she celebrity

2977
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:55,320
yes why is Parris Hilton important well

2978
02:12:53,359 --> 02:12:57,319
she's a celebrity why is she a celebrity

2979
02:12:55,319 --> 02:13:00,359
because she's a celebrity and that's the

2980
02:12:57,319 --> 02:13:02,078
Donald Trump phomen okay so this

2981
02:13:00,359 --> 02:13:03,839
volatility of time and place means we

2982
02:13:02,078 --> 02:13:06,279
have no general laws it's hard to come

2983
02:13:03,840 --> 02:13:09,319
up with a covering law that makes any

2984
02:13:06,279 --> 02:13:12,359
sense for politics but we do know that

2985
02:13:09,319 --> 02:13:16,238
loss dominates gain and secondly there's

2986
02:13:12,359 --> 02:13:19,118
pervasive anxiety about food as creates

2987
02:13:16,238 --> 02:13:20,839
political openings history matters

2988
02:13:19,118 --> 02:13:23,000
compare nuclear power if you're doing

2989
02:13:20,840 --> 02:13:23,880
the RIS risk benefit analysis pre and

2990
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:26,198
post

2991
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:29,000
Fukushima very different kind of

2992
02:13:26,198 --> 02:13:32,198
analysis or think about the malthusian

2993
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:34,760
anxiety no countries in the world oppose

2994
02:13:32,198 --> 02:13:37,479
the Green Revolution right Green

2995
02:13:34,760 --> 02:13:39,520
Revolution plants to resolve world

2996
02:13:37,479 --> 02:13:41,718
hunger were sold on the grounds that we

2997
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:44,119
had a volusian crisis people were going

2998
02:13:41,719 --> 02:13:46,279
to die in Starvation and we got public

2999
02:13:44,118 --> 02:13:49,238
science involved a tremendous increase

3000
02:13:46,279 --> 02:13:51,639
in productivity of our major food crops

3001
02:13:49,238 --> 02:13:53,759
in fact 8,000

3002
02:13:51,639 --> 02:13:55,239
High yielding varieties were introduced

3003
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:57,800
if you count all of them all over the

3004
02:13:55,238 --> 02:14:00,919
world huge numbers of improvements in

3005
02:13:57,800 --> 02:14:03,599
Plants uh and that malthusian anxiety

3006
02:14:00,920 --> 02:14:05,840
the benefit of doing that overcame there

3007
02:14:03,599 --> 02:14:09,480
was no risk discour why was there no

3008
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:11,599
risk discour there were no transnational

3009
02:14:09,479 --> 02:14:14,319
organizations right the transnational

3010
02:14:11,599 --> 02:14:15,639
advocacy organizations did not exist at

3011
02:14:14,319 --> 02:14:16,960
this time there was no green piece

3012
02:14:15,639 --> 02:14:19,440
there's no friends of the earth none of

3013
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:21,599
those people were in the political game

3014
02:14:19,439 --> 02:14:24,158
they are now dominating the political

3015
02:14:21,599 --> 02:14:25,719
game in many places and finally I don't

3016
02:14:24,158 --> 02:14:29,078
know what happened to my brain here but

3017
02:14:25,719 --> 02:14:32,399
I forgot the last point which is that

3018
02:14:29,078 --> 02:14:35,399
structure matters so who these groups

3019
02:14:32,399 --> 02:14:37,558
can approach where they have a chance to

3020
02:14:35,399 --> 02:14:39,839
have influence where the veto points are

3021
02:14:37,559 --> 02:14:41,800
where the choke points are varies from

3022
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:43,960
country to country but transnational

3023
02:14:41,800 --> 02:14:47,239
advocacy networks have been tremendously

3024
02:14:43,960 --> 02:14:48,279
effective at blocking biotechnology all

3025
02:14:47,238 --> 02:14:51,759
over the

3026
02:14:48,279 --> 02:14:55,439
world for example so this is this is a

3027
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:57,000
green piece uh we're not Lab Rats and

3028
02:14:55,439 --> 02:14:58,519
every single sign is the same they're

3029
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:00,880
all middle class people they're all in

3030
02:14:58,520 --> 02:15:05,719
cities and they had a tremendous impact

3031
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:08,039
on what 9 years of field test lab test

3032
02:15:05,719 --> 02:15:09,559
scientific consensus about the BT gr

3033
02:15:08,039 --> 02:15:12,479
will be good for farmers and good for

3034
02:15:09,559 --> 02:15:15,119
health and environment it was blocked

3035
02:15:12,479 --> 02:15:18,198
right so we have to think about this the

3036
02:15:15,118 --> 02:15:21,279
power now GRE piece has been essentially

3037
02:15:18,198 --> 02:15:22,919
delegitimized in India it's been

3038
02:15:21,279 --> 02:15:25,078
thrown out of the country in an

3039
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:28,158
important sense and Cornell was blamed

3040
02:15:25,078 --> 02:15:30,920
for this I'm particularly blamed for

3041
02:15:28,158 --> 02:15:32,039
that GRE okay so how how might things

3042
02:15:30,920 --> 02:15:34,440
change I don't want to end on a

3043
02:15:32,039 --> 02:15:37,198
pessimistic Note One

3044
02:15:34,439 --> 02:15:39,399
Way what here's our problem for how

3045
02:15:37,198 --> 02:15:40,799
things might change rist therapies are

3046
02:15:39,399 --> 02:15:44,158
as difficult to stand out as garlic

3047
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:46,520
mustard everybody here P garlic

3048
02:15:44,158 --> 02:15:49,118
mustard I mean it doesn't go away every

3049
02:15:46,520 --> 02:15:53,599
time you break off a St plant it's just

3050
02:15:49,118 --> 02:15:56,158
H like it's like Asian foil so okay so

3051
02:15:53,599 --> 02:15:58,279
um it's not going to happen these risk

3052
02:15:56,158 --> 02:16:01,719
narratives will not go away the

3053
02:15:58,279 --> 02:16:03,439
Terminator Gene HX is still floating

3054
02:16:01,719 --> 02:16:05,880
around India and it was used in a high

3055
02:16:03,439 --> 02:16:07,839
Court decision in the Philippines it's

3056
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:09,599
not there even after we knew that

3057
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:12,078
farmers were underground taking this

3058
02:16:09,599 --> 02:16:15,719
technology and pocket free new varieties

3059
02:16:12,078 --> 02:16:17,359
of e c even after that and even F A sha

3060
02:16:15,719 --> 02:16:18,800
she was complaining about the failure of

3061
02:16:17,359 --> 02:16:21,679
the government to stop all these Farmers

3062
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:24,079
from creating new hybrids at BT cotton

3063
02:16:21,679 --> 02:16:26,559
dozens of new hybrids of DT cotton while

3064
02:16:24,078 --> 02:16:28,078
talking about the Terminator gen right

3065
02:16:26,559 --> 02:16:30,520
so how do you cre new varities plant

3066
02:16:28,078 --> 02:16:31,759
that kill itself anyway so uh how I

3067
02:16:30,520 --> 02:16:33,679
think to you're not going to wipe out

3068
02:16:31,760 --> 02:16:37,280
these narratives these narratives are

3069
02:16:33,679 --> 02:16:39,679
very very durable so one quick story um

3070
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:44,319
there's a book by Heath and Heath called

3071
02:16:39,679 --> 02:16:46,398
made to stick about how ideas are stuck

3072
02:16:44,318 --> 02:16:48,239
in people's minds and they have an

3073
02:16:46,398 --> 02:16:50,638
example at the last chapter they said

3074
02:16:48,239 --> 02:16:53,638
how do you unstick the stuck idea and

3075
02:16:50,638 --> 02:16:54,959
they actually we have very few examples

3076
02:16:53,638 --> 02:16:57,920
Sarah is working on the other side of

3077
02:16:54,959 --> 02:16:59,638
this Sarah may be unsticking things but

3078
02:16:57,920 --> 02:17:01,040
on the other side of this he said the

3079
02:16:59,638 --> 02:17:03,759
only example they could come up with was

3080
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:05,679
Ray Croc who ran McDonald's I think

3081
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:07,960
that's the right name he ran McDonald's

3082
02:17:05,679 --> 02:17:09,359
and he was accused of having worms in

3083
02:17:07,959 --> 02:17:10,959
his hamburgers how can he have such

3084
02:17:09,359 --> 02:17:13,719
cheap hamburgers well he puts worms in

3085
02:17:10,959 --> 02:17:15,558
his hamburgers Ray Croc does on TV and

3086
02:17:13,718 --> 02:17:18,239
he says now here we have hamburger it's

3087
02:17:15,558 --> 02:17:19,759
39 cents a pound here we have worms

3088
02:17:18,239 --> 02:17:25,159
night crawlers a bought from the local

3089
02:17:19,760 --> 02:17:25,159
bait shop 29 pound I can't afford

3090
02:17:26,079 --> 02:17:32,280
to and they said that's an example of

3091
02:17:29,879 --> 02:17:34,598
coming unstuck the mean is businessmen

3092
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:36,559
are out there to make money Ray Croc

3093
02:17:34,599 --> 02:17:39,040
would not be grinding up nightcrawlers

3094
02:17:36,558 --> 02:17:41,119
to put into his hamburgers so this must

3095
02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:43,960
be so he kind of McDonald's went from

3096
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:46,639
there success to success anyway so this

3097
02:17:43,959 --> 02:17:49,598
is this is just a a kind of a counter I

3098
02:17:46,638 --> 02:17:51,239
I firmly believe uh in Sarah's narra but

3099
02:17:49,599 --> 02:17:53,079
how might things change so so and this

3100
02:17:51,239 --> 02:17:55,478
is this is my other example the autism

3101
02:17:53,079 --> 02:17:58,280
business this is unbelievable by the way

3102
02:17:55,478 --> 02:18:01,679
this was also promoted by someone like

3103
02:17:58,280 --> 02:18:03,280
the food Bay Jenny McCarthy who was a a

3104
02:18:01,679 --> 02:18:06,280
playmate of the year or something like

3105
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:09,319
that but this was also supported by

3106
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:11,239
celebrities mer jelen's disease the the

3107
02:18:09,318 --> 02:18:13,478
House of Representatives voted to give a

3108
02:18:11,239 --> 02:18:16,398
million dollars to CDC to investigate a

3109
02:18:13,478 --> 02:18:19,959
disease it's a it's a invention by a

3110
02:18:16,398 --> 02:18:22,000
psychotic 17th century Spanish physician

3111
02:18:19,959 --> 02:18:24,199
and their website from margel deceased

3112
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:25,920
CDC said this is a the web hoax we don't

3113
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:27,639
want to deal with it and the Congress

3114
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:29,398
said we've got to spend a million

3115
02:18:27,638 --> 02:18:31,398
dollars investigating margel disease so

3116
02:18:29,398 --> 02:18:33,119
there's a report marel disase says we

3117
02:18:31,398 --> 02:18:34,840
can't find any evidence from marel

3118
02:18:33,120 --> 02:18:38,960
disease we're sorry we just wasted a

3119
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:41,200
million dollars so that the power of

3120
02:18:38,959 --> 02:18:44,159
these kinds of narratives uh should not

3121
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:46,920
be underestimated and of course if you

3122
02:18:44,159 --> 02:18:48,039
think about suppose you have this kind

3123
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:51,000
of

3124
02:18:48,040 --> 02:18:53,800
narrative taking apart every piece of

3125
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:55,840
that you know Monet doesn't really own

3126
02:18:53,799 --> 02:18:59,558
our government and is it really poison

3127
02:18:55,840 --> 02:19:04,079
our food really just taking that apart

3128
02:18:59,558 --> 02:19:07,039
requires a kind of activity which is so

3129
02:19:04,079 --> 02:19:10,879
much more demanding than this bumper

3130
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:12,960
right okay so maybe increased utility

3131
02:19:10,879 --> 02:19:15,199
for consumers so fill in your favorite

3132
02:19:12,959 --> 02:19:16,919
bot G desire here let's say got you know

3133
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:21,280
sugar without calories or something like

3134
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:23,879
that um or gamechanging non planned

3135
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:25,960
applications of Biotech and here I I

3136
02:19:23,879 --> 02:19:28,879
think the combination of of climate

3137
02:19:25,959 --> 02:19:31,678
change which Sarah mentioned and also

3138
02:19:28,879 --> 02:19:34,199
nonplant applications biotech may turn

3139
02:19:31,679 --> 02:19:37,000
this corner and the zika virus is kind

3140
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:41,319
of my favorite in the 80s egypti carries

3141
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:44,519
five four really really deadly um

3142
02:19:41,318 --> 02:19:48,000
diseases yellow fever chicken cumia uh

3143
02:19:44,519 --> 02:19:51,200
Dy and now the zika uh if you could wipe

3144
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:52,520
that little mosquito out you know no

3145
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:55,720
great loss to the human rights it's

3146
02:19:52,520 --> 02:19:59,720
invasive anyway um you might have a game

3147
02:19:55,719 --> 02:20:02,760
Cher for increasing a massive Global

3148
02:19:59,719 --> 02:20:06,559
benefit uh at the risk of getting rid of

3149
02:20:02,760 --> 02:20:06,559
a pest thank

3150
02:20:10,680 --> 02:20:16,920
you very much and justly switch from

3151
02:20:15,159 --> 02:20:21,439
Sarah to Ron I wanted to open up the

3152
02:20:16,920 --> 02:20:23,520
floor for any questions or comments

3153

3155
02:20:26,239 --> 02:20:31,920
it's a very plexing problem frustra to

3156
02:20:29,398 --> 02:20:35,159
all of us it's great to see people so

3157
02:20:31,920 --> 02:20:37,040

3158
02:20:35,159 --> 02:20:39,079
so kudos to you

3159
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:44,720
guys

3160
02:20:39,079 --> 02:20:48,719
really so any any comments

3161
02:20:44,719 --> 02:20:51,199
questions Randy yeah um I'm not I'm

3162
02:20:48,719 --> 02:20:56,079
neither Pro nor con GE

3163
02:20:51,200 --> 02:21:00,000
but um I noticed that Sarah's um slides

3164
02:20:56,079 --> 02:21:03,478
were labeled for the liance for Science

3165
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:06,879
and Ron's t-shirt was labeled I assume

3166
02:21:03,478 --> 02:21:10,840
because you're proud of the alliance for

3167
02:21:06,879 --> 02:21:12,199
Science and and my feeling is to argue

3168
02:21:10,840 --> 02:21:14,880
against

3169
02:21:12,200 --> 02:21:17,240
labeling just show just to

3170
02:21:14,879 --> 02:21:21,069
me neither Pro nor

3171
02:21:17,239 --> 02:21:23,600
con just indicates a lack of pride

3172
02:21:21,069 --> 02:21:25,199
[Music]

3173
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:27,640
GMO

3174
02:21:25,200 --> 02:21:31,280
[Music]

3175
02:21:27,639 --> 02:21:35,279
Foods labeling Foods yeah

3176
02:21:31,280 --> 02:21:37,920
so your argument you're against labeling

3177
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:41,800
so no I'm I'm actually for labeling

3178
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:43,200
because it would show I'm proud of this

3179
02:21:41,799 --> 02:21:45,759
yeah yeah yeah no I think that's a

3180
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:48,399
really strong argument for labeling um I

3181
02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:51,159
think it's the best start for labeling

3182
02:21:48,398 --> 02:21:52,799
actually that you know this if this

3183
02:21:51,159 --> 02:21:56,359
isn't something that we think should be

3184
02:21:52,799 --> 02:21:58,239
demonized then label it and and and it

3185
02:21:56,359 --> 02:22:01,239
it can be a good thing like pasturized

3186
02:21:58,239 --> 02:22:03,439
milk so yeah I I don't actually have a

3187
02:22:01,239 --> 02:22:05,439
position on labeling I think um I

3188
02:22:03,439 --> 02:22:08,920
struggle a little bit with it because

3189
02:22:05,439 --> 02:22:10,280
why would we label something as if it's

3190
02:22:08,920 --> 02:22:12,200
as if it's dangerous when there's no

3191
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:13,600
scientific basis that it's dangerous but

3192
02:22:12,200 --> 02:22:15,200
on the other hand I think that the best

3193
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:16,640
thing we can do is label it and people

3194
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:19,439
get over it and and maybe they'll sele

3195
02:22:16,639 --> 02:22:21,478
itate like we do with P Mo or slightly

3196
02:22:19,439 --> 02:22:24,760
change your labels so now you say

3197
02:22:21,478 --> 02:22:28,079
instead of saying contains GMO which is

3198
02:22:24,760 --> 02:22:32,439
kind of like got worms or something of

3199
02:22:28,079 --> 02:22:35,000
this you say contains high quality GMO

3200
02:22:32,439 --> 02:22:37,079
ingredients right emphasizing that this

3201
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:39,719
is an improvement that save the envir

3202
02:22:37,079 --> 02:22:41,680
yeah producing pesticide application and

3203
02:22:39,719 --> 02:22:44,000
if you look at like Arctic Apple for

3204
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:46,439
example I mean there're and and I think

3205
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:49,478
um Theo also like they're really

3206
02:22:46,439 --> 02:22:51,000
promoting and branding their product as

3207
02:22:49,478 --> 02:22:53,559
something special

3208
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:55,398
um and and it's GM and it's special and

3209
02:22:53,559 --> 02:22:57,600
and they're branding it as such I

3210
02:22:55,398 --> 02:22:59,119
support labeling for different reason

3211
02:22:57,600 --> 02:23:01,318
because I think it it's going to it's

3212
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:04,160
going to create a tremendous wave of

3213
02:23:01,318 --> 02:23:05,519
inquiry and and questioning because

3214
02:23:04,159 --> 02:23:07,079
every state government every

3215
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:09,600
municipality everybody around the

3216
02:23:07,079 --> 02:23:12,398
country be huge numers of lawsuits the

3217
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:14,479
USDA has officially said you can't call

3218
02:23:12,398 --> 02:23:17,239
things GMO free because we don't

3219
02:23:14,478 --> 02:23:19,599
recognize the concept of GMO right I

3220
02:23:17,239 --> 02:23:21,879
mean we have substantial equivalents so

3221
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:23,600
I think if you allow people to start

3222
02:23:21,879 --> 02:23:25,278
labeling things GMO it's like the

3223
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:27,359
question of natural unnatural people are

3224
02:23:25,279 --> 02:23:30,200
labeling things natural what does that

3225
02:23:27,359 --> 02:23:33,960
mean so I think actually labeling is

3226
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:35,960
fine um because the the negative Fallout

3227
02:23:33,959 --> 02:23:37,559
if you refuse to label things is what

3228
02:23:35,959 --> 02:23:40,039
are you hiding that's right that's

3229
02:23:37,559 --> 02:23:42,359
that's my absolutely so I don't see I

3230
02:23:40,040 --> 02:23:45,040
don't see any downside I see no downside

3231
02:23:42,359 --> 02:23:47,159
to labeling but within that it's a

3232
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:48,680
matter of whether it's mandatory or

3233
02:23:47,159 --> 02:23:51,359
optional labeling because if you're

3234
02:23:48,680 --> 02:23:53,559
making it mandatory labeling of process

3235
02:23:51,359 --> 02:23:56,120
that's only the only process we're

3236
02:23:53,559 --> 02:23:57,840
requiring people to label why aren't we

3237
02:23:56,120 --> 02:24:00,319
saying you know this was from radiation

3238
02:23:57,840 --> 02:24:02,559
breeding so it's singling out it'll be

3239
02:24:00,318 --> 02:24:04,680
the only process that is forced to be

3240
02:24:02,559 --> 02:24:07,239
labeled as opposed to Sarah's example is

3241
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:08,520
optional Laing well we still AR to be

3242
02:24:07,239 --> 02:24:10,879
proud of it and then put that on their

3243
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:13,239
label that it's GE but do we want the

3244
02:24:10,879 --> 02:24:16,000
federal government to say that this is

3245
02:24:13,239 --> 02:24:18,559
the only process we're going to

3246
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:21,120
label we do label other things by how

3247
02:24:18,559 --> 02:24:25,039
they're made like the the

3248
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:28,000
sweat shop free texes fair

3249
02:24:25,040 --> 02:24:28,760
trade it's no it's a marketing thing it

3250
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:32,200
is

3251
02:24:28,760 --> 02:24:35,520
very but the whole labeling fit is about

3252
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:39,680
whether mandate Mand

3253
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:41,800
optional so pride pride comes in op or

3254
02:24:39,680 --> 02:24:44,760
Artic say hey you should buy this John

3255
02:24:41,799 --> 02:24:47,438
did you ever manage to succeed in deated

3256
02:24:44,760 --> 02:24:49,359
coffee that's what well yeah this is one

3257
02:24:47,439 --> 02:24:51,200
of the one of the problems about doing

3258
02:24:49,359 --> 02:24:53,318
it um

3259
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:56,880
outside of a big company which are

3260
02:24:53,318 --> 02:24:59,719
always demonized is that it's a big

3261
02:24:56,879 --> 02:25:02,199
project we started working with coffee

3262
02:24:59,719 --> 02:25:07,159
and you have to have a transformation

3263
02:25:02,200 --> 02:25:08,760
system um and if you develop your own

3264
02:25:07,159 --> 02:25:11,079
you have to spend millions of dollars

3265
02:25:08,760 --> 02:25:13,000
getting it all all through regulatory

3266
02:25:11,079 --> 02:25:15,719
apparatus so you want to buy it from

3267
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:18,478
someone else well coffee doesn't work on

3268
02:25:15,719 --> 02:25:20,599
a lot of them that's the first problem

3269
02:25:18,478 --> 02:25:23,519
and then just everything is is you know

3270
02:25:20,600 --> 02:25:26,479
raising enough money it's a different um

3271
02:25:23,520 --> 02:25:28,000
marketing strategy so you go to Monsanto

3272
02:25:26,478 --> 02:25:29,358
and say hey you want to partner with us

3273
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:32,159
and they go well how we going to make

3274
02:25:29,359 --> 02:25:34,318
money on this cuz the trees grow forever

3275
02:25:32,159 --> 02:25:35,639
you know and and so there's all these

3276
02:25:34,318 --> 02:25:38,159
kind of things it's really hard for

3277
02:25:35,639 --> 02:25:40,239
small companies to do this um but one

3278
02:25:38,159 --> 02:25:42,719
one of the comments I wanted to make is

3279
02:25:40,239 --> 02:25:45,119
is uh and it came from this study that

3280
02:25:42,719 --> 02:25:47,478
Florida State put out a while back from

3281
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:50,800
I forgot what the department was it was

3282
02:25:47,478 --> 02:25:52,679
like the egg economics guys um

3283
02:25:50,799 --> 02:25:54,599
looking to do a survey to figure out

3284
02:25:52,680 --> 02:25:56,960
well how should we label things one of

3285
02:25:54,600 --> 02:25:59,279
the things in in it turned out that

3286
02:25:56,959 --> 02:26:03,639
people don't understand anything one of

3287
02:25:59,279 --> 02:26:05,680
the things they asked about was um uh

3288
02:26:03,639 --> 02:26:08,799
something like 33% of the people that

3289
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:11,639
they surveyed thought that vegetables

3290
02:26:08,799 --> 02:26:13,840
did not contain DNA and one of the other

3291
02:26:11,639 --> 02:26:16,799
questions 80% of the people answered

3292
02:26:13,840 --> 02:26:21,760
that every plant product that has DNA in

3293
02:26:16,799 --> 02:26:23,239
it should be labeled 80% no I mean

3294
02:26:21,760 --> 02:26:25,520
I I I don't know I don't even know where

3295
02:26:23,239 --> 02:26:26,639
to go with them where were these in

3296
02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:28,800
science

3297
02:26:26,639 --> 02:26:30,920
class but you know so I don't know what

3298
02:26:28,799 --> 02:26:33,799
labeling does and just one other quick

3299
02:26:30,920 --> 02:26:35,478
comment I started doing working with

3300
02:26:33,799 --> 02:26:38,599
genetically modified organ really early

3301
02:26:35,478 --> 02:26:41,358
on like in the mid 70s and we saw the

3302
02:26:38,600 --> 02:26:43,239
same thing in everything back then I

3303
02:26:41,359 --> 02:26:44,840
remember this guy named Jeremy Jeremy

3304
02:26:43,239 --> 02:26:48,279
Ripken I don't know whatever happened to

3305
02:26:44,840 --> 02:26:50,359
him but he was against everything and I

3306
02:26:48,279 --> 02:26:53,000
think when products came out in the the

3307
02:26:50,359 --> 02:26:54,439
pharmaceutical industry after and this

3308
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:57,680
went into the '90s

3309
02:26:54,439 --> 02:27:00,479
and you know everybody's aged parent was

3310
02:26:57,680 --> 02:27:02,120
taking something that you know that's

3311
02:27:00,478 --> 02:27:06,438
pretty good you know so I think that

3312
02:27:02,120 --> 02:27:08,880
risk thing is is is maybe goes to that

3313
02:27:06,439 --> 02:27:13,239
and other things like they came out with

3314
02:27:08,879 --> 02:27:15,839
with um uh uh like some of the proteins

3315
02:27:13,239 --> 02:27:19,159
factors for like clotting that were were

3316
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:21,639
you know completely GMO made and a whole

3317
02:27:19,159 --> 02:27:23,680
a whole generation of Hemophilia were

3318
02:27:21,639 --> 02:27:26,278
wiped out by AIDS because they were

3319
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:28,680
taking stuff from plasma and you know it

3320
02:27:26,279 --> 02:27:30,479
wasn't and so I think maybe you need

3321
02:27:28,680 --> 02:27:32,760
something like that to turn it

3322
02:27:30,478 --> 02:27:36,039
around I we thought maybe our coffee

3323
02:27:32,760 --> 02:27:37,398
would if we could then then 2008 came up

3324
02:27:36,040 --> 02:27:39,000
and you couldn't raise a dime anywhere

3325
02:27:37,398 --> 02:27:41,519
so that was

3326
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:43,879
like but it's yeah it's a really

3327
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:46,560
difficult thing for for you it's amazing

3328
02:27:43,879 --> 02:27:48,239
that the papaya thing got through that

3329
02:27:46,559 --> 02:27:50,278
that they could do that on such a shoe

3330
02:27:48,239 --> 02:27:52,199
string

3331
02:27:50,279 --> 02:27:55,200
amazing that was before Jeremy

3332
02:27:52,200 --> 02:27:57,920
ruin no it was after way after way after

3333
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:59,399
he was he was the 70s it as a concept I

3334
02:27:57,920 --> 02:28:01,920
mean it was before the you know the

3335
02:27:59,398 --> 02:28:04,358
controversy when the papaya got through

3336
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:06,359
before GMO was a household name and

3337
02:28:04,359 --> 02:28:07,840
before Green Peace yeah it was pretty

3338
02:28:06,359 --> 02:28:09,920
early on but it was there was still a

3339
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:12,559
lot of controversy because I I've spent

3340
02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:13,920
20 years at University of Hawaii where

3341
02:28:12,559 --> 02:28:16,799
the breeder that worked on the project

3342
02:28:13,920 --> 02:28:19,000
Richard mansart worked and that was a

3343
02:28:16,799 --> 02:28:21,278
it's still there there is still within

3344
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:23,639
the last it's worse than ever within the

3345
02:28:21,279 --> 02:28:26,239
last 6 months or so I was just talking

3346
02:28:23,639 --> 02:28:28,199
to someone whose father grows papayas or

3347
02:28:26,239 --> 02:28:29,760
brother grows papayas on the big island

3348
02:28:28,200 --> 02:28:31,040
that that were the transgenic ones

3349
02:28:29,760 --> 02:28:33,398
someone came in and chopped all his

3350
02:28:31,040 --> 02:28:37,000
plants down one week one long weekend

3351
02:28:33,398 --> 02:28:38,959
yeah sitation in Hawaii is in terms of

3352
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:43,639
yeah it's it's a hot bed of of growing

3353
02:28:38,959 --> 02:28:46,639
GMOs cuz sna monsan Pine everybody has

3354
02:28:43,639 --> 02:28:49,879
has Laboratories there and winter seed

3355
02:28:46,639 --> 02:28:52,760
production there and it's also a hot bed

3356
02:28:49,879 --> 02:28:54,929
of anti-gmo sentiment

3357
02:28:52,760 --> 02:28:56,719
so I don't

3358
02:28:54,930 --> 02:28:58,680
[Music]

3359
02:28:56,719 --> 02:29:00,199
know guess we're still left with a lot

3360
02:28:58,680 --> 02:29:02,318
of

3361
02:29:00,200 --> 02:29:05,840
questions

3362
02:29:02,318 --> 02:29:07,760
to any other thoughts or

3363
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:09,120
comments we can spend a long time

3364
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:11,719
talking about this topic may you can

3365
02:29:09,120 --> 02:29:14,680
talk about it some refreshments Ron I

3366
02:29:11,719 --> 02:29:17,239
was I am I am now officially owed with

3367
02:29:14,680 --> 02:29:19,120
the power to propose that we all go get

3368
02:29:17,239 --> 02:29:20,639
something to drink and then we'll do a

3369
02:29:19,120 --> 02:29:23,279
toast to Peter

3370
02:29:20,639 --> 02:29:23,278
who's the man of the

3371
02:29:25,920 --> 02:29:31,398
hour this has been a production of

3372
02:29:28,520 --> 02:29:34,399
