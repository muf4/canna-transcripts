1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,580
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:10,589
University Thank You Gareth I may be

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,900
that the chair of nbnb but I love being

4
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:15,419
a member of this field so thank you for

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,219
having me thank you for sharing your

6
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:20,009
students with me it's been a great ten

7
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:21,899
years and and I look forward to stepping

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,660
down as chair and being a more active

9
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:28,858
member of your field and getting back to

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:33,179
enjoy more of my science the themes of

11
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:35,010
research in my lab are multiple I'm

12
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:37,399
interested in how volatile mediate

13
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:39,500
interactions across the full spectrum of

14
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:42,299
positive neutral and negative

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,969
interactions so we look at how volatiles

16
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:47,549
might mediate obligate mutualism whether

17
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,890
there's any whether there's private

18
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:51,899
channels that evolve between plants like

19
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,859
figs and fig wasps or yucca and yucca

20
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,340
moths

21
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:58,469
we also study and this is like obviously

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,620
an honest form of communication between

23
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,989
two intimately tied mutualists we also

24
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:06,539
study dishonest communication these are

25
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:09,780
not flowers these are platinum dung

26
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,180
mosses and so they are along with cycads

27
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,000
and a few rushes some of the few

28
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,240
examples of plants that have

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,670
independently evolved flower like colors

30
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,228
of combinations of color and scent and

31
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,000
other traits that attract animals to

32
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:27,509
move their propagules in this case

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,938
spores instead of pollen we also study

34
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:34,228
sort of third parties in the evolution

35
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:35,548
of evolutionary shifts of phenotype many

36
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:39,319
of you know Kyle Martin and his thesis

37
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:42,930
work is involved in whether microbes

38
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:45,059
lend a hand in and shifts between sort

39
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,360
of classic beetle and be pollinated

40
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,790
flowers - flowers that mimic carrion or

41
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:54,420
feces or rotting or fermenting fruit or

42
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,920
yeast and finally these night blooming

43
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,439
flowers that I'm going to talk about

44
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,868
today which are found throughout the

45
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:01,709
world and are pollinated by hawk moths

46
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:04,078
those are the first plants that I

47
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:05,908
studied in my thesis and postdoc and

48
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:09,000
largely because they're so strongly

49
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,500
scented at the time the analytical

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,719
methods I used were not very sensitive

51
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,740
and they gave me the best chance to

52
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,500
really

53
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,260
you confidently sample volatiles now we

54
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,629
can sample almost anything um so here's

55
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:24,030
the outline for today's talk I'm going

56
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:27,329
to introduce you to little laws a

57
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:29,280
ubiquitous common scent compound that

58
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,260
just happens to be a major player in

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,300
night blooming flowers so I want to set

60
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:36,179
the stage a little bit for understanding

61
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:39,570
this compound in its distribution I want

62
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,000
to talk about the project this is the

63
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:44,000
first talk that I'm giving on a project

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,219
that's just about to end five years of

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,009
funding from NSF on a program called the

66
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:52,979
dimensions of biodiversity it's a big

67
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:54,989
collaborative project 5 P is 2 million

68
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:57,179
dollars five years it's a chance to

69
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,469
really build something and so you're

70
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,599
going to get the first glimpse of what

71
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,859
we've been learning from this project so

72
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,329
I'm going to set the stage for you of

73
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,860
how we designed it what we were trying

74
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,390
to what kind of question you're trying

75
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,480
to answer

76
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:12,479
I didn't want to home in on one single

77
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:14,729
endemic species prairie species in

78
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,769
Colorado you know thira hiring Tony I

79
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:18,840
which I've brought along with me as I

80
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,180
speak I'm going to pass this around it's

81
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,039
nice to see the plant which work on

82
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,439
trees or cycads you can't always do this

83
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,590
but this is oenothera herring Tony I

84
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:31,079
star of today's show and I'm going to

85
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,990
drill down deep into how oenothera

86
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,940
herring Tony I interacts with its

87
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,189
friends and enemies across its known

88
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:41,759
distribution in Colorado and then I want

89
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:43,500
to finish up by scaling up to the

90
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,299
phylogenetic scale and looking at the

91
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,189
genus oenothera at least in Western

92
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,140
North America and asking if some of the

93
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:51,629
patterns and processes that we think

94
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,939
we're discovering and even in oenothera

95
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:56,159
herring Tony I are also shared with its

96
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:58,259
closer and more distant relatives so

97
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:02,400
that's where we're going today let's

98
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:05,159
begin by talking about little oh how do

99
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,789
I know anything about floral volatiles

100
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:10,049
where do we start there are many ways to

101
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,009
concentrate and collect volatiles what

102
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,260
I'm showing you here is a kind of

103
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:14,879
equilibrate in method for the for

104
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:17,670
today's talk we actually collect odors

105
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:21,120
over time so we get emission rates but

106
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:24,300
the whole idea is that you trap or

107
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,728
adsorb volatiles onto a substance that

108
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,240
you can either aleut with with a solvent

109
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:29,848
or

110
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,788
you can strip thermally into a gas

111
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:35,699
chromatograph and so what we do is when

112
00:04:32,788 --> 00:04:38,459
we collect our volatile samples which we

113
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:41,970
optimize through trial and error for a

114
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:44,788
given species we inject them into the GC

115
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:48,360
I use two different kinds of GC columns

116
00:04:44,788 --> 00:04:49,529
to separate complex blends and then we

117
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,470
always need a detector and the detector

118
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:54,568
we use is a single quadrupole mass

119
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,669
spectrometer and so if I do a good job

120
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:59,520
my chromatograms look like this and each

121
00:04:56,668 --> 00:05:03,288
peak this is time and temperature this

122
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:06,538
is abundance of signal and so each peak

123
00:05:03,288 --> 00:05:09,180
presumably is a single compound and how

124
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:11,250
do you know what that compound is you

125
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,650
get the mass spectrum and mass spectrum

126
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,418
provides you with a hint in this case

127
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:17,339
this is a classic mass spectrum for

128
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:20,879
today's compound of interest lintel

129
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:22,679
which is a monoterpene alcohol but

130
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,509
getting a mass spectrum isn't an

131
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,000
identification it's just it's just a

132
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:28,710
suggestion what you do then is you buy

133
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,370
the standard or you make it if you can't

134
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:34,079
buy it and you co inject it with your

135
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,750
sample and if they share a retention

136
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,758
time you do it again on another compound

137
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,430
another column another stationary phase

138
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:43,379
and if they're always Co alluding onion

139
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,319
and then you go and look at the possible

140
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:47,819
isomers or the other compounds with

141
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,038
similar mass spectra and you demonstrate

142
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:52,288
to yourself your own satisfaction that

143
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:54,629
they're not all Co alluding at 11

144
00:05:52,288 --> 00:05:57,538
minutes or whatever this is okay and so

145
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:59,009
you can go on to use IR or NMR to

146
00:05:57,538 --> 00:06:01,529
identify these things but there's a kind

147
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:03,658
of Beatles Greatest Hits of floral

148
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:07,439
vowels nails there's 1700 that have been

149
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:09,418
identified but the same 10 or 20 to show

150
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,009
up all the time and little all is about

151
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:13,889
number six okay

152
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:16,229
so although today's context is night

153
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:18,300
blooming flowers pollinated by moths you

154
00:06:16,228 --> 00:06:21,269
can find lintel all in all kinds of

155
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,250
diurnal flowers and orchids in early

156
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:26,279
Daphnis blooming and you know myth the

157
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:29,639
mediterranean etc which so one take-home

158
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:31,829
message is going to be that the rolls of

159
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,348
floral volatiles are often context

160
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:36,658
dependent the ecological functions often

161
00:06:34,348 --> 00:06:37,019
have to do with dosage time of day or

162
00:06:36,658 --> 00:06:38,968
night

163
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:41,128
who's the receiver what's the community

164
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:44,038
context what's it associated with

165
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:46,709
honest or dishonest pollination services

166
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:49,588
etc okay so if we think we have little

167
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:52,110
all then we need to start looking for

168
00:06:49,588 --> 00:06:53,009
patterns I always want to do justice to

169
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,218
Roman Kaiser

170
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:58,559
there are literally thousands of great

171
00:06:56,218 --> 00:07:01,949
chemists over the last 50 years who

172
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:04,019
allowed us to use capillary GCM and mass

173
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:07,319
spec as a way of identifying volatiles

174
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:09,929
but really only one of them translated

175
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,330
the vast knowledge from perfumery and

176
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:14,638
essential oil research into floral

177
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:16,438
biology and that was Roman Keyser söze a

178
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,209
guy who worked for jeeva down a perfume

179
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:21,509
company in Switzerland traveled the

180
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:23,999
world looking for new odors for his

181
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:26,848
company and had carte blanche from his

182
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:28,528
employers to publish his work so he

183
00:07:26,848 --> 00:07:30,990
wrote these gorgeous books where he

184
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:33,990
shows his organic synthesis and he shows

185
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:37,050
the chromatography and he was so far

186
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:39,778
ahead he was so Mozart everybody's Sally

187
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:42,149
areas that he just shared everything and

188
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:43,558
so as a graduate student I met him and I

189
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:46,139
learned a lot from him that I couldn't

190
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:48,300
have really taught myself so what Roman

191
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:50,728
Kaiser did first is he hid all of the

192
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,889
usual suspects for perfume people like

193
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:55,139
white knight blooming flowers they smell

194
00:07:52,889 --> 00:08:00,179
green coffee

195
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:04,019
citrus honeysuckle gardenia jasmine etc

196
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:06,359
okay and so he kind of did his own

197
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:08,848
mental principal components analysis and

198
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,098
found there's this guild across the

199
00:08:08,848 --> 00:08:12,628
planet of white semi-tropical night

200
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:14,788
blooming plants that all smell like

201
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:17,789
gardenias and what he found is that

202
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:21,178
there's a core of lentil all neural dole

203
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:23,688
farnesyl these are turpenoid alcohols

204
00:08:21,178 --> 00:08:25,768
I guess the third they're um they're

205
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:28,379
soluble in nectar so they could be

206
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:31,370
flavors as well as since and then he and

207
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:34,079
then to that core he found things like

208
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:36,448
aromatic alcohols and esters lactones

209
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:38,338
etc and that adds some of the spice and

210
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:40,828
difference to these different compounds

211
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,719
so these different floral Accords but

212
00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:44,729
Linda law was almost always there and

213
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,990
when I became a grad student this is

214
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:50,308
what I read I did a study of my own with

215
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,438
a National Geographic grant and a

216
00:08:50,308 --> 00:08:55,079
Fulbright my first sabbatical was in

217
00:08:52,438 --> 00:08:57,360
South Africa about 12 years ago and we

218
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,009
comparing guilds of night-blooming

219
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,200
hawkmoth pollinated plants at the same

220
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:03,990
latitude on opposite sides of the planet

221
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,420
in Argentina and South Africa and what

222
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,129
we found was that Linna law was present

223
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:10,019
and a lot of these plants and their

224
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:13,439
their floral tubes and their and their

225
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:15,329
morphology was all you know sort of a

226
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,910
textbook example of conversion evolution

227
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,920
Hawk moths are universal they can fly

228
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:22,259
across oceans and so they're sort of

229
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,719
kind of selective pressure that they

230
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:26,519
bring upon flowering plants doesn't

231
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,149
really differ that much between islands

232
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:32,549
or continents etc um and at that time I

233
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:35,819
became aware that little law was chiral

234
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:37,529
and just because I was finding it on and

235
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,420
in my chromatography didn't mean I knew

236
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:41,730
which little while it was and I had to

237
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:44,309
invest in a chiral GC column and in fact

238
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:46,620
many compounds that flowers produce as

239
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:48,689
volatiles have chiral centers and

240
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,120
because insects respond differently to

241
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,740
them their receptors are often tuned to

242
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,539
the left-handed or right-handed molecule

243
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,210
you kind of have to go that extra step

244
00:09:54,539 --> 00:10:01,349
and identify which enantiomer or

245
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:03,090
enantiomers you're working with so this

246
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,220
is just a slide to show you I'm not

247
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:08,009
going to dwell on about chemistry very

248
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,350
much today but the structural genes that

249
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:12,450
encode little or a part of a huge gene

250
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,190
family the terpene synthase family the

251
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,530
one I worked on as a grad student in

252
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:21,150
Clarkie or Brewer i with iran petritsky

253
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:23,189
was an S + little all synthase and then

254
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:26,009
the ones that are more common in the

255
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,810
literature from tomato and mint are -

256
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:30,629
limb ll synthase and they are not each

257
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:32,459
other's closest relatives as in this

258
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:35,070
gene family so this is just to show you

259
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:37,920
that many structural genes and their

260
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:40,370
enzymes that are responsible for for the

261
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:43,829
biosynthesis of specific volatiles are

262
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:46,259
revolving repeatedly okay and so putting

263
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,300
a name on them little ol synthase

264
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:50,939
doesn't actually mean anything in terms

265
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:52,559
of their sequence similarity there's a

266
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:56,160
lot of homo pleaseyou there's a lot of

267
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:57,659
repeated and parallel evolution in this

268
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,889
gene family okay

269
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:01,799
there are many ways to make these

270
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:03,929
compounds in other words alright so

271
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,309
there's the introduction now let's talk

272
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:07,879
about hawkmoths a little and why this

273
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:07,879
matters

274
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:12,250
you can't start you can't read a

275
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,789
textbook on evolution without Darwin's

276
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:19,089
star orchid from Madagascar and it's 23

277
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:25,809
centimeter nectar tube and the predicted

278
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:26,860
hawkmoth Santha pan morgan i and there

279
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:29,588
have been a lot of people including

280
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,149
onder's nielsen who have based their

281
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:33,310
careers on following darwin and

282
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:35,200
proposing that well okay this is an

283
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:37,869
example of fishery and runaway selection

284
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,730
but it's not sexual selection now it's

285
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,679
flowers and pollinators and so how do

286
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,990
you get a tube that long and a tongue

287
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,669
that long it might be this cycling of

288
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,950
you know you withhold the nectar you

289
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:51,129
make the animal shove its head into the

290
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:53,950
flower more closely so that it transfers

291
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:55,809
pollen more effectively and that then

292
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:57,160
then mutants of the moth have longer

293
00:11:55,809 --> 00:11:58,929
tongues are more effective at doing that

294
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:00,610
in the plants and moths are stuck in a

295
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:03,009
cycle of longer and longer tongues and

296
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,899
tubes this is in madagascar these things

297
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:09,490
happen on islands this made a lot of

298
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:11,620
sense in 1993 and so we've done a lot of

299
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,750
work on the moth side of things this is

300
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,929
my first grad student joaquin boy ray

301
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:19,870
and what joaquin did in a kind of

302
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:21,399
Tinbergen desk way was work out what's

303
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,860
the whole sequence of it with once you

304
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:25,480
get a motivated hawk moth what are the

305
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,459
sequence of events that gets it to put

306
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,490
out its tongue approach a flower and

307
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:32,649
drink and these are all experiments that

308
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,089
Joaquin and I and and others have done

309
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:37,750
together over the years and published

310
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:39,399
and floral scent is involved in many of

311
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,589
these early stages of getting a moth to

312
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:46,179
recognize a bright object as a flower as

313
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:47,770
well as guiding its tongue and lintel

314
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:50,139
all is one of the compounds that we've

315
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:52,870
shown and others have shown like Jeff

316
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:56,169
riffle to sort of release this searching

317
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:58,060
and probing behavior in moths so in fact

318
00:12:56,169 --> 00:13:00,069
while I'm talking about little all I

319
00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:03,278
want to pass around some little wall for

320
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:07,890
you to sniff some of you familiar with

321
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:10,409
it it's in bergamot oil Earl Grey tea

322
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:14,189
fruit loops

323
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:15,719
you can pass these around and this is

324
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,800
the racemic mixture this of you who

325
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:22,379
really want to know what Janani

326
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:24,539
enantiomer it is okay and so we learned

327
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:26,430
a lot over the last decade about how

328
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:28,740
Hawk moths respond to flowers and how

329
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:31,049
they might affect that kind of selective

330
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,240
pressure on longer nectar tubes and flow

331
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:37,859
and strong overstated floral scents

332
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:40,740
the problem is in really ecology just as

333
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,539
in courtship between animals third

334
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,039
parties make a difference there's a lot

335
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:47,129
of eavesdropping that goes on out there

336
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:49,649
it's so guppies well-known john endler

337
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:51,149
studies where guppy males that live in

338
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:53,490
streams that don't have cichlid fish

339
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:56,370
have the most wonderful orange long

340
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:59,399
flowery Fantasia tails and they attract

341
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:01,709
females and win them as mates but when

342
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,149
the cichlids are present as predators it

343
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,438
can't have those big tails because

344
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:06,750
there's those are the ones that sickles

345
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:10,169
will eat first so there's always a sort

346
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:12,149
of balancing selection on how how how

347
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:14,639
while B can you display without

348
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:16,799
attracting enemies and in flowers that's

349
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,539
been shown repeatedly over the last 20

350
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,539
years that floral displayed the

351
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:23,458
pollinators is often checked by third

352
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:26,129
party enemies that are attracted to the

353
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:27,750
flowers and for today's talk the enemies

354
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:30,480
that you need to know about are these

355
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:32,970
little moths okay so the genus is mom

356
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,430
feh the family is the mom today they're

357
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:38,000
related to yucca moths sort of broadly

358
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:40,948
and they come in three flavors

359
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,259
ecologically they are there are some

360
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:46,318
seed predators that the caterpillars

361
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:47,730
burrow into the ovules into the lope

362
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,409
they live in the locals and then they

363
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,970
they finish eating all the seeds and

364
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:53,698
they spin a cocoon so kind of like a

365
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:55,829
young come off and then their bud Gaugh

366
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:58,409
lers once where the female moths lay

367
00:14:55,828 --> 00:15:00,088
eggs on the bud the caterpillars go into

368
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:02,698
the bud and then emasculate actually

369
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:04,939
keep all the sex organs and and defecate

370
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:08,039
into the flowers so there's a huge

371
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:09,208
fitness loss in both of these cases and

372
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:10,669
then what I'm not showing here is that

373
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:13,229
there's also

374
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:15,028
leaf miners I think the ancestral

375
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,889
condition and the mambas are to mine

376
00:15:15,028 --> 00:15:19,799
leaves or just been webs around meristem

377
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:22,110
and then use that as a home so they're

378
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:23,620
all kind of galling actually but they're

379
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:25,899
specialized

380
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,250
in immortalise and particularly in

381
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:30,009
western North America where the honor

382
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,509
Gracie has a radiation with the repeated

383
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:33,309
desert off' occasion of the continent

384
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:38,049
you get these guys showing up again and

385
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:40,269
again in different hosts okay so the

386
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:43,599
Darwin Nielsen view of coevolution is

387
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:46,569
you have this binary you have the moths

388
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,100
and their pollinators and the

389
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,140
relationship between tongue length and

390
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:53,170
tube length might go vary with latitude

391
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:55,509
or altitude but those are the sources

392
00:15:53,169 --> 00:15:57,279
thoughts of selective pressure okay and

393
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:59,769
these should match each other in nature

394
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,509
and so this is almost like an isometric

395
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:03,009
scaling right you scale up if you have a

396
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:05,169
Manduca you scale down if you have a

397
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:07,149
highly as an Idaho instead of Arizona

398
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:09,969
because it's too cold at night for these

399
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:11,799
big guys and you know here you're making

400
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,000
OSA mean and little all and various

401
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:14,949
amounts that are proportional to the

402
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,740
surface area of the flower that would be

403
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:19,509
great if it were true but it's not um

404
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,899
when we did work on this species

405
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:26,559
oenothera SS potosi in Jackson Hole

406
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:29,709
Wyoming horrible place to work the bomb

407
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:31,839
foe well here hi Lee's caterpillars okay

408
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:34,180
so this white line sphinx moth is a

409
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:37,300
great pollinator but if there's a price

410
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:39,639
it lays eggs on the buds of the flowers

411
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:42,009
and their caterpillars eat flowers okay

412
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:43,449
and so there the flowers are staying

413
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:45,519
open in the morning there they're

414
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,020
opening up more broadly and they're

415
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,210
losing little all and making geraniol

416
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:51,519
instead and the pollinated by these huge

417
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:53,530
antha fara bees brilliant wonderful

418
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,909
silver beads but very long tongues you

419
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:56,759
have to get up at 6:00 in the morning to

420
00:16:54,909 --> 00:17:00,339
see them but they pollinate every flower

421
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:02,769
and in Moab Utah two getting hammered by

422
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:05,470
these mom fogies and what they're doing

423
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:07,480
is they're slamming shut the flare of

424
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:09,819
the flower because what we learned is

425
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,740
that if the female moth mama can get in

426
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:13,689
and get a drink of nectar they come

427
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,910
running out they drop into the rosette

428
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:17,830
and they start laying eggs in the bud

429
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:20,050
primordia by the time those caterpillars

430
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:22,449
has there's a nice developing bud for

431
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:24,279
them to make a gall out of okay but if

432
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,779
they can't get that nectar meal they'll

433
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:27,250
move on to another plant so this

434
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:30,970
directional selection here to slam that

435
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:32,890
shot and they lose little all as well so

436
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:35,039
before you even began the study we knew

437
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:37,000
that there is geographic variation in

438
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,649
not only scent

439
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,630
also flower morphology and it wasn't

440
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:42,190
just isometrically scaling up and down

441
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,030
with pollinator there's something else

442
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,880
going on here

443
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:48,430
so John Thompson's view of coevolution

444
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,580
it's about Geographic mosaics where some

445
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:53,259
populations the predator has a stronger

446
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:55,359
selective effect than the pollinator and

447
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:58,480
and and then the flowers respond

448
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:00,429
accordingly in evolutionary time in

449
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,990
other populations the predator isn't

450
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,310
there because it's got a parasite or

451
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,839
because there's another host plant

452
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:06,429
that's even better for it and those

453
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:08,409
plants are released from that selective

454
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:10,990
pressure and they can more directly

455
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:12,580
match the morphology and the sensory

456
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,559
biology biological needs of the

457
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:15,819
pollinators and so what Thompson

458
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,190
suggested is that there should be a

459
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:20,289
homeles aook across the populations of

460
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:23,019
these plants where there's mismatched

461
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:24,009
traits with the pollinators and other

462
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,690
places where they're matching the

463
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:29,079
pollinators really well depending on

464
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:32,200
local selective pressures okay so we

465
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:34,359
wrote a grant to the dimensions of

466
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,160
diversity program and got it on the

467
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:39,009
first go there's only time in my life I

468
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,690
got a grant on the first try and this

469
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:43,150
grant had been this proposal had been

470
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:44,620
submitted as a regular grant for you

471
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:47,769
know for three previous years as a pre

472
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:50,709
Purple's Abijah slam fair pour go away

473
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:52,710
good science if you know this is not

474
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:56,980
transformative you're going nowhere and

475
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:59,259
at least I had tenure all right but but

476
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:03,009
for those of you don't know the program

477
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:05,049
which i think has just ceased is so

478
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:07,240
interesting because it takes the normal

479
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:09,579
amount of funding and couples it into

480
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,910
cobbles it into a team and extends it

481
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:16,210
from three to five years if 5p is

482
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:17,890
maximum of two million dollars and so

483
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,230
the criteria are that you study

484
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:21,100
diversification or diversity on three

485
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,490
different scales

486
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:27,159
okay functional genomic and phylogenetic

487
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:30,039
and so your job as a grant writer is to

488
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:32,050
is to convince the panel that you've got

489
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:34,059
that and that it matters and that that's

490
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:35,799
going to tell a story that any one of

491
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:38,230
those approaches isn't going to tell and

492
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:41,099
that's what we did so the way we

493
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:44,640
outlined it was

494
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:48,740
- sort of I - - - to model intensive

495
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:52,530
surfing we're gonna choose one focal uh

496
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:55,650
species in you know thira and really

497
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:57,119
nail it study stay the whole range okay

498
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:00,240
so we wanted an endemic something that

499
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,649
wasn't sound over ten states and but

500
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,960
really understand what are the

501
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:06,419
conflicting selective pressures from the

502
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,548
enemy and the friend are there hot spots

503
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:10,500
and cold spots are there mismatches and

504
00:20:08,548 --> 00:20:12,569
the traits if we standardize the way

505
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:16,980
that we collected our data could we see

506
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:19,439
that etc and then the second part would

507
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,659
be that we would start moving backwards

508
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,519
into the into the lineage and start

509
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:25,710
looking at sibling species are couples

510
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,019
of species and different parts of

511
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:29,909
Western North America and ask - the

512
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:32,099
patterns that we saw here in our focal

513
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:34,470
species actually are they are they

514
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:37,529
shared in common across the lineage to

515
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:39,210
which it belongs and then we wanted to

516
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:41,460
take a really broad look at the end and

517
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:43,140
ask for the whole genus oenothera in

518
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,990
fact for the whole family on a gray Cee

519
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:48,000
and for the whole lineage of moths that

520
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,829
give rise to Mom feh you know are they

521
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,779
Co speciate is this tit for tat

522
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:54,089
coevolution are they locked in an arms

523
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:56,548
race are there other things that we

524
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:58,079
didn't anticipate like life history

525
00:20:56,548 --> 00:21:00,329
strategies or the kind of fruits that

526
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,759
they make that might lock out a mom fall

527
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:05,038
off if it's trying to to use fruits as a

528
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:06,900
place to live etc I mean you know thira

529
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,730
don't change their flowers that much but

530
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,710
they change everything else there's no

531
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:13,980
you know fear of trees but there's lots

532
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:17,490
of diversity and floral form okay so let

533
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:19,740
me focus now on what we learned from our

534
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:22,200
focal study so we decided to work on

535
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,849
this species oenothera herring Tony I

536
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,919
it's an annual and it's self

537
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:28,619
incompatible so we could study its

538
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,090
lifetime fitness in a single season we

539
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:32,219
could grow it obviously I passed it

540
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:33,599
around it takes a while to bloom but

541
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:37,200
they're very very happy in terracotta

542
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:39,649
pots they live only here in the Arkansas

543
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,538
River drainage this is their whole world

544
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:45,298
okay and there's about 25 or 30 known

545
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:47,069
populations we hit most of them so

546
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:50,548
Chrissa scogan was the driver of this

547
00:21:47,069 --> 00:21:51,869
word chris is a conservation geneticist

548
00:21:50,548 --> 00:21:53,609
from Kent whole Singers group at

549
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:54,929
University of Connecticut and she got a

550
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:56,849
job she grew up in far

551
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:58,740
and wanted to get back to the Prairie so

552
00:21:56,849 --> 00:22:00,629
she got a job in Chicago Botanic Garden

553
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,190
and we started studying this prairie

554
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:07,880
plant here's what it looks like in the

555
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:09,990
field and so what did we do we we

556
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:13,170
standardized our collection of

557
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:15,420
pollinator data of herbivore data of

558
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:17,430
floral scent and nectar and flower

559
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,620
measurements across five or six years

560
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:20,759
even before we got the grant we started

561
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:23,969
working in two thousand eight and nine

562
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:25,589
and so they are pollinated poorly by

563
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:28,049
large moths because they don't quite fit

564
00:22:25,589 --> 00:22:29,939
they're pollinated extremely well by the

565
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:31,799
white line sphinx which is also laying

566
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,630
eggs on them and then they're visited by

567
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:35,909
these pollen scavenging bees at dawn

568
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:37,800
that do nothing good for the plant

569
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:39,630
they're one and done if there's a one

570
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:40,950
flower they carry all the pollen eat and

571
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:43,890
carry and go straight to the nest and

572
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:49,559
lay an egg on it so they are pod their

573
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:51,870
pollen thieves and across all these

574
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:53,609
different populations there's all kinds

575
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:56,339
of variation in the relative abundance

576
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:58,079
of bees and moths but what we found was

577
00:22:56,339 --> 00:23:01,109
that there was no variation in their

578
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:03,000
identity okay so also from Colorado

579
00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:05,909
Springs and Pueblo in the foothills of

580
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,450
the eastern of eastern slope of the

581
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:11,400
Rockies all the way out into the into

582
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:13,410
the Prairie they're basically getting

583
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,560
the same friends the same enemies the

584
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:18,150
same ecology even though there's some

585
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:22,200
variation in the sort of eat affic

586
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:24,450
ecology there okay so our first round we

587
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,660
had twelve populations 13 15 to 30

588
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:29,490
plants for a population that's a lot of

589
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:32,700
of chromatography and we found something

590
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:35,370
strange but out in the south east the

591
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,140
flowers almost never had little all okay

592
00:23:35,369 --> 00:23:39,839
whereas in the northwest

593
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:42,270
and down into volson berg Linda law was

594
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,879
a major peak okay and so this wasn't

595
00:23:42,269 --> 00:23:46,710
subtle there was a complete drop-off as

596
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,780
you leave the foothills and go out onto

597
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:50,130
the Prairie and there could be a lot of

598
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:52,440
explanations for that that aren't

599
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,820
adaptive but we don't often see

600
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,430
something like this and we thought you

601
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:58,829
know going from a major peak to nothing

602
00:23:56,430 --> 00:24:04,890
is interesting we need to follow up on

603
00:23:58,829 --> 00:24:09,299
this and so we did a couple of unbiased

604
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:12,330
um surveys and statistical analyses just

605
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:14,039
to make sure we weren't guilty of

606
00:24:12,329 --> 00:24:15,329
circular thinking we weren't too excited

607
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:17,279
about lentil all it could be all kinds

608
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:18,779
of other things going on here so we

609
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,220
measured everything what you see here

610
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:21,839
are all the floral volatiles and

611
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,940
everything in gray is a measurement

612
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:26,039
flower flare to Blanc Corolla diameter

613
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,380
her kaga me and we and from all these

614
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:31,379
populations and then we put them into

615
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:34,200
random forests which is a machine

616
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:36,240
learning algorithm which tells you what

617
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,279
variables are responsible for separating

618
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,890
populations out from each other

619
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:43,200
statistically and so what you look for

620
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:45,930
is a Gini coefficient and the biggest

621
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,779
one by far was our friend our - Lin wall

622
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:50,279
okay there's another floral volatile up

623
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:53,490
there Jasmine lactone and then there's

624
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:55,170
some floral morphometrics that are

625
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:57,109
giving larger Gini coefficients but the

626
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:59,610
rest of the volatiles are pretty paltry

627
00:24:57,109 --> 00:25:02,039
okay so that's good

628
00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:04,979
how do I know what this is here's the

629
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:06,809
chromatography so Florence is in the

630
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,089
foothills and there's a big little peak

631
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:12,480
there's this mass spectrum again David's

632
00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:14,359
Canyon is out by La Junta on the on the

633
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,740
Prairie and there's no little all at all

634
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:19,079
this is presence/absence

635
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,359
okay and then the rest are kind of

636
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:23,669
typical flower volatiles osa means carry

637
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,009
off alene there's a Jasmine lactone that

638
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:29,100
makes these things smell like gardenias

639
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:30,900
etc fennel seed and I trial with lack

640
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:34,169
which lentil little is it we bought a

641
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:37,800
chiral column here's the racemic mixture

642
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:40,230
Sigma R minus S Plus here's coriander

643
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:41,639
which is S Plus only here's our minus

644
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:44,160
only which you can buy from Sigma and

645
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,950
here's the oenothera with and without

646
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:51,300
the spike so it's definitely making if

647
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:53,640
not completely all our - then mostly all

648
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,899
there's a little bump here not sure

649
00:25:53,640 --> 00:26:00,559
it's also making a little bit of S Plus

650
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:03,590
but it's hugely dominant R - okay it

651
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:06,859
drift what's going on these police tuddy

652
00:26:03,589 --> 00:26:09,199
18 athira herring Tony I because that

653
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:11,689
part of Colorado is getting hammered by

654
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,129
human change the cities of Pueblo and

655
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,720
Colorado Springs are growing in all

656
00:26:13,128 --> 00:26:15,259
directions there's a lot of light

657
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,999
pollution

658
00:26:15,259 --> 00:26:18,649
hawkmoths can't come to flowers if

659
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:21,558
they're flying around stadium lights you

660
00:26:18,648 --> 00:26:24,048
getting eaten by bats so we thought oh

661
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:25,099
there could be some local pub you know

662
00:26:24,048 --> 00:26:26,418
adrift

663
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:29,480
if these populations aren't getting

664
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:31,759
pollinated by moths answer as they are

665
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,399
there's there's did this amazing gene

666
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:37,490
flow FST is tiny across these 25

667
00:26:34,398 --> 00:26:38,989
populations we honor Agra wall developed

668
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:40,759
micro satellite primers free and if

669
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:42,679
you're a by Ennis which is a common weed

670
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:46,819
around here and they work green ethera

671
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:48,740
herring Tony I and yeah this result

672
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:51,079
shows that there's huge amounts of gene

673
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:55,548
flow between all these populations and

674
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:57,589
when we look at the structure analysis

675
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:59,778
and we look at you know the alleles for

676
00:26:57,589 --> 00:27:01,638
these micro sets you know there's

677
00:26:59,778 --> 00:27:03,589
there's sort of tacit support for maybe

678
00:27:01,638 --> 00:27:05,209
three conceptual populations but there's

679
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:07,398
no private alleles okay

680
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:10,429
there's no evidence that would make you

681
00:27:07,398 --> 00:27:11,418
think Rob this is drift you know it's a

682
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:13,669
neutral trait

683
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:15,110
give it up all right it's not what's

684
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:18,440
going on here this gene flow across this

685
00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:21,829
whole region okay and this is just

686
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,600
another way of doing that this is a qst

687
00:27:21,829 --> 00:27:25,699
versus FST looking at quantitative

688
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:28,490
variation in greenhouse grown

689
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:31,759
heritability type study comparing it

690
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:34,878
against FST and only lentil all for all

691
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:37,099
the scent traits and flora morphology

692
00:27:34,878 --> 00:27:40,459
only lentil all in the Jasmine lactone

693
00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:42,408
come out looking you know significantly

694
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:45,169
higher than what we'd expect by by

695
00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:47,690
neutral neutral models okay so it looks

696
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:49,460
like it might be adaptive the the the

697
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:51,558
variation in lentil all might be

698
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,600
adaptive all right so let's look at the

699
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:55,220
map we filled it out we went back first

700
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:57,079
year we got the the grant we went back

701
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:59,929
and hit the other populations so now

702
00:27:57,079 --> 00:28:02,509
we've got 19 populations with micro sets

703
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:05,389
and floral scent so the colored pie

704
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:07,220
charts every time you see yellow that's

705
00:28:05,388 --> 00:28:09,618
the proportion of plants in the

706
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:11,600
population that had lentil all okay or

707
00:28:09,618 --> 00:28:14,118
the amount of lentil all in the floral

708
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:17,509
scent on average so

709
00:28:14,118 --> 00:28:18,858
you see that in the northwest they're

710
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:20,598
really putting out a lot of lentil all

711
00:28:18,858 --> 00:28:24,288
and that Peters out in the southeast

712
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:25,968
okay and so one of the questions was it

713
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:28,009
is there a difference upon ears I

714
00:28:25,969 --> 00:28:29,808
already showed you a slide showing you

715
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:32,149
the best not true and so in fact when we

716
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:34,009
lump all the little producing and non

717
00:28:32,148 --> 00:28:36,288
producing populations together and look

718
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:38,209
at their average visitation rates for

719
00:28:36,288 --> 00:28:40,128
hawk moths and for bees there's no

720
00:28:38,209 --> 00:28:42,589
differences here okay these things are

721
00:28:40,128 --> 00:28:44,208
almost uniform across their range so

722
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:47,989
they have gene flow and they have the

723
00:28:44,209 --> 00:28:49,519
same floral visitors and pollinators so

724
00:28:47,989 --> 00:28:51,558
for you to have a different trait in the

725
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,169
face of all that also suggests that

726
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:54,949
you've got something adaptive going on

727
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:56,299
so the next question goes well what

728
00:28:54,949 --> 00:28:58,009
about enemies okay

729
00:28:56,298 --> 00:28:59,088
hi leaves is visiting the flowers but

730
00:28:58,009 --> 00:29:02,689
they're also turning around and dropping

731
00:28:59,088 --> 00:29:04,638
eggs on them so what if the herbivore

732
00:29:02,689 --> 00:29:08,359
pressure from the caterpillars of high

733
00:29:04,638 --> 00:29:13,698
leaves might be a problem as well as mom

734
00:29:08,358 --> 00:29:15,259
fuh okay so then when we look at at the

735
00:29:13,699 --> 00:29:17,479
the caterpillars and eggs

736
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:19,639
this is eggs of white line sphinx

737
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:22,278
there's a lot more eggs on the plants

738
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:24,438
when there's no little okay when there's

739
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:29,028
little all there's there's relatively

740
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:34,519
few eggs so that's interesting and here

741
00:29:29,028 --> 00:29:36,618
what we have is bonfá seed predation so

742
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:38,419
the proportion of fruits that have mama

743
00:29:36,618 --> 00:29:40,698
in them and so when little all is

744
00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:42,949
present there's more of those fruits

745
00:29:40,699 --> 00:29:44,269
that are getting hammered okay so

746
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:45,859
there's something weird going on here

747
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:48,618
that little all might actually help the

748
00:29:45,858 --> 00:29:49,968
plant fight against Kylie's might be

749
00:29:48,618 --> 00:29:52,068
calling the third trophic level it might

750
00:29:49,969 --> 00:29:54,379
be calling an egg predators and first

751
00:29:52,068 --> 00:29:56,658
instar larvae predators to remove those

752
00:29:54,378 --> 00:30:02,298
guys but little all may make the plant

753
00:29:56,659 --> 00:30:04,249
vulnerable to Samantha okay so then the

754
00:30:02,298 --> 00:30:05,449
question is you're assuming that they

755
00:30:04,249 --> 00:30:07,278
can spell it you're assuming that they

756
00:30:05,449 --> 00:30:07,939
care you know go to the wind tunnel into

757
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:09,499
a bioassay

758
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:12,319
we can do that with Halley's because we

759
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:16,818
have it mama is a wild animal we can't

760
00:30:12,318 --> 00:30:20,088
yet raise it so Jeff broadhead ran some

761
00:30:16,818 --> 00:30:22,489
electron tena Grahams and so what these

762
00:30:20,088 --> 00:30:24,348
are is here's here's the response to

763
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:25,818
hexane which is nothing special but

764
00:30:24,348 --> 00:30:27,950
here's the antennae responding to our

765
00:30:25,818 --> 00:30:29,960
plus little aw okay and that's a nice

766
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,210
flection that's a good-sized amount

767
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,909
that's that's a one in 1,000 dilation of

768
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:36,950
little oil in hexane and here's mama

769
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:39,710
Antony responding to the same stimulus

770
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:41,630
not very much to hexane and very very

771
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:43,579
nicely to our - little wall here it's

772
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:45,320
responding to a rolled-up flower petal

773
00:30:43,579 --> 00:30:47,990
in a Pasteur pipette so that's the whole

774
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:49,849
blend so this is just proof of concept

775
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:51,230
that they can smell these things okay

776
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:54,759
doesn't mean behaviorally that they like

777
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:54,759
them but at least they can smell them

778
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,139
what are the units the vertical units

779
00:30:57,558 --> 00:31:03,079
are millivolts and the horizontal are a

780
00:31:00,138 --> 00:31:05,209
time in seconds thank you the red bar is

781
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:07,189
the duration of the stimulus so we're

782
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:09,440
puffing an odor over an antenna and then

783
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:10,909
stopping the puffs okay so these are a

784
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,259
half second H and these are a second

785
00:31:10,909 --> 00:31:16,909
each thanks all right so here I want to

786
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:19,419
show you a great video that that's sold

787
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:26,389
by Buena collection just a few days ago

788
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:28,610
of how highly is handled flowers this is

789
00:31:26,388 --> 00:31:31,759
the first visit this moth has never seen

790
00:31:28,609 --> 00:31:34,459
this flower before okay and so you can

791
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:35,990
see the amazing contact that it made

792
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,028
with the stigma and with the anthers

793
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:40,069
pulled off a lot of pollen on its on its

794
00:31:38,028 --> 00:31:42,470
legs we see this in the field all the

795
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:45,038
time all the time this is this was

796
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:49,970
actually done in a wind tunnel

797
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:58,339
what's the dot this is a satay spike

798
00:31:49,970 --> 00:32:01,460
with a with a septum on it and this is

799
00:31:58,339 --> 00:32:03,769
the segue into a field experiment that

800
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,690
we did where we we added little all to

801
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:07,250
flowers that didn't have them and so

802
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:09,380
that's what Sol is doing in these

803
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:11,298
experiments she's flying moths to

804
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,039
flowers from the David's Canyon

805
00:32:11,298 --> 00:32:14,690
population that doesn't have lintel all

806
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:16,879
and she's adding lintel all to half of

807
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:23,210
them and not to the others and asking if

808
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:25,010
the mods care okay now here's the other

809
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:28,009
star here's mom feh I've shown you still

810
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:31,009
photos of her but you need to see how

811
00:32:28,009 --> 00:32:33,470
she behaves okay look at the antenna she

812
00:32:31,009 --> 00:32:35,359
is drumming her antenna on the surface

813
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:37,639
of the petal this is at dusk the same

814
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:40,278
time that hylians visits the flowers

815
00:32:37,638 --> 00:32:41,759
pollinator and enemy responding to the

816
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:45,539
same shoes

817
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:48,599
okay and what she did later on in that

818
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:50,609
sequence is she went all the way down

819
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:52,740
that tube took a drink came out and

820
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:54,539
dropped an egg I wish I had that

821
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:58,769
unfilmed but we've seen it now a hundred

822
00:32:54,539 --> 00:33:01,829
times so what we needed to do was an

823
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:05,039
augmentation experiment it's hard to

824
00:33:01,829 --> 00:33:06,750
knock in traits to a plant that you have

825
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,299
that you haven't worked with you know

826
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:12,210
genome weekly but we certainly could get

827
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:13,500
the emission rates right and add them to

828
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:15,180
the cut to the plants out in the field

829
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,039
so this is David's Canyon it's a short

830
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:19,380
grass prairie it's pretty amazing

831
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,099
open place we supplemented lentil all on

832
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:24,630
flowers every day for about five weeks

833
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:27,659
seventy percent of the flowers got got

834
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:29,400
lentil all we measured herb every the

835
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:31,500
number of eggs that I'm of caterpillars

836
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:34,980
the damage we looked at pollen

837
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:36,299
deposition and removal from flowers we

838
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,759
collected all the fruits to score the

839
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:41,700
presence of mom for caterpillars and

840
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:43,680
their feces and and how many and loss of

841
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:47,190
seeds etc okay

842
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:49,049
and this is just to show you that the

843
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:52,080
augmentation worked all right so we're

844
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:53,879
adding odor at time zero and then an

845
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:56,039
hour later we're collecting it and this

846
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,690
is just a slow decay curve over the

847
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:59,190
whole night and then after sunrise the

848
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,170
emission rates increased a little bit

849
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,789
because it got warmer but basically it

850
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:04,800
can these plants continued the

851
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:07,200
treatments continued to emit little all

852
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:09,239
through the night okay so it wasn't a

853
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,909
15-minute experiment which would have

854
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:14,069
been an easy criticism we nailed not

855
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:15,989
only the first hour when both friend and

856
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:18,539
foe are visiting the flowers but we kept

857
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:22,169
it going all night all right so we're

858
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:24,989
going to use path analysis here to show

859
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:27,119
you what happened when you add little

860
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:29,429
all it increases pollen deposition okay

861
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,859
so that's a positive coefficient here a

862
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:34,559
significant coefficient probably because

863
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:36,390
of more pollinator visitation we're not

864
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,549
sure because we couldn't be there to see

865
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:40,619
all of them but that's what makes sense

866
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:43,650
the bees never deposit poem so is

867
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:44,730
probably the hawkmoths lintel all

868
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:46,829
edition of lintel I'll also

869
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:49,320
significantly increased infestation by

870
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:51,659
monthly okay so the plants that don't

871
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,000
make lentil all and we jacked up the

872
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:56,000
number of mindful larvae we were finding

873
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,789
in the

874
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,010
the other thing it did is it knocked

875
00:34:58,789 --> 00:35:02,778
down the number of caterpillars but not

876
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:05,750
the number of eggs so adding little all

877
00:35:02,778 --> 00:35:08,889
didn't reduce over position on the plant

878
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:11,449
by female hawkmoths what it did is it

879
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:13,338
reduced the survivorship or the presence

880
00:35:11,449 --> 00:35:15,949
of the caterpillars once they hatch from

881
00:35:13,338 --> 00:35:17,750
those eggs we don't know if that means

882
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:21,828
that they left the plant or they got

883
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:23,139
killed okay but they weren't there and

884
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:25,940
then

885
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:27,889
so here's putting it all together that

886
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:29,358
lintel has a positive effect on Martha

887
00:35:27,889 --> 00:35:31,098
which has a negative effect on seed

888
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:34,219
fitness so this is a classic path

889
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:35,390
analysis you know result the enemy of

890
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:39,798
your friend of your enemy is your friend

891
00:35:35,389 --> 00:35:42,588
etc and it suggests that what we're

892
00:35:39,798 --> 00:35:44,239
seeing in the southeast part of the

893
00:35:42,588 --> 00:35:46,130
range where we did this experiment is

894
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:48,889
that Lin allows a liability that if

895
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:51,289
flowers were to make it there they would

896
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:56,420
incur fitness loss buy more seed

897
00:35:51,289 --> 00:36:00,470
predation okay so we went back to the

898
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:02,269
Carter where the Marfa infestation was

899
00:36:00,469 --> 00:36:07,669
highest and that's this road down here

900
00:36:02,268 --> 00:36:09,199
interstate 25 down to Albuquerque okay

901
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:11,329
and these populations down here had the

902
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:14,058
highest mom fed infestation so we went

903
00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:16,068
went back the next year 2017 to these

904
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:19,490
four populations or five populations and

905
00:36:16,068 --> 00:36:20,869
we did a correlative study this is a

906
00:36:19,489 --> 00:36:24,709
phenotypic selection study where you

907
00:36:20,869 --> 00:36:27,858
regress a fruit set and seed sets you

908
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:30,259
Fitness against everything you can

909
00:36:27,858 --> 00:36:33,139
measure flower size flower number lintel

910
00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:34,699
all emission rates etc okay now here's

911
00:36:33,139 --> 00:36:36,078
what we found there are five populations

912
00:36:34,699 --> 00:36:38,480
all over here in the serve Death Valley

913
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,430
from mom feh all these other traits

914
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,829
Corolla diameter flare to blank for

915
00:36:40,429 --> 00:36:45,889
Kagamine nectar volume sucrose the major

916
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:47,930
four compounds none of these departed

917
00:36:45,889 --> 00:36:49,730
from null expectations and any of the

918
00:36:47,929 --> 00:36:52,788
five populations except lentil all and

919
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:53,750
it happened only in rouse which is right

920
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:56,569
there

921
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:58,219
and what was funny about rouse it was

922
00:36:56,568 --> 00:37:00,920
that it was an alley effect it was a

923
00:36:58,219 --> 00:37:03,348
small population with small plants so

924
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:06,170
what we think is happening is that a

925
00:37:03,349 --> 00:37:08,690
large robust plant with 80 flowers per

926
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:10,490
year can tolerate

927
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:12,349
damage from mom fauxmance because it's

928
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:16,159
still gonna make fifty or sixty fruits

929
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:18,619
but a small plant in a bad year with no

930
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:21,409
second chance because it's an annual and

931
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:24,289
no ability to self pollinate that's when

932
00:37:21,409 --> 00:37:26,929
the screws get tightened so that's what

933
00:37:24,289 --> 00:37:28,909
we think after five years that's what we

934
00:37:26,929 --> 00:37:31,098
think we're seeing it's really hard to

935
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:33,949
do this and coefficients are not very

936
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:35,869
satisfying but this is all the all the

937
00:37:33,949 --> 00:37:38,779
assays together lead us to believe that

938
00:37:35,869 --> 00:37:43,250
this is what's happened okay and so in

939
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:46,010
some plants eyes and whatever abiotic

940
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:48,650
factors influence plant size is probably

941
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:53,450
setting the context for whether this

942
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:55,608
hurts that okay so let me finish by

943
00:37:53,449 --> 00:37:57,919
asking if we scale this up outside of

944
00:37:55,608 --> 00:38:00,650
Colorado outside of this one species

945
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,838
that that we obsessed with for five

946
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:05,119
years do we see anything else that's

947
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:07,190
useful we see these patterns propagating

948
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,400
across the American West do we see in

949
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:14,300
John Thompson's parlance Geographic

950
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:17,000
mosaic of Co evolutionary processes so

951
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:19,339
here's the family on a Gracie I'm sorry

952
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,349
for the lack of confidence values but

953
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:23,480
this is a cartoon just to show you that

954
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:26,119
the ancestral condition for the whole

955
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:29,480
group is almost certainly be pollination

956
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:31,640
with one or two transitions to a

957
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:35,088
hummingbird pollination these are not

958
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:37,578
indicative of species richness fucsia is

959
00:38:35,088 --> 00:38:39,920
a huge genus epilobium is a huge genus

960
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:42,740
just focusing on a you know thira here

961
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,858
so you know theory itself probably was

962
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:47,750
ancestrally be pollinated we have strong

963
00:38:45,858 --> 00:38:49,699
support for a lot of these transitions

964
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:52,699
here and it looks like there was a there

965
00:38:49,699 --> 00:38:55,309
was one major transition to hawk moth

966
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:56,838
pollination at the root of many of these

967
00:38:55,309 --> 00:38:59,420
oenothera lineages and then they

968
00:38:56,838 --> 00:39:01,519
translate to self pollination or knock

969
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:04,670
to it moth pollination or back to bees

970
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:07,068
so we wanted to capture some of this

971
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:09,019
diversity file ethically these are some

972
00:39:07,068 --> 00:39:10,130
of the species that we worked with

973
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:12,230
including clark eeeh

974
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:14,420
the plant i worked with as a grad

975
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:16,608
student with one species out of 45's

976
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,530
hawk moth pollinated okay so there's

977
00:39:16,608 --> 00:39:22,500
several different clades represented

978
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:24,590
here in our plan so what we wanted to do

979
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,809
was hit 15 different species

980
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:29,700
strategically chosen to represent you

981
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:32,039
know couplets closely related species

982
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:35,099
whose biology we suspected was going to

983
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:37,110
be very different and and here's their

984
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:38,909
relationships phylogenetically and what

985
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:41,250
you see here is that for each color bar

986
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:43,289
that's a species and each one of them

987
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:46,440
had three to five populations that we

988
00:39:43,289 --> 00:39:47,909
went out sampled over five years and so

989
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,700
they're all color coded across the

990
00:39:47,909 --> 00:39:52,289
American West now again not a bad place

991
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:54,449
to work

992
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:56,489
pretty amazing there's no normal years

993
00:39:54,449 --> 00:39:58,289
right every year is different for

994
00:39:56,489 --> 00:40:00,809
rainfall and for the early onset of

995
00:39:58,289 --> 00:40:02,579
blooming or a great monsoon and

996
00:40:00,809 --> 00:40:04,019
everything blooms again you know in the

997
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:05,849
Chihuahuan Desert in August the first

998
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:08,940
year of the project we had a September

999
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:10,500
bloom you just got to run and do it but

1000
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,809
what we wanted to do was capture some of

1001
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:15,119
that population level variation that we

1002
00:40:12,809 --> 00:40:19,289
had seen in oenothera herring Tony I out

1003
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:21,150
here try to get sort of smaller versions

1004
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:24,239
of that variation and as many other

1005
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:26,519
species as we could and so our approach

1006
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,859
was again to bring out large teams and

1007
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:31,139
standardize the data collection floral

1008
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:33,780
scent morphology nectar pollinator

1009
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:35,909
visitation herb every Haley's eggs and

1010
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:39,510
larvae mama in the buds and in the

1011
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:41,579
fruits who worked in 58 populations many

1012
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:44,490
many states this is a lot of work that

1013
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:47,759
most of the budget of the project and

1014
00:40:44,489 --> 00:40:51,179
yet the players are so similar across

1015
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:54,660
the whole family the same enemies the

1016
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:57,239
same friends and so here's a quick look

1017
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:59,369
a little all polymorphism extended well

1018
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:01,319
beyond mean if they were hiring Tony I

1019
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:02,819
differs among sibling species and among

1020
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,360
populations with different species of

1021
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:07,800
oenothera

1022
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:10,170
so there's a couple of independent

1023
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,580
origins of s plus little all we knew

1024
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:13,289
about Clark your brewery because that's

1025
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:14,610
what I studied as a grad student but

1026
00:41:13,289 --> 00:41:16,920
there's another one in the section

1027
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:18,630
cattle office that accompany to switch

1028
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,500
from hawk moth ancestry to be

1029
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:24,599
pollination in West Texas okay then

1030
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:27,300
there's a couple of examples here where

1031
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:29,309
an ancestry is is likely a little el

1032
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:32,670
producer and there's been an inferred

1033
00:41:29,309 --> 00:41:34,769
loss of our - little all okay here this

1034
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:35,920
is a switch to be pollination this one

1035
00:41:34,769 --> 00:41:37,449
here

1036
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,920
is still being pollinated by hawkmoths

1037
00:41:37,449 --> 00:41:40,989
like some of the populations of

1038
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,400
oenothera herring Tony I this one here

1039
00:41:40,989 --> 00:41:45,129
in athira Brackett Carper has the

1040
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,070
largest flowers and the genus it makes

1041
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:51,460
no sense and it makes no sense

1042
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:54,090
it is almost entirely vegetatively

1043
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:56,619
propagating at this point and it's being

1044
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:57,820
destroyed by mom feh so we don't know

1045
00:41:56,619 --> 00:42:00,009
how they're flying to finding the

1046
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:05,559
flowers but but they've almost given up

1047
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:07,690
on pollinator display and so the

1048
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:12,039
question we asked is if you take all of

1049
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:14,490
this data can we ask how to what extent

1050
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:16,420
pollinators versus mom fuh are

1051
00:42:14,489 --> 00:42:19,709
structuring some of the data the

1052
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:21,970
variation in the data sets so this is a

1053
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:25,690
fight we're gonna do a file genetically

1054
00:42:21,969 --> 00:42:28,449
controlled multiple regression okay

1055
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:30,340
and taking into account phylogenetic

1056
00:42:28,449 --> 00:42:32,859
distance Geographic distance pollinator

1057
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:35,500
distance and and which species of mom

1058
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:37,660
feh and the and the coefficients we got

1059
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:40,150
for pollinators were both for morphology

1060
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:42,029
and scent and for Mantha interestingly

1061
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:45,940
enough even though we know that flower

1062
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:48,040
trumpet flare matters to mom feh in that

1063
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:49,720
this phylogenetic scale they were

1064
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:52,210
explaining more variation in scent and

1065
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:54,459
not so much in morphology so we had the

1066
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:55,960
right to look at it now this is

1067
00:42:54,460 --> 00:43:00,099
basically a principal components

1068
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:02,500
analysis of flower morphology across all

1069
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:04,389
of our taxa and what you see here are

1070
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:08,199
the be pollinated ones are clustering up

1071
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:10,900
here in a Morpho space the high Lee's

1072
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:12,579
small medium sized hawkmoth pollinated

1073
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,019
ones are clustering over here and then

1074
00:43:12,579 --> 00:43:16,840
the ones with really long tongues and

1075
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:18,539
tubes are clustering down here okay so

1076
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:22,390
this is very pollinators are very nicely

1077
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:24,130
explaining variation in more flow space

1078
00:43:22,389 --> 00:43:25,719
although each of these dots is a

1079
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:27,460
different population and certainly in

1080
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:29,230
many cases there's considerable

1081
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:33,849
variation between populations of the

1082
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:35,769
same species okay for scent these are

1083
00:43:33,849 --> 00:43:38,230
all hawk moth pollinated species and

1084
00:43:35,769 --> 00:43:39,519
they're all over the board okay so some

1085
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:41,530
of them are making our little law but

1086
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:43,690
that's not a strong predictor is

1087
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:48,130
nitrogenous compounds down here there's

1088
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:49,150
s little all up there so and and look at

1089
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:52,150
also this

1090
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:53,858
in Morpho space or in chemical space of

1091
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:56,230
these populations of the same species

1092
00:43:53,858 --> 00:43:59,710
these guys are close these guys are not

1093
00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:01,960
okay whereas the be pollinated ones are

1094
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:06,369
often the periphery they are really

1095
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:08,769
leaving the chemical space so between

1096
00:44:06,369 --> 00:44:11,619
them we think we have a lot of structure

1097
00:44:08,768 --> 00:44:13,118
here here's what mama does alright

1098
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:15,490
here's the same phylogenetic

1099
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:18,130
relationships the pie charts if they're

1100
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:20,318
blue mean that that species at least in

1101
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:21,579
some populations has our - little wall

1102
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:23,558
which we've been talking about all the

1103
00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:25,839
time if they're yellow they've switched

1104
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:26,680
to s plus limb wall and we don't know

1105
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:28,480
what that means

1106
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:29,919
it's tracts moths but we don't know if

1107
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,009
it attracts Mom feh

1108
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,619
almost done um and then if they're gray

1109
00:44:33,009 --> 00:44:38,108
they've lost little all entirely and so

1110
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:41,499
here the black bars show how many

1111
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:44,469
populations in species X has infestation

1112
00:44:41,498 --> 00:44:47,768
from mom feh some species are free of

1113
00:44:44,469 --> 00:44:49,209
mom feh others are not and then we're

1114
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:51,699
tracking the different kinds of month as

1115
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:55,239
the flower bud galling ones and the seed

1116
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:57,068
capsule galling ones so the good news is

1117
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:57,460
there's an awful lot of stuff going on

1118
00:44:57,068 --> 00:44:59,170
here

1119
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:02,278
the bad news is there's not a clear

1120
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:05,200
direction of one mom for species driving

1121
00:45:02,278 --> 00:45:08,318
flowers to be silent removing scent

1122
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:10,268
entirely and in fact there's other

1123
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:11,679
species that are shifting to diurnal bee

1124
00:45:10,268 --> 00:45:13,598
pollination and are still getting

1125
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:15,308
hammered by mom fuh okay

1126
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,480
you would imagine that maybe those

1127
00:45:15,309 --> 00:45:20,048
flowers would be under selection to

1128
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:22,920
close at night when Mom for active okay

1129
00:45:20,048 --> 00:45:25,449
so to wrap up what have we learned

1130
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,789
little ole emission is certainly a

1131
00:45:25,449 --> 00:45:29,798
labile trait within population species

1132
00:45:27,789 --> 00:45:31,210
and sections of oenothera and I've shown

1133
00:45:29,798 --> 00:45:33,900
you that it's found across the world in

1134
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:35,949
all kinds of other angiosperm families

1135
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:38,200
little all appears to be selected

1136
00:45:35,949 --> 00:45:40,419
against by seed predator mom foe moths

1137
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:42,489
without sacrificing Hailey's pollination

1138
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:45,548
services which leads to the question of

1139
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:47,380
why is little all needed at all and in

1140
00:45:45,548 --> 00:45:49,230
Eden Sara herring Tony I in similar

1141
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:51,489
species it might be a phylogenetic

1142
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:55,659
artifact is a shared derived trait in

1143
00:45:51,489 --> 00:45:57,159
that group of oenothera escaped from mom

1144
00:45:55,659 --> 00:45:58,719
from might involve the loss of little

1145
00:45:57,159 --> 00:46:00,759
all let's switch to a different

1146
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:02,048
enantiomer of little all switch to be

1147
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:02,780
pollination or switch to self

1148
00:46:02,048 --> 00:46:06,530
pollination

1149
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:08,510
um and herbivores in some clearly play

1150
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:09,980
important roles and complex roles as

1151
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:13,130
selective agents on florals and

1152
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:14,570
variation so I want to thank the big

1153
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:17,210
team that we worked with in the field

1154
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:19,730
over five years Amherst College Chicago

1155
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:23,059
Botanic Garden and Warren Wagner from

1156
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:25,340
the Smithsonian and certainly Jeff

1157
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:28,250
broadhead so la buena and Deidre

1158
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:29,900
Jacobson for helping us to to study some

1159
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:33,170
of these interactions here in Cornell

1160
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:35,960
during the year and our funding sources

1161
00:46:33,170 --> 00:47:01,880
and co-operators and thanks very much

1162
00:46:35,960 --> 00:47:04,190
look forward to questions right so this

1163
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:06,289
is this is another prediction of the

1164
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:08,119
geographic mosaic that not all not all

1165
00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:09,559
odors are attractive and there should be

1166
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:15,349
strong selective pressure either to hide

1167
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:18,019
or to push away we have to do the

1168
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:20,360
experiments one of the it's interesting

1169
00:47:18,019 --> 00:47:22,909
that the second compound that showed up

1170
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:26,269
in the qst FST analysis was Jasmine

1171
00:47:22,909 --> 00:47:29,719
lactone it's not a common compound in

1172
00:47:26,269 --> 00:47:33,800
flowers except in Jasmine but lactones

1173
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:36,459
have a repellent quality in in in insect

1174
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:38,510
control lactones can often be repellent

1175
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:40,369
so that's a compound that we could

1176
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:43,640
actually add to flowers and see if we

1177
00:47:40,369 --> 00:47:45,710
reduce mama attack the several of the

1178
00:47:43,639 --> 00:47:48,019
ones that had no mom for attacking them

1179
00:47:45,710 --> 00:48:01,240
actually produce lactones it's a good

1180
00:47:48,019 --> 00:48:03,440
question yeah that's a good question I

1181
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:06,109
think that they have enough standing

1182
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,700
variation in each population but that

1183
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:09,740
the selection could act pretty quickly

1184
00:48:07,699 --> 00:48:12,529
we've wanted to do we were really

1185
00:48:09,739 --> 00:48:14,119
sensitive to the problem of not going to

1186
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:16,160
the populations that make lentil all and

1187
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:16,460
turning it off right I mean that would

1188
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,289
be the

1189
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:21,199
in baldwin way to do it is to use gene

1190
00:48:18,289 --> 00:48:23,029
silencing or to breed you know to

1191
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:24,710
breathe uh the few individuals in those

1192
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:26,150
populations that don't make little oh of

1193
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:27,858
course there could be all kinds of other

1194
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:30,108
things that are coming along with them

1195
00:48:27,858 --> 00:48:31,489
so you really do want a real it would

1196
00:48:30,108 --> 00:48:35,269
take a decade to make rolls with these

1197
00:48:31,489 --> 00:48:36,079
guys but a reciprocal transplant would

1198
00:48:35,269 --> 00:48:37,940
be interesting

1199
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,909
I mean ethically he would want to every

1200
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:43,960
move for pollen I would guess but you

1201
00:48:40,909 --> 00:48:46,098
certainly could look at bonfá attack on

1202
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,858
plants from the Prairie that were grown

1203
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:50,210
in Colorado Springs for plants from

1204
00:48:48,858 --> 00:48:52,369
Colorado Springs that were being grown

1205
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:56,119
out in the Prairie to water them every

1206
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:57,890
day would not work it is a parched Park

1207
00:48:56,119 --> 00:48:59,510
Place Sol and I went to work there this

1208
00:48:57,889 --> 00:49:01,338
spring and it was an unbelievable

1209
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:04,010
drought there were no bees just a few

1210
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:06,289
plants blooming it is the fate of the

1211
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:09,080
West at the moment and and and Prairie

1212
00:49:06,289 --> 00:49:12,050
Colorado is becoming the Chihuahuan

1213
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:13,900
Desert so a we we we were aware that we

1214
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:15,920
wanted to do reciprocal transplants that

1215
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:36,588
would have been a really nice experiment

1216
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:38,809
to do yeah pie charts pie charts are

1217
00:49:36,588 --> 00:49:40,969
crude that's a great question what we in

1218
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:43,789
in the publication that we're about to

1219
00:49:40,969 --> 00:49:45,289
submit we quantify so we do is is we

1220
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:47,300
always have an internal standard in our

1221
00:49:45,289 --> 00:49:50,000
chromatography just to make sure that we

1222
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:52,820
haven't injected the wrong amount but

1223
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,989
then we run external standard curves for

1224
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,789
all the major volatiles and we

1225
00:49:53,989 --> 00:49:57,559
quantitate them independently because in

1226
00:49:55,789 --> 00:49:59,929
mass spectrometry you have really

1227
00:49:57,559 --> 00:50:00,769
different response factors to the 70

1228
00:49:59,929 --> 00:50:03,799
electron volts

1229
00:50:00,769 --> 00:50:06,199
you know ionizing radiation so energy

1230
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:09,050
rather so so yeah we quantitate them all

1231
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:11,079
and we and we we try to eschew percent

1232
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:15,050
of total we try to actually present

1233
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:19,598
nanograms or micrograms per flower per

1234
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:19,599
hour or per gram of flower per hour

1235
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:27,500
potentially having different in

1236
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:29,329
different concentrations yeah that's a

1237
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,019
that's a great question the dose often

1238
00:50:29,329 --> 00:50:32,090
makes the

1239
00:50:30,019 --> 00:50:34,070
or the attractant in chemical ecology

1240
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:36,470
what we found is that there are

1241
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:38,210
plasticity issues when we grow the

1242
00:50:36,469 --> 00:50:41,839
plants from Florence which make huge

1243
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:44,869
Peaks in our greenhouse with no UV okay

1244
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:47,960
those Peaks fall fourfold in peak area

1245
00:50:44,869 --> 00:50:49,550
okay so we were conservative the amount

1246
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,769
of little L that we added in the field

1247
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:54,050
was the greenhouse amount and not the

1248
00:50:51,769 --> 00:50:55,730
field amount we were we were worried if

1249
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:58,490
we added too much lintel all we'd have

1250
00:50:55,730 --> 00:51:00,139
some artifact of toxicity so we actually

1251
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:04,279
chose you know we've lucked into

1252
00:51:00,139 --> 00:51:06,739
actually a an amount that we could add

1253
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:10,280
in the evening that constituted a a

1254
00:51:06,739 --> 00:51:11,479
conservative test yeah no that's but

1255
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,010
that's an important question a chemical

1256
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,980
ecology you have to be very careful

1257
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:18,170
which is why expressing a transgene in a

1258
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:20,900
plant you know with an appropriate

1259
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:23,150
amount of regulation you know could get

1260
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:35,030
you the phenotype you want sure if

1261
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:38,119
you're lucky great question

1262
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:44,510
we did a transcriptomic study which I

1263
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:48,320
didn't show here looking at expression

1264
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:51,080
in stamens stigma petals buzz leaves etc

1265
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:55,390
and we have all kinds of candidates for

1266
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:59,599
an R - little synthase from this plant

1267
00:51:55,389 --> 00:52:02,269
the leaves don't emit very much there's

1268
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:04,130
some Screaming candidates in leaves but

1269
00:52:02,269 --> 00:52:06,259
we don't get a lot of headspace coming

1270
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:07,970
out of them other plants do we're

1271
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:09,260
working with jewelweed right now which

1272
00:52:07,969 --> 00:52:12,289
makes little oh and it's leaves and not

1273
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:14,690
so much in the flowers but this in this

1274
00:52:12,289 --> 00:52:16,969
point in this species the petals are

1275
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:18,800
their source of lentil all the the

1276
00:52:16,969 --> 00:52:20,959
nectar tubes are nine centimeters long

1277
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,100
and there's methyl benzoate in the

1278
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,800
nectar but there's no little all in the

1279
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:26,750
nectar but they're really separate

1280
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,240
functional parts of the flower because

1281
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:42,429
of that distance of thy pantheon so it's

1282
00:52:29,239 --> 00:52:42,429
a good question much lower amounts

1283
00:52:43,579 --> 00:52:54,890
variation and consider factors such as

1284
00:52:47,659 --> 00:53:00,798
environment UV radiation yes thank you

1285
00:52:54,889 --> 00:53:02,118
excellent we did we worried so these are

1286
00:53:00,798 --> 00:53:05,568
the little all producers these are the

1287
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:07,910
little non producers this is an annual

1288
00:53:05,568 --> 00:53:09,889
average high temperatures okay for

1289
00:53:07,909 --> 00:53:11,420
across I guess we have three or four

1290
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:12,858
populations of eh we didn't we didn't

1291
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,999
get weather for all of them because some

1292
00:53:12,858 --> 00:53:14,420
of them are literally in the middle of

1293
00:53:13,998 --> 00:53:18,848
nowhere

1294
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:21,019
um but precipitation there's no pattern

1295
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:24,140
temperature there's no pattern winter

1296
00:53:21,018 --> 00:53:25,998
precipitation there's no pattern we also

1297
00:53:24,139 --> 00:53:29,498
looked at a principal components

1298
00:53:25,998 --> 00:53:33,078
analysis of soil okay they grow in silt

1299
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:35,568
really fine grains and we looked at all

1300
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:37,900
kinds of macronutrients and

1301
00:53:35,568 --> 00:53:45,650
micronutrients and and and particle size

1302
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:47,119
no no clear explanation there yes

1303
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:51,528
absolutely

1304
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:53,180
Florence and a Pueblo Colorado are

1305
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:54,739
coming up off the Prairie you know

1306
00:53:53,179 --> 00:53:56,118
they're they're probably like I mean

1307
00:53:54,739 --> 00:53:57,858
Colorado Springs uh seven Dells would

1308
00:53:56,119 --> 00:54:00,410
feet up right it's higher than Denver

1309
00:53:57,858 --> 00:54:02,808
whereas out in the Prairie it's like

1310
00:54:00,409 --> 00:54:05,298
nineteen 800 or 900 feet above sea level

1311
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:26,569
so there's a considerable drop in

1312
00:54:05,298 --> 00:54:27,920
elevation so yep lots of UV out there

1313
00:54:26,568 --> 00:54:29,748
that's a very good point what's

1314
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:32,420
fascinating is that all the other sent

1315
00:54:29,748 --> 00:54:34,399
compounds don't change well it all seems

1316
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:37,358
to be the one that responds to UV but

1317
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:39,949
that's an excellent point thank you yeah

1318
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:45,099
so I so I should write a grant for UV

1319
00:54:39,949 --> 00:54:48,639
lamps all right thanks

1320
00:54:45,099 --> 00:54:51,710
