1
00:00:02,968 --> 00:00:08,468
so today I'll talk about roots I just

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,240
want to mention one thing before I gave

3
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:14,798
it a lot like two or three months ago at

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:18,640
best so most of the talk today will be

5
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:22,329
new but some of it won't so people who

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,789
are coming back who have to suffer or

7
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:28,868
enjoy again

8
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:31,779
okay so roots so what is so I called it

9
00:00:28,868 --> 00:00:34,469
towards the second revolution and the

10
00:00:31,778 --> 00:00:37,478
question is what is the first revolution

11
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:42,369
so the first Green Revolution is the

12
00:00:37,478 --> 00:00:44,530
attributed to Professor Borlaug and it's

13
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:48,908
considered this huge increase in crop

14
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:53,469
yields mainly grain yields that we we

15
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:57,039
have seen due to use of pesticides and

16
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:59,738
new varieties but these yields got to a

17
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,070
plateau in the last few years with which

18
00:00:59,738 --> 00:01:07,509
this yield or in a pasture and with we

19
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:09,430
are not going up to the next level so we

20
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,980
think because we are good people but

21
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,990
also trying to be objectively but the

22
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,659
next revolution and increasing the yield

23
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:19,000
should come from the roots since the

24
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:22,060
roots and this is towards the second

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,450
grade of evolution were until let's say

26
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:28,689
five years ago much less studied in the

27
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:33,159
above-ground it's like a 5% of

28
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:36,340
publication or were on the roots so what

29
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:39,310
do roots do is have many functions they

30
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:42,219
have anchorage water and nutrient uptake

31
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,439
storage biosynthesis a sexual

32
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:46,510
reproduction and communication with

33
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:49,679
other plants and with the rhizosphere

34
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:53,340
I will now I'll present to you several

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:57,580
studies that were carried out in my lab

36
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,950
these studies not dealing with wood and

37
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:02,259
just to show you how I got excited

38
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,659
in truth so I'll start with the first

39
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:07,150
project so the first project is the role

40
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:10,450
of route orders in water nutrient uptake

41
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:12,760
so we have this title and then the

42
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:16,500
question is what are route orders in

43
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:19,269
order to understand that it will be easy

44
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,359
to first understand what a river stream

45
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:24,670
orders so when you think about rivers

46
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:28,209
it's easy to think that the small Creek

47
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:30,458
goes to a mr. Chris put bigger Creek and

48
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:32,920
then put the large street and as we say

49
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:34,930
in the poem in Hebrews or withers at the

50
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:39,009
end those who the seat so this is the

51
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:42,819
main rivers at sea so the small river is

52
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:45,848
ordering one and the order that gets

53
00:02:42,818 --> 00:02:47,888
orders one is order to if you an order

54
00:02:45,848 --> 00:02:52,988
that gets in order to know in order

55
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:55,269
three and so this is in rivers so in

56
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:59,289
plant it's more or less the same but

57
00:02:55,269 --> 00:03:01,239
it's below ground okay and but and we're

58
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:07,718
not going to the sea but we're going to

59
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:11,200
the tree now in words until and also

60
00:03:07,718 --> 00:03:13,598
today most research is usually based on

61
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:16,209
diameter so we have large roots and

62
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:19,298
small roots fine roots course with

63
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:23,560
different people different and the size

64
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:27,340
is important for people and this term of

65
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:30,128
route orders came up in the literature

66
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,199
already a few years ago but not much

67
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:34,388
research was done about this and we were

68
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:37,449
interested to know what is the function

69
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:39,879
whether there is a function for this

70
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:42,340
specific alternate and what is this

71
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:45,908
so for that you need students or

72
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:48,908
postdocs and we had a very good postdoc

73
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:51,848
in my life both evolved

74
00:03:48,908 --> 00:03:54,878
dr. Roosevelt who's now a CI at boku

75
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:58,448
University and we started to work and

76
00:03:54,878 --> 00:04:02,258
trees and we decided to work on orange

77
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:03,969
trees just what we had and we owe them

78
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:06,818
hydroponic link so you see that growing

79
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:09,459
hydroponically in a nutrient solution

80
00:04:06,818 --> 00:04:12,310
and then we decided to look at the root

81
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:16,090
orders for that we constructed these

82
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:18,848
chambers many chambers see here where

83
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:21,538
they in hold with them a piece of root

84
00:04:18,848 --> 00:04:24,839
order could be root order one two three

85
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:28,848
different wood orders now this chamber

86
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:31,008
we connected to a scale

87
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:33,288
so the plant here this is the orange

88
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:35,899
tree growing in a nutrient solution with

89
00:04:33,288 --> 00:04:38,478
our chamber the chamber is connected to

90
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:42,709
a scale with a nutrient solution now if

91
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:45,110
this area is taking water up so what

92
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:48,079
will happen to the way in the scale it

93
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:51,110
will go down the scale is connected to a

94
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:54,709
computer and by this we could know

95
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:57,559
exactly the rate of uptake of this of

96
00:04:54,709 --> 00:05:01,929
every specific a root order okay this is

97
00:04:57,559 --> 00:05:05,449
the hard thing to explain I hope this is

98
00:05:01,928 --> 00:05:07,278
understandable so we are measuring the

99
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:11,569
uptake of different orders just by

100
00:05:07,278 --> 00:05:15,699
connecting them to a scale and what we

101
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:18,229
see is here we have root orders 1 1 2 3

102
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:20,209
this is distilled water this is under

103
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:23,300
nutrient solution we saw a little bit

104
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:26,689
decrease of uptake when we have nutrient

105
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:29,240
solution versus distilled water but what

106
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:32,449
was interesting but also expected is

107
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,869
that root orders one the smallest with

108
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:39,709
orders or up taking much more water

109
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:43,819
nutrient solution okay so this was

110
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:46,009
expected and then the really surprising

111
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:48,860
thing and the thing that we we were

112
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:50,538
really we had to repeat and repeat in

113
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,718
order to make sure we understand what's

114
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:57,848
happening is when we went to the 4 &amp; 5

115
00:05:53,718 --> 00:06:01,998
root orders the large roots we saw water

116
00:05:57,848 --> 00:06:04,519
coming into the scale the weight is

117
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:06,110
going up we couldn't understand what's

118
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:08,899
happening and we did and again and again

119
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:13,088
and that's what we saw so we have an

120
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:18,019
influx in root order one two three any

121
00:06:13,088 --> 00:06:22,490
flux water coming out from the high root

122
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:26,629
orders now the question was whether this

123
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:30,139
is a active or passive going out of the

124
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:32,479
water I'll show you soon what we think

125
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:34,579
but for sure we have water coming out

126
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:37,158
and I'll tell you now already what what

127
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:40,728
we think is the large root orders or the

128
00:06:37,158 --> 00:06:42,240
main shadows for the tree and they're

129
00:06:40,728 --> 00:06:46,800
usually older

130
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:49,740
so in order to maintain a relatively wet

131
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,038
environment for them not to die these

132
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:56,910
route orders have both passive and

133
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:59,279
active exits of water some people talk

134
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,259
about hydraulic lifts in other papers so

135
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:04,500
this is kind of hydraulic weight but

136
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:06,000
this is in hydroponics okay so we have

137
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,060
to remember this is an aeroponic this

138
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,660
was the first to see that so we see this

139
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:15,478
route orders going out and we see it so

140
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,340
this was I did it by area when we also

141
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:19,079
when we calculated by weight so no

142
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:22,228
matter which we calculate the piece of

143
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:24,870
or roots is there is by area rate we

144
00:07:22,228 --> 00:07:28,560
still see this a flux water coming out

145
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:31,410
of the hi route orders so now we said

146
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,620
okay let's see what happens on the

147
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:36,930
salinity so just when we grow them under

148
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,590
salinity we look here this different

149
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:42,650
route orders so the main effect is to

150
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:45,779
the route or the one they are

151
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:47,969
significantly decreased small holes

152
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:51,989
under salinity also what are the three

153
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:55,470
is decreased significantly but not not

154
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:59,490
very much okay so what happens when we

155
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:01,560
decrease this route order once the

156
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:05,728
hypothesis if we did with them will

157
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:09,720
decrease the uptick of water so we do

158
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:11,310
see here that this this was under

159
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,889
nutrient solution and when we grow them

160
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,658
under salinity you see weight decreased

161
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:22,110
by at least 50%

162
00:08:15,658 --> 00:08:26,219
we but we also saw that the influx that

163
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:29,939
we showed doesn't exist anymore okay

164
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:35,009
there's no water coming out so this

165
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:38,038
shows us that the part of the influx

166
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:43,528
from high orders is also active it's not

167
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:45,509
also only passive effect so and then we

168
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:48,929
say okay this is under salinity now

169
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:51,299
let's give these pans we list them for a

170
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:54,059
stress for two hours we list them from

171
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:56,179
salinity what we see we see this very

172
00:08:54,059 --> 00:09:00,859
large increase

173
00:08:56,179 --> 00:09:02,629
of uptick so the plants are under

174
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,269
salinity the stress they are not taking

175
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:09,049
water you know okay and then we give

176
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:13,250
them an option with no salinity they

177
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:16,189
drink it so this is just a summary this

178
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:19,399
this is by before it was by area this is

179
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:21,520
by weight this is my area so you see

180
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:25,759
this is under control we see this very

181
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:30,379
unique efflux from high root orders

182
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:33,259
under salinity very low uptake and a

183
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:37,338
release you have a very large uptake

184
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:42,769
this is the rate of uptake to jay-c so

185
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:44,420
so this is our first project that I

186
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:46,730
wanted to tell you when we we look at

187
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:48,620
the statistics we see but in these root

188
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,889
orders so you say would order 1 or

189
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:54,740
smaller so maybe bit size but the most

190
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:58,250
statistical thing is the for itself okay

191
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:00,799
not the distance not where it is in the

192
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:03,589
branch not if it's up or down not if

193
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:07,849
it's the diameter the most significant

194
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:10,010
is the root order itself okay and then

195
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,990
we we are continuing to deal with these

196
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,759
root orders and we do it in different

197
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:17,000
ways so this is just I'm showing you

198
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:19,100
examples we work on papers we grow the

199
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,220
plants on paper so we have the roots

200
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,409
here and by this we could just punch the

201
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:27,350
paper with diamond see uptake of

202
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:29,629
nutrients okay next two different root

203
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,820
orders so we just I'll show you this was

204
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:35,299
not published yet so but this is work

205
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:37,550
that we are doing so you see the

206
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:40,159
different root orders this is just an

207
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:42,578
example for potassium then this is time

208
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:45,980
in hours they have a different uptake

209
00:10:42,578 --> 00:10:48,259
behavior of nutrients so not only they

210
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,269
are taking water differently or solution

211
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:51,950
they're different that specifically

212
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:55,939
taking different nutrients differently

213
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:57,410
and then that also we look also

214
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,410
physiology so we look at the root

215
00:10:57,409 --> 00:11:02,860
respiration so also the root one and two

216
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:05,299
they are more active they will spire

217
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:08,570
significantly more than the higher root

218
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:10,159
orders so what did we see so water up

219
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:13,060
the crates were determined by the

220
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:15,500
order not by diameter or distance and

221
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:18,859
what the uptick rates under solidity

222
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,690
decreased significantly however in

223
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:24,019
plants grown in salinity and subjected

224
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:32,509
locally to a non salt solution all our

225
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:34,610
orders showed only in flux root root

226
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:37,579
interactions I told you woods have many

227
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:41,870
roles one of them is the interaction

228
00:11:37,578 --> 00:11:45,469
with the biosphere so we have a root

229
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:49,009
system here in in this root system we

230
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:51,500
have different roots right so does this

231
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:55,310
would know that knows that this roots is

232
00:11:51,500 --> 00:12:00,318
the same like this hand note but belongs

233
00:11:55,309 --> 00:12:02,869
to the same individual and what happens

234
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:05,120
when we know it was already published

235
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:08,600
that when you have two words together so

236
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:13,789
for some reason this root knows they're

237
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:15,230
decreasing their system okay so we

238
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:18,230
wanted to look at this root with

239
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:22,579
interactions and for that we used peas

240
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:24,139
as a model plant and what is I'll just

241
00:12:22,578 --> 00:12:26,989
show you in order to understand the

242
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:31,220
terminology is this is the roots of one

243
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:33,799
individual so these are called self this

244
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,778
is the roots of the other individuals

245
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:38,688
are also called self in between them the

246
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:41,299
purple color versus the world color but

247
00:12:38,688 --> 00:12:44,000
if this word sees this purple its

248
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:48,620
non-self okay so we have self and

249
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:52,009
non-self now what did we do we took our

250
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:55,639
piece and we split the root okay when

251
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:59,089
they are young into two platforms

252
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:01,639
the first one is self so each we have

253
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:06,529
three ports in each pot we have one

254
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:10,250
plant with its own roots okay in this

255
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:12,409
one we have three ports in each post we

256
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:14,808
have words from two different

257
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:17,360
individuals because we take the Dajjal

258
00:13:14,808 --> 00:13:20,299
and it split it into two half of the

259
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,938
roots here half here half here half here

260
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,899
half here half here so all parts here

261
00:13:22,938 --> 00:13:28,279
are

262
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:34,519
non-self and all parts here or so this

263
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:38,569
is clear so the last thing to do is this

264
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:40,250
is a cat scan of an answer route when

265
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:42,440
you take an x-ray and if you go to

266
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:50,320
Vienna and talk about it this is what it

267
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:57,140
reminds you I didn't get in yet the

268
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:59,780
inspiration for ethica for this so these

269
00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:04,100
are our plans okay so this is self an

270
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:06,019
answer okay and then we measure route

271
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:13,820
length in the non self is significantly

272
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:15,860
decreased the so photosynthesis now the

273
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:19,010
next thing we wanted to see is what

274
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:21,169
happens to restoration where suppression

275
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:25,039
is a very important process in plants

276
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:27,019
however it's much less studied there's

277
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:30,129
almost no people in the world who

278
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:34,759
measure intact respiration of plants

279
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:37,789
although as you can see so it could a

280
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:42,200
large fraction of the assimilates could

281
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:44,149
be expended by respiration after 70% so

282
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:48,560
what this was where respiration produce

283
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:51,639
ATP NADPH or any in the age and carbon

284
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:55,209
skeleton so in my lab we developed this

285
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:58,939
not very nice looking but very effective

286
00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:02,139
way to measure route respiration we

287
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:06,290
measure simultaneously both Otto and co2

288
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:09,169
okay this is our and we have these

289
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:12,379
special chambers with Stefan because the

290
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:15,620
o2 is very difficult to measure and this

291
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:18,250
is we put our plants we seal them and we

292
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:24,440
measure go and gas in and out in and out

293
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:27,470
constantly for a week okay and what do

294
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:30,860
we see we saw this very weird thing

295
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:33,279
non-self glands had 30% more respiration

296
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:37,509
so if I'm next to a neighbor I'm going

297
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,509
I'm nervous I'm going to a better

298
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:43,930
so the roots when they are from the same

299
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:48,838
plant for some reason they know that we

300
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:52,229
are self and when I am far I'm going

301
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:57,760
what does increased respiration give us

302
00:15:52,230 --> 00:16:01,000
ATP okay lots of ATP and this comes and

303
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,639
the expense of carbon going to growth so

304
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,009
the roots are smaller and this you can

305
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:08,919
see this is both - as the co2 release

306
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:11,789
and o2 consumption and this is by time

307
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:16,929
this is just a day a night and day of

308
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:19,299
the non-self and so ok so we have these

309
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:20,500
roots that are aspiring more just

310
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:24,519
because they're seeing their neighbors

311
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:29,159
so what is the conclusion so root length

312
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:32,049
an area decreased when you have non self

313
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:35,439
with respiration increased when you have

314
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:40,929
non-self so what happens under stress

315
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:42,730
conditions and one of the most important

316
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:45,759
stresses that we work in the lab is

317
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:49,509
salinity so we look at salinity we grow

318
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,220
them we put hundred milli molar nacl you

319
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:54,458
see that the when yourself you are much

320
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:57,699
more affected than you in your non-self

321
00:16:54,458 --> 00:17:00,458
and the same thing also happens in the

322
00:16:57,698 --> 00:17:03,039
shoot and also in respiration so whisper

323
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:05,708
Asian under salinity increases but it in

324
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:10,298
both self and non-self but it increases

325
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:12,130
less in the in the non so as if we are

326
00:17:10,298 --> 00:17:13,900
ready for the stress we already

327
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:17,439
respiring so much so maybe we're more

328
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:19,630
acclimated to our future stress so

329
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:23,350
non-self plants were less affected by

330
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:25,150
soul stress non-self plants in the

331
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:27,099
k-league and a possible acclamation to

332
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:31,000
future stress in lots of plants in a

333
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:33,969
feed-forward acclamation mechanism our

334
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,109
results provide new information and wood

335
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:42,730
restoration and now you could read the

336
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:44,829
paper so I'll go to the next thing so in

337
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,548
the horticultural meeting I heard a

338
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:47,980
little bit about

339
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:50,480
aeroponics here so I decided just to

340
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:53,450
show but we also do our opponents

341
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,110
in our lab and we when we wanted to do

342
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:58,308
it we wanted to control temperature

343
00:17:56,109 --> 00:18:03,349
because we are very interested in

344
00:17:58,308 --> 00:18:04,908
extreme temperatures so we the thing we

345
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:07,699
thought about is like the ice cream you

346
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:09,528
know refrigerators so we built these ice

347
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,380
cream refrigerators and we could control

348
00:18:09,528 --> 00:18:15,440
the root temperature they're very stable

349
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:17,570
with temperature or four degrees up to

350
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,590
that no matter what so we have these

351
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:23,298
chillers at the end of each so and this

352
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:27,288
is how it looks so we have four

353
00:18:23,298 --> 00:18:29,629
containers also and we have a nutrient

354
00:18:27,288 --> 00:18:31,369
solution here they stand on a weight so

355
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:35,179
we know exactly how much water we are

356
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:36,888
giving all the time and it looks like

357
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:39,259
this so we have a chamber with four

358
00:18:36,888 --> 00:18:42,859
plants and the plants are growing in the

359
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:45,619
air and we spray them every minute okay

360
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:47,449
with nutrient solution now the plants

361
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:50,058
are growing great we looked at

362
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,669
hydroponics soil and aeroponics they are

363
00:18:50,058 --> 00:18:55,069
going the biggest wonder airponics and

364
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:57,710
the roots are more similar to soil than

365
00:18:55,069 --> 00:18:59,569
hydroponics in their architecture so

366
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:03,620
this is very a very good tool to study

367
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:06,109
the roots aeroponic system so what it

368
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:09,319
what are the advantages easy access to

369
00:19:06,109 --> 00:19:13,579
the root low salt the positions on the

370
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:16,849
root zone we have adequate Aviation lack

371
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:18,349
of mechanical impendence when we want to

372
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:21,980
take the roots so we're not destroying

373
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:26,058
them and the root development is similar

374
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:29,089
to the soil disadvantages or that if you

375
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:33,009
grow if you live in the desert very far

376
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:35,449
so sometimes we do have no electricity

377
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:37,970
ten minutes without electricity in the

378
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:40,730
desert the plans for this because

379
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,259
there's no buffer to hold the roots so

380
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,970
the first thing you do when you have a

381
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:47,089
student to make sure he has a smartphone

382
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:49,250
and he gets this SMSs and it the first

383
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:52,189
day it happened he got two hundred sms's

384
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:54,888
and then now it's only one bit per day

385
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:56,659
so you have to run fast to see the

386
00:19:54,888 --> 00:19:59,778
plants and make sure they are ok because

387
00:19:56,659 --> 00:20:01,730
most of them are false sms's and we have

388
00:19:59,778 --> 00:20:04,250
very you need this technical know-how

389
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:06,440
that we

390
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:11,299
supply so I'll just show you an example

391
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:13,430
for a research that was done so this is

392
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:15,349
a graph that bell peppers taken from

393
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:17,390
companies in jente this is in

394
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:19,669
collaboration with them and we were

395
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:22,780
looking at we are very interested in

396
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:27,230
roots and different wood science based

397
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:29,899
yeah wood stocks so here we grafted

398
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:32,450
cannon and cannon and here with graphs

399
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:35,540
and Carroll innocent 1:03 and we looked

400
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:37,640
at the effect of low temperatures on the

401
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:39,500
root zone okay

402
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,490
so here we have the plants and we grow

403
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,930
them either and the 14 degrees or just

404
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:49,279
one wait for 14 degrees and then

405
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:51,710
recovery or 27 degrees and then when we

406
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:55,190
look at the above-ground its you almost

407
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:56,990
don't see differences but when you look

408
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:58,970
at the roots and it's easy to look at

409
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:02,720
the roots you see significant

410
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:05,620
differences between the 103 is much more

411
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:10,250
tolerant in the root wise than the

412
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:10,789
cannon and you could go deeper to the

413
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,309
woods

414
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:16,539
and look at root the projected area and

415
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:18,769
number of ticks and you see a

416
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:20,569
significant decrease so this is you

417
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:23,420
don't see anything above ground in the

418
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:26,419
vegetative stage but you do see lots

419
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:27,860
below ground and then we did a lot a lot

420
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:31,430
of research I'm not showing everything

421
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:32,809
we look at all the metabolites so I know

422
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:36,230
typically we didn't see anything in the

423
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:38,629
shoots but when you look at metabolites

424
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:42,680
in the shoots we see large differences

425
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:48,350
from control okay when they are under 14

426
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:52,130
degrees and there are less differences

427
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:55,039
in the 103 and the wood is one so this

428
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:57,860
was just an example of aeroponics and

429
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:00,799
this is also working progress so we did

430
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:06,139
publish not all yet but some of it and

431
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:08,240
now almost last topic I I know people

432
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:11,210
here are very interested in wine vines

433
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,420
so we also got interested in it like six

434
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:15,950
or seven seven years ago already and we

435
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,690
started growing Cabernet Sauvignon in

436
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:21,830
Shiraz

437
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:22,730
in our desert so white will wine vine in

438
00:22:21,829 --> 00:22:26,359
the desert

439
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:29,720
first we have lots of space okay

440
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:32,719
there's life and temperature extremes or

441
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:35,390
import are good or the wine water the

442
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,549
lack of water is a big advantage why

443
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:39,980
when wine vines are stressed they

444
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:42,019
produce sugars and this way when we

445
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:45,470
irrigate them we could control exactly

446
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:48,109
how much water to give no surprises we

447
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:50,420
don't have water no halfway in our area

448
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:54,699
we have well here we have like 80

449
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:54,700
millimetres a year and it's only between

450
00:22:54,759 --> 00:23:00,309
December to March 80 millimetres is 8

451
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:03,920
centimeters it's two and a half inches

452
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:06,529
it's not a lot if you're going more self

453
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:08,660
it's less but this is what we have and

454
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:11,420
of course the wine so we are also making

455
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:14,600
our own line we have companies and so we

456
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:18,140
have things to do so and we're not the

457
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:21,139
first one to do this the Nabateans 3,000

458
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:24,110
years ago had this winery so this is of

459
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:26,120
that 10 minute from our campus and this

460
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:28,639
is shifted 25 minutes from our campus

461
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:34,459
and all these are wine presses you see

462
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:37,880
but they had large wine making so means

463
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:40,579
there was that many wine punch board ok

464
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:44,450
and this wine was exported you know

465
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:45,740
these two cities or 3,000 years oh they

466
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:49,670
are sitting under what is called

467
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:53,480
instance route from Yemen to the port of

468
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:59,269
Gaza and then to Cyprus and you found in

469
00:23:53,480 --> 00:24:05,170
Cyprus is clay bottles of wine with the

470
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:08,960
stamp of duck from 2,500 years ago so

471
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:14,810
wine was in the area and it's now being

472
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:18,410
reintroduced to the area so all the wine

473
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:20,659
vines in our area are grafted and they

474
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:23,480
are all grafted than one a Woodstock or

475
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:25,940
jury which is the tolerant Woodstock for

476
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,579
our area so the wood stacks of all our

477
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:31,660
Cabernet Sauvignon Shiraz whatever we

478
00:24:28,579 --> 00:24:34,339
have is the same ok

479
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:37,009
so we're good this Cabana Shenyang

480
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:39,949
Shiraz the background below ground is

481
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:44,179
the same Roger Lee and we looked at the

482
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:48,080
water in the soil so we could see in

483
00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:50,509
black is Shiraz Shiraz is taking much

484
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:54,649
more water than Cabernet Sauvignon

485
00:24:50,509 --> 00:24:57,170
the soil is becoming much drier since

486
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:59,330
and every four days we irrigate so every

487
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:02,320
four days the water comes to the same in

488
00:24:59,329 --> 00:25:05,649
both of it okay

489
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:09,019
every four do the four days she doesn't

490
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:11,509
come honest we don't slow okay same

491
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:13,429
Woodstock and then at the end of the

492
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:17,150
season we even stopped irrigating

493
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:17,509
completely this soil in Cabernet

494
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:20,750
Sauvignon

495
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:22,819
does not go down to there so there's

496
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,950
something differently in head radically

497
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:29,480
between them we repeat an experiment in

498
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:32,419
a greenhouse and we see again the Shiraz

499
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,829
is taking much more water than Cabernet

500
00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:35,960
Sauvignon and this is an experiment

501
00:25:33,829 --> 00:25:37,609
where we stop irrigating so you see that

502
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,250
Shiraz is taking much more water and

503
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:42,259
when we look at the water potential so

504
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:45,440
under non stressed conditions they are

505
00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:48,619
similar under stress conditions they

506
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:51,429
both go down and then Cabana so we don't

507
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:56,389
stabilizes Shiraz continues to go down

508
00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:59,000
and this these terms for that I won't go

509
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:01,850
into this but they behave hydraulically

510
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,220
differently and this hydraulic behavior

511
00:26:01,849 --> 00:26:05,750
the different hydraulic behavior leads

512
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,298
also to a different photo chemical

513
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:11,119
behavior so photosynthesis electron

514
00:26:08,298 --> 00:26:16,548
transport rate in the Cabernet Sauvignon

515
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:20,178
which takes less water is always higher

516
00:26:16,548 --> 00:26:23,900
than in Shiraz as if soon maybe across

517
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:26,540
tamata I need to be efficient okay and

518
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,460
this all the time open I'm less

519
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:30,379
efficient

520
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:33,440
okay so hydraulic and photochemical

521
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:37,220
behaviors differently and we think we

522
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,870
understand why and also the wine itself

523
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:42,230
when we looked at the wine so this is

524
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:44,659
all the metabolites so in Shiraz and

525
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:45,650
this is in in this case is the bravery

526
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:48,140
itself for local

527
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:50,210
skin and the leaves so Shiraz is much

528
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:52,970
more sensitive to this drought

529
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:54,710
you see many metabolites are changing

530
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:58,819
all the colors in Cabernet Sauvignon

531
00:26:54,710 --> 00:27:02,000
it's much more moderate the changes so

532
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:05,089
we are interested in roots so what we

533
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,269
did is we have this field and we put

534
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:13,579
these mini Reisman tubes to 2 meters

535
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:15,619
deep and looked at roots we look at

536
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:20,179
roots will measure every 12 millimetres

537
00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:22,069
up to the deaths of two meters and this

538
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:24,259
is and we do it even more like that so

539
00:27:22,069 --> 00:27:26,359
this is our tubes when after we dug the

540
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:28,879
two meters we put them in and we put

541
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:31,669
them in two distances 25 centimeters and

542
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,560
75 centimeters from the trunk so we have

543
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:36,320
a knowledge of the root system going

544
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:39,019
like this and going like that so we get

545
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:41,779
the impression of a 3d what's happening

546
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:44,450
below ground okay we are also measuring

547
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:48,319
two distances and also down to the dirt

548
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:51,350
and this is how it looks and these are

549
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:54,019
the roots and we could see how the root

550
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:57,349
dynamics what's happening and what was

551
00:27:54,019 --> 00:28:00,109
quite amazing for us is first of all is

552
00:27:57,349 --> 00:28:02,679
how deep these woods go because this is

553
00:28:00,109 --> 00:28:05,809
drip irrigation if I understand

554
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:09,789
we didn't think we'll get over half a

555
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:14,210
meter or meter we get to 2 meters easily

556
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:16,069
and this is in a Cabana some lunch

557
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:18,980
service when there are 20 weather close

558
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:19,279
to the stock so we see roots in both of

559
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,519
them

560
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:27,829
but when we go further from the trunk

561
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:30,680
you see no roots in shiraz only in

562
00:28:27,829 --> 00:28:32,569
Cabernet Sauvignon so Chile's is growing

563
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:35,630
like this come on now someone's going

564
00:28:32,569 --> 00:28:40,480
like this but this is the same root

565
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:44,450
system so Roger II the root system is

566
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,940
reacting to it above ground to the

567
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:49,700
different physiological characteristics

568
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:53,029
and one is going like this

569
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:55,580
shira's one is going like this same root

570
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:57,680
system or Juba and this is how it looks

571
00:28:55,579 --> 00:28:59,009
so we count the root so this is 25

572
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,380
centimeters this

573
00:28:59,009 --> 00:29:05,869
75 centimeter so this is the red is

574
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:09,540
Cabernet Sauvignon the blue is Shiraz so

575
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:12,239
she has behaved in a near an idyllic way

576
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:15,240
whereas cabana severe anemia I'd week

577
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,990
and this behavior was correlated to high

578
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,240
water transport I didn't show all the

579
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:24,480
results but it was also a combined by

580
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,370
photochemical efficiency and would

581
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,849
distribution and dynamics change

582
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:31,500
according to the Scion so we think if we

583
00:29:29,849 --> 00:29:33,899
have wine vine irrigation

584
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,669
it should take into account the cut the

585
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:39,048
cultivar specific water behavior

586
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:45,270
although never nobody does it until now

587
00:29:39,048 --> 00:29:47,129
okay last topic so so line enemies this

588
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:48,869
is an amazing plant it was the plant I

589
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:52,770
was most interested when I got to this

590
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:56,609
place the desert this is an summer

591
00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:59,548
annual plant so this plant is a very

592
00:29:56,609 --> 00:30:00,298
small plant with very shallow roots 15

593
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:03,750
centimeters

594
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:05,668
it's an annual plant that grows only in

595
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:09,599
the summer so germinates around March

596
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:12,390
April stay small until June then it

597
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:15,058
starts to grow its with maximum October

598
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:16,799
November flowers and dies no rain

599
00:30:15,058 --> 00:30:22,259
between March and November

600
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:25,160
no rain okay so it's an amazing pattern

601
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:27,660
I was interested it because I was

602
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:30,090
looking at I thought about you I won't

603
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,650
talk to you about it today I'll talk to

604
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:35,279
you only about what's happening below

605
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:40,980
ground so we take to this plant I came

606
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:44,069
when I dug it out and after I dug it I

607
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:47,250
saw this thing again I crushed it and I

608
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:50,519
get something mushy in my hand I thought

609
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:53,460
what it is and we have these mud huts so

610
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:55,950
it's not a pizza hut it's a mud hut and

611
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,210
we have many mud huts one plant could

612
00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:00,860
have one mud heart

613
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:04,769
some of them three too many mud huts

614
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:07,319
what is it you go inside and serve

615
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:11,190
crushing it like I did the first time I

616
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:11,799
open it slowly and I see a weaver so

617
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:14,200
there's

618
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:17,109
a thousand weevils in the world 50,000

619
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:20,350
no weevils are known to live with plants

620
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:22,779
without harming them below ground okay

621
00:31:20,349 --> 00:31:25,059
when you talk to farmers about weavers

622
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:27,879
they're all scared in Israel the palm

623
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:31,119
tree industry is a very important

624
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:33,100
industry the date trees called us or the

625
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:36,009
quarter tree because each date is silk

626
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:38,139
sold for quarter so and they're very

627
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:41,079
afraid of weevils they're killing the

628
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:42,550
trees the Wiggles but our we vote not

629
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:44,259
only they're not killing them as I'll

630
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:47,289
show you they are living together and

631
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:50,680
you'll see the wood is not harmed at all

632
00:31:47,289 --> 00:31:52,990
so we see larvae we saw papa we see we

633
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:55,390
will see all these terms that I learned

634
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:58,839
to know now I'm becoming like an

635
00:31:55,390 --> 00:32:02,259
entomologist and eggs we also see well

636
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:05,709
I'll show you as soon so we have this

637
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:09,509
weavers see very nice so this is the

638
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:13,360
main Weaver we see the corner windows

639
00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:16,839
fill the Romani it's nice and cool

640
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:19,329
pictures to show people you know sit

641
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:21,339
inside I'll show you there half a year

642
00:32:19,329 --> 00:32:25,269
and then they after I could open it and

643
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:26,619
then we go out so I had a very good

644
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:31,359
student oven Sheriff

645
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:35,909
and he did a lot of observations and

646
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:39,159
working and we made this so they're out

647
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:43,180
the weevils out at two months from the

648
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:47,050
year then they go below ground okay

649
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:50,400
there's a lava here so a small plant has

650
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:55,000
a small lava a big plant has a big lava

651
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:57,430
okay and adult plant flowering has an

652
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,009
adult and this is in blue is the

653
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:02,200
rainfall and these are the temperatures

654
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:04,240
average temperatures and this is also so

655
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:08,440
they grow together the river and the

656
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,960
plan small together big together and

657
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,640
then we decided to analyze roots because

658
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,940
that's what we do in the lab we analyze

659
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:20,280
roots so far were very big surprise

660
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:22,160
woods with rebels had 30% more nitrogen

661
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:27,410
they had

662
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:30,620
fourteen percent less carbon so we were

663
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:33,620
showing at the beginning that this is

664
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:35,809
what our conclusion from that was the

665
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:39,529
woods are getting nitrogen from the

666
00:33:35,809 --> 00:33:44,509
weevils and giving sugars carbon to the

667
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:47,450
weevils as a result seeds of weevil of

668
00:33:44,509 --> 00:33:51,529
the plants which levels were bigger this

669
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:54,470
is what now today was just a the second

670
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:57,170
paper in this story was except was it's

671
00:33:54,470 --> 00:34:00,829
on line today already and they and we

672
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:02,450
showed I'm not the P I cause other this

673
00:34:00,829 --> 00:34:04,099
paper was rejected from nature in front

674
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:07,100
then I left it for three years and then

675
00:34:04,099 --> 00:34:08,110
I gave it to another collaborator made

676
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:11,659
me nervous

677
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:14,090
so but the plants are also bigger when

678
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:15,980
you have weevils so not we're not sure

679
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:17,990
if the weevils are going to big plans or

680
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:19,309
they're helping them to go bigger we

681
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:21,889
know we don't know what is the egg and

682
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:23,179
what is the hen you know in order to

683
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:24,589
know what is their cover the hen you

684
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:34,940
send them by mail and see what's coming

685
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:37,130
first so this is where the the the we

686
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:39,619
made measurements from different areas

687
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:41,990
from the mother okay but this is very

688
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:44,779
close to the mother their most

689
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:46,549
significant when they're close and then

690
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:51,019
we said okay where's the nitrogen coming

691
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:52,940
today to the plant okay this wood has

692
00:34:51,019 --> 00:34:56,509
more nitrogen and we look at the weevils

693
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:58,820
in the guts we saw DNA of nitrogen

694
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:01,670
fixing bacteria so we have it three ways

695
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:03,950
in biosis we have a bacteria living

696
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,619
nicely having enjoying its life in the

697
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:08,199
Weaver have the weevil and the plant

698
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:11,329
everybody or profiting

699
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:13,129
but we started with the DNA in also the

700
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:14,829
adults and for two years we couldn't see

701
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:17,780
nitrogen fixation

702
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:19,009
we only saw it in jalapa took us two

703
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:21,460
years to understand we have to look at

704
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:25,760
the larvae so lava has nitrogen fixation

705
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:31,250
all have the genes for this Graziella

706
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:33,530
nitrogen if if genes are that let us

707
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:35,960
that take nitrogen which is a very

708
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:39,109
limiting factor in the desert nitrogen

709
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,869
these are the limiting factors so just

710
00:35:39,108 --> 00:35:45,559
to remind her we saw a small plant

711
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:47,450
swallow a big plant big lava so we

712
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:50,000
wanted to show that sugar is going to

713
00:35:47,449 --> 00:35:55,838
the plant to from the plant to the lava

714
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:58,429
yes and what we did is we took our plant

715
00:35:55,838 --> 00:36:01,009
when it was small we knew it a small

716
00:35:58,429 --> 00:36:03,469
lava yes and we did the French

717
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:07,670
Revolution to it we stopped the factory

718
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:09,889
of sugars right what happened we we

719
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:12,050
created the factory for midgets all the

720
00:36:09,889 --> 00:36:16,069
small larvae who pitted and became

721
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:21,619
midgets all died okay when sugar stops

722
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:24,200
to come becomes four so ever this

723
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:26,210
three-way and this is an amazing system

724
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:27,858
and we are continuing to look at that

725
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:30,608
this is the Dr Mahathir collie who is a

726
00:36:27,858 --> 00:36:33,108
new researcher in our Institute and I

727
00:36:30,608 --> 00:36:35,389
just smallest gave her the project and

728
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:38,210
she's doing wonderful things we said and

729
00:36:35,389 --> 00:36:42,230
we did a very large survey like 16

730
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:44,659
different places in our desert every

731
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:48,740
place we go we find this fellow he say

732
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:51,319
they say this hot mud huts the way

733
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:56,000
symbioses every way and only at this

734
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:59,000
Isola minimus you see this is all the

735
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,420
sites we checked and the percentage so

736
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,030
some areas the plants get up to almost

737
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:07,760
50 over 50 percent of the plants have

738
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:10,269
lava but some only fibers when we

739
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,670
started we found we looked at this area

740
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:15,469
and we had only 5% so this is part of

741
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:18,559
the thing that people didn't like this

742
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:21,139
cell not not important but you see it's

743
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:23,029
everywhere and it's correlated to

744
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:28,000
nitrogen so you have when you have more

745
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:29,119
nitrogen in the soil you have more more

746
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,039
weevils

747
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:35,838
and also nitrate and it's this is

748
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:38,750
correlated positively with nitrogen

749
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:43,519
nitrogen but correlated negatively with

750
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:45,230
sand and positively with silt so texture

751
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:47,900
and nitrogen are correlated with this

752
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:49,949
weebles so what happened when the plant

753
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:54,180
dies the

754
00:37:49,949 --> 00:37:56,460
guys if rain comes the weevil says okay

755
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:59,639
I'll go elk okay I have nothing to do it

756
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:03,108
there's no plant anymore so I'm thinking

757
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:07,679
I'm not very fast yes I'm a weevil yeah

758
00:38:03,108 --> 00:38:11,608
so so I'm going there slowly I'm saying

759
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:17,190
hi to everybody don't feel one or

760
00:38:11,608 --> 00:38:20,429
something another and so this is the

761
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:23,639
adult yes so what happens when you have

762
00:38:20,429 --> 00:38:27,239
a lava a small plant we have a lava so

763
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:31,889
we open this lava and look at it will it

764
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:33,539
go out like it's about so it's a lava

765
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:36,299
so it's still not very developed so it's

766
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:39,960
slow in thinking but then it gets to a

767
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:43,230
decision yes a thinks thinks thinks to

768
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,659
go out or not no I will stay inside and

769
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:47,250
I'll build my house and get some sugars

770
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:50,129
and I do water from the plant

771
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:51,530
give it some nitrogen live together with

772
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:55,890
my bacteria

773
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:59,490
so this is our lava now when you have

774
00:38:55,889 --> 00:39:01,170
hosts that's working in this nuclei so

775
00:38:59,489 --> 00:39:03,299
you have these cameras everybody has the

776
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:06,510
camera so this was taken with a cell

777
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:09,869
phone in the field we mounted our pan we

778
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:12,619
put now bine order to have some weevils

779
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:14,940
and we see this Widow I told you we did

780
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:17,250
so it's digging you see

781
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:20,369
so it's digging a hole in order to get

782
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:25,858
to the roots and then you'll see when

783
00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:28,858
the hole is good enough soon so see so

784
00:39:25,858 --> 00:39:34,348
takes it and then you see it's good

785
00:39:28,858 --> 00:39:37,309
enough so I'm turning okay I'll turn and

786
00:39:34,349 --> 00:39:41,550
I have see here the egg look at the egg

787
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:43,259
the egg is coming but I have to sit down

788
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:47,910
and relax in order for it to come out

789
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:50,130
you know with in and out so I'm relaxing

790
00:39:47,909 --> 00:39:57,679
this will take another minute for this

791
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:57,680
relaxation and then relax

792
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:08,829
so we have the reverse today yeah from

793
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:13,590
from over to something with you from two

794
00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:13,590
and a half three centimeters I have two

795
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:23,970
they're not not not some are small some

796
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:28,059
are big depending on the species when

797
00:40:23,969 --> 00:40:29,799
they eat leaves so this plant so when we

798
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:31,750
put them on the wrist is the plant this

799
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,300
is some of the problems we encountered

800
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:35,889
yes they could kill this time but

801
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,620
usually they don't ease when they have

802
00:40:35,889 --> 00:40:40,119
other now in the summer this morning

803
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:44,759
the only annual there they have some

804
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:48,670
perennials so they eat perennials okay

805
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:50,290
the larvae doesn't harm the root okay so

806
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:56,250
see here it's finished

807
00:40:50,289 --> 00:40:56,250
okay the egg is there a black eye post

808
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:07,059
and then if we continue we'll see how it

809
00:41:01,949 --> 00:41:10,299
is covered and this is an amazing story

810
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:12,820
I think now because of all these root

811
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:14,650
things we I we have developed what we

812
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:17,410
call root of the matter which I'm

813
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:21,010
directing it's sponsored for seven

814
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:23,649
million dollars and we are just the base

815
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:27,340
money we are collaborating with we have

816
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:28,960
20 pies in our root of the matter we are

817
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:33,519
collaborating with different companies

818
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:36,730
that only add some more funds we have so

819
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:38,409
we have this a website you go root of

820
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:41,800
the matter you see a dentist and another

821
00:41:38,409 --> 00:41:44,079
dentist and will see us and then we have

822
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:47,380
three projects we see now a root of the

823
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,269
matter grafting which I'm a part of it

824
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:52,360
I'm also managing the grafting we are

825
00:41:49,269 --> 00:41:56,380
looking to graft vegetables of tomatoes

826
00:41:52,360 --> 00:42:00,780
and melons in order to improve their a

827
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:03,490
biotech tolerance okay and look at root

828
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:06,340
all kind of root characteristics how to

829
00:42:03,489 --> 00:42:09,129
monitor blog below ground and how to add

830
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:12,000
bacteria in order to enhance now the

831
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:15,000
nice thing is that we have we have a

832
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
neutral

833
00:42:15,889 --> 00:42:21,960
research areas so we all work together

834
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:24,569
okay and this is one of our this is just

835
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,849
now from week ago this is one of our

836
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:28,710
greenhouse net houses where you see the

837
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:30,360
tomatoes we have also bacteria we're

838
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:32,159
looking at the root and how to monitor

839
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:34,530
we're doing everything in our

840
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:37,250
greenhouses and we are really really

841
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:40,110
excited about this root of the matter

842
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:43,079
now I would like to thank all the people

843
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:46,829
who helped this is part of my lab and

844
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:48,929
this is our great place in Slovakia okay

845
00:42:46,829 --> 00:42:50,639
if you come to the desert in Israel you

846
00:42:48,929 --> 00:42:52,349
should come to step okay this is our

847
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:56,219
Oasis you could swim

848
00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:58,529
you could have snow even have a water

849
00:42:56,219 --> 00:43:01,349
phone to see the flood yeah this is our

850
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:04,620
campus it's a great place to be not only

851
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:06,630
scenery we have flowers okay it's desert

852
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:08,929
but we have flowers we have endemic

853
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:11,309
irises tulips

854
00:43:08,929 --> 00:43:18,869
we have everything here we have all our

855
00:43:11,309 --> 00:43:22,230
animals know this these are endemic

856
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:24,960
these are not we have a breakfast all

857
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:26,659
away so gardens are very well protected

858
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,760
because they eat everything

859
00:43:26,659 --> 00:43:33,420
we have also vultures and of course our

860
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,950
vehicles okay I would like to invite you

861
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:38,039
to the 10th

862
00:43:34,949 --> 00:43:40,559
International Society of water stats

863
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:42,929
conference which will be held in Israel

864
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,159
we are organizing it so it won't be in

865
00:43:42,929 --> 00:43:46,829
the desert because you don't have enough

866
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:49,679
place to accommodate it will be not far

867
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:53,610
from Jerusalem and deadline for

868
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:55,799
submitting is February 14th if you are a

869
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:58,410
student we have a special student

870
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,590
ambassador program where we which will

871
00:43:58,409 --> 00:44:05,039
be in our Institute where we sponsor

872
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:10,120
everything for you so time is limited

873
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:15,029
please submit and have fun thank you

874
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:24,639
[Applause]

875
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:29,560
question with the self and non-self

876
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:33,029
recruit think over Peas yes big what

877
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:38,710
would you see the same thing if you used

878
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:43,810
clones so the plants that you were doing

879
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:47,050
the self and non-self were genetic we

880
00:44:43,809 --> 00:44:48,699
think yes and we also we think also the

881
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:50,920
question could be even if you we do

882
00:44:48,699 --> 00:44:53,618
different species we think that if we

883
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:55,420
look at different species the effects

884
00:44:53,619 --> 00:44:57,190
will be much smaller because the

885
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:59,650
competition for resources is smaller

886
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:01,539
when you go to genetically identical the

887
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:04,210
competition should go increase and it

888
00:45:01,539 --> 00:45:29,880
will we didn't do it but we believe it

889
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:33,220
will increase I've got a question and I

890
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:36,490
like your work excuse me and on the root

891
00:45:33,219 --> 00:45:38,828
order so remember that in corn roots

892
00:45:36,489 --> 00:45:40,479
there's constrictions between them where

893
00:45:38,829 --> 00:45:42,640
that junction between the first order

894
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,829
roots and the second order root is a

895
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:46,929
very high hydraulic resistance right

896
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:50,890
there are you seeing comfortable things

897
00:45:46,929 --> 00:45:54,759
to notice no so we just the wood orders

898
00:45:50,889 --> 00:45:57,608
thing we looked only at we don't see it

899
00:45:54,760 --> 00:46:00,030
we don't see we looked at these orange

900
00:45:57,608 --> 00:46:02,409
trees and now we're looking at Tomatoes

901
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:05,980
Tomatoes we don't see this thing that

902
00:46:02,409 --> 00:46:09,489
you're talking about in corn very

903
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:13,588
interesting it just could increase the

904
00:46:09,489 --> 00:46:13,588
effect I think what you're saying

905
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:22,750
yes so with your evil story which is

906
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:26,619
fascinating for victory that an insect

907
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:29,440
which is borrowing into and eating the

908
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:34,150
roots is actually having a symbiotic

909
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:36,880
effect so how how do you simulate the

910
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:38,680
increase in nitrogen is occurring so I

911
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,390
don't think that eating first of all the

912
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:43,149
roots they're not eating the just

913
00:46:40,389 --> 00:46:44,889
getting exudates from the roots and the

914
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:47,079
nitrogen is just you know the wafers are

915
00:46:44,889 --> 00:46:55,750
going to the toilet and the plant is

916
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:57,730
getting metropolises okay we really

917
00:46:55,750 --> 00:47:02,440
tried very hard to grow them in these

918
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:05,619
volumes but no success and just what we

919
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:17,289
saw as weevils or going Oh everywhere so

920
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:20,019
we are still trying so in hydroponics in

921
00:47:17,289 --> 00:47:23,650
ways we don't see this so we don't see

922
00:47:20,019 --> 00:47:27,219
them it's going in a hydroponics so the

923
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:29,349
plan doesn't know they don't develop

924
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:30,879
them so in hydroponics this is yeah it

925
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:33,250
would be very nice to go to the field

926
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,530
and look at written we won't be able to

927
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:37,210
look or just on the hair we need to look

928
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:39,700
at cultivars which here and without here

929
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:42,159
oh yes this is this is a thing we

930
00:47:39,699 --> 00:48:02,919
thought of doing as the next looking at

931
00:47:42,159 --> 00:48:04,809
plants we said correlation we say

932
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,760
correlation when we have more weevils

933
00:48:04,809 --> 00:48:08,320
have more nitrogen again I don't know

934
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,700
what is the egg what is the hen maybe

935
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:14,860
the weavers are going to an area with

936
00:48:09,699 --> 00:48:16,869
more nitrogen we don't know in both I

937
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:20,039
thought at the end I saw a correlation

938
00:48:16,869 --> 00:48:23,009
was nitrate and nitrogen in the soil so

939
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:26,170
we looked at six in different areas

940
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:28,090
abundance of of we've of

941
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:35,260
when we had more we both we had more

942
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:42,750
nitrogen and nitrate the study with

943
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:42,750
peppers were the root stocks where they

944
00:48:42,809 --> 00:48:49,690
closely related of the same strain yeah

945
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:52,299
they're closely propagated but they're

946
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:53,079
from a company so the truth is I don't

947
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,900
know exactly

948
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:59,529
okay so it's not easy working with

949
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:01,930
companies I don't know can we run out of

950
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:09,040
time but thank you so much sheep on for

951
00:49:01,929 --> 00:49:12,309
a fascinating this has been a production

952
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:16,079
of Cornell University on the web at

953
