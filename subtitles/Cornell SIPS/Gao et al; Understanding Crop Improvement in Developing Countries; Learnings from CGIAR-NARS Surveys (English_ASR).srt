1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,280
University yes no I I'll I'll be brief

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,759
uh but yeah it's it's my pleasure to to

4
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,559
introduce the topic today being

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,439
presented by star Sage Greg and and

6
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:22,038
Matthew uh they've been you know working

7
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:24,118
with the Innovation lab for crop

8
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:27,118
Improvement I've been um really kind of

9
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:29,079
been engaged in interacting with them uh

10
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,719
since the start of the program you know

11
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:32,359
one of the state goals of of the

12
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,320
Innovation lab for crop Improvement is

13
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:37,200
to develop tools Technologies and

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,399
methodologies uh for crop Improvement in

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,520
my experience you know developing these

16
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:44,120
tools Technologies and methodologies is

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,520
is relatively straightforward but

18
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:48,399
developing uh you know these ttms that

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,480
are actually adopted and have real

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,079
meaningful impact in a breeding program

21
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:55,000
is is incredibly diff uh difficult and

22
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:56,679
being able to really track the impact

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,600
that these tools are having can be

24
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:00,000
really uh you know a challenging

25
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,000
Endeavor especially when dealing with

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,558
with you know large and complex research

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,759
you know organizations like a lot of the

28
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:10,039
Nars that we partnering with with ilce

29
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:11,759
and it's been great working with uh this

30
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,520
team because they're they're bringing a

31
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:15,640
lot of expertise that that we don't

32
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:19,000
really have uh certainly in the plant

33
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,319
breedings and genetic section um they've

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,159
they've been able to put together some

35
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:25,279
great surveys that help us get a better

36
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,000
understanding on you know really how

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,560
these these programs operate what some

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,078
of these baselines are and this is

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,560
really just incredibly important

40
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,319
information as we try and actually

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,079
develop collaborations that are going to

42
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:39,078
be impactful with these organizations

43
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,959
and try and track and learn from you

44
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:43,758
know how these tools are being used in

45
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,438
the programs and so with that I I just

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,519
uh like to thank everyone for for

47
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:50,519
presenting today and I'm really looking

48
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:53,359
forward to this presentation thank you

49
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:56,000
okay thank you so much Kylie yeah all

50
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,000
right

51
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:03,079
so a quick outline say

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,640
Greg myself is going to have three parts

53
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:08,318
of today's presentation we'll talk a

54
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,639
little bit of complex objective of this

55
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:14,359
service and then we'll give you uh two

56
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:16,719
overviews the methodologies and some the

57
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,720
fundings from the two the surveys

58
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,878
actually or I was going to put three

59
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,359
surveys and I don't think there's enough

60
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,000
time and tomorrow I'm going to present

61
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,360
that in the live meeting with Kylie and

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,878
GS lab and I will cover my recent uh

63
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,239
interviews with our the area objective

64
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:36,799
uh leads okay so today only the two

65
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,080
service and at the end uh we'll share

66
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,640
some the learnings and then also mainly

67
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,760
for discussion very informal and then

68
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,199
under 10 your questions I think for

69
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:50,359
ourselves uh we are planning the next

70
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:53,039
phase of the grand proposal so allow to

71
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,920
learn from the discussion as well okay

72
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,919
so the quick

73
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:05,040
begin so CG and the Nars uh is the main

74
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,000
uh topic today we are going to speak you

75
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:11,158
may Wonder uh as

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,759
Coronel uh Community why we care about

77
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:18,639
CGS why we care about

78
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:21,798
Nars in the developing uh world uh these

79
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:25,158
a large this is the largest uh public uh

80
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:29,719
breeding programs Agriculture and funded

81
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:31,639
by many uh funders and so important

82
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:33,598
important because since the Green

83
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:37,598
Revolution in the

84
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:40,000
1960s the uh solving the hunger and even

85
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:43,719
in today in terms of managing the

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,799
climate change uh so this has a huge

87
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:50,039
impact it's not only from The Innovation

88
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,480
perspective also in terms of adoption on

89
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:56,000
the farms field and this is great model

90
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:59,479
has the large Footprints over hundreds

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,039
hundreds uh countries and the Coronel

92
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:05,598
and the USDA we are one of the 3,000

93
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:08,078
Partners so for The Graduate students

94
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:10,399
you are here your research your

95
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:12,560
publication even your future as your

96
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,519
different opportunity to work in

97
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,160
industry or academic or funding agencies

98
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,199
one way the other because you're in

99
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,880
plant breeding imp plant science you'll

100
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:25,319
be in this value chin somewhere so

101
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:28,600
that's why uh so many people we know

102
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:32,879
uncom work with cgir and

103
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:37,960
Nars so you can see here uh 15 centers

104
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:40,560
they are formed over uh since uh the

105
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:43,359
Green Revolution over time and sometimes

106
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,560
there were 17 18 and some sometimes 13

107
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,560
to right now active 13 centers they lead

108
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,759
agriculture innovation technology

109
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,600
transfer to small holders uh in the

110
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,639
developing world so they mainly serve

111
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,879
this is not really for the very

112
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,960
profitable main yield like large

113
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:04,478
multinational know huge inputs that's

114
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:07,959
also caus today's climate uh change

115
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:12,038
challenges so the small stakeholders

116
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:16,279
meeting the local uh nutrition and also

117
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:18,318
diet and equality this huge impact as a

118
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:21,000
model in addition

119
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:25,199
to uh

120
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,759
well we we learn from them so this is

121
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,960
one recent from the last two to three

122
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,479
years uh the genetic innovation from CG

123
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:36,359
the pipeline from the left to the right

124
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:40,560
first part is product design to figure

125
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:43,360
out what Farmers what Le customers what

126
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,519
type of products they need and this

127
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,879
involve Economist Market intelligence

128
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:51,198
together looking at from the end

129
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:54,759
beginning with the end for local a

130
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:58,199
adaptation to help design and going to

131
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:59,800
either the center part as the the GM

132
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,879
Bank of prebreeding

133
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,240
and then go to the breeding networks

134
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:09,279
breeding networks uh they may cost uh

135
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:11,560
from uh original breeding crosses U go

136
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,799
with population development and early

137
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:17,280
testing late testing all the way until

138
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:20,160
un Farm trail testing okay so this

139
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,598
itself can take depends on the crops can

140
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,280
last somewhere from four to eight years

141
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:27,399
before they hunt up to the seed systems

142
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:31,399
uh in the product delivery in the

143
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:31,399
variety registration Etc

144
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,000
so this is a little background from uh

145
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:43,560
the CG perspective they work in the

146
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,800
broader network with the Nars so I'm

147
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,879
going to pass this on to a sage and then

148
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,360
I will come back when we talk about the

149
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:54,519
second part of survey so with that Sage

150
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,080
please amute yourself thanks great thank

151
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:59,038
you star so as mentioned I'm Sage I'm a

152
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:01,240
research support specialist at the Tata

153
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,399
Cornel Institute for agriculture and

154
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,000
nutrition I'm joined today by my

155
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:08,359
colleague Greg Traxler who is a Tata

156
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,120
Cornell fellow also working on the feed

157
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,160
the future Innovation lab for crop

158
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,598
Improvement or what we call ilce um so

159
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,039
we're both members of the ilc

160
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:19,240
institutional capacity research team and

161
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:21,759
so just to know we're mostly a group of

162
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,598
economists um so we're really excited to

163
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,680
present some of our preliminary results

164
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:30,240
um and ideas with this group of plant

165
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,519
breeder plant breeding researchers um

166
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,598
and Greg will be available for questions

167
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,839
as uh when we get to the Q&amp;A session so

168
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:38,759
I'm going to start by just giving a

please so by serving the Nars Partners

234
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:11,278
we want to better understand the crop

235
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,919
Improvement system um we also wanted to

236
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:16,600
know which modern ttms are being used in

237
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:19,278
which breeding programs um and by

238
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,800
identifying capacity gaps we could

239
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:22,799
better understand the strengths and

240
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,000
needs of institutions in individual

241
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,479
breeding programs and then lastly

242
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,519
monitoring capacity changes over time

243
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,800
enable the team to understand which ilc

244
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,200
interventions have an impact on capacity

245
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,479
next slide

246
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,839
please so to come up with the metrics

247
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,079
and a survey tool to measure

248
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:43,120
institutional capacity the team first

249
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:44,799
conducted a comprehensive scoping review

250
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,639
of the literature to Define

251
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:49,919
institutional capacity in the context of

252
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,759
plant breeding we did we identified 74

253
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,599
papers that assess the various

254
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,559
components that make up institutional

255
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,399
capacity and this helped us create a

256
00:10:55,559 --> 00:11:00,599
list of indicators we then reviewed

257
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:04,480
existing capacity assessment tools like

258
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,560
the bat which was used in the CG system

259
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,399
to identify and adapt relevant metrics

260
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,199
to the LC context this led to various

261
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:13,519
discussions with experts in the field

262
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,240
including ilc objective area leaders

263
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,839
enabling the team to arrive at this

264
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,879
initial list of survey questions we

265
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,160
conducted a deli among experts and

266
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,720
stakeholders to generate a consensus on

267
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:27,078
our list of questions and then using

268
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,399
this list of questions separated into

269
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:31,879
indicator areas the team conducted pilot

270
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,759
survey with 14 iasap breeding programs

271
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:36,200
in Africa and Asia to test the

272
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,078
functionality and Technical features of

273
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,800
the survey and also to receive some

274
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,958
feedback from the programs concerning

275
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,479
the quality of the instrument we then

276
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:45,759
went back with all the feedback and

277
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,920
simplified the tool and reduce questions

278
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:50,278
to eliminate redundancies and streamline

279
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,319
the survey finally we conducted the

280
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:54,720
survey to measure the Baseline capacity

281
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,959
of 18 Nars breeding programs involved in

282
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,480
the LC project next

283
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:02,199
slide so on the left shows the

284
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,399
components of capacity that were

285
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,839
identified in our literature review um

286
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,720
including the various resources

287
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,800
available to a program management and

288
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,839
planning collaborative activities

289
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:13,919
breeding activities setting priorities

290
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,519
and stakeholder involvement these

291
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,759
components were translated into our

292
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,679
indicat areas for the survey as seen on

293
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,480
the right and in each indicator area

294
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:25,439
represents a module in the survey each

295
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,560
containing about 10 to 15 questions next

296
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,560
slide

297
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:33,278
please so we surveyed the nine uh ilc

298
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:35,518
Nars partners with a total of 18

299
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:37,799
breeding programs in Africa and Latin

300
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,519
America uh the program surveyed we're

301
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:42,078
working with crops including cow peas

302
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,919
sorum millets common bean and sweet

303
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:47,319
potato next slide

304
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:49,919
please so on the left you can see that

305
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,600
about 30% of breeding program surveyed

306
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:56,240
did not make any crosses in 2019 and

307
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,360
only 6% made more than 100 crosses so

308
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,159
most programs made in between one and a

309
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,519
100 cross loses in

310
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:05,000
2019 and then the graph on the right

311
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,480
shows variety release over a three-year

312
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,399
period of the programs that reported to

313
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:13,079
release varieties we can see almost 15

314
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:17,839
50% did not release any varieties in

315
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:19,559
2017 to 2019 so only 34% release three

316
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,680
or more varieties over that threeyear

317
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:25,719
period corresponding to an average of

318
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:28,239
one variety per year next slide

319
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,560
please so as for the use of modern

320
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,000
technology we first looked to the

321
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,239
digitization of data where we found just

322
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,278
over half of the programs surveyed did

323
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,360
not collect any phenotypic data

324
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:43,039
digitally at the field level while 27%

325
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,680
of the programs collected 50 to 100% of

326
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,319
phenotypic data digitally the right

327
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,000
table shows the percentage of programs

328
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:52,079
that use breeding management software

329
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,399
for various breeding activities um so

330
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,399
using software for trial designs or

331
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,039
trait data were the most common while

332
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,799
very few programs use breeding

333
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:03,679
management software Ware for genomic

334
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:05,679
data on the bottom left graph um shows

335
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,039
some of the more modern techniques to

336
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,919
achieve greater genetic gains and we can

337
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:13,240
see that half of the programs use

338
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:16,360
genomic Services a third use genomic

339
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,919
assisted selection uh sorry a third used

340
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,560
marker assisted selection and less than

341
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:22,319
a quarter used genomic selection so

342
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,198
since achieving genetic gains is the

343
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,800
express goal of the LC project we then

344
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:28,799
asked Nars if they measure genetic gain

345
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:31,039
and learned that just 11% of the

346
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:32,039
programs that were surveyed do measure

347
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:35,559
genetic

348
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:35,559
gain next slide

349
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:40,519
please so as I described earlier

350
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,799
resource availability comprises an

351
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,440
important part of institutional capacity

352
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,078
like the availability of scientific

353
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,680
staff and genetic resources and we

354
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:51,120
learned about 60% of the Nars surveyed

355
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,919
have less than three full-time

356
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,159
equivalent staff available to their

357
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:57,360
programs and most of the programs have

358
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:59,799
less than 500 accessions available to

359
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,839
them for comparison I'm displaying the

360
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,719
data from our pilot survey with iasap

361
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,279
breeding programs where most of them

362
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,160
reported to have greater than 1500

363
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:10,958
accessions

364
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:13,480
available um next slide

365
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,439
please so some things that we learned is

366
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,120
that there's high heterogenity within

367
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,680
the Nars and this should be considered

368
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,360
when targeting ttms that will be most

369
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:24,559
appropriate based on the Nars capacity

370
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,480
so most Nars were making less than 100

371
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,278
crosses released less than an average in

372
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,278
one variety per year and had a small

373
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:32,838
number scientific staff and genetic

374
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:34,399
resources available to them at this

375
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:36,480
level of plant breeding research there's

376
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,078
a smaller probability to enhance rates

377
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,199
of genetic gain so in contrast there are

378
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:43,239
a few programs that were surveyed that

379
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:45,000
are reporting to use modern techniques

380
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,198
conduct many crosses and have more

381
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,720
available

382
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:49,719
resources next slide

383
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,759
please a large component of an

384
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,199
Institutional capacity is the policies

385
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:59,639
in place that determine the funding

386
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:02,240
allocated to each program which impacts

387
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:04,240
the availability of resources so orphan

388
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,680
crops comprise a smaller proportion of

389
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,240
Institutions budgets compared to other

390
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:11,078
crops given that there's these

391
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,198
institutional constraints in the state

392
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:16,078
of breeding programs um within the state

393
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:18,399
of breeding and many of these programs

394
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:21,039
that we surveyed that I was describing

395
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,879
earlier it may be best to adapt capacity

396
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,559
building efforts to ensure that Nars

397
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,958
breeding programs are testing and

398
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,758
releasing varieties more effectively so

399
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,479
that could mean targeting TTM as

400
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:33,519
collecting and analyzing stakeholder

401
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,680
input to generate product profiles more

402
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,759
accurate phenotyping data management and

403
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,838
experimental design then the programs

404
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,519
that have a higher level of capacity

405
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,480
will be better candidates for targeted

406
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,679
training of these more advanced genomic

407
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,839
type

408
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:50,318
ttms next slide

409
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,440
please and then lastly tools like our

410
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:54,559
survey to monitor capacity can be

411
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,720
helpful in the decision-making process

412
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,239
to better understand each program and

413
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,800
adapt ttms appropriately

414
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,919
um so just a little background that we

415
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:05,798
will actually do the same survey at the

416
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:07,879
end of the project in this upcoming year

417
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:09,838
to measure that change in capacity so we

418
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,400
can track those changes over time using

419
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,798
this survey and very few Nars are

420
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,720
measuring genetic gain variety turnover

421
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:18,639
adoption or yield gains in Farmers

422
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,519
fields and these are really important

423
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,559
measures of progress and to track the

424
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:26,119
actual impact on plant breeding efforts

425
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:30,119
so um this is a consideration of what we

426
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:31,759
might want to quantify in the future

427
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:33,199
um so I'm going to now hand this over to

428
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,759
Star again to talk about some of the

429
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,960
studies that she's been

430
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:39,759
conducting thank you okay thank you so

431
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,679
much uh Sage I know she run through very

432
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:44,440
fast uh many of you may have questions

433
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:46,798
if there's just one quick burning

434
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,558
question we can also save some time at

435
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:49,558
the end

436
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:56,959
anyone okay if not I'm going to switch

437
00:17:53,679 --> 00:18:00,400
to the second gear all right so this is

438
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,840
on the CG the other ones on Le two

439
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,919
completely independent survey so this

440
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:10,319
survey was conducted in the first uh uh

441
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:13,640
three quarters of 2022 the context of

442
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:16,480
this survey is with the one CZ means the

443
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,400
15 centers there are similar crop

444
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,919
breeding programs across different

445
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,880
centers and the one C uh was uh for them

446
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,038
to work together as these large

447
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,720
companies located in different parts of

448
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:32,720
the world uh with this centers have very

449
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,400
limited bi informatics resources

450
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,279
including the institutional

451
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:41,080
capacity uh servers and data management

452
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:44,558
systems also their staticians or

453
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:47,359
quantive genetics Etc in this context

454
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:49,720
the thinking is if all the bi

455
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:52,839
informaticians quantive genetics they

456
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,759
work together with the covid mode people

457
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:58,480
can work online and can provide services

458
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:01,038
support to the centers the regions they

459
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,279
do not have the resources in the data

460
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:07,919
analysis uh in the decision support ex

461
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:10,639
and this survey uh with this in the mind

462
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,400
uh there was also transitional uh in

463
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,280
terms of people from accellence breeding

464
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:19,038
to the breeding resources and genetic uh

465
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:23,639
uh Innovation this new funding like as a

466
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:26,400
project the new program so yali uh she

467
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:29,038
took the position Kylie was before as

468
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,880
the module five leader in ACC brief Mee

469
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:33,599
and she lied about Matrix and

470
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:37,039
informatics so I worked with her as the

471
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:39,399
program manager managing all the uh B

472
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:42,319
informaticians qu genetics across all

473
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,880
the centers and while this funding

474
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:48,000
tration the module three lead the

475
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:51,120
genotyping the Service Tool manager Ina

476
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,240
and also Ardo who's the module two lead

477
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:57,639
from ACC breeding to together uh uh you

478
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,279
module five the four of us in this

479
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,559
transition stage we're trying to

480
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:06,200
understand from all the breeding program

481
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:10,038
perspective are they ready if we have a

482
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:12,919
centralized service and also what are

483
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:14,839
the key common demands if they are ready

484
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:17,120
so that's the

485
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:19,558
background so as I mentioned there are

486
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:22,678
two overarching goals the first one on

487
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:25,038
the life hand side is are they ready and

488
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,360
then from technical perspective also

489
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:30,038
psychological willingness to how

490
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:32,439
everyone work together the second one is

491
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:35,200
the common demands if they are ready

492
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,880
what type of capabilities they need for

493
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,319
these quantitive genetics about

494
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,240
information to provide so the survey had

495
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,879
a total eight

496
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,919
pieces and I'm going to get into more

497
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,640
details later so in the next several

498
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:53,640
slides I'm going to talk uh about uh the

499
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,200
methodologies we used also uh some the

500
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,799
results and some discussion about the

501
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:02,120
Insight so these all together in these

502
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:04,200
two uh overall arching goals so the

503
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:07,399
first part is

504
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,720
uh for social scientist I think many of

505
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,919
you already know a sample sides to

506
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:15,240
collect this type of uh priority setting

507
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:18,440
and then for us Stanfield we were

508
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,798
learning uh who do we send a survey to

509
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,480
uh the data is going to really indicate

510
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:25,679
truly the program will they need rather

511
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,720
than diluted so with a lot of back and

512
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,159
forth the four of us thinking and the

513
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,278
way agreed with the different CG leads

514
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:36,440
is we only send it to the head of the

515
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:39,599
breeding program so they can work

516
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:42,400
themselves and distribute if needed and

517
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:44,839
this need to be really representing how

518
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,080
the weight uh from what they need

519
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:50,918
instead of we sent to everyone that's

520
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:54,079
why highly selected one survey sent to

521
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:56,000
each person with personal email we wrote

522
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:58,720
describing the background why this is

523
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,038
important and also time to turn around

524
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:08,038
access individual service sent to Nar

525
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:10,240
breeding sorry Nar n CG uh breeding head

526
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:12,519
and it turned out uh some of them

527
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,839
answered themselves and they also

528
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:18,918
allocated uh to their uh subject matter

529
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:21,319
expert for the parts of the questions

530
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:25,320
they are the best expert answer we sent

531
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:28,798
to the 12 Nars breeding head and six

532
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:31,639
responded and among total 2 five uh

533
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:34,558
respondents they represent 16 different

534
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,559
crops and 12

535
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:42,520
centers and this is the overview for the

536
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:45,480
all the cgir people who answered so you

537
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:48,158
can see the center affiliation and the

538
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,400
crops uh they represent and the once

539
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:54,720
highlighted in red they come in

540
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:57,960
answering this survey with the manager

541
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,400
role looking at this big picture and the

542
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,759
other one UNH highlighted they are

543
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,240
almost like a lead breeders representing

544
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:10,079
their entire

545
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:13,200
program and uh we have 89% responses

546
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:15,798
rate and 200 almost 40 participant rate

547
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,200
because some the centers uh they have

548
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:20,400
multiple subject matter expert answered

549
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,400
the

550
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:32,119
questions so from Nars

551
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:36,319
interesting we sent to 12 reading head

552
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:38,798
but only uh six responded so we can

553
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:42,359
discuss later why we couldn't accomplish

554
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:45,679
the same participation so here is a 50%

555
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:49,038
participation and then uh the full

556
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:52,320
respect I'm not listing the other six we

557
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:55,158
invited but didn't uh didn't answer the

558
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:57,639
survey and hopefully this also represent

559
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:59,520
the 50% of the Nars breeding programs

560
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,679
need as

561
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:04,879
well hide

562
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:06,400
this so the first question as I

563
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,919
mentioned overarching go on the left

564
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,000
hand side we want to know is uh are they

565
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:14,159
technically ready to measure the

566
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,880
institutional capacity uh we want to

567
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,520
Define what's called institution

568
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:23,120
capacity right so capacity including uh

569
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:25,879
Technical and human capital resources J

570
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:29,918
plasm Etc together collectively are they

571
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:32,120
able to do the program uh quickly and in

572
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,120
good quality to meeting the demands and

573
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:37,839
the mandates so this how we Define as in

574
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:40,359
institution capacity so first we want to

575
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:43,798
understand are they ready if we want to

576
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:46,278
provide the centralized services so from

577
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:49,000
here I don't know you can see very well

578
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:51,359
uh but overall we want to ask them very

579
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,558
similar these two independent study as a

580
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:56,199
sages and we all thinking good has think

581
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,798
about the same thing we ask them for

582
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,840
phenotypic data or Pig data genotype

583
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:03,359
data and the breeding crosses these

584
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:05,918
different type of data are they already

585
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:08,359
captured in digital format if they a

586
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,759
digital format they are shared in

587
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:13,278
centralized servers then these

588
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:15,079
biometricians can sit somewhere analyze

589
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,200
their data together and distribute the

590
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:19,519
results and that would give more power

591
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,080
right so we want to ask them are they

592
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:23,918
digitalized or they are just doing on

593
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:27,319
their own computer or on piece of paper

594
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,960
Etc so 75% of the reading head of the

595
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:32,119
particip they mentioned they are ready

596
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,759
they already have these in digital

597
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:37,079
format and the phenotype data mostly

598
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:40,359
digital types followed by genotyping

599
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:43,319
data and pigr data and lastly is the

600
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:46,038
process this means Sops how things make

601
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:48,879
transation from one person hand one

602
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:51,359
stage gate to another so that's least

603
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,039
digitized and here I want to point out

604
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:56,678
is uh B the data how you really get

605
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:58,278
inside is not only you collect data

606
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:01,519
because this is harder to to see what

607
00:25:58,278 --> 00:26:03,880
that that mean right so we ranked and we

608
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:07,119
also developed a method to look at is

609
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:10,000
called sum of product as the indicator

610
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:12,158
to look at this uh with more inside

611
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,880
basically the degree of data digital

612
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,600
tyes measured as a percent data

613
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,919
collected and also stored in the digital

614
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:21,599
formats and then you can see the phot

615
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:27,399
type data when they run as low like say

616
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:30,839
0 to 33% mid 34 to 66% High means 67 to

617
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:34,398
100 % data already in the digital format

618
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:38,240
and when you multiply the data uh level

619
00:26:34,398 --> 00:26:40,639
for each one ranked by the the cons and

620
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,919
you sum that up called sum of product

621
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:47,038
this is as one indicator and with this

622
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,600
uh you can more easily simply compare

623
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:53,720
them so you can see the breeding process

624
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:57,918
only 40% 46% digitzed with the highest

625
00:26:53,720 --> 00:27:01,360
at phenotypic data so that um also um

626
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:03,919
match with what we see in Sage survey as

627
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:05,879
well another thing we asked them about

628
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:09,278
infrastructure do they have the

629
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:11,278
infrastructure cloud or server and are

630
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:14,119
they ready even they have the

631
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:17,519
infrastructure to share uh they are

632
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:20,158
ready to use the data analytic services

633
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:22,720
so when we ask these questions uh just

634
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,919
very simple for them to read as one to

635
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:29,038
five so the current state uh Readiness

636
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:32,640
were qualitatively a size at a low

637
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:36,000
medium high or as one two three or one

638
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:39,038
125 from one's lowest five is high this

639
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,038
is qualitative it just gives some

640
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:44,038
indication is not directly quantify

641
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:48,359
their right in is but overall you can

642
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:50,720
see uh the ones on the right uh side

643
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:54,918
infrastructure actually they are pretty

644
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:57,880
good uh for most of them and the five is

645
00:27:54,919 --> 00:28:00,159
the highest here and the inter read is

646
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,880
uh actually mod four and five they are

647
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:06,159
ready they want to have the centralized

648
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,159
uh analytical

649
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,880
support uh one is the server another one

650
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,720
is the data management also the

651
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,600
management practices are they willing

652
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,720
right so we ask them about currently do

653
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:22,439
you have your data just dispersed means

654
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,399
on your local or they are like a hybrid

655
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,640
you have some centralized on Cloud

656
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:30,839
Server or purely centralized server so

657
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:35,799
what we see is in the three means the

658
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:38,639
centralized 24% and large majority 64%

659
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:40,440
still on their local computer these uh

660
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,919
definitely making sense you can see very

661
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:47,480
diverse differences and the 24% program

662
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:50,799
they are technically U more ready to

663
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,480
adopt this centralized services so

664
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:56,839
tradition into the next part is in the

665
00:28:53,480 --> 00:29:00,599
goal to the second goal is about if we

666
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:02,398
are ready for centralized uh analytic uh

667
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:04,879
function to support them then what kind

668
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:08,158
of capabilities do they need from the

669
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,600
phenotypic genotypic bio informatics and

670
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:14,120
data management all full functional area

671
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:16,879
we ask them uh the features they want to

672
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:19,759
have as must have or should have could

673
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,679
have or will not have so the must have

674
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,720
means

675
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:26,519
non-negotiable and should how is

676
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:29,319
important and if uh but not adding

677
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:31,640
significant VI and could have means nice

678
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:34,639
to have but if we leave out have small

679
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:37,399
impact we now have means not at this

680
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:41,640
time frame is important so we ask them

681
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:44,038
to put these uh uh capabilities uh in

682
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,399
these buckets and we also assign a

683
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:49,960
numerical value 4 3 to one for each of

684
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:52,678
the category this allow us to quantify

685
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:56,079
the final demand and also fund out the

686
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:58,440
priority ranking in the capabilities so

687
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:01,319
you can see this is just one example in

688
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,480
term of data collection after collecting

689
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:05,558
you do data curation and data analysis

690
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:09,120
decision support in these four

691
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:11,599
functional area what do they consider as

692
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:15,839
uh must have and based on the count the

693
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:20,319
frequency distribution you can see

694
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:23,558
uh this is way for us to quantify it uh

695
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:27,639
so the demand calculated not only with

696
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:29,879
the must should could and will not have

697
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,640
uh we also did a summer product very

698
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,278
similar like early on I showed you in

699
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,679
the previous Slide the readings uh for

700
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,319
each category the ranking multiply by

701
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,038
the number of accounts and you do the

702
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:45,879
sum this give you a cumulative number

703
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:48,640
easy for you to compare them and then to

704
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,320
simplify here you can see the decision

705
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,519
support is the last stage of the

706
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:56,319
breeding analytic to provide for product

707
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:59,200
advancement consider is in the highest

708
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:00,798
demand vers is data analysis and the low

709
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,399
is the data collection basically they

710
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:04,359
are saying they can take care of the

711
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:07,158
data collection on their own but they

712
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:10,599
need a support of for decision support

713
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:12,760
and then uh you can also see uh for the

714
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:15,240
must have should have and will not have

715
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:18,278
some Cent have a little bit uh diverse

716
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,440
wheels for example for data collection

717
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:24,440
uh for one Center they think this is

718
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,440
very important ex and data

719
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:33,798
curation so for phenotypic analysis what

720
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:36,840
kind of capabilities they need they

721
00:31:33,798 --> 00:31:40,519
agreed on based on the analysis here is

722
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:43,798
uh optimize the trails the design and

723
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:46,240
also the product advancement basically

724
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:49,398
there is not much difference you can see

725
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:52,440
the points and the relatively lower at

726
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:54,278
the end uh is like for some program for

727
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,200
example I think should have is a side

728
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:59,119
selection here and then for some program

729
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,759
they want to have the variety catalog

730
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:04,439
drone plasm catalog to compare drone

731
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:07,519
plasm and then for two of them consider

732
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:10,000
very important but vot like R by other

733
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:13,399
Pro people participating in this that's

734
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,398
why at the end is as lower ranking

735
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:19,759
that's the phenotypic and how about for

736
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:22,719
micro selection using mid or low density

737
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:25,079
genotyping based analytics and we see I

738
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,720
think Gary atan if he see this recording

739
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:30,960
he will be happy he always talk about

740
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:33,319
calcul the grm the yeah the grm this

741
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:37,200
rise up showing this the highest in

742
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:37,200
demand and followed by the P

743
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,399
rication so for me the high density

744
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:51,319
genotyping here is the genomic selection

745
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:52,879
of gas come in place we can see gas

746
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:55,960
considered not important for the

747
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,960
breeding program instead predicting the

748
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:01,798
breeding crosses to go to their proing

749
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:05,480
block considered the highest importance

750
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:05,480
and followed by predicting

751
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:12,879
gbvs and the third function is the bi

752
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:16,000
informatics in terms of capabilities

753
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,600
infrastructure we can see uh provided

754
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,960
infrastructure that's what very timely

755
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:23,839
they need and then followed by merging

756
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,079
data from different sources including

757
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:29,918
phenotype pedigree genotype EXC and

758
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:32,918
across the different actors merging them

759
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:37,038
together that's what currently uh

760
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:40,080
repeatedly saying in the seventh eighth

761
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:42,079
section of the survey the eighth uh part

762
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:44,158
of the section survey is about how the

763
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:47,599
data flow integrate together so that

764
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:51,200
allow them working holistically from the

765
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:54,918
pipeline A to Z and here it talk about

766
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:57,038
the digitized processes this come in is

767
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:59,120
very obvious and also centralized

768
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:03,359
databases so that they can share with

769
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:05,319
programs in different regions okay so uh

770
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:07,798
this the main

771
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:10,719
results and then here the summary

772
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:13,280
already mentioned Uh u based on their

773
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:16,158
ranking the common High demands uh for

774
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:21,119
the second part of a goal we understand

775
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:24,440
and uh uh with these high demands now we

776
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:27,399
have to ask about the way how the

777
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:30,519
Personnel the quantitive genetics or the

778
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:33,118
B informaticians to provide all these uh

779
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:36,320
capabilities in high demands are we able

780
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:40,519
to give them the product of services and

781
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:43,320
that's the story uh actually uh continue

782
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:47,559
to be discussed but at least now we

783
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,559
understand breeding programs what they

784
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:54,399
need and then uh key learnings there are

785
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:58,078
many many learnings uh for myself uh

786
00:34:54,398 --> 00:35:00,719
through doing this uh with the the 1cg

787
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,440
breeding informatics team uh tech

788
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:06,118
technical Readiness considered really

789
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,159
important uh they have digitized data

790
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:11,559
processes centralized data storage for

791
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:13,719
sharing and then from here from Cy part

792
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:18,239
you can see as well increase uh the

793
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:21,358
investment this uh uh uniformally from

794
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:24,078
both Nars and CG Center we need this to

795
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:27,078
enable them uh to do the centralized

796
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:30,400
data sharing and the common demands the

797
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:33,560
money but in order to provide this

798
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,599
minimum viable products have to be uh

799
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:40,880
focused on as well that's where the

800
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:43,359
phase currently uh we origin wanted to

801
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,119
build that but that didn't take off

802
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:48,639
there are a lot of factors we can

803
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:51,519
discuss offline and then but so many

804
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:54,400
learnings how to make this ready for the

805
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:57,838
early adopter as you can see some the

806
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:01,280
program uh 24% have the data management

807
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:03,440
ready and for them different stages of

808
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,760
the tools they need for example making

809
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:09,519
the breeding

810
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:12,520
cres uh at very early on and then very

811
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:14,318
diverse programs sometimes uh even

812
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:17,199
though you have this high

813
00:36:14,318 --> 00:36:20,079
demand when you go to talk to Le

814
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:22,519
breeding leas from different centers

815
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:25,079
they do not want to give away their own

816
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:27,719
bform or work together support

817
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:30,640
centralized because

818
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:33,719
time of the year different capabilities

819
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:37,480
needed so the resources and how to have

820
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:42,519
tailor the support and solving this

821
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:46,400
bottl neck one at a time so with that I

822
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:49,039
think uh sage and also Greg uh we can

823
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,639
just open up uh for the questions and

824
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:55,920
especially uh in the context of planning

825
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:58,559
the next steps uh with LC and um I think

826
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,838
there's some good news when CG Nar just

827
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:04,759
got a the new commitment for the next

828
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:07,078
two to three years almost like 900

829
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:10,240
Millions that's what I heard just two

830
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:13,839
days ago and hopefully the the second

831
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:17,679
part of survey we have to pause and also

832
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:21,559
from uh the people here uh on the line

833
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:26,879
and also here to see how we can be part

834
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:29,559
of this value chin as a service provider

835
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,760
or as the stakeholder you see you can

836
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:37,358
contribute yeah so I'm going to uh open

837
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:40,599
up uh for the uh questions uh because we

838
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:44,639
have a few minutes and uh also just want

839
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:48,720
to give big shout out uh to the LC the

840
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:52,358
area uh objective area lead uh I did a

841
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:54,078
focus the group interviews uh recently

842
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:55,719
not enough time to cover today and

843
00:37:54,079 --> 00:38:00,200
tomorrow in the live meeting I'm going

844
00:37:55,719 --> 00:38:00,199
to cover also thank you so much

845
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:07,240
uh uh Sage Greg and also Matthew uh for

846
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:13,400
collaboratively recently we are planning

847
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:16,759
the ongoing survey yeah okay so I see

848
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:19,680
um people on the line

849
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:22,560
okay so yeah marjerie

850
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:24,440
please is there any do you have any

851
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:27,039
ideas of how to increase the engagement

852
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:29,480
from the Nars and their particip ation

853
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:32,358
in the surveys or is there have you

854
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:34,880
noticed any specific reason why the CGS

855
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:38,679
are more responsive than the

856
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:42,760
Nars yeah I think sage and then Greg

857
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:45,118
also add comments as well from my part I

858
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:48,280
knew we sent exactly the same

859
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:51,079
personalized email from our side the

860
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:54,480
lead one to one to the breeding lead

861
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:58,039
from Nars as well I think just lies uh

862
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:01,960
direct working relationship maybe maybe

863
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:05,279
v a spam folder maybe uh they didn't see

864
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:07,838
the importance so it's so important we

865
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,280
are very selective and also have the

866
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:13,279
personal connection to reach the

867
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,280
awareness

868
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:21,720
yeah stage Greg from y surveys uh you

869
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:24,119
may also have the struggle about getting

870
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:27,279
people's uh engagement participating

871
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:30,119
right especially the data

872
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,440
yeah sure um yeah that would that could

873
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:34,440
be a bit of a struggle our advantage is

874
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,480
that we're all working on a project

875
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,960
together um that are receiving funding

876
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,920
uh from the same source so there was a

877
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,119
little bit more of a Buy in from the

878
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:46,039
Nars we were surveying because they were

879
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,559
part of this project already um so you

880
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:51,800
know we all represent different teams um

881
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:54,639
but we have tried to survey other

882
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:57,000
programs um you know both in the CG and

883
00:39:54,639 --> 00:40:00,400
the the Nars and we've had difficulty

884
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
getting people to respond at times um so

885
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,838
yeah these are things we're constantly

886
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,838
thinking about how to get people to buy

887
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:09,358
into this idea that institutional

888
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:11,960
capacity is a um a valuable thing to

889
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:14,440
measure and track um and so that's you

890
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,240
know doing presentations and trying to

891
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,960
to talk to more people and I think these

892
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:20,479
personal connections make the big

893
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:22,519
difference um we've had some responses

894
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,920
based on you know knowing some of the

895
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:27,159
Nars from this program and then asking

896
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,880
them to ask some of the breeding

897
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:31,759
programs within their institution

898
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:35,680
themselves so um yeah this kind of

899
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,680
collaborative network is really

900
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:42,760
useful yeah okay there's one question

901
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:45,679
from Kylie on the line Kylie is asking

902
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:48,839
uh the surveys self assessment versus

903
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:51,799
this external evaluation like a bad uh

904
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:55,000
any sense how well the self assessment

905
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,000
external assessment

906
00:40:55,318 --> 00:41:01,800
align

907
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:05,519
so there must be some part align and

908
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:08,359
some part um may may not so so align

909
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:08,358
because

910
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:15,639
uh from some yeah go ahead Greg yes star

911
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,680
thank you we we did include in our

912
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:20,838
survey uh subjective questions of the

913
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:23,919
scientists how well do you think you're

914
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:28,119
doing in particular areas what's your

915
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:31,159
subjective opinion on your capacity in

916
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:35,000
data management or given areas and then

917
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:39,799
we also collected objective data so we

918
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:42,639
do have um both kind of the you know the

919
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:46,800
counts of number of crosses

920
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:50,799
and access to materials Etc and then can

921
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:53,440
come compare those to the scientists

922
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,480
expressed opinions about their capacity

923
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:59,760
so we I don't think that we've p those

924
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,760
out to compare them but we could do

925
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:04,358
that and just to add on a little bit

926
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:06,519
something that we had done in our

927
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:08,920
research effort is we visited some of

928
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:11,679
the breeding programs um and did some

929
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,639
field work there and with those programs

930
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:15,440
we conducted a midline assessment and

931
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:18,239
that was the major goal there is to

932
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,920
validate some of our findings um which

933
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:23,039
had changed a little bit you know some

934
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:25,000
we found that you know one program that

935
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:28,759
had claimed to be doing marker assisted

936
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,559
selection when we pass them in person um

937
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,280
they they didn't they weren't actually

938
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:35,599
implementing that or you know maybe they

939
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,880
had markers available but they weren't

940
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:41,318
um using them for selection so there can

941
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:45,119
be um you know some some inaccuracies

942
00:42:41,318 --> 00:42:47,599
with this uh but continuously monitoring

943
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,559
over time has and going in person has

944
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:53,680
helped um clarify some of those and help

945
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:55,519
us to explain the questions um and

946
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:58,318
ensure we're getting more reliable data

947
00:42:55,519 --> 00:43:01,119
based on how we pose the

948
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:02,639
questions yeah just want to add

949
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,720
that

950
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:09,199
actually the right questions to ask and

951
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:11,959
also really uh designer question is more

952
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:14,558
than half of the the survey research

953
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:18,000
itself because what you get from the

954
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:20,640
answers largely depend on how you ask

955
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,039
this question so definitely it's really

956
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:26,838
good complementation for onside visit to

957
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:30,279
the external uh evaluation

958
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:32,920
because uh even for example uh the

959
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:37,319
answer they answered like read from one

960
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:40,200
to five uh level right if the breeding

961
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:43,199
programs located in so in so many places

962
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:45,759
there is a huge hyrogen it's difficult

963
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:48,919
to how just one number to read it even

964
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:53,240
the breeding lead think they are ready

965
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:56,599
or they already at a highest level so we

966
00:43:53,239 --> 00:44:00,239
cannot really Overlook the

967
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:03,240
diversity the whole hydrogenous of these

968
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:07,959
programs so this just quantitive simple

969
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:11,358
way to C quick look uh yes I'm wondering

970
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:13,760
how centralization of reading analytics

971
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:17,000
um tools might affect the capacity

972
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:20,640
building um of young scientists at Nars

973
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,159
or um yeah other breeding um Specialists

974
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:24,759
working at the Nars and I'm wondering if

975
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:26,399
that came up in a survey at all and do

976
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:29,720
you think that would affect willing to

977
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:33,200
move to this model um of centralized

978
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:34,959
Services um for example um if there's

979
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:38,199
young scientist or students working with

980
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,760
these Nars Partners who are um wanting

981
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:42,639
to learn genomic prediction or wanting

982
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,359
to learn database

983
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:47,838
management yeah this definitely uh is

984
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:49,078
going to be more difficult for the Nars

985
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:52,039
than for the

986
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:56,000
CGS and then for the young scientists I

987
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:58,759
think the model is uh these onside visit

988
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,239
haathon and then even during Co this

989
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:04,040
team work online together the community

990
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:07,199
building we had one platform called

991
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:10,000
breeding informatic uh analytics uh

992
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:12,919
platform so people online are join in

993
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,280
different functional areas and then they

994
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:18,358
have different levels some very Advanced

995
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,519
and some just beginning and also they

996
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:25,078
compliment each other some knows python

997
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:26,519
some knows art very well so actually I

998
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:29,400
see

999
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:30,679
even for Coral University and for other

1000
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:34,559
LC

1001
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:38,239
Partners we provide a huge value in this

1002
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:41,400
system as well so for example we have

1003
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:44,358
the uh the Nars Partners recently

1004
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:48,280
visiting from Costa Rica in ice group

1005
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:53,000
for several weeks and then also the one

1006
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:55,280
from uh Sy go as well so they uh they

1007
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,559
are learning and then the university

1008
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:00,519
like us provide huge value and then also

1009
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:03,160
The Graduate students right because the

1010
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:07,400
Publications from The Faculty here and

1011
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:10,279
we are you guys are at the front end so

1012
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,720
a lot of the learning here for you to

1013
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:15,119
dive into some the case studies working

1014
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:19,598
with them this could be a one model

1015
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:22,838
because Le uh a young jior uh bi

1016
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:26,079
informaticians some of them uh finished

1017
00:46:22,838 --> 00:46:28,799
the master degree and then some of them

1018
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:31,000
actually pursuing and after they find

1019
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,839
opportunity they leave from where they

1020
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,679
work they come to us do PhD study we

1021
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:38,119
lose people over and over by working

1022
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:40,358
with them and it's very difficult for

1023
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:43,079
the team there to hire because where

1024
00:46:40,358 --> 00:46:45,078
they are located sometime no electricity

1025
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:47,800
no internet and then they are asked to

1026
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:48,760
do this to do that is not really easy so

1027
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,599
more

1028
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:53,920
centralized uh

1029
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:55,800
resources for them to continue even like

1030
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,440
seminar like this allow them continue

1031
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:01,440
learning when they get a stock the other

1032
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:04,960
is uh the infrastructure so this

1033
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:08,159
platform is huge to how this is not only

1034
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:11,318
Social Capital to boost the morale for

1035
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:15,000
them to work learning informally in this

1036
00:47:11,318 --> 00:47:16,880
platform is huge so may not be easy for

1037
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,519
the supervisor to say centralized

1038
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:23,920
because they have a lot to do but in the

1039
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:26,800
uh the effectiveness the collaboration

1040
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:31,119
Partnership of a great Val

1041
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:33,839
yeah sorry I don't know this long

1042
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:35,720
answer okay can I just jump in there for

1043
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:40,279
a minute star because I think that's a

1044
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:42,959
key question I think that if you were to

1045
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:44,599
kind of separate the individual human

1046
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,679
capital the kind of quality of

1047
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:48,480
scientists in the National programs and

1048
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:51,879
compare it to 20 years

1049
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:54,559
ago uh it's it's pretty clear that the

1050
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:58,240
scient individual scientists are better

1051
00:47:54,559 --> 00:48:00,319
trained but but if you would compare the

1052
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:01,479
institutional capacity to deliver

1053
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:04,639
genetic

1054
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:06,800
gain uh within Nars compared to 20 years

1055
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:07,838
ago I think you would have a much more

1056
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,318
mixed

1057
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:12,039
picture uh it's not at all clear that

1058
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:14,440
the Nars today

1059
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:17,519
are stronger in their capacity to

1060
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:21,159
deliver than they were 20 years

1061
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:23,440
ago uh the picture that emerges is

1062
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:25,199
they're not releasing more varieties

1063
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,599
they're not doing more crosses than they

1064
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:30,118
were in the

1065
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:33,599
past uh the if

1066
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:36,680
you again separate out the quality of

1067
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:41,240
the scientists that are in staff in the

1068
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:43,639
CG and in the Nars better trained uh the

1069
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:46,719
individual scientists within the Nars

1070
00:48:43,639 --> 00:48:50,279
have great incentives to build their

1071
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:52,838
human capital and then move on move on

1072
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,680
to another build their career not

1073
00:48:52,838 --> 00:48:58,119
necessarily within the Nars move to the

1074
00:48:54,679 --> 00:49:03,558
CG or some other

1075
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:06,200
institution uh and so as institutions

1076
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:11,079
the national programs are very

1077
00:49:06,199 --> 00:49:13,558
unstable funding uh is is not secure uh

1078
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:16,798
resources are not necessarily growing we

1079
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:19,000
have very poor measures of those um and

1080
00:49:16,798 --> 00:49:20,318
the CG has been incredibly unstable over

1081
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,798
the last

1082
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:27,759
decade uh so I I think it's very

1083
00:49:23,798 --> 00:49:31,358
important to look at developing some

1084
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:36,559
measures of institutional capacity and

1085
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:36,558
stability uh keeping in mind that

1086
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:42,480
uh capacity of individuals is is an

1087
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:44,039
important component but it is not always

1088
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,039
going to solve the institutional

1089
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:49,798
stability problem and lead to more

1090
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:53,639
effective delivery of genetic

1091
00:49:49,798 --> 00:49:57,039
gain yeah thanks uh Greg for that

1092
00:49:53,639 --> 00:50:00,279
addition the huge challenge is the yeah

1093
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:03,279
how do they really the problem so much

1094
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:06,000
greater than yeah the resources they

1095
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:08,519
have it's very difficult to do what they

1096
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,719
asked to do with uh three full-time

1097
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:14,880
people and maybe they do not have the

1098
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:18,879
expertise and they need to have the

1099
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:21,880
resources in infrastructure Etc and then

1100
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:25,240
people work in Nars Le National level I

1101
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:28,280
think they are only at maybe onethird of

1102
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:31,159
one quarter of the salary as the the

1103
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:33,920
same like say classmate who went to work

1104
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:36,440
at the cgir

1105
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:39,920
scientist

1106
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:42,079
so gping maybe the last question and we

1107
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,960
I can stay for other people a question

1108
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:49,720
maybe sage grg and stay as well last

1109
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:52,920
question yeah yeah U okay uh so you done

1110
00:50:49,719 --> 00:50:54,439
the survey I don't know what's your best

1111
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,200
plan

1112
00:50:54,440 --> 00:51:00,519
you

1113
00:50:56,199 --> 00:51:03,519
the feedback to different

1114
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:08,119
institution

1115
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:10,519
what's yeah you have the surve

1116
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:16,280
have I

1117
00:51:10,519 --> 00:51:20,719
guess goal is of the service are to give

1118
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:24,400
some feedback to the different Institute

1119
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:26,679
right right so my part of survey I can

1120
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:29,119
speak to the say and great answer to

1121
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:32,879
that part so my part survey after we

1122
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:35,720
finished we shared the results with uh

1123
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,400
the key leadership right that's the

1124
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:39,358
justification uh these the

1125
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:42,599
functionalities we need to put together

1126
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:44,719
this the priority and then to build this

1127
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:48,160
uh one

1128
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:50,838
centralized analytic Services prioritize

1129
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:53,960
which one to go and that's where we left

1130
00:51:50,838 --> 00:51:58,519
with and then this may we even brought

1131
00:51:53,960 --> 00:52:01,519
out uh analytic team together

1132
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:03,798
in in Egypt and that's what we did at

1133
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:06,318
the planning face by face what

1134
00:52:03,798 --> 00:52:08,759
functionality we focus on the components

1135
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:11,119
in the matrices serving this entire

1136
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:13,079
pipeline so this is one thing internally

1137
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:16,400
deliver these a minimum viable

1138
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:19,839
implementation connect with databases so

1139
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,240
with uh the like say braby or data Lake

1140
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:23,679
connecting between the different

1141
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:25,679
databases with the functionalities they

1142
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:28,118
asking this is one thing another thing

1143
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:30,358
is uh the first part of the go one part

1144
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:32,960
of survey I didn't present but this is

1145
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:34,798
also asking the breeding program are you

1146
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:38,039
willing to contribute and what

1147
00:52:34,798 --> 00:52:40,759
percentage of the budget to support the

1148
00:52:38,039 --> 00:52:43,719
centralized uh analytic services and

1149
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:47,160
support and each of the service support

1150
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:50,279
we have them as an service have other

1151
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:53,078
number just like your other genotyping

1152
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:55,920
uh you have a price this may have price

1153
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:58,400
or this maybe just as a service as a

1154
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,798
support this come from the breeding

1155
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,760
budget but they don't have to pay for so

1156
00:53:00,798 --> 00:53:06,400
this where we were trying to move onto

1157
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:09,160
the new operational model that's the

1158
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:11,559
survey background and we didn't GA there

1159
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:14,279
because the funding as some of you

1160
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:18,480
already aware and um hopefully new

1161
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:21,680
phases in 24 different story just can

1162
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:24,000
continue building this so how about for

1163
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:26,199
sage Greg would you like to add did you

1164
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,719
hear ging's question after the survey

1165
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:32,719
where do you take to the next stage do

1166
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:35,959
you give back to the participants of the

1167
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:40,199
survey why don't you go ahead

1168
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:42,440
Sage sure um so our plan at the moment

1169
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:44,439
again we're conducting the kind of same

1170
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:47,159
measurements at the end of this project

1171
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:50,358
so we took this the initial Baseline

1172
00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:51,838
survey in 2020 um the first thing that

1173
00:53:50,358 --> 00:53:55,519
we did is we shared a lot of these

1174
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:57,639
results with the ilc objective areas um

1175
00:53:55,519 --> 00:54:00,159
and so that we could provide kind of

1176
00:53:57,639 --> 00:54:03,358
this Baseline information so they knew

1177
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:05,199
within their kind of relevant metrics um

1178
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:07,920
where the the breeding programs were at

1179
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:09,318
that they were working with um and so

1180
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,798
this upcoming year when we take these

1181
00:54:09,318 --> 00:54:14,199
measurements again the plan is to have

1182
00:54:11,798 --> 00:54:15,719
different um kind of reports available

1183
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:17,679
and we'll meet individually with the

1184
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:20,239
breeding program leads and whoever can

1185
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:23,039
join the call um and give some some

1186
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:24,838
survey feedback um another thing like I

1187
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:27,000
mentioned we we've been visiting a lot

1188
00:54:24,838 --> 00:54:30,400
of the breeding programs so so far we

1189
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,920
visited uh four of them um with the plan

1190
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,680
to visit in this next year three more um

1191
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:37,519
so that's an opportunity for us to give

1192
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:39,279
some feedback and talk about these um

1193
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:41,119
and then hopefully you know this is

1194
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,559
still up in the air but if there's you

1195
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:45,240
know another um another cycle of this

1196
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:47,599
project this could be involved in the

1197
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:50,838
planning process um you know moving

1198
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:52,599
forward how to take these kind of gaps

1199
00:54:50,838 --> 00:54:57,400
in institutional capacity and really

1200
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:57,400
plan for um you know the next five

1201
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:02,919
years yeah and we've also shared our

1202
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:05,798
results with the national

1203
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:08,920
programs to to allow them to place their

1204
00:55:05,798 --> 00:55:11,880
own program in context of pure

1205
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:13,880
programs so they can kind of see who's

1206
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:18,680
who's doing what who's using what what

1207
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:18,680
capacities exist within other

1208
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:24,798
Nars yeah and also just by working with

1209
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:29,880
sage and Greg Matthew the last several

1210
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:32,239
months we are still uh collecting um

1211
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:34,318
basically we have ongoing survey and in

1212
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:36,879
January when I go to pack we continue

1213
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:39,318
collect data from the yeah the

1214
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:42,318
participants and these uh insights is

1215
00:55:39,318 --> 00:55:45,920
going to help us to uh plan the next

1216
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:48,719
phase is about matching the demand with

1217
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:51,838
the supply and identify opportunities

1218
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:55,639
and the challenges where and also if you

1219
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:59,480
do customize the support at in indidual

1220
00:55:55,639 --> 00:56:02,400
uh Center or the stages level so this

1221
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:05,920
give us this as a foundation to be more

1222
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,480
tailored for next

1223
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:10,358
phase

1224
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:13,679
okay all right thank you so much I

1225
00:56:10,358 --> 00:56:17,440
really uh appreciate by working this

1226
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:19,558
semester and then answer the survey from

1227
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:23,480
The Graduate School or from the course

1228
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:26,920
for evaluation and how great our final

1229
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:30,280
yeah thanks thank you everyone online

1230
