00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,929
alright let me tell you a little bit

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:14,690
about some of the things that are going

5
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:16,730
on in the industry who here thinks the

6
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:19,460
industry is anything like it was in 2007

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,289
I think we all know it's changed quite a

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,750
bit

9
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:25,310
first of all the recession had a huge

10
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,289
impact we all know that generally

11
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:29,838
speaking our industry is somewhat immune

12
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:31,910
to recessions people still own their

13
00:00:29,838 --> 00:00:33,739
homes people still want to invest in

14
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,560
their homes they may cancel going out

15
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:38,390
the dinner or a nicer vacation but they

16
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,129
continue investing in their homes this

17
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,989
one was different I think we all know

18
00:00:40,128 --> 00:00:44,089
why I'm not gonna dwell too long on this

19
00:00:41,988 --> 00:00:47,359
but with so many people losing their

20
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:49,039
homes our industry was deeply impacted

21
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,920
there's no new buildings you know going

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,469
up there's no new homes going up and

23
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:59,329
therefore the the demand for four

24
00:00:54,469 --> 00:01:00,679
planets we're starting to die off and I

25
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:02,420
would say a good number of people went

26
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:05,000
out of business in that time period also

27
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,159
garden retailers are retiring in huge

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,140
numbers you know I don't know what was

29
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:12,530
going on in the 70s and 80s but it was

30
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,329
like a baby boom for garden retail how

31
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:18,320
many people in here are garden retailers

32
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:21,280
are a handful of you how many here less

33
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:24,008
than 55 years old to own a garden center

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,930
who own a garden center so we have one

35
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:29,359
so it's you know if you if you're

36
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,820
serving garden retail or if you someone

37
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:36,890
who owned it yourself the ownership is

38
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:39,529
going through a huge huge change because

39
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:43,399
everybody wants to retire consumers are

40
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:44,960
changing and that's no big secret there

41
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:46,159
at all and I'm gonna go into each one of

42
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,019
these little bit more deeply here in a

43
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,670
moment and sorry guys

44
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:54,438
plant retool is moving away from the

45
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:57,280
term garden centers the word gardening

46
00:01:54,438 --> 00:02:01,398
is beginning to not be all that popular

47
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:04,700
all right so owners are retiring so what

48
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:06,379
happens when they retire about a third

49
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,240
of them have family members or employees

50
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:13,370
who are buying or inheriting the

51
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:16,760
business hopefully you're selling the

52
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,920
business and the land in order to sell

53
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:20,719
the business and this is kind of this is

54
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:25,849
where the timing is really

55
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:28,759
really poor with the 2008 recession if

56
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:30,560
you were not making a profit for the

57
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:33,739
last three years it's very difficult to

58
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,479
sell your business you know that you're

59
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:39,920
selling the inventory and you're selling

60
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:42,079
the land you're sitting on so hopefully

61
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,399
these people have been able to turn it

62
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,130
around before they retire and able to

63
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,319
sell the business all right so if you

64
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:50,269
are selling you're if you're not able to

65
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,340
sell your business hopefully you're able

66
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:55,760
to sell the land if you own the land if

67
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,770
you're not leasing it if you sell the

68
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:03,109
land and the inventory if you don't have

69
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:05,090
a profit and you work until you can't

70
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:08,000
anymore that's your other option if you

71
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,560
can't sell anything a lot of retailers I

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,539
know who are looking to retire they have

73
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,430
like a five year selling plan they go

74
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:15,229
ahead and quietly put their business up

75
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,819
for sale so they could have several

76
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:20,090
years to sell it it's not like selling a

77
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:23,030
house it's a very different business so

78
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:25,250
if you were supplying plants to people

79
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,539
who have a retail business keep that in

80
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,360
mind because that's a very different

81
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:30,859
mindset for those who are you know

82
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,030
they're not necessarily reinvesting in

83
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,410
their company unless they're trying to

84
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:35,300
sell it or they have someone else to

85
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:39,669
pass it on to so that's gonna be a

86
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:42,739
challenge for you now at the same time

87
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:46,009
garden plant retail is not just plant

88
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:47,269
retail anymore I'm trying to get us out

89
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:51,189
of my hands here moment it's not gonna

90
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:53,420
be pretty but there we go

91
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:55,759
all right so it's not just plant retail

92
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:57,589
anymore a lot of retailers are going at

93
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,298
this having services and this isn't just

94
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,039
landscape I'm not talking about the

95
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:02,900
traditional landscape services I'm

96
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,810
talking about going to a customer's home

97
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:09,110
and doing a sketch of a layout for them

98
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:11,360
so landscape extremely light or it might

99
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:13,220
be going in and changing out patio pots

100
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,400
for them or putting up Christmas

101
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:18,709
decorations their product mix is

102
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,000
changing the types of plants that

103
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,949
they're selling you know obviously

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,810
annuals are still keen but we checked

105
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:27,399
that every year we asked retailers about

106
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:29,569
how their plant cells are going and

107
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:31,939
annuals and perennials are still keen

108
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:33,240
but shrubs and trees and the large

109
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,939
perennials and a

110
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,228
those things have been quiet this year's

111
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:38,819
different this year's different we've

112
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:40,740
been hearing good news about the larger

113
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:43,289
plants but for the past several years

114
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,019
they've been going down and fitting

115
00:04:43,288 --> 00:04:47,550
garden is are blending I know a lot of

116
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,859
retailers who are actually starting to

117
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,470
host farmers markets at their center

118
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,819
they're either giving space to people

119
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,860
who have farmers markets or they're

120
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:58,169
actually becoming the farmer market farm

121
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,720
market managers for it or they're

122
00:04:58,168 --> 00:05:02,848
hosting CSAs and they're also selling a

123
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,830
lot of food plants and edibles and also

124
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:06,089
produce themselves so you're beginning

125
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:08,370
to see kind of the spin of the farm

126
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:10,168
market and the garden center and this is

127
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,699
happening more on the garden retail side

128
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:13,198
than it is on the farm market side

129
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,419
you're not seeing as many plants going

130
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,098
in the farm markets as you are produce

131
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:20,250
going in the farm type greenhouse garden

132
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:22,439
centers and the beginning act as

133
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,910
community hub you know they have

134
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:25,199
especially in the wintertime when they

135
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,210
have all that space underneath the

136
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,069
greenhouse I'm seeing more and more

137
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:31,589
garden centers that either leasing or

138
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:33,538
donating the space they have so this is

139
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:35,818
where the Lions Club meets and this is

140
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:37,469
where sometimes Town Council's have

141
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:38,819
their meetings where they have community

142
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,740
get together see there's a lot of

143
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:42,569
auctions that begin happening so that

144
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,658
they're able to use that space when it's

145
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:48,389
not having that full of plants all of

146
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:50,218
these things are going to impact how how

147
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,840
we're selling plants you could see the

148
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:54,680
traditional model of what we're doing

149
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:57,209
isn't at all what it used to be and

150
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,400
they're setting up shop where consumers

151
00:05:57,209 --> 00:06:00,658
are so your spaghetti meseta pop-ups

152
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:02,908
that are coming around but they aren't

153
00:06:00,658 --> 00:06:04,918
just on the corner of a busy street

154
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:07,800
anymore you're seeing them in the

155
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:10,408
farmers markets you're seeing them like

156
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,990
a little stand outside the popular craft

157
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:14,189
beer you know location and that type of

158
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,810
thing you're beginning to see them at

159
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:21,689
festivals so where consumers are is

160
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:24,718
drawing retail there that's a very small

161
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:26,939
footprint generally speaking all right

162
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,899
so consumers are changing let me give

163
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:29,939
you a little background here on this

164
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:31,888
section here who's here is tired of

165
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:36,680
hearing about Millennials and how they

166
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:36,680
behave too bad

167
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:41,819
I have been working with Bridget Beatty

168
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:44,610
with Michigan State

169
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,709
and Susan Hogan with Emory University

170
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,569
well she was with Emory University a

171
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:51,209
year ago she got lured away by deloitte

172
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:53,879
and touche over very big salary but for

173
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:56,879
the past three years since 2013 we have

174
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:58,920
been doing consumer research and what we

175
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,050
wanted to know well what we really

176
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,180
wanted to do is only slightly ambitious

177
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:06,180
we want to figure out how we can expand

178
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:09,480
the number of people who garden not at

179
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,949
all ambitious and so what we started

180
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,740
looking at we wanted to know what are

181
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:15,899
the barriers we wanted to find out why

182
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,730
what people think about garden centers

183
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:19,079
what do they think about gardening but I

184
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:21,480
don't think about plants and their own

185
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,909
yards and their lifestyles and then we

186
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,920
also wanted to figure out what kind of

187
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:28,350
marketing messages so stage two was to

188
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,560
go to the PR type people in the

189
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:33,870
advertising firms and in stage three was

190
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,459
then to recruit real-world garden

191
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,800
centers to implement these marketing

192
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:38,939
messages and see how they went so what I

193
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,410
want to go over here is going to be

194
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:42,990
about the research we've done and what

195
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:45,510
we found out we decided to look at those

196
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,579
who are under 50 for our research or a

197
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:49,620
very good reason

198
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:52,500
ruby has been looking at consumers for a

199
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,840
long time those who are over 50 if

200
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,250
they're not gardening they have a very

201
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:58,169
good reason why they're not gardening

202
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:01,199
anymore they've moved into a condo

203
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:02,640
they've tried it they hate it you know

204
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,159
they're not gonna be able to convert

205
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,110
that group as much so our goal was to

206
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,730
expand people who garden which means we

207
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,160
need to get those who are more ignorant

208
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:13,740
about gardening or have not tried it or

209
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:16,560
just beginning to to think about it so

210
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:19,290
that's why we chose this group so what

211
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,220
we did is we had we did focus groups and

212
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,170
we've done this in three different

213
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,300
locations one was in Atlanta one was in

214
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:27,360
Ohio and right now we're working in the

215
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,879
Toronto area and we've been working with

216
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,120
in Ohio and Toronto we worked with two

217
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,559
different grants along with that as well

218
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:38,940
flowers Canada than the USDA that the

219
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:43,079
Department of Ag in Ohio so we had three

220
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:44,610
days of focus groups where we had those

221
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,720
we wanted to find out what the pipeline

222
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,279
was doing these are not the people we

223
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,230
necessarily think are going to be our

224
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,839
customers right now but we looked at the

225
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,259
18 to 29 year olds we then looked at the

226
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,930
32 Ford

227
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:57,549
49 year olds which is our sweet spot and

228
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:58,839
then we also looked at parents who had

229
00:08:57,549 --> 00:09:00,879
children between the ages of two and

230
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,280
twelve because that's a whole different

231
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,450
dynamic all on its own and we had three

232
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,220
days of questions for each of those

233
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:08,230
groups and we wanted at least 20

234
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,610
participants in each group which means

235
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,139
if he wanted them there by the third day

236
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,970
you start at the first day with you know

237
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:15,610
a lot more so on average we had more

238
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:19,210
than a hundred people on each year of

239
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:21,399
study so here are some of the things we

240
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:24,129
found so this is the first this is

241
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,840
Ohio's key findings we find out that the

242
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:27,610
act of gardening has mostly positive

243
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,290
impression of so I'm starting positive

244
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,600
here you know they think of it it's

245
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:33,969
outdoors and beautiful and healthy and

246
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:38,259
and so we do have that reputation good

247
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:40,750
news consumers have distinct ideas of

248
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:44,230
who gardens and it's that lady right

249
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:45,610
there and they don't see themselves at

250
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:48,550
that lady right there they think she has

251
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:51,580
to have tons of time and here's a very

252
00:09:48,549 --> 00:09:54,129
key part she has to be expert she has to

253
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,450
know what she's doing and even people

254
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:57,600
who like the garden think that are

255
00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:01,180
stupid about it they don't feel expert

256
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,889
so that's a problem and it's a very

257
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:04,750
limit that limiting them they're not

258
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:07,299
going to associate themselves with that

259
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,919
hobby and that's where the term

260
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:10,870
gardening has a problem garden centers

261
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:13,899
are the third most popular place to buy

262
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:17,470
plants grocery stores and mass merchants

263
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:19,419
are the most popular and they will drive

264
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,590
pie a independent and what was

265
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:24,399
interesting the first time we did a

266
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:26,920
focus group was in Atlanta where Home

267
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,840
Depot is headquartered and what we were

268
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:30,669
being told is that if you go into a

269
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,160
garden retail somebody who's an expert

270
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:34,599
in that it's intimidating I don't want

271
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:35,649
to feel stupid if I go in there and they

272
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,090
know more than I did and they know I

273
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:39,549
know more like me they know more than I

274
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:41,560
do then I feel humiliated there's a

275
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:43,719
sense of being caught being stupid and

276
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:45,549
nobody wants to feel that way so they

277
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,990
would rather go to Home Depot where they

278
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:48,939
know the employees might or might not

279
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:52,909
know but at least they're not stupid in

280
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:56,150
comparison to them so

281
00:10:52,909 --> 00:11:01,129
yeah that's something we have to

282
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:02,870
overcome that's a barrier and consumers

283
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:04,399
lack this this one was really

284
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,779
interesting this fourth finding you know

285
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,579
we had the three days of questions

286
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:10,069
that's a lot of questions we're asking

287
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,740
we didn't ask one question in this field

288
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:15,770
this became a queue fiving because we

289
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:18,710
heard the word luck and risk over and

290
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:20,720
over and over again from every all three

291
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:23,150
groups and related to all these

292
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,450
different questions over three days so

293
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:29,299
like one person said I knew I shouldn't

294
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:31,070
buy that rose those so beautiful I knew

295
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:35,269
was gonna kill it but I bought it anyway

296
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:37,400
and I was so lucky it survived you know

297
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:40,699
it's just there's a sense that if you

298
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:43,429
buy a plant you have no impact on if it

299
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,410
succeeds if it lives or dies it's almost

300
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:47,149
like they're expecting that you know

301
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:48,860
like I think of gardening and like

302
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:51,110
someone going to cook and have it don't

303
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,820
have a recipe and they decided to throw

304
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,940
out a thing into a pot and hope it comes

305
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:57,680
out tasty you know that they're so since

306
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,240
that we don't need recipes so you know

307
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,779
there's a sense we have no control over

308
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,129
how it happens and so you know we that's

309
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:05,360
that's a major problem that's why

310
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:08,960
gardening is not the number one hobby

311
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:12,490
anymore you know so that that's a big

312
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:14,900
one this is what we learned last year in

313
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:17,450
this past year it's uncomfortable

314
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:18,679
feeling ignorant which is not the two

315
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:20,210
different groups these are two totally

316
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:22,189
different you know once in a high Oh

317
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:24,259
ones in Canada and we also had the ones

318
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,980
in Atlanta we heard this again and again

319
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:26,980
yes yes

320
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:57,929
yeah I think that's incredibly

321
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,490
insightful he's saying just for those of

322
00:12:57,929 --> 00:13:01,289
you who didn't hear and he wonders if

323
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:05,269
two three and four is that right or two

324
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:07,769
and three two and three are interrelated

325
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:10,500
so they have a distinct idea who gardens

326
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:13,470
and then Gardens there I think it is

327
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:16,080
very much that basically I had several

328
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,370
people tell me in Atlanta because those

329
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,690
are the ones I actually sat in and not

330
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,159
the other ones we we made sure we

331
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,500
weren't in the room other than to

332
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:24,179
moderate questions you know people come

333
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,309
to us so we're trying to make sure it's

334
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:29,459
as unintimidating a process as possible

335
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:32,549
but I heard several people say that I

336
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:38,540
will go to a garden center once I'm an

337
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:42,199
expert but I'm not an expert yet so yeah

338
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:42,199
you're gonna follow up a question

339
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:17,289
yeah everybody familiar with the

340
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:19,360
Brandeis I think it's Brandeis isn't it

341
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:22,029
that does the incoming freshmen kind of

342
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,289
their world perspective right right

343
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:27,309
suppose say they've never been in a

344
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:29,649
world where you know I don't know what

345
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:31,629
the most recent stuff yeah they've

346
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:33,819
always had I have always had smartphones

347
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:35,860
they don't know what a CD is you know

348
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,540
they you know they've never been heard

349
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,879
of a beat VCRs they kind of go through

350
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:42,099
to try to get the professor's a sense of

351
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,379
the kind of world perspective well think

352
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,120
about that when it comes to gardening

353
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:47,830
you know my grandparents were major

354
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:52,029
gardeners I was lucky enough that my mom

355
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:54,129
left the garden but most people most

356
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:56,110
people do not have parent to garden

357
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:59,110
there are at least two generations away

358
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:01,000
and I'm fifty by the way so I'm on that

359
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:03,340
cusp of between these these two groups

360
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,820
so you get younger and younger

361
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:11,410
generations there's the whole disconnect

362
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:13,210
of how they what gardening is and and

363
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:14,769
that type of thing there's another

364
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:17,470
problem which I'm not to get to in a

365
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:18,879
moment here no one wants to feel

366
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,040
ignorant and if they feel ignorant

367
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,860
they're not you know there's a sense of

368
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:27,610
they're not going to even try which

369
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:29,889
leads to online research it's a big deal

370
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,240
and this is funny someone that dinner

371
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:34,809
last night was talking about this

372
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,850
they're saying that you know people will

373
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,199
come into the gardens nursing I'm so

374
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,730
confused I try to looked it up online

375
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,910
they may ever try to research things

376
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:44,590
online and I'm someone who I'm a new

377
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:47,829
homeowner I've had a house for a year

378
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:50,700
and the element and my oven caught on

379
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:52,509
fire shorted out and you by the way

380
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,070
usual ways of putting out a fighter

381
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:57,309
doesn't work other than this turning off

382
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:59,710
the oven so I went online to find out

383
00:15:57,309 --> 00:16:01,899
some cheap and I want to do an addition

384
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,910
a little bit have a new kitchen I don't

385
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:05,679
want to buy a new oven so I went online

386
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:08,829
and I saw a video on how to replace the

387
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:10,299
element that's what people do now you

388
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:11,889
know but try to do that with gardening

389
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:12,909
it's not as easy I mean there's there's

390
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:14,169
and we're getting better and better

391
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:16,480
there's more out there than there used

392
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:18,549
to be but there's a lot of information

393
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,070
and this information and it's confusing

394
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:22,719
so what they'll do the start online but

395
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,540
they want to trust a real world person

396
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,180
that could be

397
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:27,439
their aunt or they do know someone in

398
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:29,569
the family who garden so they'll call

399
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,660
them up now or they'll go into a garden

400
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:36,740
center now and start asking questions

401
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:38,629
okay so yes online research is extremely

402
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,970
important that's where they start but

403
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:42,318
then they kind of get so far then they

404
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,430
want to talk to someone who they think

405
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:45,528
might know what they're talking about

406
00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:48,679
and that's where we have a real

407
00:16:45,528 --> 00:16:51,588
opportunity in food gardening is almost

408
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:53,208
as common as flower gardening involved

409
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:56,000
woman is a consultant in the industry

410
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:57,859
and he's been working with the national

411
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,600
gardening Association with international

412
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,449
survey they've been doing they've been

413
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,120
doing it since I think 1970 and they

414
00:17:02,448 --> 00:17:07,399
look at food gardening not just for the

415
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,048
vegetable plants and the herbs which we

416
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,298
know are not very high ticket or high

417
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:13,068
margin products they look at everything

418
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:15,019
else that people buy when they do that

419
00:17:13,068 --> 00:17:17,359
type of gardening which is a lot of

420
00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:19,009
stuff they want to have you know as you

421
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,889
mentioned you have people who want to do

422
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:24,109
vegetable gardens in containers you know

423
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,759
so they're buying all of that garden

424
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,139
media they're buying the pots which are

425
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,450
usually big pots because if you have a

426
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,730
tomato you can't have a little pot you

427
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,350
know so they're they're buying gloves

428
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,509
and all these things you know they want

429
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:37,879
me this generation wants to look the

430
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:39,169
part so they're gonna get their boots

431
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,580
and their clogs in there you know

432
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:41,419
they're gonna get the hats everything

433
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:43,519
they're gonna be they're gonna be

434
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:45,200
well-equipped that's a lot of money and

435
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,730
that's more associated with vegetable

436
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,000
gardening than it is with flower

437
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:52,400
gardening now it hasn't completely

438
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,220
overtaken it but it's neck-and-neck so

439
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,759
don't underestimate that that category

440
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,759
for yourself

441
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:04,349
we've got a real problem think about

442
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:07,829
when we have dinner parties what do

443
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:09,899
people gather now kitchen island you

444
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:11,399
know they used to be out in the dining

445
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,230
room or if you had them outdoors you

446
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,410
know when he had big big parties

447
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,720
- are they held in the backyard anymore

448
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:19,350
they're almost always held inside now

449
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,880
you know because we don't want

450
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:23,189
mosquitoes we don't want the heat we

451
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,290
don't want the rain you know only if the

452
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,420
conditions are absolutely perfect and

453
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:29,879
you had time to mow the grass and do the

454
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:32,550
weeding and all that do you see what I

455
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,930
mean that's all chores think about all

456
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:36,720
of the you know one of the you think

457
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:39,060
about how popular an HDTV is you know

458
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,710
all the home decor stuff is because

459
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:43,409
people are inside all the time and

460
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:44,940
they're looking going you know I'm kind

461
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,590
of tired of the cut you know I think I

462
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,820
need to restain that wall because you're

463
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:49,859
looking at it all the time

464
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:51,419
and you begin thinking I don't like that

465
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:53,339
blonde wood anymore I want it to look a

466
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,019
little I want to get a little pop you

467
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:56,970
begin you know that's just human nature

468
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:58,200
you want to begin tweaking stuff if

469
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,240
you're not outside they're not thinking

470
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,029
that way if the only time you're going

471
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,559
outside is the snow blow or you're going

472
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:07,349
out to rake are you going out to mow the

473
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,509
lawn it's annoying and if you're only

474
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:10,799
going outside to get in your car we've

475
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:13,109
got a problem people want to be outside

476
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,970
don't get me wrong but they're going to

477
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:16,259
hiking trails they're going to the beach

478
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,630
the goings out don't you know they're

479
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:22,200
kids sporting events outdoors some

480
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:23,670
people now are not their backyard so

481
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,279
we've got to figure out in our marketing

482
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:28,019
you know your the nature is at your

483
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:30,960
doorstep you know we need to emphasize

484
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:33,329
that nature is right there because the

485
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,090
people are not going outside all they're

486
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:37,980
doing our chores you know has anyone

487
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:39,769
ever had done any home renovations do

488
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,900
you know how freaking hard that is I

489
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:44,849
mean my best friend and I decided she

490
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:47,280
had this cute bungalow and they decided

491
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:49,259
to get a big attic and they're gonna add

492
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,660
a bedroom up there so we took out the

493
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:53,220
hall closet and I know it's all the rage

494
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,720
now but shift laughs if you ever try to

495
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,360
actually pull that sucker stop that

496
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,279
stuff off it was so much fun for like

497
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:03,729
the first 15 minutes

498
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:05,109
we had about four more days to go so but

499
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:08,230
people are still focused on the end

500
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:11,529
result gardening is nowhere near as hard

501
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:13,599
as home decor but we're so focused on

502
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:15,190
the annoying part you know they're not

503
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:19,869
looking at the end result because

504
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:20,740
they're not outside enjoying it and this

505
00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:22,959
is the fun part

506
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,750
this is the part I like so much people

507
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,900
who absolutely hated gardening who had

508
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:31,420
no desire was never going to do it 100%

509
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:34,090
every single person said children should

510
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:35,620
be gardening they need to get unplugged

511
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:37,359
they need to get away from all their

512
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:39,489
computers and their games they need to

513
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:41,219
understand where food comes from it's

514
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:43,029
educational

515
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:53,019
everybody thinks kids should be

516
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:54,639
gardening yeah that I think it's big

517
00:20:53,019 --> 00:21:02,889
vehicle to get people back into the

518
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:06,280
garden retail in the plant cells when

519
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:09,670
you think about what you know this

520
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:11,109
desire to get unplugged and get out of

521
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:14,050
all the routine because gardening is not

522
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:16,119
as routine and I say going to a sporting

523
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:18,490
event and on ballet and everything is so

524
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:19,779
so structured and people aren't quite

525
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,309
ready to give that up because they still

526
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:24,099
want him to get into Cornell and Harvard

527
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:25,419
and that type of thing but they do want

528
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:27,159
them to have a little bit more

529
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,830
instructor time but has to be

530
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:32,140
educational it has to be productive so

531
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:33,849
really think about the marketing that

532
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,700
you can be doing I remember I wrote an

533
00:21:33,849 --> 00:21:38,740
article a few years and this would not

534
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,789
make sense at all today and it wasn't

535
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,759
that long ago it's less than five years

536
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:44,250
ago and the question was do we really

537
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:47,740
want to have kids in the garden center

538
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:49,390
because a lot of retailers don't want

539
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,220
kids coming to the garden center all

540
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,450
they do is they what they force the

541
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,130
parents to be there for less than 20

542
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,980
minutes their attention span is so short

543
00:21:54,130 --> 00:22:00,850
they mess things up they climb on a stop

544
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:02,860
and and and their parents never spend

545
00:22:00,849 --> 00:22:05,740
that much anyway which actually I'll

546
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:08,229
show you a little bit they do but if you

547
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:10,569
don't bring the kids you're not gonna

548
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,829
have cells pretty quickly and this is

549
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:13,299
where you get the adults in because

550
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:13,869
everybody thinks kids need to be in

551
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:31,690
there

552
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:32,829
now with a cover story you know I don't

553
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,450
know if you guys heard that she's saying

554
00:22:32,829 --> 00:22:36,970
there's a garden center near her her

555
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,620
that has a scavenger hunt for kids and

556
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:40,538
they have to go through the store and

557
00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:41,889
when they they find their tomato plant

558
00:22:40,538 --> 00:22:43,980
or whatever it is the prize that they

559
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:49,840
get they get a gold star when they leave

560
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:52,480
so that's awesome all right now think

561
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:55,569
about that mindset and think about what

562
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,669
they would think walking into this we've

563
00:22:55,569 --> 00:23:00,668
got a perception problem you walk in and

564
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:03,190
it's a horizontal sea of green it's

565
00:23:00,669 --> 00:23:04,299
intimidating I don't know what even the

566
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:06,700
difference between the annual and a

567
00:23:04,298 --> 00:23:08,109
perennial and I'm walking into this I

568
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,569
mean this is actually pretty well done I

569
00:23:08,109 --> 00:23:12,099
think this you know it's attractive but

570
00:23:10,569 --> 00:23:12,960
if I have someone who doesn't know where

571
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:18,189
to get started

572
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:21,159
yikes I'm scared how are we doing on

573
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:25,538
time by the way cuz I'm kind of okay

574
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:27,730
good alright so there is a solution all

575
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:30,369
this I'm not someone who's to say scared

576
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,960
scared scared I'm very much you've got

577
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:38,648
to be able to figure out what we can do

578
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:42,370
about it so my philosophy for like my

579
00:23:38,648 --> 00:23:45,189
career is if I focus on who is reading

580
00:23:42,369 --> 00:23:47,769
who is the audience we can't go too far

581
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:49,929
wrong you know we're gonna follow them

582
00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:51,190
we might go make a misstep here or there

583
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:53,649
but if we get so stuck on ourselves

584
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:56,169
thinking we know everything we're going

585
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:57,609
to not where our numbers of people who

586
00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:58,809
are reading articles and I think we're

587
00:23:57,609 --> 00:24:00,908
just gonna plumb it we're gonna crash

588
00:23:58,808 --> 00:24:02,970
and burn the exact same thing is true

589
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:06,250
for anyone who deals with the public

590
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:08,319
including garden centers you know we

591
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:10,450
have to be thinking about who your

592
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:11,710
customer is and some of the things we've

593
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,840
done you know one of the reasons we've

594
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:16,690
been so specific about the locations is

595
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:19,449
you have to understand the customer in

596
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:21,120
that location they aren't the same in

597
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:23,830
Toronto as they are in Atlanta Georgia

598
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:27,058
now there's some universal truths about

599
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:30,089
human nature your community

600
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:35,069
as your community and so we worked with

601
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:38,398
I work with Susan Hogan she was the

602
00:24:35,069 --> 00:24:40,349
professor from the NB a college boys

603
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:42,628
etta School of Business I think it's

604
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:45,418
called at Emory University in Atlanta

605
00:24:42,628 --> 00:24:49,319
and we worked with a garden center in

606
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:51,299
Massachusetts called Lakeview nurseries

607
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:52,829
anybody familiar with Lakeview they've

608
00:24:51,298 --> 00:24:56,460
got a couple of locations in lüneburg

609
00:24:52,829 --> 00:25:00,928
arena and that's the staff they're a fun

610
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:04,288
bunch and so we did this in May of 2012

611
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:06,860
April and May and we decided we're going

612
00:25:04,288 --> 00:25:08,970
to research her customers specifically

613
00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:11,368
those who are actually coming in to the

614
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:14,038
garden center so we're looking at

615
00:25:11,368 --> 00:25:15,569
customers here and she's going oh and I

616
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:17,099
already know my customers I'm there

617
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:19,470
every day and I'm reading all the new

618
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:23,099
reports that come out and she is a very

619
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:24,778
smart woman you know I'm see if I could

620
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:26,248
see Michele Michele it's a second from

621
00:25:24,778 --> 00:25:32,878
the end there I'm sure there's some way

622
00:25:26,249 --> 00:25:34,048
to do a pointer here that's not it I'm

623
00:25:32,878 --> 00:25:37,829
not gonna play with this other than the

624
00:25:34,048 --> 00:25:39,960
four and a backward now there we go

625
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:42,329
that's Michele right there Michele

626
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:46,230
Harvey and she owns it and that's her

627
00:25:42,329 --> 00:25:47,878
husband her family owned it and that's

628
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:49,860
her husband who's the finance guy on the

629
00:25:47,878 --> 00:25:51,418
on this team so it's important to know

630
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:53,998
what Richard Burr his name is Richard

631
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:58,139
birch he was a skeptic on all of the

632
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:59,548
stuff we're doing beforehand so she was

633
00:25:58,138 --> 00:26:00,990
sure she understood cuz she's someone

634
00:25:59,548 --> 00:26:02,999
who really pays attention she does a lot

635
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,079
of really smart things though he said

636
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:05,970
let's just take a look at who your

637
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,859
customers are so going in she knew who

638
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:11,038
our customer was she was a 50 to 60

639
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:14,729
something female and she was affluent

640
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:15,929
and she loved gardening so we decided to

641
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:17,278
do three different types of research

642
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:20,038
methods how many people in here are

643
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:22,138
researchers okay I'm gonna be going over

644
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:23,999
stuff you've heard so we did the

645
00:26:22,138 --> 00:26:28,699
observational which I call the jane

646
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:28,700
goodall or more honestly stalking

647
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:35,289
laddering which is answering questions

648
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:38,079
and asking basically like a

649
00:26:35,288 --> 00:26:39,278
three-year-old why Wi-Fi by Wi-Fi until

650
00:26:38,078 --> 00:26:41,979
you're getting to the emotional payoff

651
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:46,808
of what caused something fairly normal I

652
00:26:41,979 --> 00:26:48,278
could know that in a second OOP when it

653
00:26:46,808 --> 00:26:51,069
jumps forward it jumps forward and then

654
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:53,858
we did a survey so we went to watching

655
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:57,069
what they're doing then hyper individual

656
00:26:53,858 --> 00:26:58,598
and then we went to as broad as we could

657
00:26:57,069 --> 00:27:02,259
so we did three different methods to try

658
00:26:58,598 --> 00:27:04,749
to figure it out the observational

659
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:06,128
method you have to recruit people so you

660
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:08,769
basically what they're doing is they are

661
00:27:06,128 --> 00:27:12,338
watching people shop and they're taking

662
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:16,149
notes and so you have to find the right

663
00:27:12,338 --> 00:27:20,348
person rule number one never have it be

664
00:27:16,148 --> 00:27:23,439
a male ever because and this is

665
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:25,148
stereotyping but women we most of us

666
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,669
were raised to always be aware of who's

667
00:27:25,148 --> 00:27:28,808
around us and males or threats unless

668
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:32,079
he's a really cute guy but you're

669
00:27:28,808 --> 00:27:34,388
noticing him too so generally speaking

670
00:27:32,078 --> 00:27:35,648
if you don't know a guy and you know if

671
00:27:34,388 --> 00:27:37,238
someone just happens to be going from

672
00:27:35,648 --> 00:27:39,578
department department with you you're

673
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:41,769
always aware of that I'm know I'm

674
00:27:39,578 --> 00:27:43,298
generalizing but if anyone every any

675
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:45,878
female in here think differently on that

676
00:27:43,298 --> 00:27:48,878
one generally I mean it's true enough

677
00:27:45,878 --> 00:27:50,528
that enough women are doing this that we

678
00:27:48,878 --> 00:27:51,698
are aware were you know I don't know

679
00:27:50,528 --> 00:27:53,169
about you I was always taught to look in

680
00:27:51,699 --> 00:27:54,699
the backseat before I get in the car so

681
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:56,589
that first episode of Dexter when he

682
00:27:54,699 --> 00:27:58,269
strangled a guy in the front you know by

683
00:27:56,588 --> 00:27:59,288
jumping on the back seat it's like yeah

684
00:27:58,269 --> 00:28:01,088
that never would have happened with a

685
00:27:59,288 --> 00:28:02,858
woman you know we always look in the

686
00:28:01,088 --> 00:28:04,269
backseat we're always aware of the fact

687
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:06,249
that we could be easy victims because

688
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:08,558
we're not as physically strong as men

689
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:12,338
you know we're not I'm not saying we're

690
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:14,288
always victims but we're always alert so

691
00:28:12,338 --> 00:28:15,428
you never want to have a male do it so

692
00:28:14,288 --> 00:28:17,949
what they ended up doing is they

693
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:20,979
recruited two ladies who head up their

694
00:28:17,949 --> 00:28:23,288
garden clubs in the area and they shop

695
00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:24,669
at multiple stores so they did not want

696
00:28:23,288 --> 00:28:26,259
them to be employees that's another big

697
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:28,839
important role your employees are

698
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:30,249
recognized and people are going to

699
00:28:28,838 --> 00:28:31,658
they're gonna be interrupted they're

700
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:34,690
gonna be they're gonna be noticed as

701
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:37,569
well so they got two older ladies who

702
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:38,710
shop at multiple stores who are gonna be

703
00:28:37,568 --> 00:28:40,359
a little bit more fair they're not

704
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:43,390
say how incredible you are that type of

705
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:45,369
thing and they worked separately and

706
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:47,710
they follow people all day long two days

707
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:51,639
on it you know Saturday and Sunday two

708
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:53,169
weekends in a row they wanted to they

709
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,960
selected the criteria but they're going

710
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:57,340
to observe they had bought new they're

711
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,519
on a hilly location so they had bought

712
00:28:57,339 --> 00:29:02,019
hand brakes on their carts and they

713
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:03,250
wanted to see you know basically I'm

714
00:29:02,019 --> 00:29:04,538
sure they're looking at Hey look how

715
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:06,130
much more money we're getting because of

716
00:29:04,538 --> 00:29:07,390
these great carts we have now we're not

717
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,649
having to go down to the liquor store at

718
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:11,528
the bottom of the hill to get our carts

719
00:29:08,648 --> 00:29:13,359
back but they also wanted to see if

720
00:29:11,528 --> 00:29:14,890
we're in the store they went how many

721
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:16,658
people they talked to what you know

722
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:18,700
which departments they went to they pick

723
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:20,080
things up and put them back down what

724
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,880
they end up buying did they do think you

725
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,079
know didn't have impulse buy they're

726
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,840
also looking at general they can

727
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:27,220
guesstimate their age they could you

728
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:29,740
know they're by themselves or they're

729
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,240
with kids who are a friend or spouse you

730
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,159
know they're making this type of

731
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:36,278
observations and how long they were in

732
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:38,740
the store they did it for multiple days

733
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:43,298
of observation and they compiled the

734
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:45,399
chart and the results in a chart so a

735
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:47,970
chart sample time in store we've kind of

736
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:50,648
gone the age and gender behavior and

737
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,880
they took note so they had room if

738
00:29:50,648 --> 00:29:55,329
there's something unusual they can make

739
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:58,960
a note about that so here's an example

740
00:29:55,329 --> 00:30:01,389
of what we learned here so we had this

741
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,028
person number one is there in the store

742
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:07,179
35 minutes there were about in 30s

743
00:30:04,028 --> 00:30:09,640
there's a female with one child primary

744
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:11,380
path they really wanted to see where

745
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,419
they win it so we have the path there

746
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:15,940
she spoke with staff yes

747
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:20,830
what were they what was purchase window

748
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:23,769
boxes kid project hummingbird feeder and

749
00:30:20,829 --> 00:30:25,089
perennials add-ons at checkout she got

750
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:27,099
that hummingbird hummingbird feeder

751
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:28,689
right there and they seemed to pick up

752
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:30,519
an item from every department staff

753
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:33,519
worked with her to find plants and so on

754
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:39,058
so they did this with everybody and what

755
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:39,058
they found out sorry

756
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:44,209
so what they found out when they

757
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:47,119
compiled all of this their main customer

758
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:48,860
was a 30-something couple they were in a

759
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:50,388
store about 20 minutes on average you

760
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:52,038
know she was a little bit above average

761
00:30:50,388 --> 00:30:53,569
in her time there and she actually spoke

762
00:30:52,038 --> 00:30:54,919
with a lot of people generally speaking

763
00:30:53,569 --> 00:30:57,288
they didn't speak to people in their

764
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:59,240
departments they were there quickly

765
00:30:57,288 --> 00:31:00,378
because they had kids there there like I

766
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,149
said that 20-minute time for him but

767
00:31:00,378 --> 00:31:04,788
they piled a lot of stuff in that short

768
00:31:02,148 --> 00:31:07,128
time period now the next most important

769
00:31:04,788 --> 00:31:09,349
group was that 50 something female but

770
00:31:07,128 --> 00:31:11,178
they were there on average 45 minutes

771
00:31:09,349 --> 00:31:13,368
and they spoke with people in there to

772
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:16,159
each department that makes a big

773
00:31:13,368 --> 00:31:18,740
difference in how your marketing so the

774
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,940
next one and we're short on time I would

775
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,919
normally bring someone up here with us

776
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:25,480
say hey let's do a practice of laddering

777
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:28,220
but this is kind of a why-why-why method

778
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,808
so if you can have about half hour of

779
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,769
the per customer what you do is you ask

780
00:31:29,808 --> 00:31:33,378
them what is the last thing you

781
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:42,109
purchased so what's the last thing you

782
00:31:33,378 --> 00:31:46,668
purchased at a garden center a perennial

783
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:49,240
and why did you buy that perennial why

784
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:49,240
did you want it

785
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:56,170
okay so why is it important to you to

786
00:31:54,670 --> 00:32:19,480
have something that appeals to you

787
00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:21,430
that's different I don't know he caught

788
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,960
that she was told that this is not zone

789
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:28,000
six I don't think I should sell it to

790
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,569
you if you go now I need to have it he

791
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,220
was right

792
00:32:28,569 --> 00:32:34,599
it died but generally keep pushing and

793
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:37,240
pushing and pushing until you find out

794
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:39,099
what is the emotional payoff so for one

795
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,559
woman that this method was done they

796
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:44,589
found out that she actually doesn't like

797
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:46,990
gardening but she wants her daughter to

798
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:48,549
come over and spend time with her and so

799
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:50,380
she that's her daughter will come over

800
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:52,809
to garden that's one of the tasks her

801
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:55,750
daughter volunteers its happy to do with

802
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:56,859
her because mom needs help in the are so

803
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,819
she doesn't really like gardening but

804
00:32:56,859 --> 00:32:59,259
it's a way to spend time with her

805
00:32:57,819 --> 00:33:01,059
daughter the emotional payoff has

806
00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:03,990
nothing to do with that plant it has to

807
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:06,190
do with family and emotional fulfillment

808
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,750
someone else and this is where it gets

809
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:09,309
interesting so when you're interviewing

810
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,720
all these individuals and then you go

811
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:11,980
back to the other one and you kind of

812
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,529
compare notes about the different groups

813
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:16,390
the thirtysomething is I'm the kind of

814
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:18,549
person who really cares about the planet

815
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:20,560
and I'm going to be an organic gardener

816
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:23,139
I'm the kind of person who cares about

817
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,549
what happens to the food that goes in my

818
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,590
family's body so I want to make sure

819
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:28,720
it's pure I have all control over that

820
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:31,480
I'm the kind of person to see the you

821
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,329
know the continued here all of it was

822
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,190
about a form of self-expression that's

823
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:37,720
extremely different than somewhat like

824
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:40,509
the older group it was more about a

825
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,970
chance to be alone the younger group was

826
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:45,190
about socializing the older group was

827
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:47,500
about recharging and getting away from

828
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:49,390
the madness of their of their life those

829
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:51,789
are two extremely different marketing

830
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:53,410
messages so you really need to

831
00:33:51,789 --> 00:33:55,000
understand the demographics of who's

832
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:59,310
buying the plants in your area in your

833
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,309
store how my time

834
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:14,878
hmm ten minutes okay so it's all saying

835
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:16,769
if you notice patterns in the in the

836
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:20,069
observational study the nican apply you

837
00:34:16,769 --> 00:34:21,449
can cross match it here we also did the

838
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:24,059
survey method and frankly this was

839
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:26,250
almost just like a checking how are we

840
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:27,570
doing so we asked what do you want from

841
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,889
a garden center and they had a whole

842
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:31,230
bunch of things they could choose from

843
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:33,750
and then they asked specifically how do

844
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:36,480
we do each of them and that went to

845
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:38,190
several thousand people so you could see

846
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:43,500
you know what we're we're looking at

847
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:46,079
different areas so here's some of the

848
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:49,559
questions we asked you know what's

849
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:51,889
important to you then how are we doing

850
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:51,889
on that

851
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:03,609
well it change from group to group so

852
00:35:01,909 --> 00:35:09,829
again we got the demographic information

853
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:11,090
so it was important to have when it

854
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:13,279
comes to independent this is true across

855
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:17,030
the board with people who cared about

856
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,890
knowledge who cared about quality they

857
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,820
always went to a local locally owned

858
00:35:18,889 --> 00:35:22,579
plant retailer

859
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:24,440
it was convenience of course it's going

860
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:26,000
to be the grocery store or a master

861
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,740
tickets they're never there just to buy

862
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,289
plants usually they're there to buy

863
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:31,789
other things as well and I can say

864
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:36,199
someone is you know as busy as I am

865
00:35:31,789 --> 00:35:40,429
that's a big appeal you know so being

866
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:42,230
active in the community kid friendly you

867
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:43,639
can see where that all different all

868
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:46,190
these different things would be variety

869
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:47,989
of plants was important but it's not as

870
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:50,240
important as we as retailers Timothy you

871
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:52,429
know we are plant people not business

872
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:54,859
people so we put you know the plant is

873
00:35:52,429 --> 00:35:56,480
most important it is our biggest you

874
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,220
know everybody knows it's our biggest

875
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,139
seller if you look at all plants as a

876
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:02,089
whole so we need to increase the cells

877
00:36:00,139 --> 00:36:04,429
of that and that's why they're there at

878
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:06,530
your store but we tend to put much more

879
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:09,799
you know we will give you six ways to

880
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:12,380
kill a slug we'll give you 20,000 Rose

881
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:14,330
varieties and the consumer wants us to

882
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:17,030
actually do some editing for them on

883
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:18,739
that I think so and that's not part of

884
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:22,580
the study that's just me editorializing

885
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:25,009
so all right so what leaf you learned

886
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:28,309
this primary customer family with the

887
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:32,240
parents in their 30s or 40s the

888
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:33,619
expensive cars for her bust Michelle

889
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:37,429
kept the diary through all of this it

890
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:40,339
was hilarious and people because he had

891
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:42,500
it was you know like with a lawn mower

892
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:43,670
we have a double handle in order for it

893
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,369
to go you have to squeeze it together

894
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:48,050
and the stop it you let go the same kind

895
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:49,460
of concept people couldn't figure that

896
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:52,039
out they were dragging specially the

897
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:55,970
guys we're dragging it through the

898
00:36:52,039 --> 00:37:00,119
gravel with the brakes on

899
00:36:55,969 --> 00:37:03,949
so they had a fire sale pretty quickly

900
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:06,119
after that there are $500 a piece yeah

901
00:37:03,949 --> 00:37:08,819
she had to submit that they made a

902
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:11,130
mistake with it the customers were

903
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,570
ditching the racetrack path okay for

904
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:15,930
anyone who doesn't know what a racetrack

905
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:17,309
path is it's whenever you have I could

906
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:19,199
go through IKEA they have a racetrack

907
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:20,880
they take you through the entire store

908
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:23,219
and you kind of have to know the inside

909
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,050
ways to kind of cut corners that's the

910
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:27,719
same concept with the garden center we

911
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:28,980
take there's a wider path than anything

912
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:31,259
else in the garden center and it takes

913
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:33,510
you all the way through all the plant

914
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:35,460
yard and throughout the entire store so

915
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:36,870
they have one here because the further

916
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:40,110
they go into the store the more they're

917
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:41,730
going to buy so they were finding that

918
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:44,550
there's one location where everybody was

919
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:46,500
leaving on the first weekend so the next

920
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:49,260
weekend in between the week between the

921
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,880
two weekends they increase the size of

922
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,140
the display there so they didn't block

923
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,630
it if they actually wanted to be there

924
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:56,339
but it wasn't so visually appealing you

925
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,960
know what's at this wider path so they

926
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:00,180
made it so they can go in that section

927
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,579
easily but it wasn't so obvious a path

928
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:04,699
and everybody started going to the back

929
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:07,739
of the store after that so it worked so

930
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:09,299
this is just a good practice overall now

931
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:12,209
these are things beyond just you know

932
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,890
this is just behavior the customer they

933
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:15,119
also found out that what motivates the

934
00:38:13,889 --> 00:38:19,589
two main customer groups are very

935
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,909
different and sales training needed

936
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:22,620
tweaking this is really interesting

937
00:38:20,909 --> 00:38:24,179
they had a product that they're not

938
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:27,239
making money on it's a five dollar

939
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:29,219
starter kit for every shrub sold they

940
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:31,769
want their staff to sell this five

941
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:34,349
dollar starter kit everything then there

942
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:36,389
is value I mean that's whole so it is no

943
00:38:34,349 --> 00:38:38,659
margin on that at all it's

944
00:38:36,389 --> 00:38:40,739
straightforward but they do that because

945
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:42,569
just by the customer reading the

946
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:45,089
instructions putting in the fertilizer

947
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,500
they're watering the plant more just the

948
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,550
fact that they're you know taking care

949
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,469
they're not just putting it in the

950
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:52,050
ground and walking away they have more

951
00:38:49,469 --> 00:38:53,669
success and there's nothing more

952
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:55,620
discouraging there's someone had the

953
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:57,720
first plant they buy especially they

954
00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:00,359
spend money on it like a shrub but for

955
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:01,799
it to die and so they found out their

956
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,410
staff wasn't doing that weren't really

957
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,870
selling that starter kit so they had an

958
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:08,879
emergency staff meeting where they did

959
00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:09,440
role playing and different things like

960
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,210
that

961
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,059
their staff and their cells on that

962
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:15,409
starter kit went up 65% like I said the

963
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:18,049
cells of the starter kit itself

964
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:19,730
monetarily aren't that important but it

965
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:21,050
is because then the customer has more

966
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:25,510
success and they're happy and they'll

967
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:25,510
come back to the store yes

968
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:46,389
you know that's that would have been

969
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,190
brilliant what she's saying is that it

970
00:39:46,389 --> 00:39:50,170
probably would have been smarter and you

971
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:52,539
need to quite say it that way but that I

972
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:54,970
probably have been smarter to add the

973
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:56,219
cost of the starter kit to the shrubs so

974
00:39:54,969 --> 00:39:58,509
they could it as a gift with purchase

975
00:39:56,219 --> 00:39:59,980
you know we want you to succeed so much

976
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:01,320
here's here's our gift to you making

977
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,400
sure there could their costs are covered

978
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,170
because they're not you know this is not

979
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,280
a money-making venture for them that's

980
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:08,590
that's a brilliant idea

981
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,240
and that's important that you actually

982
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:12,340
add the price right now and another

983
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:15,759
study I'm working on right now it's

984
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:17,680
pricing and we are terrible about

985
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,020
including all our costs when we put

986
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:22,829
plants in Chrysler plant both growers

987
00:40:20,019 --> 00:40:26,829
and retailers or terrible at it

988
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:28,929
Freight is a cost and it's not a bad

989
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:30,309
thing to include it in the cost you're

990
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:31,690
not cheating your customer because

991
00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:34,029
you're wanting to include Freight in

992
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:41,920
your cost sorry you can tell a lot of

993
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:43,000
people do not do that so alright so I'm

994
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,480
private it because we're probably

995
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,260
towards the end here right five minutes

996
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,260
okay so

997
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:58,289
you can saw I'm not wearing a watch so

998
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:01,200
thank you I appreciate that so that was

999
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:02,579
like looking at your own own store the

1000
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:04,230
other thing is how do we get bigger

1001
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:06,150
Pinot Noir people to come into your

1002
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:08,880
store and you need to get comfortable

1003
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:10,280
with spending time with a census because

1004
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,079
the census will have information

1005
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:15,180
demographic information about the zip

1006
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:16,829
codes in your community I mean you can

1007
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:18,659
get really granular with what the

1008
00:41:16,829 --> 00:41:21,389
information the US government has and

1009
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:23,190
you can target communities that you know

1010
00:41:21,389 --> 00:41:25,079
you want to be attracting so you you

1011
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:27,059
know you can send all of your mailers to

1012
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:28,909
that zip code and that type of thing

1013
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:36,029
there's a lot you can learn from that

1014
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:39,299
and hold focus groups you know $500 gift

1015
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:42,900
cards and put an ad on Craigslist to get

1016
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:45,060
people to come in and begin questioning

1017
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,980
them about you could choose what area

1018
00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:48,329
that it is that you want to improve if

1019
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:50,219
you're wanting to do projects that you

1020
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:51,929
want to have displays related to that

1021
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:53,219
what are the projects they're trying to

1022
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:55,049
want to do at their home what are they

1023
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:58,859
trying to improve you know there's a lot

1024
00:41:55,050 --> 00:42:03,090
of different things create an advisory

1025
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:05,220
panel I do that for myself I've done

1026
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:06,630
that to the beginning my career I will

1027
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:08,219
you know if I have something come up I

1028
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:09,950
have a group of people who've agreed to

1029
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:12,359
let me bug them on the phone and say hey

1030
00:42:09,949 --> 00:42:14,279
I've got this topic I think we need a

1031
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,570
handle but I I'm not doing what you're

1032
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,820
doing what should I do with it

1033
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:19,590
you can do the same thing with customers

1034
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:21,090
you know get a group that you know will

1035
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:22,590
be honest and you need to pick the

1036
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:24,180
people right you want people who are

1037
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:28,350
opinionated but not people who are

1038
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:29,849
obnoxious and arts are so opinionated

1039
00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:31,949
that they can't see how that people have

1040
00:42:29,849 --> 00:42:32,940
different points of view you know so you

1041
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,949
don't you know you want someone who's

1042
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,360
going to be honest and this shoots from

1043
00:42:34,949 --> 00:42:39,359
the hip and tell you tell you what you

1044
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:41,190
need to hear and you can get some really

1045
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,930
good information and I would say bring

1046
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:44,789
them together at least once a month to

1047
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:46,739
kind of get some feedback take them to

1048
00:42:44,789 --> 00:42:49,500
dinner this is not a focus group this is

1049
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:51,539
not something formal this is you you

1050
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:54,389
know being willing to hear people who

1051
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:57,748
are willing to help you out

1052
00:42:54,389 --> 00:43:01,778
there's an HOA offer to work together

1053
00:42:57,748 --> 00:43:03,639
HOAs have an amazing amount of power the

1054
00:43:01,778 --> 00:43:04,838
business home owners associations for

1055
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:07,449
those who don't know what that is and

1056
00:43:04,838 --> 00:43:09,188
they have rules like oh if you let the

1057
00:43:07,449 --> 00:43:12,909
grass go Brown you get fined every day

1058
00:43:09,188 --> 00:43:14,469
it's brown you know I'm from Texas so

1059
00:43:12,909 --> 00:43:15,699
you know there's actually people out

1060
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:18,278
there spray-painting they're from their

1061
00:43:15,699 --> 00:43:20,380
lawn to get brown that you cannot have

1062
00:43:18,278 --> 00:43:21,969
more than three rose bushes in your yard

1063
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:23,858
you know there's a lot of people people

1064
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:26,528
who get on HOA boards and if anybody in

1065
00:43:23,858 --> 00:43:28,900
here is on one I'm about to insult you a

1066
00:43:26,528 --> 00:43:29,949
lot of people get on HOA Bart boards are

1067
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,349
people who are not accustomed to having

1068
00:43:29,949 --> 00:43:35,739
power in their lives so they kind of go

1069
00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:38,349
a little crazy when I was in college I

1070
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:41,019
worked with the Student Loan Association

1071
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:42,910
in the summer I don't know why they did

1072
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:45,448
this but they asked me to organize the

1073
00:43:42,909 --> 00:43:45,449
annual homeless

1074
00:43:45,518 --> 00:43:50,889
what do you call it the conference I'm a

1075
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:52,689
college student I don't know what the

1076
00:43:50,889 --> 00:43:54,159
heck I'm doing but I'm lining up the

1077
00:43:52,688 --> 00:43:55,389
speaker's you know they're getting me

1078
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:57,338
the speakers but I'm calling them and

1079
00:43:55,389 --> 00:43:59,708
I'm biting them and I'm doing the site

1080
00:43:57,338 --> 00:44:01,808
visits and I mean this is way more power

1081
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:04,208
than I should have been given but I was

1082
00:44:01,809 --> 00:44:07,809
also moonlighting at night at Dillard's

1083
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:09,759
and so one day I had to speak to the

1084
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:11,859
Secretary of Education for the United

1085
00:44:09,759 --> 00:44:14,380
States get him on the phone with mr.

1086
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:16,778
secretary oh no no call me Bill you know

1087
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:18,548
very very nice I get to work that night

1088
00:44:16,778 --> 00:44:20,438
it's just little guy who's the manager

1089
00:44:18,548 --> 00:44:22,838
of the store I am he's like maybe five

1090
00:44:20,438 --> 00:44:26,518
years older than me I'm mr. Monroe you

1091
00:44:22,838 --> 00:44:29,438
must call me Monroe mr. Monroe like okay

1092
00:44:26,518 --> 00:44:31,478
people with not much power have more

1093
00:44:29,438 --> 00:44:33,848
desire to force other people to show

1094
00:44:31,478 --> 00:44:35,078
them respect people with real powered

1095
00:44:33,849 --> 00:44:37,568
need to do it

1096
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:40,568
HOA sometimes you get that mindset on

1097
00:44:37,568 --> 00:44:43,119
those boards I think every yard in this

1098
00:44:40,568 --> 00:44:44,409
should never ever ever ever have a pink

1099
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:47,769
flamingo and if you haven't I'm fining

1100
00:44:44,409 --> 00:44:49,449
you $1,000 you know we could only have

1101
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:51,698
blue and green at the front door colors

1102
00:44:49,449 --> 00:44:53,409
you know you can only have wrought iron

1103
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:55,599
for your fence there's some silly stuff

1104
00:44:53,409 --> 00:44:57,068
it happens with plants too you can't

1105
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,640
have any vegetable plants in your yarn

1106
00:44:57,068 --> 00:45:01,808
at all it's tacky you know so if you

1107
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:02,858
actually work with homeowners

1108
00:45:01,809 --> 00:45:04,150
association I've known a couple

1109
00:45:02,858 --> 00:45:06,730
retailers who've done this

1110
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:10,090
they'll have open nights that there

1111
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:13,619
garden center where 10% of all sales or

1112
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:16,809
that's a big not just profit potential

1113
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:19,779
omona association they love getting

1114
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:22,059
money so if you work with them and then

1115
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,720
you can say hey there's some here's some

1116
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:24,610
things you should know about

1117
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:26,649
sustainability and this is what you know

1118
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:29,440
can really help your community and you

1119
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:31,480
you can work with them it's being partly

1120
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,900
- playing paulo politics really is what

1121
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,829
it is

1122
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:37,180
but it can make a big difference so this

1123
00:45:35,829 --> 00:45:39,519
will set us talking about fact finder

1124
00:45:37,179 --> 00:45:42,069
com go spend some time and explore your

1125
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:43,389
community I mean you need to find out

1126
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:45,460
what the ethnic groups are in your

1127
00:45:43,389 --> 00:45:47,429
community we're far to fight an industry

1128
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:49,929
and we attract far too many white people

1129
00:45:47,429 --> 00:45:52,569
or a much more diverse country than that

1130
00:45:49,929 --> 00:45:56,049
and we need to figure out and again that

1131
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:58,539
focus groups advisers all of that be

1132
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:59,920
respectful try to find out you know how

1133
00:45:58,539 --> 00:46:02,110
gardening is different for someone you

1134
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:07,329
know if you have a large community that

1135
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:09,010
has emigrated from Estonia you know that

1136
00:46:07,329 --> 00:46:12,009
that's the way America is today we have

1137
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:13,660
enclaves from countries sometimes we've

1138
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:15,280
never heard of until we find out that's

1139
00:46:13,659 --> 00:46:16,679
part of our community we need to be

1140
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,300
reaching out to these communities

1141
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:21,069
America's only get any more diverse it's

1142
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:23,860
been time here and that's going to help

1143
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:26,350
you get to know your community so good

1144
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:29,769
news is we're an industry made up of

1145
00:46:26,349 --> 00:46:32,049
independently owned businesses and that

1146
00:46:29,769 --> 00:46:33,849
means we are more flexible we're better

1147
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:35,860
able to understand who our communities

1148
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:38,019
are and if we really focus on who they

1149
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:40,900
are all of those problems I was talking

1150
00:46:38,019 --> 00:46:42,670
about in the beginning we're all there's

1151
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:44,349
no one answer there's no one answer but

1152
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:46,389
if you're focusing so much on who your

1153
00:46:44,349 --> 00:46:47,739
customer is you're going to be

1154
00:46:46,389 --> 00:46:51,250
responding to them and you're going to

1155
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:54,279
be automatically appealing to them

1156
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:56,849
because of that so thank you very much I

1157
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,850
appreciate your time
