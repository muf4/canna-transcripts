1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:04,560
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:12,559
University thank you Susan for the

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:16,359
introduction and it's always nice to

4
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:19,559
talk to your colleagues about your work

5
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:23,519
so to today I'm going to tell some of

6
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:27,479
our recent research on crop nutritional

7
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:31,678
quality improvement so my lab has been

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:35,079
focused on mainly four areas one is the

9
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:37,839
C noid research and the ano signning

10
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:40,200
selenia and the michelon bio

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,719
fortification and today I'm just going

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:47,520
to tell you some of our recent research

13
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:50,320
results on CR noid research so this is a

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,640
slid I always like to use to introduce

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:59,039
Crow noise so Crow noise are not Le to

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,679
any of us because CR no gave their red

17
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:06,519
orange and and the yellow color find

18
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:10,519
Elling vegetables fruits and flowers so

19
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:14,319
why are we interesting with C noid

20
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:17,879
research this is because C noid are know

21
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:21,919
to be important in human nutrition and

22
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:25,959
health like reduce the risk of cancer

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:29,960
heart disease and eye age related eye

24
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:33,239
diseases and it's some of the croto we

25
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:37,399
called Pro vitamin A choid like a beta

26
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:39,919
Carin contain one or two beta rings and

27
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:43,840
they are not to provide the precursor

28
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:48,040
for vitamin A senses since our humans

29
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,680
can't synthesize the vitamin A so all of

30
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:55,280
the vitamin A in our diet can be

31
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:58,360
ultimately traced back to Coto origin

32
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,519
and many staple crops are known to

33
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:06,560
contain very low level of crop noise as

34
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:10,758
a result they contribute to the global

35
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:13,878
prevy of vitamin A deficiency and as you

36
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:16,958
can see vitamin A deficiency affect a

37
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:22,120
large number of preschool children and

38
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,120
the pregnant women in those poor

39
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:32,480
areas so typically uh CR noid are C40

40
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:35,639
turboid compounds the croo bi synthetic

41
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:40,518
pathway has been very well established

42
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:42,279
over half century ago and the main crop

43
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:45,920
noid because the double bond and the

44
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:49,400
ring structure give distinctive colors

45
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:53,158
like we know tomato is red color because

46
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,519
tomato accumulate a lots of lco beIN and

47
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:58,000
carrots is orange color because

48
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,840
accumulate lots of Alpha carotin and

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,878
beta cartin many yellow flow like a

50
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,519
death de is yellow color because

51
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:09,079
accumulate looting and other zensor

52
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:12,840
fails so during the past two decades we

53
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:16,159
also start to understand uh the the

54
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,799
process to produ to produce April crop

55
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:23,239
noise include some plant homas Ava and

56
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:26,200
St electon and also beta ions they

57
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:31,039
volatile compounds to give flow fruits

58
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:34,238
the the flavor and aroma so all the

59
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:37,000
genes in the Coro biosynthetic pathway

60
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,799
have been major Gene all the gene the

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,239
major Cal biosynthetic pathway have been

62
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:46,280
clone and the whale studed from many

63
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:49,719
crops and plant species however T now we

64
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:52,120
still have a very limited knowledge

65
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:55,759
about the transcription factors and the

66
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:59,719
Rory genes control the expression of

67
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:02,798
those paway genes so crop noise

68
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:04,199
essentially are synthesized in plastic

69
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,319
in Plants

70
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:10,238
tissues

71
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:13,560
so crinoid can synthesize in nearly all

72
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:17,918
kind of plastic like amop plast uh

73
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:21,319
chromoplast and chloroplast Etc but they

74
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:25,519
accumulate in high levels in chloroplast

75
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:28,599
in Green Leaf tissues and also in Chrome

76
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:31,560
plast found in many flour fruits and

77
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,439
vegetables since the ultimate goal of

78
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:38,399
our research is to understand how plants

79
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:41,759
can synthesize high level of crot noise

80
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,679
so this is our Focus to try to

81
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,840
understand how crot noise are

82
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,759
synthesized and regulate In

83
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:52,879
chloroplast so for many of you know for

84
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:56,120
long time my lab has been work with the

85
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,560
orange Jean that was originally Clon

86
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,840
from Orange

87
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:04,759
cauliflower and uh you the map based

88
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:09,000
cloning strategy we cloned this Gene and

89
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:11,879
found it's does it does not encode a

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,439
enzyme involved with croto bios

91
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,800
synthetical pathway but instead it's

92
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:20,439
encode a protein with one on low

93
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,079
function and contain DJ sit in reach

94
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:27,000
domain but it's not Cho on protein by

95
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:31,240
itself because it's lack of the J

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:35,079
domains so recently in collaborate with

97
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:40,000
Israeli scientist we found that the O

98
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:42,758
Gene is also also controls beta cartin

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
senses in mow

100
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:49,400
fruits so our collaborate uh

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,079
collaborator from Israel and they made a

102
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:59,799
cross between the orange mow fruit dely

103
00:05:54,079 --> 00:06:02,240
with orange green mellow fruits tamy Jew

104
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,199
and in the F2 population in this

105
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,319
particular population they found the

106
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,439
orange fruit flash

107
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:14,120
segregate with 3 to one ratio

108
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:18,680
essentially it's this tray segregates as

109
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:22,160
a monog genetic dominant trays so they

110
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:25,759
did Association analyze and they found

111
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:30,240
that the O Gene completely cosegregates

112
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:33,520
with flash color in this F2 mapping

113
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,038
population as you can see with green

114
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:40,399
green flash fruits contain this band and

115
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:43,360
orange contain this B so in C in in

116
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:46,560
addition they also servered a white

117
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:50,919
genetic collection they have and they

118
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:55,439
found the or existed in two hpo ties one

119
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:58,359
is associated with green flashh for from

120
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:01,519
all those ger plant collection and one

121
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:04,840
is associated with either yellow or

122
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:06,878
either orange or green or

123
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:09,878
white so in

124
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:13,080
collaborate in collaboration with them

125
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:17,960
we clone the oin from green fruit green

126
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:21,598
flesh and uh orange flash fruits and we

127
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:27,159
transform them into plants as you can

128
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:30,240
see they Gene from Orange if the Gen the

129
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:33,800
O Gene from Orange Flash fruits can

130
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:37,160
introduce can induce Coto accumulation

131
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:40,879
like the orange cauliflower Gene however

132
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:44,840
they Gene from the Green Flash fruit

133
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:48,158
can't introduce additional Coro uh

134
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:52,878
accumulation just like a white Ty

135
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:56,598
control so we looked at the the SE the

136
00:07:52,879 --> 00:08:00,960
seing a sequence between this two

137
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:04,360
variety there there are six nips and

138
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:07,638
five of them cause silence mutation and

139
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,319
but one of them cause msense mutation so

140
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:14,720
essentially the the later genetic

141
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:18,639
variation show that the in green flesh

142
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:23,960
fruits contain the G and in the orange

143
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:26,759
contains the A and with the the they

144
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:30,719
change it's CA one single amino acid

145
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:36,240
change to change the ariny in the o into

146
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:40,200
hting the orange o so to see if

147
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:44,038
this sleep or this single nuclear tide

148
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:48,920
difference uh is indeed responsible for

149
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:52,480
the fruit flash color and the g the sequ

150
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:56,360
U the nuclear TI was CH was mutagenized

151
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:59,360
so what we did is that we changed the g

152
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,560
into a in the green Gene and we we

153
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,879
change the a into g into in the orange

154
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:10,000
Gene and as you can see the green Gene

155
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:12,958
now can induce Coto accumulation and the

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,639
Red Jeans can't introduce croto

157
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:19,759
accumulation so this will confirm the

158
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:23,480
effect the indeed this slip is

159
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:27,000
responsible for the or function and we

160
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:30,800
called this slip golden

161
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,919
slip and we called it L sleep because

162
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:36,759
with this single sleep change one amino

163
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:39,078
acid and it can cause beta carotin

164
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:41,799
accumulation and also change the fruit

165
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:45,599
color and this golden slip is

166
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:48,240
responsible for all the Mellow color

167
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,399
difference at least from those germ

168
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,120
plasma I a collaborator

169
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:57,879
collect from all around the world so the

170
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:02,679
next question we asked uh was does this

171
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:07,320
golden slap also work in other plant

172
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:11,599
org so what we did is that we changed

173
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:15,120
the conserved we did Cy direct muten Li

174
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,600
to change the conserved ariny in this

175
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:22,759
case in arodis or Arin changed Arginine

176
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:26,639
to Hine phenoline lysine and Aline and

177
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:29,120
we also Chang the nearby Arin into Hine

178
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:32,679
and transform those construct into

179
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:35,959
plants to look at the color change and

180
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:39,879
as you can see here when we ought the

181
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:44,919
conserved ariny into history in the arop

182
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:49,399
OR Gene and the it's CA the crop no it's

183
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:51,679
cause the color change in arabis C and

184
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,679
when we looked at the color change and

185
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:58,039
found that the color is indeed

186
00:10:54,679 --> 00:11:00,958
associated with Cortino increased Coro

187
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:03,838
accumulation and more importantly if we

188
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:08,319
look at the profile and we found that

189
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:13,600
the beta cting ratio in the white uh

190
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:17,200
colors only 15% but this become over 50%

191
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:20,120
during two weeks of dark in

192
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,560
incubations and in addition we found the

193
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:27,278
hesting substitution in a crop or in

194
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:32,559
this case San or gen it's also caus the

195
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:35,559
same effect lead to high level of croto

196
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:40,239
accumulation moreover we found that the

197
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:43,919
hting is not the only amino acids change

198
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:47,919
show to be effective we showed that the

199
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:52,199
Aline replacement in the org is also

200
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:55,599
equally effective to promote croto over

201
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:58,399
production as you can see the the the

202
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,480
the colors cure become dark orange and

203
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:06,039
show high level of coronoid

204
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:12,759
accumulation so this experiment shows

205
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:17,439
shows that the both o or Aline can serve

206
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:21,399
as effective genetic tools for croto

207
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:25,240
accumul for croto manipulation so what

208
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:28,278
does this finding means for CR

209
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:31,000
Improvement and sometimes go when we

210
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:35,078
first close on the cauliflower or Gene

211
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,839
and we we test its effect to improve

212
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:42,399
crop nutritional quality and in

213
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:46,120
collaborate with Joyce W and we put the

214
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:50,559
cauliflower or g into potato

215
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:56,039
tubers and the or transing does not only

216
00:12:50,559 --> 00:13:00,039
induce CR no increase in the fresh prate

217
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:03,278
tuber but during the storage they it's

218
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:05,838
stimulate continuous accumulation of

219
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:09,039
beta caring as you can see here

220
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:13,680
following five months of storage the

221
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:17,599
crot no increase over 10 times in some

222
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:22,719
lines and furthermore in collaborate

223
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:25,480
with Mike mour we also look at the cral

224
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,480
accumulation during storage of the

225
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,480
squash and as you can see the color

226
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:35,920
become darker during storage and it's

227
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:39,480
also associated with with increased CR

228
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:43,319
noise so what this means the actually

229
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:47,278
the significant of this findings that we

230
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:50,759
know staple crops with as I just

231
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:54,078
mentioned staple crops with low level of

232
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:57,800
beta cartin contribute to the global

233
00:13:54,078 --> 00:14:00,479
prevalency of vitamin A deficiency and

234
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:04,399
we also know know that the beta carting

235
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:07,159
in stable crops is not very stable

236
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:10,000
during storage because in most of the

237
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:12,958
case those beta cartin are synthesized

238
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:18,559
and store in Amo

239
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:21,599
plast so through this two o uh o

240
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:25,119
transing experiment in potato tuber and

241
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,800
also the Squatch experiment we know that

242
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:32,000
the oing or in the squash case the both

243
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:36,000
most case they provide some unique

244
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,799
mechanism to improve beta carting senses

245
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,159
and also stable storage during the sto

246
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:46,159
during stay uh and beta carting

247
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:49,120
stability during the storage so if we

248
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:52,879
can find the mechanism maybe we have a

249
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:55,919
way to improve our stable crop with

250
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:59,559
enhance the beta carting level not only

251
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:03,759
for continuous senses but also staing

252
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:07,919
storage during past post Harvest

253
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:09,959
storage so I showed you that in Orange

254
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:13,759
cauliflower we know the mutation is

255
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:16,638
duing to a insertion of large transposal

256
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:20,560
elements however in the M case the

257
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:23,919
mutation is this duing to a later

258
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:26,679
variation with the single nuclear TI the

259
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:29,639
difference so because this is single

260
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:32,719
nucle tide we Pro that that the single

261
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:35,399
nucleotide change to change a specific

262
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:39,560
amino acid and it change the

263
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:43,839
functionality of the o to promote corol

264
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:46,879
accumulation so all of many of us know

265
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:51,040
that Geno editing become the technology

266
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:55,000
you to use to change our G to

267
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:58,599
enhance to change to improve economic

268
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,639
trace and so we are waiting for the

269
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,759
maturity or advanc of the technology so

270
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:06,278
we can

271
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:10,318
specifically replace one or two nuclear

272
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:13,240
tide to change one amino acid to say its

273
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:16,159
effect you

274
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:20,440
improve beta carting accumulation in

275
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:23,519
staple crops and actually in collaborate

276
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,519
with Peter bear as the inventor of

277
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,759
golden rice they are not trying to put

278
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:34,440
our o h

279
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:38,600
they are trying to manipulate the rice

280
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:42,440
Orin to change the hting to change the

281
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:46,120
Argin into hting and see if it can help

282
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,399
indeed can help improve the total CID

283
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:52,000
level in Golden rice and most

284
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:54,919
importantly say if it can help stabilize

285
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,318
the beta carting doing post Harvest

286
00:16:54,919 --> 00:17:03,078
storage and also we know that or I'm

287
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:06,000
sorry so we also we know that there

288
00:17:03,078 --> 00:17:09,159
there's taing method and also looking

289
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,199
for later genetic variation so so

290
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:16,120
through those approach we are hoping in

291
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:18,959
future we can improve the staple crop

292
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:23,078
beta carting level not only through

293
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:26,000
transg approach of no we know it's not

294
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:29,079
uh in good state to do that but we we

295
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,079
believe we can get use some way to

296
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:36,480
improve to to create the function a of

297
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:39,240
the org in stable crops through non

298
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,480
through transitional breeding

299
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:46,798
approach so maybe some of you already

300
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:50,558
notic that in our experiment we

301
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:54,279
expressed both Y type O Gene and the

302
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:56,678
mutant o Gene and although both of them

303
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:59,440
show the similar level of gene

304
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:01,679
expression and also similar level of

305
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,720
protein expression but they show the

306
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:08,120
dramatic difference in induced CR noid

307
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:11,919
accumulation as you can see the both the

308
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:15,558
color and the total crop no accumulation

309
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:19,600
so one question we were asking was how

310
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:22,839
does the or or Aline or the or mutant

311
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:26,158
differentially regulate C noid

312
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:30,199
accumulation so to answer this question

313
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:35,000
the we try to ask what is the function

314
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:40,759
of the Y type O Gene so to answer this

315
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:44,119
question we did uh we were looking for o

316
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:47,960
interacting proteins to find the O

317
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:50,839
interacting proteins we use the co imuno

318
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:54,480
precipitation in conjunction with mass

319
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:59,480
spectral analyze so essentially we have

320
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:04,120
our robotop plants Express the or Y type

321
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:07,679
Gene TCT with gfp and the gfp only we

322
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:11,399
extract uh protein from this plants and

323
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:15,480
mix with beads and you then you loot out

324
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:20,080
the COO precepted protein and in

325
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:25,640
collaboration with T touser at our

326
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:30,678
usdf unit and they his lab analyze those

327
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:35,720
Gil band and identified uh around

328
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:38,720
19 proteins that can be this is 19

329
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:42,240
conserved protein actually from each

330
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:45,200
each gel and we identified more than 100

331
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:49,000
proteins so we essentially from multi

332
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,440
biological replicate samples we identify

333
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,240
19

334
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:59,000
Protein that's as potential candidates

335
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:02,599
for all our interaction proteins very

336
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:08,240
excitingly we found the psy or Fon

337
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:12,079
senses as one of them so what is Psy the

338
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:17,359
psy of Fon senses is the rate limiting

339
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:20,158
enzyme in Cal by senses paway and uh

340
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:22,959
it's also the first enzyme in the

341
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:27,440
specific pathway there are lots

342
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:30,360
of experiment shows that manipulation of

343
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,558
the PS why expression can have a

344
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:35,918
profound effect on total crop no

345
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:38,480
accumulation and here I show you some

346
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,200
example like a golden rice here's a

347
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,319
golden rice one and golden rice two you

348
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,080
can see the crop no level is quite

349
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:50,038
different actually the only difference

350
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:54,960
between Golden rice 2 and golden rice

351
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:59,079
one is change the psy and golden rice 2

352
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:03,440
use a high active Psy from Maze and

353
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:06,279
golden rice one use Psy from Death de

354
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,558
flowers and also here's the golden

355
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:12,558
colola it's just Express the psy you can

356
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:16,119
see the Colona seeds color change from

357
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:20,480
green to orange color and there are Lous

358
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:22,879
experiment show you express any Psy from

359
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,000
from any plants normally you can get

360
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,159
orange

361
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,519
colors uh showed like here so to come

362
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:36,600
confirm that the psy is indeed they all

363
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:40,038
are interacting proteins we use we used

364
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:44,480
three different approach to confirm that

365
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:48,079
and the first through e two Hy for acid

366
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,759
and as you can see not only cifl or but

367
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:54,678
Aris or there's a

368
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:58,919
lot or like protein they all interact

369
00:21:54,679 --> 00:22:02,240
with Psy in yeast two Hy I

370
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:04,600
and we also did put down assd to confirm

371
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,359
such interaction as you can see here

372
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:12,319
when you mix the psy tack protein with o

373
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:15,678
tack protein you can see the O put down

374
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:18,918
with gfp and you can detect with CMAC

375
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:22,880
show the direct interaction but not in

376
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:26,559
the selective controls and the third

377
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:30,120
approach we used the BFC and the further

378
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:35,079
confirm such inter action in Vil in

379
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:38,719
plastic this is the site of CR noise

380
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:43,720
senses so what does this interaction

381
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:48,679
means and how does this uh interaction I

382
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:52,640
found affect the psy expression so we

383
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:56,679
generate the O over Express n we also

384
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:59,278
got the lockout and also generate the

385
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:01,759
double lockout as as you can see with

386
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:05,519
those AR robotop Sy night they show the

387
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:09,158
dramatic difference in O protein and

388
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:12,639
gene expression and then we looked at

389
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:16,840
Psy gene expression as you can see here

390
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:20,360
you alteration of the O expression does

391
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:25,240
not affect gene expression then we

392
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:28,798
looked at the protein level and as this

393
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:32,919
slides show you with the over EXP press

394
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:37,839
of the org cause increased accumulation

395
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:40,799
of Psy and in the single lockout the the

396
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:43,480
psy protein level is very similar we

397
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:47,918
think that they complement with each

398
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:51,480
other but in the dou lockout the psy

399
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:54,679
protein level was significantly reduced

400
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,360
and this is showed in leave case and

401
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:59,480
similar in Roots you see the similar

402
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:03,678
pattern of ofly

403
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:06,839
change so how does o affect Psy

404
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:11,240
abundance now we know with overe Express

405
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:15,558
Psy reduce PS overexpress o reduce

406
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:19,519
Express o and it's cost Psy change so

407
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:23,839
how how does or affect the psy abundance

408
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:28,839
so what we did is we introduced Psy gfp

409
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:32,158
tag protein into Y type or arob is and

410
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:35,240
also into all our background our

411
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:40,039
robotopsy plant and then we extract the

412
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:43,519
protein and uh inhibit with CHX the

413
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:47,960
protein senses inhibitor and looking for

414
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:51,158
the the psy gfp protein level and as you

415
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:55,240
can see in the O background the turn

416
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:57,799
over rate of the psy was significantly

417
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,919
dramatically reduced compared with

418
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:06,720
without the protection of

419
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:10,240
or so in addition in our collaborator RF

420
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,640
Welsh from Germany and he also looked to

421
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:17,278
say if they increase the

422
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:20,080
psy uh protein level is in active or not

423
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:22,359
quite often when you upregulate a

424
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:26,519
protein it can be just a protein level

425
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:31,359
up regulate but not lary means active

426
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:35,519
enzyme level so from his result clearly

427
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:39,240
showed that with overexpress o increased

428
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:44,079
the psy protein level cause increased

429
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:48,399
enzyme activity as you know that PSY the

430
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:50,918
key enzyme in the quoid Bios sensis and

431
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:54,599
then they correlate accumulation of

432
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:59,880
choid was observed in leaf tissues when

433
00:25:54,599 --> 00:26:04,000
we have overexpressed o and when it's Dr

434
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,480
significantly reduced when the or level

435
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,480
was

436
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:12,399
reduced so in summary of this part

437
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:17,558
essentially we showed that both o and O

438
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:21,239
like directly interact with Psy to to

439
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:24,798
enhance Psy protein level and activity

440
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:28,480
through regulate Psy protein stability

441
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:32,398
and because Psy is the key en um in the

442
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:36,038
Copo bensis pathway it caus increased

443
00:26:32,398 --> 00:26:39,199
cropo accumulation and actually this is

444
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:43,720
one of the first case demonstrate a

445
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:47,319
protein can act act as a post

446
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:49,759
transcriptional regulator of Psy to

447
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:52,678
regulate crop no

448
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:55,839
accumulation so let's come back to the

449
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:59,360
same question we tried to answer so how

450
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:03,278
does or mutant differentially regulate

451
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:05,759
cloid accumulation in both of this case

452
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:09,359
does the differential regulations

453
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:13,440
through differentially regulate uh

454
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:17,000
Psy or there are some other

455
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:23,000
mechanism so to answer this question and

456
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:27,079
uh we compared the o h and O interaction

457
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,240
with Psy EAS two high as you can see

458
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:30,038
both

459
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,880
or and

460
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:39,158
or white type protein interact with PSY

461
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:42,120
and both of them also caus increased Psy

462
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:45,799
protein level in car's culture and we

463
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:49,599
also looked again in collaborate with r

464
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:54,679
wor from Germany he looked at the

465
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:58,158
psy enzyme activity from o his line with

466
00:27:54,679 --> 00:28:01,840
O and we found there's no difference

467
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:04,960
so which indicat that the

468
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:09,959
differentially induced Coto accumulation

469
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:13,840
it's not duing to the O H has a high

470
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:16,200
capacity to increase the psy activity or

471
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:19,480
increase the biosynthetic

472
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:23,000
activities so previously in our study we

473
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:25,839
showed that with the O mutation in CIF

474
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,359
flow with the single gene mutation it's

475
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:34,278
caus the change from lumous Pro plastic

476
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:39,639
into one or two large Chrome plast in

477
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:44,000
the CT M Curt influence mer stem cell

478
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:48,159
and also in the shoots epidemic shoots

479
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:52,119
cells similarly our collaborators from

480
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:55,360
Israel and they also observed in mellow

481
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:58,000
case if you look under light microscope

482
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:01,199
and there's one or two large much Chrome

483
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,440
plast per cell like if you look at

484
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,038
tomato there each cell contain a huge

485
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:10,679
number of chrome PL so both of them

486
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:12,640
shows that the mutation or the later

487
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:16,840
variation can

488
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,000
induce large chrx formations so what

489
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:21,759
happen with

490
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,839
arabidopsis Ki that show the difference

491
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:28,519
big difference with Coro accumulation

492
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:32,079
and we look at this is long TR G and out

493
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:36,159
dois C and you can see there's a plastic

494
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:40,000
contain some dark circle that's plast

495
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:42,799
globin and with the overexpress or the

496
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,519
plastic become larger but they can they

497
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:50,158
retain the same shape but the pl Globe

498
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:54,159
will become darker and um with the high

499
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:57,360
electrod dense this is the same as Psy

500
00:29:54,159 --> 00:30:01,039
only express We Believe crot noise are

501
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:06,639
accumulate there but when you look at

502
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:10,079
the ORS mutation or or mutation and you

503
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:14,159
can see the plastic shape changed from

504
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:17,480
those and become the membrane structures

505
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:20,880
actually those member structur member

506
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:24,278
member Chrome plx show exactly the same

507
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:27,760
as what we observed in Orange curved

508
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:31,000
cauliflower so those experiment uh

509
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:34,558
confirm shows that the key for this

510
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:38,319
specific high level of Coro accumulation

511
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:42,519
is duing to the unique ability of the o

512
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:44,678
h in induced Chrome plast biogenesis

513
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:46,919
actually this experiment is fairly

514
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:50,600
significant in a lot of way we know

515
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:53,880
arobic are excellent model system to

516
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:59,319
understand genes the signaling in many

517
00:30:53,880 --> 00:31:02,880
many process however ad dois

518
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:05,879
doesn't contain doesn't contain a tissue

519
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:09,600
with chrome plast so essential we show

520
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:13,880
here now we generate our robotop 9 that

521
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:17,480
has a program to be able to form Chrome

522
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:20,240
plast therefore provide us a system to

523
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,639
better stud genes and signaling in

524
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,599
Chrome plast

525
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:31,038
biogenesis so here's from our research

526
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:35,038
uh we should show that the O mutant has

527
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:39,679
du functions in induced croto over

528
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:44,000
production why as post transcriptional

529
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:46,880
Regulators to regulate Psy enzyme

530
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,079
activity and a larger one

531
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:53,960
is actually the most important is have

532
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:56,759
unique ability to induce Chrome plast

533
00:31:53,960 --> 00:32:02,399
biogenesis and because Chrome plast

534
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:06,079
provide WR a storage sync that can sta

535
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:09,719
storage a crot noise at the same time

536
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:13,839
it's also stimulate continue bio senses

537
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:17,319
that's why the lines can those plants or

538
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:20,199
those lines can can have high level of

539
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:23,960
Cino accumulation currently we still

540
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:28,440
focus on or because till now or still is

541
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:32,798
the only genes that know to convert

542
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:37,840
conver Chrome plas biogenesis so but how

543
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:41,240
this o gen control Chrome plus Genesis

544
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:44,879
is still unknown so this is the topic

545
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:49,000
and we are focus on

546
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:52,760
now so in addition to those research we

547
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:57,079
also take the advantage of VAR is omic

548
00:32:52,759 --> 00:33:00,200
tools to discover genes and proteins re

549
00:32:57,079 --> 00:33:03,519
require for high level of Coro

550
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:06,880
accumulation so one full experiment we

551
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:11,638
did is protein omic analyze of chrome

552
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:13,840
plast proteins in fruits and vegetables

553
00:33:11,638 --> 00:33:17,319
as you can see here we

554
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:21,319
extract uh Chrome plaster from some of

555
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:24,240
CR no in Rich fruits and vegetables and

556
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:27,720
we are hoping to looking for the common

557
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:31,240
mechanism involved in those crop

558
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:34,519
enriched crops for Chrome plaster

559
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:39,359
biogenesis so we

560
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:44,159
we we separate the Chrome plast protein

561
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:47,479
from all from all from those those

562
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:51,120
vegetables and the fruits and one thing

563
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:55,278
interesting we found that if you look at

564
00:33:51,119 --> 00:34:00,319
the All Chrome plast the ATP senses and

565
00:33:55,278 --> 00:34:04,519
ATP ATP trans locators are most abundant

566
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:07,319
proteins in those in all those six

567
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:10,280
chrome chrome plast so the high

568
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:13,199
abundance of ATP senses and the nuclear

569
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:16,960
tide translocators suggest a important

570
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:19,398
role of them in control or energy

571
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,760
production and transport in control

572
00:34:19,398 --> 00:34:23,719
Chrome PL

573
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:27,079
biogenesis and the one project uh is

574
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:30,918
going on in the lab is we trying to

575
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:34,399
figure out if the ATP and ADP

576
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:35,960
translocators is indeed involved with

577
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:39,559
chrome plas

578
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:44,358
biogenesis in addition we also did quite

579
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:47,719
a lot of RNA SI ex experiment in

580
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:52,719
collaborate with many colleagues on

581
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:57,919
campus and one of experiment is the bulk

582
00:34:52,719 --> 00:35:01,879
segregate R A6 transcript and analyze

583
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:05,480
so in again in collaborate with Israel

584
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:09,920
scientists we use the same lines to that

585
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:16,199
they all our are gen mow fruits so what

586
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:21,559
they did is they grow the the homoy F3

587
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:27,039
family uh plants and they extract the

588
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:31,039
RNA from 25 orange or green fruits at a

589
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:34,639
is develop fruit developmental stage and

590
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:38,960
actually here are the RNA samples showed

591
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:43,118
there so we bed those RNA and did the

592
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:46,400
transcripton analyze and here's showed

593
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:50,240
the crot metabolical passway gene

594
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:53,960
expression pattern and you know we know

595
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:57,559
you have as we know that

596
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:00,559
mow the orange mow accumulate high level

597
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:04,159
of beta cartin we found nearly all the

598
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:07,199
Upstream genes are up regulated doing

599
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:11,039
fruit development similar as a fruit

600
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:14,559
mature and the down stream gen are uh

601
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:15,960
down regulate during fruit development

602
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:19,759
but very

603
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:24,639
interestingly in Orange fruits and the

604
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:28,200
croo accumulate but for the green fruit

605
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:31,559
there's no huge CR accumulation but the

606
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:34,559
gene expression pattern is similar which

607
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:38,039
indicate additional mechanism in this

608
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:41,279
case we believe the storage sync a

609
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:44,719
mechanism difference between the green

610
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,599
and orange fruit to distinguish the two

611
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:50,000
kind of fruit

612
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:56,000
varieties and in addition in collaborate

613
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:59,599
with Jung Jin F uh at BP he helped us to

614
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,920
analyze of those transcripton data and

615
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:05,960
in addition he also did the Sleep

616
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:09,599
analyze of the orange and green

617
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:15,760
box and with this box essentially we

618
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:21,400
only got very low only 64 slips that

619
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:25,359
with over 90% of R to distinguish orange

620
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:29,838
and green buls and within those snip

621
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:32,679
only two genes one is the O Gene and

622
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:35,480
there is another one it's totally

623
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:38,519
completely distinguished 100%

624
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:41,240
distinguish between the box so if we

625
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:44,159
don't know the org is responsible for

626
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:49,439
the orange color through the bulk

627
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:52,879
segregate r s Allin we will uh we would

628
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:57,920
identify the oring which also show the

629
00:37:52,880 --> 00:38:02,400
effectivess of the bulk strategy for G

630
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:05,480
discover and the a co-cr gate currently

631
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:09,200
a visitor scientist who made law in the

632
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:13,119
lab is study that Gene to see if it also

633
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:17,439
contribute to the cateo accumulation so

634
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:19,960
we we looked at the differential Express

635
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,599
Gene at different fruit

636
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:25,119
development stage and we found that

637
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:28,599
there's only one gen Shield differential

638
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:33,079
expressed in all fruit development stage

639
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:38,519
but we are mainly focused on the 20 da

640
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:41,880
to and we select a few candid genes B

641
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:44,960
candid genes for functional analyze as I

642
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:48,480
told you the AR robotop is color system

643
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:52,480
we used to start the O function and it's

644
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:55,719
showed very responsive and effective to

645
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:59,480
response the genes that's involved with

646
00:38:55,719 --> 00:39:02,719
scoto accumulation and we all know that

647
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:06,199
the AR robotop is with flowering deeping

648
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:10,318
method you can simultaneously transform

649
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:12,439
a lot of genes so this system also

650
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:15,880
really give us a relative High

651
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:19,200
throughput to test those genes and the

652
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:21,079
proteins identified from other omic

653
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:25,239
techn

654
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:29,200
omics and in addition as I told you that

655
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:32,598
in M case it's no o control the orange

656
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:36,439
was non orange fruit flash color but

657
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:39,838
within the o g plus collection there are

658
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:42,440
several magnet there is the SE there

659
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:45,960
there is the several magnitude variation

660
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:48,519
of beta carting levels so again in

661
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:52,838
collaborat with is really scientist we

662
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:57,239
are going to genotype those germ PL

663
00:39:52,838 --> 00:40:00,239
collection by GBS and then look the

664
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:03,759
association between the mow fruit beta

665
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:06,239
cartin content and the later genetic

666
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:10,119
variation not only to identify some

667
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:12,759
markers to be used for M mow breeding

668
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:16,000
but we are hoping to identify add

669
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,560
additional Al that control high level of

670
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,679
Coro

671
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:25,480
accumulation so in summary our data

672
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:29,279
shows that the O mutants can serve as

673
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:32,119
effective gen I two for CR no

674
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:35,560
enhancement in food crops both through

675
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:37,559
transitional breeding and hope through

676
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:40,400
both through genetic and the

677
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:43,880
transitional breeding approach and also

678
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:48,000
all mediate beta carting over production

679
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:51,720
through regulate both Psy with enhanced

680
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,159
bios sensis ability and also Chrome plas

681
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:57,159
with storage

682
00:40:54,159 --> 00:41:00,598
abilities and uh as I just as I

683
00:40:57,159 --> 00:41:01,759
mentioned we believe that if we can put

684
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:05,680
the

685
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:09,839
croto into Chrome plas instead of Amo

686
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:13,199
plus we can help to it can significantly

687
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:16,639
help to stabilize the beta car in stable

688
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:18,799
crops and a lot of things our data

689
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:22,480
showed that post transcriptional

690
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:26,720
regulate of Psy represent a lava

691
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:32,000
mechanism under crop no accumulation so

692
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:35,159
finally I like to say co- co- workers

693
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,280
here's the people currently in their lab

694
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:41,358
and especially I want to

695
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:45,079
thank posted in the lab for the work I

696
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:48,480
described and also some foral lab member

697
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:51,800
for their work I Des described here

698
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:56,358
especially Shang jino and also a

699
