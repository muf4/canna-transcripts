1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,719
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,280
University thank you um yes as as Emily

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,839
said my name is Erin I'm a a fourth year

4
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:19,320
PhD student in Mike gors and I'm excited

5
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:21,518
to talk with you all today about uh

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,518
integrating data collected from

7
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:26,320
different proximal remote or proximal

8
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,879
sensors uh for improved prediction of

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,000
important

10
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:34,479
traits so proximal uh sensors PR present

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,519
a mechanism of field-based high

12
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:40,398
throughput uh phenotyping that saves um

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,640
Time and Labor as compared with manually

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,120
measuring

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,679
phenotypes uh so proximal sensors are uh

16
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:51,519
those which do not come into direct

17
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:54,519
contact with the plant um but are more

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,359
close by or uh proximal than remote

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,960
sensors such as satellites um so you can

20
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:03,519
see here some commonly used uh plat

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:07,239
platforms for uh field-based um proximal

22
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:09,359
sensing include um unoccupied aerial

23
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:13,759
Vehicles such as

24
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:19,519
drones um Gantry systems tractors uh

25
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:22,319
push carts um ground Rovers um and even

26
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:25,438
smartphones the uh sensors which can be

27
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:28,798
deployed on these uh different platforms

28
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:31,078
um include uh typical red green blue

29
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,439
cameras uh multispectral and

30
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:36,478
hyperspectral cameras which include

31
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:41,158
additional bands Beyond those um and

32
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:44,759
then we also have liar uh thermal and um

33
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,759
then uh radar which can sense um below

34
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:51,879
ground

35
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:54,599
trades um so these uh sensors have a

36
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:57,319
broad application to both uh breeding

37
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:57,319
and precision

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:03,240
agriculture they can be used to uh

39
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,200
forecast end of season traits um

40
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:06,920
therefore allowing selections to be made

41
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,000
pre-flowering and decreasing the

42
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,479
breeding

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,239
cycle um features from these data

44
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,959
streams can be used in phenomic

45
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,878
prediction where those features replace

46
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:21,239
um traditional markers in genomic

47
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:24,239
prediction um they can also be used for

48
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,800
um building populations for genomic

49
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,120
prediction genome wide Association

50
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:34,120
studies and the um increased temporal

51
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,360
resolution um lends um to studying

52
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,439
genotype by environment

53
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,239
interactions they have also been used

54
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:44,199
for uh stress detection and efficient

55
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:46,840
allocation of resources in Precision

56
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:46,839
agriculture

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,800
applications so uh due to the um

58
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,439
broad-reaching

59
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:58,480
applications um for breeding programs um

60
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:01,079
significant investment in um studying

61
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,679
the use of of these different sensors

62
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,879
and platforms for a variety of of

63
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,159
different traits have been carried out

64
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:10,359
in recent years including um

65
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:13,399
productivity traits such as yield

66
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,360
biomass uh quality traits such as um

67
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,719
taste and many others across a wide

68
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,200
array of

69
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:23,840
crops what this has ultimately led to is

70
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:26,439
a a large number of crop and trait

71
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,840
specific

72
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:31,400
algorithms in addition these uh data

73
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:35,000
streams are both very high-dimensional

74
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:38,039
and complex um a single multispectral

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,680
image can have couple hundred thousand

76
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:45,639
pixel values for a single plot and so um

77
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:48,799
how to effectively extract meaningful

78
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:51,839
information from the the data becomes

79
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:56,239
the challenge and we have ultimately um

80
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,239
relied on Manual curation of

81
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:01,119
features um in addition you can see

82
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:03,919
there's a variety of different sensors

83
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,519
which capture um wavelengths across the

84
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,559
electromagnetic spectrum um and

85
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:10,959
platforms which allow uh capture of

86
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,799
information at canopy subcanopy and

87
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,040
below ground scales um and while there's

88
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:19,720
like the you know unique information

89
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:24,040
contained within each of these um data

90
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,440
streams um this data is is usually used

91
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,680
uh separately from each other and

92
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,680
integration is uncommon and and Lacks

93
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,680
generalizability

94
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:37,959
so as an example um on the left here we

95
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:40,439
have um a kind of pictographic

96
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:44,120
representation of a multispectral image

97
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:47,759
which can be thought of as a grid of

98
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,720
pixel values for each band um the bands

99
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,800
kind of stacked on top of each

100
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,880
other um the most common mechanism for

101
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,439
extracting information from these is by

102
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:02,360
calculating vegetation indices so might

103
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:04,519
be familiar with the um normalized

104
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,680
difference vegetation index is

105
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:09,519
calculated by taking the relative

106
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,959
difference between the near infrared and

107
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:15,198
the red bands of the

108
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:19,519
image um ultimately reducing down to a

109
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:23,000
single uh value per multispectral

110
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,120
image um an alternative to this is uh

111
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,519
latent

112
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,199
phenotyping so latent

113
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:33,478
phenotyping um is a mechanism of

114
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:36,680
extracting features or information from

115
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:38,918
proximal sensing data streams using

116
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,478
unsupervised machine learning algorithms

117
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:45,279
such as Auto encoders so while the um

118
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:48,758
while ndbi in this example takes in just

119
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:52,799
the n and the Red Band um were able to

120
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:54,560
pass the entire um image um into the

121
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,160
model to extract

122
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,439
information um in addition where ndvi

123
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,400
reduces down to a single value

124
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:05,680
um we can uh extract a larger number of

125
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,198
latent

126
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,840
features um we specifically do this

127
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:14,199
using Auto encoders um which can be

128
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:16,359
conceptualized similar to uh principal

129
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:20,038
component analysis of without the

130
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,639
linearity constraints so it takes the um

131
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:26,680
input image and passes it through an

132
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,720
encoder to reduce the dimensionality and

133
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,160
find an

134
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,840
embedding that reduced space is then

135
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,319
passed through an analogous uh Network

136
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:39,839
the decoder to reproduce the original

137
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,639
image and um the model is optimized such

138
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:45,918
that the difference between the original

139
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,918
and the Reconstruction is minimized so

140
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:51,079
in this way the latent features um

141
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:53,560
should contain the necessary and

142
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:56,519
sufficient information to reconstruct

143
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,439
the original image um and are hopefully

144
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:01,439
the most relevant then and important

145
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:03,719
features are noise and and other

146
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:08,120
unimportant

147
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:10,039
information so our goal is to um make

148
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,800
use of latent

149
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:17,240
phenotyping to perform integration

150
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,319
across different sensors preserving uh

151
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,639
additional information that is lost with

152
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,520
traditional um mechanisms of feature

153
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:26,960
extraction and providing a a

154
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:30,159
generalizable u method of analyzing

155
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:32,799
these data so I'll I'll go through our

156
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,360
um end end pipeline of data collection

157
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,759
processing and Analysis through

158
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,639
extracting and integrating Laden

159
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:45,240
features so we have specifically focused

160
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:49,038
on multispectral images collected by

161
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,120
unoccupied aerial vehicles or drones and

162
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:55,918
uh lar scans collected by unoccupied

163
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:58,918
ground vehicles or the uh Rover here so

164
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:01,639
the multispectral images collected uh

165
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:04,198
blue green green red red Edge and near

166
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:06,639
infrared bands capturing that canopy

167
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:10,759
level spectral information which is

168
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:14,038
commonly um extracted as vegetation

169
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,360
indices the lighter skins can be used to

170
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:18,478
generate three-dimensional

171
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,879
reconstructions of an entire plot giving

172
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:24,000
subcanopy architectural

173
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:26,439
information these data were collected

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,158
for Maze hybrids planted as part of the

175
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:31,199
genomes to Fields

176
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:34,319
initiative um for weekly collections

177
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,560
from 2020 through 2024 uh for each

178
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,120
growing season we pause Rover

179
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,518
collections a couple weeks post

180
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:44,879
flowering um until inessence as uh

181
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:49,200
structural changes slow during that

182
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:52,000
time um ultimately giving a data set of

183
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:57,399
about 75,000 plot level multispectral

184
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,399
images and about 35,000 plot level Point

185
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
clouds so

186
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:04,319
the multispectral images are collected

187
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,159
by this drone here you can see the

188
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,120
camera on the bottom the raw images have

189
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:12,278
about 80% overlap with each other which

190
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:16,919
allows them to be stitched together to

191
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:19,320
generate a field uh scale image or

192
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:22,120
orthomosaic the field scale image can

193
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:25,000
then be split down into our individual

194
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,000
plot level

195
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,879
images the uh lighter camera is on the

196
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:37,759
back of the row over here which drives

197
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:39,759
in between the um two uh rows of maze um

198
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:44,200
the uh lar

199
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:46,879
scans um collect the uh distance emitted

200
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,480
light has traveled to the nearest object

201
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,958
um can be thought of as being in polar

202
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,519
coordinates this is essentially

203
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:55,000
converted into cartisian coordinates to

204
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:57,399
generate a three-dimensional Point Cloud

205
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,320
where each point has an X Y and Z

206
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:01,320
coordinate associated with it

207
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:10,800
um do further um processing on this to

208
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:13,440
remove arous points um do vertical

209
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,078
flipping uh kind of stacking the rows on

210
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,440
top of each other and then compressing

211
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:19,719
that down to a single uh

212
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:24,000
two-dimensional image or density map

213
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,000
which can be input into an auto

214
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:29,879
encoder so we have trained Auto encoders

215
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:33,720
for both the multispectral image

216
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:37,320
and the uh 2D density Maps uh you can

217
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,839
see examples here of original images and

218
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,160
as well as their reconstruction for both

219
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:46,040
the msis and density

220
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:48,799
Maps the uh latent spaces uh can then be

221
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:51,759
extracted from each of these uh trained

222
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:51,759
models and

223
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:57,399
integrated so once these models had been

224
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:59,039
trained and Laten phenotypes had been

225
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,559
extracted we wanted to first see what

226
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:04,759
kind of information was contained within

227
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:07,599
them so this is uh these are latent uh

228
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:10,559
phenotypes for a single uh field in a

229
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,320
single year um we calculated the uh

230
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:16,599
heritability for each of them in lar and

231
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,519
msis um and what you can see here is the

232
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:23,440
heritabilities range from uh near zero

233
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:25,560
up to about 0.9 uh so we're capturing

234
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,800
both

235
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:32,719
um heritable genetic information as well

236
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:35,319
as um is likely environmental

237
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,519
information uh the latent phenotypes

238
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,278
once uh extracted and integrated are

239
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:45,480
then used for characterizing manually

240
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:45,480
measured uh phenotypes for the gtf

241
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:53,000
fields

242
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,759
so for uh each of the eight ground truth

243
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,078
phenotypes that were collected as part

244
00:11:54,759 --> 00:12:01,519
of the genomes to Fields project um

245
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:03,799
these were predicted by MSI Laten

246
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,519
phenotypes for all dates in the growing

247
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:08,719
season lar Laten phenotypes for all

248
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:11,039
dates in the growing season and then the

249
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,320
integration of the two and these were

250
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:16,799
compared against a baseline of 49

251
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,519
different vegetation

252
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:22,078
indices uh extracted or calculated for

253
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:26,198
all uh msis throughout the growing

254
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:30,638
season um what you can see here is that

255
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:33,838
um flowering time and Gra moisture have

256
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,240
higher um ndbi has higher predictive

257
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,279
ability for those

258
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:43,600
traits um for the uh remainder the

259
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:47,159
integrated uh L venot types have higher

260
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,600
predictability with um variation on when

261
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:53,159
MSI or lar Laten phenotypes are more

262
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:56,959
highly predictive um for example you can

263
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:59,838
see here um ear height and uh plant

264
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:03,599
height are have higher predictability um

265
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:06,519
from the lar Len space um as their

266
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:10,000
architectural traits if Mak sense um

267
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:14,320
overall we see a um

268
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,159
4.6 um% average increase in uh

269
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,199
prediction accuracy for the integrated l

270
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:20,919
in Space over vegetation indices across

271
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:24,958
all

272
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:28,240
trits um similarly the integrated latent

273
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:35,039
space outperforms MSI and lar latent

274
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:35,039
phenotypes by average of 5.1% and 20.8%

275
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:43,240
respectively so finally we wanted to um

276
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,600
look at how the uh prediction accuracies

277
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,120
changed with the addition of more

278
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,040
information throughout the growing

279
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,679
season so we iteratively added uh dates

280
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:55,759
of

281
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:59,120
information um for each of the eight uh

282
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:02,000
phenotypes here so as predicted with the

283
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,320
integrated Laten space uh we can see

284
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,799
some uh prediction accuracies don't

285
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,560
change for example um stand count which

286
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:14,439
isn't changing over the growing season

287
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:17,679
so um makes sense um some traits which

288
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,440
are are not very easily predicted um

289
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:23,198
early in the season uh and only see kind

290
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,320
of a large bump toward the end um but

291
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:28,039
notably there are some indices and

292
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:31,759
traits that have reasonable prediction

293
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:35,879
accuracies pre-flowering so um yield

294
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:38,879
here sees a 0.1 increase from the uh

295
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:41,120
pre-flowering uh predictions to the end

296
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:44,360
of um end of season incorporating all of

297
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:49,000
the dates um indicating the potential uh

298
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,000
foreing this data for um pre-flowering

299
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:55,278
forecasting so I would like to thank my

auto encoder

311
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,559
modeling thank you so much and I'll take

312
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,959
questions

313
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,198
yes

314
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:36,239
Charlie the traits you're look you're

315
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:38,039
looking at these correlations with are

316
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,720
the traits themselves are correlated

317
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:43,639
with each other right so like you know

318
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,199
flowering time and yield so is there any

319
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:49,799
way to like kind of disentangle which

320
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:52,120
which of those the models or which which

321
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:55,519
of those the latent spaces kind of

322
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,440
capturing and which are like second

323
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,278
order yeah that's that's a great

324
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,360
question so the question was um since so

325
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:06,078
many of these uh phenotypes are

326
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:09,560
correlated with each other um is there a

327
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:11,198
way to disentangle which um the latent

328
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:13,719
phenotypes are capturing and which are

329
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:15,958
just correlated with each other is that

330
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,759
the question so

331
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:21,439
um I think that that is a great question

332
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:23,039
and we haven't done a lot of um

333
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,800
investigation

334
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:28,399
into

335
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:31,799
um which which latent phenotypes are

336
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:34,839
more highly correlated with which traits

337
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:36,639
um and what they're capturing um

338
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:40,199
ultimately the latent phenotypes are

339
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:43,159
still kind of a a black box for us um

340
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:47,198
and maybe relying on these um

341
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:51,198
relationships between um between traits

342
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:54,719
um it's kind of a yeah secondary kind of

343
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:56,639
selection um but uh that is a that is a

344
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,199
very good question I'll definitely look

345
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:02,159
into that more

346
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:04,240
yeah when we fly drones we like you know

347
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,119
have to do it near solar noon and like

348
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,038
you have to consistent cloud cover for

349
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:11,558
the lighter Rover are there similar

350
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:13,240
constraints and do those impact how well

351
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:14,199
certain data points can be integrated

352
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,279
into your

353
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:19,679
model so the question is um for uh

354
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:21,279
flying drones and collecting

355
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,880
multispectral images there are

356
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,599
constraints on time of day and cloud

357
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,640
cover and other conditions are there

358
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,558
similar constraints for the Rover data

359
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,280
um

360
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:36,279
so in so far as the data collection

361
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:38,720
quality there aren't really constraints

362
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:42,000
um the constraint would be

363
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:45,600
around when we can feasibly drive the

364
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,798
Rover so if it's rainy um of course we

365
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,159
can't or if it has rained heavily in the

366
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:53,200
past day or two and it's too muddy the

367
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,640
tires will you know just kind of spin um

368
00:17:53,200 --> 00:18:00,759
so more constraints on the platform

369
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:02,600
itself than the the sensor yeah and yeah

370
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:05,038
very nice what I was wondering about

371
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:07,319
have you tried training between the two

372
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:09,679
reps it'll mess up your heritability

373
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:11,678
estimate but if we want to say we wanted

374
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,200
to capture really about genetics and

375
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,480
kind of ignore some of the environmental

376
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,360
ones have You' been able to does does

377
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,599
that work or have you tried that yet

378
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:22,199
yeah so that's a great question so the

379
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:24,558
question is training um between reps so

380
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,360
using one rep as the input image and the

381
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:28,319
the second rep as the output is that

382
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:31,759
that correct so we haven't tried that so

383
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:36,119
we've been when focusing on kind of plot

384
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:38,038
level predictions themselves um and have

385
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:40,639
looked less into kind of parsing out

386
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:42,798
those uh genetic and environmental

387
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,038
factors uh within the the latent

388
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:47,679
features um but that would definitely be

389
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,279
something that we should look at for for

390
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,880
the next itation it would also be

391
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,240
interesting to see if you could predict

392
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,440
liar use the liar to predict the other

393
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,120
one the MRI and as essentially make the

394
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,558
embedding space in between those two or

395
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:02,599
something like yeah oh yeah yeah that's

396
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:02,599
a good point thank

397
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,480
you I didn't quite file for latent

398
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:10,639
phenotypes um like in like a is there

399
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,919
like a an intuitive way you describe

400
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,120
those in terms of like okay they're kind

401
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,080
of analogous to this in a PCA or like

402
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,558
this and like weights in a layer or so

403
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,319
they're like dimensionless metrics on a

404
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:25,000
plot level versus like a or an image

405
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:27,279
level yes so yeah so um the you can

406
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,079
think of them as like the principal

407
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:33,480
components of some some higher order

408
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:37,798
object um that's probably the the

409
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:40,200
closest um analogous uh yeah kind of

410
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:43,519
conceptual way of thinking about

411
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,720
it um I'll do the last question um so I

412
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,759
know that of course L you work with work

413
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,279
with maze but I was wondering with the

414
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,558
Rover are there any kind of like

415
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:53,119
architectural limitations about what

416
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:56,079
crops that you can drag

417
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:58,279
them uh yes that's a great question on

418
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:01,720
the um limitations of the Rover

419
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:07,798
depending on the the um architecture of

420
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:11,120
the crop um so the uh resolution of the

421
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:15,038
lar scans um is on the order of

422
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:16,918
centimeters um so anything that is too

423
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:19,480
small um would not be able to be

424
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:21,679
resolved by um at least the quality of

425
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,000
the the lighter camera that we are using

426
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,480
um there are likely higher resolution

427
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,359
ones that could be used

428
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:34,079
um also anything where

429
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:37,439
um you have what you're trying to

430
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:39,319
measure may be blocked by kind of lower

431
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,240
foliage or something that might because

432
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:44,839
the you know the liar is going to bounce

433
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,519
off of whatever it hits first so um if

434
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:48,678
you have something where you have lots

435
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:51,038
of leaves or something and you want to

436
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:53,519
maybe get Imaging of fruit that's up

437
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:55,519
higher um the Rover might not be the

438
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:59,319
best

439
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:01,879
application yeah

440
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,879
thank you so

441
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:06,480
much thank you very much um good

442
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,960
afternoon everybody my name is SE and

443
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:12,640
I'm a third year PhD student at the

444
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,400
small grains lab with Professor sell and

445
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,480
today I'm going to talk about organic

446
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,640
naked barley and creating Innovations

447
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,038
for resilience in the state of New York

448
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,880
um first of all about naked barley

449
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:27,879
itself

450
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,840
um as one could imagine it's uh a part

451
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,320
of naked in there means just that loss

452
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:34,759
of The Barley Hull itself during the

453
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:37,519
Harvest process which is something that

454
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:39,640
occurs naturally thanks to the loss of

455
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:44,558
function mutation in the new Gene 8,000

456
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:46,559
years ago uh and this Gene uh apparently

457
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:48,480
coats the lipid layer that would glue

458
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:52,200
together the hull and the

459
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,480
kopsis um and it's visible here as we

460
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,720
see in

461
00:21:53,480 --> 00:22:00,558
the um quick laser out here um on the

462
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:03,000
left we see the covered barley and on

463
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:06,000
the right we see the naked barley or the

464
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,519
Hess barley and there are two big

465
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,480
benefits about that so one of them is

466
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:14,000
that um when we have covered parley we

467
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,200
are relatively limited with the use of

468
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,919
that as if we would like to use car

469
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,319
barley in the food products we would

470
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:24,200
need to uh go through the lots of

471
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:26,879
processing steps to remove the H as it's

472
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,440
uh in digestible and with that we could

473
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,278
also lose important the nutrition Parts

474
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,440
like the Bran or The Germ of the seed

475
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:36,159
but with the naked barley uh this is all

476
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,360
going to stay in the grain after our

477
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:42,080
Harvest and we're not going to lose any

478
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:44,678
of those micronutrients and this allows

479
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:47,839
um those multi-purpose uses for the nak

480
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:49,640
barley and making it more digestible and

481
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:51,480
all of this together kind of indicates L

482
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:55,120
of potential for organic and small

483
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,679
farmers as in health healthy and and an

484
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:59,439
easy process

485
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:03,840
alternative uh in their cropping system

486
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,360
and um this is where we come in with the

487
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,158
multi-use naked barley project for

488
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:11,399
organic systems that's a collaboration

489
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:14,480
between five universities uh Oregon

490
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,120
State UC Davis University of Minnesota

491
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,120
University of Wisconsin Madison and us

492
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:20,719
here at Cornell and we have a quite a

493
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:24,639
wide variet of goals we're trying to

494
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:27,319
achieve with that project um most of all

495
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,200
about educating the public about the

496
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:31,839
naked Pary itself and the health

497
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,480
benefits of that uh combined with

498
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:35,278
working together with stakeholders to

499
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,120
build those markets for this naked

500
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:40,839
parley products out there um while at

501
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:44,038
those different universities we test the

502
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:47,399
existing CH plasm and also generate new

503
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:48,599
genetic diversity um in the face of or

504
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,919
like as an example with our breeding

505
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:52,519
lines that we're trying to get out there

506
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:55,320
that would be locally adapted to all of

507
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:58,599
those environments that we would like to

508
00:23:55,319 --> 00:24:01,278
see the naked barley be grow so for this

509
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:04,558
we have different kind of populations in

510
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:06,839
our hands to be used as uh we conduct

511
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:09,519
Regional trials across all of those

512
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:13,240
locations uh we have diversity panel to

513
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:15,158
look into the genetics um in a much more

514
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,359
fine level and we also do have the

515
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:19,200
breeding populations that we are

516
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:21,678
throwing across all of those locations

517
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,440
to be able to select for local

518
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,519
adaptation and talking about local

519
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,600
adaptation the most important trait

520
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:30,319
we're trying to implement here in our

521
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:31,639
breeding process in upsite New York is

522
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,839
PR sprouting

523
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,600
resistance which I'm going to tell more

524
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:39,359
in the next slide a little bit so Bri

525
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:41,959
sprouting is something that can be quite

526
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:45,639
devastating for barley Farmers as an

527
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:48,319
example um as a definition re sparting

528
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,520
is something that's um defined as a

529
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,398
germination unwanted germination of The

530
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:56,038
Barley grains in the spike right before

531
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:58,479
the Harvest and as a result causing

532
00:24:56,038 --> 00:25:00,798
damages to the grain quality and the

533
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,079
starch and the enzyme profile which

534
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:07,359
could end up with a complete yield loss

535
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:09,759
and losses of pro profit for the farmers

536
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:12,599
and from the perspective of a breeder it

537
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:15,440
is relatively expensive and complicated

538
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:17,480
trate the screen as we see here this is

539
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,720
the scale we do screen this tra in our

540
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,360
breeding program but for this to happen

541
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,919
we need to sample the spikes dry them

542
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:26,719
out and then miss them three days in an

543
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:29,679
artificial missing array in our

544
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,079
Greenhouse to be able to score um the

545
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,798
level of germinated grains in a spike

546
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:36,720
from 0 to

547
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:38,879
nine but luckily for us we already know

548
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,919
that a lot about the genetics of PR

549
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:45,240
sprouting uh from the work previously

550
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,360
done in s's lab by several grad students

551
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,798
and I'm just going to bring some of

552
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:51,918
those examples out here first of all we

553
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:55,079
had a forra student Dan Sweeny uh being

554
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:58,679
able to map the genetic control of be

555
00:25:55,079 --> 00:26:00,960
sprouting in covered background uh going

556
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:02,440
from the qil to the Gene and also up out

557
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,038
to Al

558
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:08,960
levels as we see here as an example that

559
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:11,640
bar lines having two dormant GS in this

560
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,919
qtl have an average we have sprouting

561
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,159
score of

562
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:16,720
three but the parly lines having two

563
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:19,880
non-dormant lines have an average

564
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,720
sparing score of

565
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:26,640
seven and some work from another student

566
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,919
Travis Rooney who was able to um prove

567
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,080
the large effect qtl

568
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:35,559
having an heterogenic heterogenic effect

569
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:38,720
in the whole background and also how

570
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:41,079
using those large effect qtl Al as fixed

571
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,880
effects in the prediction models improve

572
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:45,678
the accuracy so this has motivated us to

573
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,799
tap into the genetic diversity of the

574
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:52,480
same genes and alals in the nakure plasm

575
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:55,798
and here is where I could come with with

576
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,399
come in with my proposed ideas for a

577
00:26:55,798 --> 00:27:00,879
experiment with the naked parleying

578
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:04,599
population throwing those same lines out

579
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:08,600
on the field in two locations having

580
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:10,480
them genotyped with a USDA snip chip and

581
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:12,879
you typing all of those lines in a

582
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,919
greenhouse to measure their reever

583
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,600
sprouting

584
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:19,440
resistance and that would allow us to

585
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:24,879
tap into the genetic diversity we have

586
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:27,080
in the naked barley uh ger plasm uh that

587
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,120
would also enable us to verify what we

588
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:34,720
already know in the C CH plasm like the

589
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:37,639
genes alic effects and how how often do

590
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,640
we find those alyss in these Gene pools

591
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,759
um and also just to like test out the

592
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:46,679
predictive abilities with the naked germ

593
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:52,119
plasm um and as an outcome of that

594
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:54,000
um we do gain um a nice insight to

595
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:56,398
verication in the naked barley

596
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,679
background and also broading the overall

597
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:00,759
understanding of what's Happening in

598
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,880
there and allowing the Breeders to use

599
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:05,200
them in the future for their Selections

600
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,679
in this as an example for all those

601
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,600
different breeders in the same program

602
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:14,240
and uh being able able to advance the

603
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:16,480
materials in our program much faster um

604
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,960
with a good predictive ability from the

605
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,720
model and also being able to combine

606
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,278
those uh local adaptation traits

607
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,720
together with those beneficial traits

608
00:28:24,278 --> 00:28:28,960
already in the naked body to provide

609
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,360
good varieties for local producers here

610
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,319
in Upstate New York to grow them out and

611
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:36,359
here I would just like to thank all of

612
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:40,759
our collaborators working with this

613
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:43,199
project and um yeah any questions be

614
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:45,879
happy to take him thank you so I was

615
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,278
wondering for your populations with the

616
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,399
additional germ plasm and snit chip are

617
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:53,759
you hoping to find maybe more genes

618
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:56,278
associated with the resistance toing or

619
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:59,879
more so like news that might completely

620
00:28:56,278 --> 00:29:02,480
uh deter um new genes it's not that

621
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,480
likely so the question was if I'm hoping

622
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,319
to find new genes or new oals in this

623
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,880
naked Bley Jean Pool that might not be

624
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:12,439
present in the covered barley gin pool

625
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,278
and my answer to that would be uh I

626
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,840
think it's relatively unlikely to find

627
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:18,919
new genes but the diversity of alals

628
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:22,678
already present in those covered barley

629
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:25,278
Qs is it's it's pretty wide I think for

630
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:27,640
both of those qals together we already

631
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:28,640
have six different alil segregating in

632
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,240
those

633
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,038
so some Al and alic variation is highly

634
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,440
likely to be there that I'm looking to

635
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:41,158
see yes question is pre- Harvest

636
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,880
sprouting uh correlated or related to uh

637
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:45,399
any other trait you might be interested

638
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,720
in cooking time mot toxin you know post

639
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:49,719
Harvest

640
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:54,079
accumulation uh macronutrient profile or

641
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:56,679
anything um it is um so the question was

642
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:58,720
if we have sprouting susceptibility or

643
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:01,159
resistance is related to other quality

644
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,679
traits and as far as I know we haven't

645
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:04,360
tested them here at the Cornell but we

646
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:07,798
do also have collaborators in Oregon

647
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:11,000
State who have a baking quality lab and

648
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:13,278
they have found some um signs of

649
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,839
deteriorated baking quality as an

650
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:19,200
example of like early on bri sprouting

651
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:21,678
that has deteriorated the quality of the

652
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,600
bread or the dough they make out of it

653
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,759
so yes I I think it's a pretty clear

654
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:28,719
relationship with that any other

655
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:30,119
correlations or like what I've seen a

656
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,880
field what I've seen on the field is

657
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:34,798
relatively hard to see like in terms of

658
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,559
like you know what you see in the canopy

659
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:40,879
or the spikes

660
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:43,440
themselves Recaps uh is naked barley

661
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:47,159
more susceptible to to insect

662
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,720
damage um not that I know of and we have

663
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:53,159
not seen that so naked bar is more

664
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:55,038
susceptible only to the smart disease

665
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:57,039
because the hull is I guess like more

666
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:59,000
loose and I guess some of those

667
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:02,558
particles of this Fung can access the

668
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,480
Grain in those early stages much better

669
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:07,678
but with other diseases we haven't seen

670
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,440
any uh difference with covered barley or

671
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,919
also yeah with

672
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,639
insects I guess is there a categorical

673
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:16,360
difference in terms of nutrient profiles

674
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:18,199
like how holess Sals are three four

675
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:19,599
percentage points higher in protein or

676
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,679
anything like categorically different

677
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:24,119
between naked and hon barley yeah so the

678
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:26,480
question was about categorical

679
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:28,638
differences in the profiles of naked

680
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,399
barley and card barley and one of those

681
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:34,000
big differences is the better glucan

682
00:31:31,398 --> 00:31:37,839
which is actually something that is um

683
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,398
FDA has suggested for people to consume

684
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,879
more as it improves the digestion of

685
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,719
people so so this is one of those big

686
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,039
differences but at the same time it's

687
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,120
it's good to keep in mind why it's low

688
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:51,200
in a covered parley because better

689
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:53,959
glucan can inhibit some of those malting

690
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,200
processes and in the making of Milds so

691
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:59,360
it's even though we want to develop

692
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,880
those multiuse purpose varieties it is

693
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:04,599
this is kind of a hard path to choose

694
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,799
from like I think with this we you need

695
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:08,759
to develop separate varieties one for

696
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:11,398
multing and one for like you know really

697
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:14,519
high better clue gain that would we

698
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:16,439
could advertise them like this yeah yeah

699
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:18,839
my name is Aaliyah I'm a second year PhD

700
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:21,320
student um all of my research has to do

701
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:24,439
with dowy moldy resistance in grap

702
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:26,558
Vine um yeah so with over 45 different

703
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,558
Hypes that can confer Dy mly resistance

704
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:30,918
and grape Bine there is a lot of stuff

705
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:33,960
to phenotype how do I phenotype it all

706
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:36,559
with is there a laser on here yes with

707
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,278
the black bird robot so basically this

708
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:40,440
how the scheme works is we go out we

709
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:42,960
collect leave from germplasm um either

710
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,038
from the field or from the greenhouse we

711
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,519
use a cook borer hold punch them out to

712
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:49,038
create these arrays of leaf diss that's

713
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:51,000
also pictured here um these Leaf dis

714
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:53,319
arrays will get inoculated and then put

715
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,638
into the Blackbird and imaged over a

716
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:57,678
number of days to capture the disease

717
00:32:55,638 --> 00:32:59,240
progression um these images are uploaded

718
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,320
to to a convolutional neural network

719
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,200
that will pick apart the images and give

720
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:05,000
us a nice quantitative data set about

721
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,200
the disease severity on the leaf

722
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,519
diss I can't talk about the Blackbird

723
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,038
without showing you the beautiful images

724
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:12,960
that come off of it so this is a grap

725
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:14,879
Bine Donny mildo which by default has to

726
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,440
be my favorite

727
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,919
pathogen um so my whole first chapter is

728
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,200
a metadata study on the Blackbird robots

729
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,960
we really wanted to investigate the

730
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,038
trade-off between this High uh data

731
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,319
acquisition with the data quality to

732
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:29,038
make sure that we're conserving our data

733
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:30,720
quality and we wanted to know if the

734
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:32,879
system was really robust to the types of

735
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,600
human error or data variation that could

736
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:39,120
happen in the scheme so basically what I

737
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:40,678
had done was I have three um real data

738
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:42,558
sets that have come off of the Blackbird

739
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:45,399
that have resulted in disease resistance

740
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:48,759
qtl Publications I've simulated a bunch

741
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:51,119
of variation onto those data sets and um

742
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:53,278
I basically observed how the

743
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:55,119
significance of the LOD score changed

744
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:57,759
with those added errors and

745
00:33:55,119 --> 00:34:00,479
variation um and I did things like uh

746
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:02,158
Leaf disk swaps Leaf disk frame shifts

747
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,919
to kind of capture the types of human

748
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,399
errors that could happen in the arraying

749
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:09,159
process different variation and disease

750
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:10,480
severity to capture um the types of

751
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:12,398
micro environments that are happening in

752
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,639
the trays that might impact pathogen

753
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:15,519
growth and also replicate subsetting

754
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,240
because usually when we do these

755
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:19,639
experiments we have up to eight to 10

756
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:23,398
replicates per

757
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:25,240
experiment so what did I find this is an

758
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:27,398
example of an intermediate effect size

759
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:28,799
qtl and all of these colored boxes

760
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,118
represent present the different flavors

761
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,800
of variation that I introduced in the

762
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:35,519
previous slide blue has to do with

763
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,240
variation in pathogen growth the pink is

764
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:38,679
the leaf dis swaps the Orange is the

765
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:41,918
leaf dis frame shifts and then the

766
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:43,119
yellow is the um replicate sub setting

767
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,480
so basically you look at this and you

768
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,800
say wow the Blackbird is very robust to

769
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,800
the types of human errors that can

770
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,480
happen but it seems to fall apart when

771
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:54,079
we pick apart the replicate

772
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,519
number that's great um more of the story

773
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,800
we were able to figure out that we are

774
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:59,159
not compromising any data quality by our

775
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,119
large volumes of data

776
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:02,719
acquisition um this is supposed to be a

777
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,358
lightning talk so I understand that this

778
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:07,118
is a great overview of my chapter but

779
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:09,519
happy to report it's been accepted to a

780
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,519
focus issue of phytopathology literally

781
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:15,039
this morning updated the um like First

782
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:16,559
Look copy so I'll make sure it gets in

783
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:17,480
the newsletter very excited and happy

784
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:19,960
about

785
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,079
this um so yeah what's the catch we've

786
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,800
all been slided by technology okay

787
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,400
there's veteran academics probably on

788
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,280
the zoom rolling their eyes at me like

789
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,440
I'm praising this robot and for what

790
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,640
there's got to be something um and I'd

791
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,480
like to introduce the bane of my

792
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:35,960
dissertation Leaf

793
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,119
hairs um so the Blackbird is based off

794
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,358
of RGB Imaging so all of the visual

795
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:42,358
wavelengths that we can see so if there

796
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:44,039
is morphology that is obscuring the

797
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:45,639
phenotype that you're trying to measure

798
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:48,000
in our case Leaf hair is covering up the

799
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:50,039
spanga of the Denny mildo the robot

800
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,960
can't see

801
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:56,759
it so how I plan to circumvent our Leaf

802
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:59,199
hair issue is with a hyperspectral

803
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,760
blackbird uh this robot is called the

804
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:03,399
hyperb bird um it's a lot less pretty

805
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,160
and a lot less user friendly than the

806
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,440
Blackbird because it's a prototype um

807
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:10,480
but I'm hoping to use hyperspectral

808
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:13,318
Imaging to kind of peer through the leaf

809
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,400
airs LOL I wish it was that easy we saw

810
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:17,039
from aon's talk that hyperspectral

811
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,079
Imaging is really complicated so what

812
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,679
does this actually mean uh well I'm

813
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:24,519
hoping that the bioch the biochemistry

814
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:26,519
makeup biochemical makeup oh my god of

815
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:28,559
the host versus the pathogen is like

816
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:30,559
distinct enough to where they have

817
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:32,599
different hyperspectral signatures that

818
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:33,920
will allow me to differentiate them on a

819
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:37,079
microscopic

820
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,000
scale and it's a non-destructive method

821
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:40,599
which is really helpful to me um

822
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,760
especially when you're um phenotyping

823
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:46,838
things like disease resistance

824
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,599
um yeah my hopes and dreams for the

825
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:51,119
hyperb bird uh number one we have to

826
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,359
ensure that the hyperb bird works again

827
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,119
this robot is a prototype um so we've

828
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:57,318
never actually published anything with

829
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,960
it and I hope to do that with the actual

830
00:36:57,318 --> 00:37:02,279
Le hair themselves so hopefully they'll

831
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,480
have a use um and we have a

832
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,200
convolutional neural network on the

833
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,440
Blackbird that can also measure Leaf

834
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:09,559
hair so I'll probably um compare it to

835
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,240
that probably Leaf hair will be

836
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:12,799
conserved across Vitus considering a lot

837
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:15,239
of different Vitus species have the same

838
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,920
Leaf hair morphology and then after we

839
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:19,479
prove that the hyper bird can work in

840
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,720
this uh like phenotyping scheme then I

841
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,358
can do the thing that I actually want to

842
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:24,719
do which is discover new disease

843
00:37:22,358 --> 00:37:27,519
resistance qtl on hairy

844
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:28,919
Vines um and then maybe I'll even take a

845
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:30,838
a step further for this last bullet

846
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,880
point

847
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:34,119
um make some inferences in the

848
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,720
relationship between Leaf her and

849
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:38,000
resistance this is supposed to be a

850
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:39,838
lightning talk um these three question

851
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,719
marks symbolize the 10-minute rant I

852
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:44,119
could go on about like this concept of

853
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:45,639
like Leaf hair and resistance and does

854
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:46,760
it confer resistance and does it not and

855
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:48,400
is a barrier and blah blah blah blah

856
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,200
blah anyway I'll save you the rambling

857
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,039
the important things are there is

858
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:53,318
conflicting literature and I'm very

859
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:55,440
skeptical of some of the phenotyping

860
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:56,880
methods that these papers have and we

861
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,400
might be able to solve some labrusca

862
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,640
Mysteries as well well all of these

863
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,240
hairy Leaf discs that I've shown you

864
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:04,239
they're labrusca um conquered grapes are

865
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:05,639
a labrusca variety and basically these

866
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:07,279
grapes have been resistant to Donnie

867
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:09,000
mildo for over 200 years and no one

868
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,359
knows why is it because of the leaf

869
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,239
hairs is it because of an unknown qtl we

870
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:15,119
don't know maybe I'll find

871
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:16,279
out and with that I would like to

872
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,079
acknowledge my whole committee and their

873
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,480
Labs especially Katie Gold and her lab

874
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,560
and all the engineers that contribute to

875
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,159
all these

876
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:25,960
robotics um I'm housed at the agch C

877
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:27,159
campus in Geneva um Sira subota he's

878
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,280
been really integrated into all of my

879
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:32,358
dis projects antis gen 3 not only for

880
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,079
funding me but for also just being an

881
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:35,519
amazing research group that is very

882
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,000
collaborative and supportive of each

883
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:42,079
other and with that I will take any

884
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,000
questions you might have yes so uh you

885
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,599
talked about one of your greatest

886
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,280
frustrations that you've been

887
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:50,160
experiencing with the leaf hairs I was

888
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,599
just wondering if there's like a great

889
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:56,078
Joy or something exciting that had in

890
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:57,720
the research okay I've complained a lot

891
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,880
and now Sam wants to know something that

892
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:03,759
makes me excited um I don't okay Leaf

893
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,880
hairs aren't all bad okay they um you

894
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,560
can kind of see in my one picture here

895
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,880
they they have great

896
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:14,279
diversity um they make the grapes really

897
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:17,599
fluffy and cute

898
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,400
um I don't know I I I really like all of

899
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,440
the research that I do and I me and

900
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,240
Lance had a conversation a while ago and

901
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,679
he was like oh like what's your favorite

902
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:26,879
chapter like what's your favorite

903
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:28,399
project and I feel like I have all of my

904
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,880
projects are very diverse and different

905
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,039
and I feel like I like them all for

906
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,800
different things uh most notably most

907
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:37,239
notably my metadata study uh is my

908
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:39,760
favorite right now because it's done

909
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:42,439
so hopefully that answers your question

910
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:46,880
I I find joy in diverse

911
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:49,720
things yes Ed it's kind of uh you know

912
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,358
when you have leaves that aren't hairy

913
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:55,759
uh is the infection can you see it from

914
00:39:52,358 --> 00:39:59,318
either side of the leaf fairly equally

915
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,040
well or not so that yeah so Ed is asking

916
00:39:59,318 --> 00:40:02,800
about the phenotypic expression of the

917
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:04,800
disease on the leaf dis and if we can

918
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,920
see it on both sides so that depends on

919
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,200
the pathogen so my pathogen Downey

920
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:12,000
mildew only uh sporulates from the

921
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:13,679
bottom of the leaf so on the top of the

922
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,159
leaf in the field you'll see some like

923
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:18,159
oil spotting or lesions but they're they

924
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:19,519
won't spoil from the top so on the

925
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:21,799
Blackbird we always phenotype from the

926
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:24,880
bottom and we always count severity as

927
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:27,440
the little fluffy spria that pop out in

928
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:31,119
terms of powdery mildew powdery mildew

929
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,800
only like spoiles on the top of the leaf

930
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,519
so when we do those in the black bird

931
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,039
scheme we put them right side up to

932
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:38,159
observe disease from the top so again

933
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:40,559
dependent on the disease that you're

934
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:42,000
looking at because I was wondering if

935
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:45,480
there's some way you could play with

936
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,318
light it's transmission and flipping the

937
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:51,679
leaf training a model so you train on

938
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:53,318
one side and the reverse side and then

939
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:55,358
with transmission if you could somehow

940
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:58,000
pick it up because you know I agree the

941
00:40:55,358 --> 00:41:01,519
refraction off those leaves May

942
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,719
off the tri may be tricky right Ed is

943
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:05,318
offering that I instead of looking

944
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:07,199
through the leaf hairs if I flip the

945
00:41:05,318 --> 00:41:09,800
disc over and observe some type of

946
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:11,039
phenotype from the top I mean we could

947
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,400
we haven't

948
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,800
tried um especially for the black bird

949
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:18,720
scheme they're sitting on agar so if you

950
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:21,039
were to put dyu upside down I don't even

951
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:22,399
know if that would like kill the OM

952
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:23,920
because you're you're cutting it off

953
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,400
from the outside you're not letting it

954
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,559
breathe in the field sure in the field

955
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,599
sure I could see like you see symptoms

956
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:32,000
on both sides of the leaves but um I'm

957
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:33,079
not sure on the Blackbird system whether

958
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,199
that would be

959
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:39,160
feasible yes you see the January paper

960
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:41,598
on on it was out Julius where they

961
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:43,118
did a reset for like RGB Imaging of leaf

962
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,519
hairs and if so what are your what are

963
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,720
your thoughts is that one the one out of

964
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:50,159
jki yeah yeah

965
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:53,118
I've I have I have

966
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:57,239
different um I have read that one I do

967
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:59,599
like that one um I'm sure that's great

968
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:02,759
we have a

969
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:06,200
different we have a different um CNN

970
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:08,000
that was made by someone else that um

971
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:09,719
like I have and know works so I'm going

972
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,800
to train against that but I'm sure that

973
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:15,159
one's great and fine I love Oliver trap

974
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:17,760
and the people that work at jki so again

975
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:17,759
sure that's

976
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:24,279
great this has been a production of

977
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:27,280
Cornell University on the web at

978
