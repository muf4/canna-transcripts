1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:06,819
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:08,320
University so I'm not alone 3 I'm a grad

3
00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:10,449
student at the University of New

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,820
Hampshire right now and I'm gonna

5
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:15,448
present some material that I did for my

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:19,050
masters at the University of Maryland

7
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:22,509
some stuff we're working on at UNH and

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,810
some of it has been funded by there and

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:28,060
I also wanted to do a little shameless

10
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:30,009
self-promotion while I have a captive

11
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:32,859
audience so if you want more information

12
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:35,739
on the stuff I'm talking about today you

13
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:38,439
can go to no-till vegies org and then I

14
00:00:35,738 --> 00:00:40,780
also just released the first four

15
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:43,089
episodes of a podcast that was the

16
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:47,410
result of a ser partnership grant that I

17
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:50,109
thought and I would love it if you would

18
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:51,608
check it out tell everybody about it my

19
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:51,969
final report is due at the end of the

20
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:54,879
month

21
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:57,760
so check it out the first four episodes

22
00:00:54,878 --> 00:01:01,179
are all about organic matter so it's

23
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:03,339
very appropriate ok but today I'm going

24
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:04,659
to talk about organic rotational no-till

25
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,829
for vegetables which is a little

26
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:11,349
different than the title that I

27
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:13,179
initially submitted so it's appropriate

28
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:15,219
that this is the North East cover crop

29
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,970
Council the first project I'm going to

30
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:20,739
talk about took place in Maryland

31
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:23,019
looking at forage radish and then going

32
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:29,079
into spring vegetables I worked with ray

33
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:31,060
while then the current project is in New

34
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:32,500
Hampshire and Maine mostly the day and

35
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,409
I'm going to percent is from Maine

36
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:38,109
actually from my family's farm we turned

37
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:43,000
it into a little experiment light and

38
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:45,519
that is with rich Smith at UNH so the

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,439
the big question how can we create the

40
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,450
optimal conditions for crop growth which

41
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,250
include soil moisture nutrient

42
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:54,549
availability weeds and temperature

43
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:56,590
everybody knows that while at the same

44
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:59,019
time conserving and improving soil

45
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,329
reducing erosion increasing soil organic

46
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:02,709
matter it's especially hard in vegetable

47
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,870
systems if there's one thing that's

48
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:07,030
coming across and all the vegetable

49
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,159
stalks it's that this is really hard

50
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,080
vegetable systems are really complex

51
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:13,629
everybody does it a little bit

52
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,940
differently so this is just kind of a

53
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:17,620
limps of some options that you can try

54
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:21,520
and then everybody has to put it all

55
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,800
together in their own unique way and so

56
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,600
to that last point how can we do it to

57
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,000
meet the different scales of vegetable

58
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,609
producers everybody has a different

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,620
favorite piece of equipment a different

60
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,810
budget they're working with so there's

61
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,819
nothing standardized about vegetable

62
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,460
production system and more and more

63
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:42,370
we're seeing small growers entering the

64
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:45,040
market and so while they may not cover a

65
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:47,289
large land base they're very important

66
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,840
population in terms of providing people

67
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:53,319
with a living providing fresh produce to

68
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:58,500
the market so can cover crops facilitate

69
00:02:53,319 --> 00:03:01,269
Noto this is just a slide to show that

70
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,159
not only can cover crops do a lot of

71
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:06,040
different things everything that they do

72
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:08,740
is interconnected and so ultimately we

73
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:10,629
care about crop growth but to get to

74
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,180
crop growth we have to be thinking about

75
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:14,919
how does that affect nitrogen or how

76
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,349
does the cover crop affect nitrogen

77
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:19,659
availability soil water needs those

78
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:21,069
things that I mentioned and it's not you

79
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:24,099
know it's not necessarily linear

80
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:25,989
everything just connects everything else

81
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:28,449
so

82
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:30,158
the four R's of nutrient management I

83
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:32,078
think are very applicable to cover

84
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:34,209
cropping you have to pick the right

85
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:38,280
product the right time the right place

86
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:41,739
and the right rate so for spring crops

87
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,479
we're thinking about soil temperature we

88
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:46,000
want it to be warm enough everybody's

89
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:48,218
talked about that which means that we

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,060
can't have a lot of soil cover because

91
00:03:48,218 --> 00:03:54,759
that's just gonna keep the soil cold we

92
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,829
want enough soil water but our problem

93
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:58,658
in spring tends to be too much water not

94
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:00,579
too little water I mean the climb is

95
00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:03,219
variable so we do get these dry Springs

96
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:05,439
but in general historically in the

97
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:08,709
spring the problem is too much water you

98
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:10,598
can't get on the fields and we need

99
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:12,908
enough nitrogen early in spring that's

100
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:15,068
related to soil temperature and finally

101
00:04:12,908 --> 00:04:17,659
in every cropping system we can't have

102
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:22,490
too many weeds

103
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:25,689
radish it's this very unique cover crop

104
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:29,210
it's you know become popular in the last

105
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:31,610
10-15 years folks and vegetable

106
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:33,079
production systems hate on the radish a

107
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,120
little bit because it is another

108
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:37,009
Brassica and so if you're growing a lot

109
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,410
of brassicas people are really hesitant

110
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:41,719
to introduce the radish cover crop but

111
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:44,140
if you can manage to fit it into your

112
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,780
rotation it has some amazing properties

113
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:51,500
so it's their project that I worked on

114
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:53,419
for my masters was using low low residue

115
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,920
winter killed cover crops we looked for

116
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,270
others that would do the same thing that

117
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,699
four-eyed reddish does and there just

118
00:04:56,269 --> 00:05:02,060
isn't one out there it's unique

119
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:03,889
so after it winter kills it leaves if

120
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,290
you had a good stand and you got it in

121
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:08,000
early enough basically zero weeds it's

122
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,950
completely weed free it looks like

123
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,230
somebody threw a pair of quat they

124
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:15,469
didn't there are all these little radish

125
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:18,140
carcasses but other than that very low

126
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:20,390
residue the soil warms up nicely and you

127
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:21,949
can go in this is not a no-till planter

128
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:23,860
this is just a regular made Ermac

129
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:27,349
planter you can go in and direct seed

130
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:29,540
no-till into this

131
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,879
um if you don't have a mater Mac planter

132
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:36,020
you can go in and direct seed no-till

133
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:38,839
with an earth way you do occasionally

134
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:42,229
have to pick out the dried radish

135
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:45,979
carcass it doesn't work quite as well as

136
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:48,920
if you have a larger cedar but it can

137
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:52,370
work um so I mentioned soil moisture

138
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:55,430
that's important because you can't get

139
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,110
on the field when it's too wet so I was

140
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,449
interested in looking at all right well

141
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:02,689
how much does radish affect soil

142
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:05,750
moisture so we had an experiment we had

143
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:09,949
four radish oats a radish oat mixture

144
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:12,829
and the no cover and so this line here

145
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:14,839
is 80% of the plastic limit which is

146
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:16,189
sort of what you would consider alright

147
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:18,789
you can get on the field without

148
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:23,269
destroying your soil if you're you're

149
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:27,950
within below 80% of the plastic limit so

150
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:33,620
these are the rain events on the x-axis

151
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:35,810
and you can see that when with the oat

152
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,910
cover crop which is high residue and it

153
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:43,040
also winter kills there are very few

154
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:45,380
points in this span of time when you can

155
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,230
actually get on the field so I looked at

156
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:51,529
in terms of the workable days and with

157
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:53,960
oats there are very small windows with

158
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:56,239
radish it's as good as if you had no

159
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:57,680
cover crop basically and so when people

160
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,210
use the argument well I don't want to

161
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,550
plan a cover crop because I need the

162
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:03,169
soil to be dry in spring well you can

163
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,000
plant a radish and it will be just as

164
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,590
dry and in fact you'll probably get

165
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,329
better infiltration so you'll have

166
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:11,318
better subsoil moisture and if you

167
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:13,718
didn't have a cover crop there

168
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,789
so so temperature another thing we need

169
00:07:13,718 --> 00:07:17,740
the temperature to be high enough so

170
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:21,329
that we'll get some mineralization going

171
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:25,210
on so that your seeds can germinate and

172
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:28,508
forage radish in red is almost the same

173
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:30,878
as no cover crop but you can see that

174
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:34,740
oats as you would expect higher residue

175
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,740
keeps the soil temperature down

176
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:40,869
um so how does that translate to

177
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:45,069
nitrogen availability so on the bottom

178
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:51,160
here we've got Julian day so just that's

179
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:54,099
basically March and cumulative degree

180
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,199
days and then on the top we've got soil

181
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,990
nitrate nitrogen for the top 20

182
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:01,960
centimeters and so what you see is that

183
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:04,689
with the radish and the radish and oat

184
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:06,728
you get a spike once you kind of hit

185
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:08,978
this critical level when that you get

186
00:08:06,728 --> 00:08:11,079
increasing degree days you get a spike

187
00:08:08,978 --> 00:08:12,370
in the available nitrogen so right when

188
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:14,978
your plants are going to start growing

189
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,079
and you need the nitrogen it's getting

190
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:19,360
mineralized from the radish that's not

191
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:20,620
happening with the oat it's also not

192
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,780
happening when you don't have a cover

193
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:26,439
crop they're getting a significant boost

194
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:27,939
in nitrogen early in the spring you want

195
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:31,750
to take advantage of that you don't want

196
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:34,299
to wait for it to leach out so it ends

197
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:38,759
up being about 40 to 50 pounds of

198
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:41,908
nitrogen per acre

199
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:46,068
so this is a no-till spinach crop right

200
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:50,759
after after radish just really quickly

201
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:53,099
yields we had foresight years total this

202
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:57,749
this Clarksville site up here was in the

203
00:08:53,100 --> 00:09:02,278
Piedmont a really nice soil not to abuse

204
00:08:57,749 --> 00:09:06,629
the Y soil is a coastal plain soil silt

205
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:09,208
loam and it's rather abused so the yield

206
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:13,860
that Clarksville tend to be a lot higher

207
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:16,498
and they were just as good in the

208
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,639
no-till as in the tilled plots which is

209
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:21,600
you know a lot of people would be

210
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:24,539
surprised by that but we did not see

211
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,970
that at why and I think it's because the

212
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:28,828
soil just isn't it was soil sort of at

213
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,509
the why I would say is kind of addicted

214
00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:32,099
to tillage it's one of those soils that

215
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:34,079
can't produce a good crop without

216
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:38,310
tillage it just doesn't have the soil

217
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:41,069
structure needed to support a crop

218
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:43,469
one thing that people ask a lot when I

219
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:45,960
talk about radishes is what about the

220
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,889
holes when you're direct seeding don't

221
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:53,580
you lose a lot of seeds into the holes

222
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:56,639
and in fact Steve can come up in the

223
00:09:53,580 --> 00:10:00,290
holes but what we found is that no-till

224
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:02,669
planting led to equal or better

225
00:10:00,289 --> 00:10:04,259
emergence as planting after tillage so

226
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:06,240
with tillage you eliminate those holes

227
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:10,110
but you don't get as good germination

228
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:13,080
you don't get as good emergence so no

229
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:15,360
the holes don't seem to limit that but

230
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:21,629
like I said you need to have good enough

231
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:24,480
soil to support the crop growth not all

232
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:26,309
vegetable crops do well in this no-till

233
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,769
situation it seems that some take a

234
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:31,109
little longer to mature we did some

235
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:33,720
lettuce and kohlrabi and they were just

236
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:35,430
slower so they did mature a couple weeks

237
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,279
later but if you're eager to get that

238
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:40,859
crop out of the field then it might not

239
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:44,279
be as good an option I did some carrots

240
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:48,899
in Maine's no-till carrots after radish

241
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:52,230
and I found that they did very well the

242
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:54,000
the yields were not quite as good but I

243
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,850
think that was just because we actually

244
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,850
in this case got lower emergence and had

245
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:05,730
reduced dance but so just to summarize

246
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:09,810
this system relies on seeding your cover

247
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:12,389
crop around mid to late August your

248
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:14,699
cover crop grows in fall your cover crop

249
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:16,259
dies over the winter pretty much the

250
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,740
whole Northeast region your cover crop

251
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:23,549
or forage radish will die then you grow

252
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:28,419
a cash crop makes money then you grow

253
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:30,519
another crop or another cover crop

254
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:33,399
all right so that's kind of the spring

255
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:37,149
the spring early system where you're

256
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:39,730
looking for low residue more soil

257
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:41,470
warming you want to get rid of the water

258
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,839
the excess water so you don't want your

259
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:47,199
fields to be too wet so for summer crops

260
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:52,029
though again you definitely don't want

261
00:11:47,198 --> 00:11:54,429
weeds but it's actually not as important

262
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:55,990
for the for the soil temperature well I

263
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:57,849
shouldn't say that it is important for

264
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,970
the soil temperature to be high but you

265
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:03,430
want the soil cover because you want it

266
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,019
to retain the moisture when you're

267
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:07,579
getting into the summer and you really

268
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:10,459
need that mulch

269
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:12,889
so but high residue systems like the

270
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:14,569
roller crimper that's discussed a lot in

271
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:16,580
grain systems and discussed a lot in

272
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,350
Pennsylvania and Maryland in those

273
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,450
places it was really interesting I don't

274
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,190
know if you folks went to Stephens talk

275
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,800
today but it was interesting to see that

276
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,959
you just can't get the kind of biomass

277
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,028
in northern climates that they talked

278
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:31,129
about in Pennsylvania and Maryland we

279
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:33,980
can't do it no matter how hard we try

280
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:36,740
and so to get adequate weed suppression

281
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:39,019
in those high residue systems you really

282
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,759
need almost four tons of dry matter and

283
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:42,470
if you look at the data like I love

284
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:45,439
looking at other people's presentations

285
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,600
and I'm like nope nope nope like almost

286
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,810
nobody gets out amount of dry matter in

287
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,089
their cover crops and so a much more

288
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:55,578
realistic number for us in the Northeast

289
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:58,690
is about half of that for a pretty good

290
00:12:55,578 --> 00:12:58,689
cover crop performance

291
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:02,549
they can also be hard to terminate

292
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:04,139
especially if you're drawing rye with

293
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:05,969
vetch or something and you get a

294
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:08,370
synchrony between when those crops

295
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:11,460
mature and you have to wait until a

296
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:15,360
certain point so really these high

297
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:17,370
residue systems sound great but we need

298
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,690
a lot more flexibility if people are

299
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,610
going to adopt them we need to be able

300
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,770
to terminate the cover crops more easily

301
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,659
and we need some kind of supplemental

302
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:27,210
weed control because we just aren't

303
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:31,100
going to get the biomass that they can

304
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:34,500
get in Maryland so what about tarps

305
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:37,580
tarps have been promoted in the market

306
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:40,620
gardener a lot of small farmers are

307
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:43,470
using them in the context of permanent

308
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,028
raised beds but as far as we knew there

309
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:46,950
weren't a whole lot of people who were

310
00:13:45,028 --> 00:13:50,220
combining actually we don't know of

311
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:54,240
really anybody who is combining high

312
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:56,690
residue cover crops and tarps

313
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,889
there were these folks in Canada

314
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,480
unfortunately I couldn't I don't speak

315
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:01,919
French so I couldn't I think they may

316
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,080
have had something about their

317
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:06,389
experiment but I couldn't understand it

318
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:10,379
but I did find this picture online of

319
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:13,889
what they did so what we did though we

320
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:16,320
had an initial preliminary trial two

321
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:17,939
years ago and we tried black and clear

322
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,740
tarps and what we learned was clear

323
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,839
doesn't really work in our climate so we

324
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,000
went to black so then that we modified

325
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,850
it and so this past season what we did

326
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,250
was we seeded Brian Betz end of

327
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:31,830
September again that's not a date when

328
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:34,350
you're gonna get very high biomass but

329
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:38,040
it's a really realistic date for farmers

330
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:39,600
in the Northeast the mid August even

331
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:43,199
though I would advocate that for forage

332
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:46,440
radish is not very realistic and the

333
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:49,080
September is so the the biomass that we

334
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:54,029
got in these two fields and my farm was

335
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:56,480
about 4,000 killed between 3500 and 4500

336
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:59,700
killing ant kilograms per hectare so

337
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,190
around two tons that's what it looked

338
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:05,759
like so the treatments we applied on

339
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:08,550
June 5th were rolled with a disengage

340
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,110
rotor tiller and parked that's what that

341
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:12,059
looked like and the reason we that is

342
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:16,589
because we also do not have a roller

343
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:20,189
crimper we mowed with a sickle bar mower

344
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:23,760
and tarped we had to borrow that and

345
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:26,430
then we motive sickle bar mower and we

346
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,439
didn't tarp and then finally we tilled

347
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:30,239
in tarped and we tilled and didn't tarp

348
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,459
so this is what it looked like when we

349
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,899
mowed with the sickle bar mower it was

350
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:36,449
really hard because it was a push one

351
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:39,419
piece yes and it was hard to get the

352
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:41,250
residue to lay flat it kind of shook off

353
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:45,528
to the side so I did the best I could

354
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:49,708
but it was a little messy

355
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:53,789
then we tarp is just four mill UV

356
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:57,299
stabilized black plastic held down with

357
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:59,219
sod staples so this is what the the

358
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:01,620
three different sort of residue

359
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:04,230
management looked like this tailed

360
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,000
treatment not I know that most farmers

361
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,610
would never do that

362
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,190
like that's messy so that's not

363
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:13,528
your ideal tailed treatment but your

364
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:16,230
ideal tailed treatment you would have

365
00:16:13,528 --> 00:16:19,500
killed your covered hawk way earlier and

366
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:21,420
incorporated it so it's hard to deal

367
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,600
with high biomass cover crops if you're

368
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:27,000
working in a tilled system this is what

369
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:31,019
the mode one looked like and then rolled

370
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,639
looked like that so we had two fields

371
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:35,610
kind of next to each other but a little

372
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:38,549
different soil types left the tarps on

373
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:43,320
for four weeks basically the whole month

374
00:16:38,549 --> 00:16:45,990
of June then on July 5th we transplanted

375
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,390
the cabbages they were bigger than that

376
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:51,419
and to do that again we don't have any

377
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:53,549
fancy no-till transplanting equipment so

378
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:55,500
what we did was actually use a tree

379
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:56,759
seedling dubler you stand up and you

380
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,409
make a hole

381
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:00,450
it sounds really laborious but when you

382
00:16:58,409 --> 00:17:03,569
have undergrads it doesn't take too long

383
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:07,439
no I actually don't think it took that

384
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:11,039
long but if we do this again we will you

385
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:15,120
know measure how long it takes so we can

386
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:17,639
do an enterprise budget of sorts so this

387
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:20,458
is what it ended up looking like so this

388
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,740
is a mode and tarped this is a tilled

389
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:25,318
and not tarped and then we did have sub

390
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:28,410
plots of weeded and not weeded and so

391
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:30,629
here in the mode in tarp you can't see a

392
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:34,019
huge difference between the weeded and

393
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:36,090
not we did here with the tilled and not

394
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:39,029
tarped there's a pretty substantial

395
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:41,819
difference between the weeded and not we

396
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:43,259
did so it's not like these these fields

397
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:46,259
were weed free or anything there was a

398
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:50,339
substantial weed seed bank a substantial

399
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:53,450
weed problem this is a Roldan tarped

400
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:55,889
again that middle flag there is marking

401
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:58,980
weeded and unweeded you can't really see

402
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:00,360
a difference mode and not harped which

403
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,759
is one of those treatments that no

404
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:06,599
farmer in her right mind would ever do

405
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:09,629
but we're researchers that's what this

406
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:14,399
looked like so the that's the not weeded

407
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:16,970
part this is the weeded part we

408
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,070
ended up harvesting a little bit early

409
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,990
these were these are small cabbages

410
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:24,269
they're tiara cabbage from johnny's

411
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,069
they're intended to be a two to three

412
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:29,639
pound head kind of a high-density

413
00:18:26,069 --> 00:18:32,700
planting but we had a severe porcupine

414
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:35,370
infestation which we kept that bay with

415
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:40,319
a 22 but we were like we gotta get our

416
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:42,899
data out of the field so they were there

417
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,730
really beautiful cabbages if I do say so

418
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:49,190
myself

419
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:53,979
and our yields so

420
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:59,599
these three are the tarped treatments

421
00:18:53,979 --> 00:19:01,970
Reds weeded blue is not weeded not a

422
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:05,829
huge difference between weeded and not

423
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,829
we did where we had a tarp

424
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:12,120
those are our tailed treatments where we

425
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:15,779
didn't have a tarp and we tailed an

426
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:18,209
enormous difference between we did and

427
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:20,339
not we did so if you're not using a tarp

428
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:22,980
you really have to control your weeds

429
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:26,579
which is what you know most farmers do

430
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:29,630
you control your weeds and again mow no

431
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:33,470
tarp just kind of joke

432
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:37,430
uh weed biomass so as a reminder the

433
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:42,920
average cover crop biomass was 35 to

434
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:46,100
4,500 kilograms per hectare so where

435
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,900
there was no tarp substantially more

436
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:51,919
weed biomass this is just for the

437
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:54,530
unweeded plots by the way both field

438
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,750
pretty similar story where there was

439
00:19:54,529 --> 00:20:00,619
lower biomass there was a little bit

440
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:04,069
more of a we more weeds even in the tarp

441
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:08,079
block in the tarp plots

442
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:12,139
it was mostly pigweed and purslane and

443
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:14,589
research has shown that tarping or

444
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:17,330
solarization does not really affect

445
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:21,169
pigweed and personally they have a very

446
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:25,490
very high temperature tolerance but

447
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:27,860
there still weren't a ton of weeds so I

448
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:29,950
haven't looked at the moisture and

449
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:32,479
temperature data I do have some of it

450
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:35,480
but we hypothesized that warmer

451
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,220
temperatures during carping increased

452
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,349
nitrogen mineralization so you're

453
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,420
solving some of that problem of cool

454
00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:43,369
soils in spring by having a tarp on

455
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:45,590
there for a little while and getting

456
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:49,969
everything going and Katy just showed me

457
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:53,119
a graph from a on-farm experiment that

458
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:55,460
out one of her collaborating farmers was

459
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:59,269
working on who actually had a very

460
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:02,769
similar experiment and there was a

461
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:05,960
substantial like three degree difference

462
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:09,529
3 to 5 degree difference under the tarp

463
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:12,110
which is what you would expect so we all

464
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:15,139
also hypothesize that more water

465
00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:18,589
available in the no-tell thoughts is

466
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:22,700
good for the crops there's less stress

467
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:25,819
during dry period so to summarize this

468
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,980
rotation looks like alright we plant our

469
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:30,409
cover crops they grow a little bit in

470
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:33,529
the fall not a lot they mostly grow in

471
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:35,750
the spring we tarp them for around the

472
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:39,230
month of June we know for weeks works

473
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:41,000
we'd love to do some more experiments to

474
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,930
see whether we can get away with shorter

475
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,180
tarp duration

476
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:47,279
this project was pretty much unfunded

477
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,750
but we're we just put in an application

478
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,170
and hopefully we'll get funding and we

479
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:54,420
can answer some more of these questions

480
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:57,300
then you grow your cash crop and then

481
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:59,850
move into whatever's necked next so

482
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:02,669
that's just kind of a proof of concept

483
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:04,500
but what I like about this system even

484
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:08,640
though I hate plastic and I hate being

485
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:11,579
like yeah plastic it provides so much

486
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,880
flexibility because it kills the cover

487
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:18,240
crop which is often a problem it

488
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,860
suppresses weed and it warms the soil so

489
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,539
it's like solving so many of the

490
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:23,849
problems that we have and needs reduce

491
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:25,769
tiller systems and so but it doesn't

492
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:27,869
just have to be Ryan vetch it could be

493
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:29,789
for instance a winter killed oat cover

494
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:32,219
crop and then you could put the tarp on

495
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:34,470
earlier and get stuff going I really

496
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:37,110
don't know but I think there's like many

497
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:40,350
possibilities for applying the system to

498
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:42,449
other other time periods you do want it

499
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:44,969
to be during a period when there's some

500
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:48,509
heat so you're going to get that warming

501
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:55,049
under the tarp but how am i doing on

502
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:56,609
time okay so the way forward I think I

503
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:58,139
said in the description I was gonna like

504
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:59,939
talk about how to integrate all these

505
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,100
systems which sounded like a really good

506
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,870
idea but then when I was putting this

507
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:05,939
together last night I was like I don't

508
00:23:03,869 --> 00:23:11,009
know how to do it I don't know other way

509
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:13,769
for it is but I think I think that when

510
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:16,259
we have multiple systems where we can

511
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:18,480
eliminate tillage events farmers will

512
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:20,220
get creative and string those multiple

513
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:25,410
systems together so that we can

514
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:27,180
eliminate multiple tillage events so but

515
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:29,070
the problem with this whole system is

516
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:32,430
that cover crops do take time to grow

517
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:34,799
there's no way around it and so what is

518
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:36,750
the opportunity cost using this tarping

519
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,490
system also takes a significant amount

520
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:42,000
of time so what's the opportunity cost

521
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:44,750
of a four week tarping period in May or

522
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,549
June so that's why we really do want to

523
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:49,289
drill down on how long do you have to

524
00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:51,269
put that tarp on if it's the beginning

525
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:54,450
of June can you leave it on for a week

526
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:56,009
and get close to the same effects or do

527
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,730
you really have to have it for four

528
00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:58,710
weeks

529
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:00,720
it's hard to look at anything that has

530
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:02,429
to do with timing it's really hard

531
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,370
because there are so many confounding

532
00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:07,290
factors was it how how moist the soil

533
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:09,569
was when you put it on was it this was

534
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:11,220
it that so we've tried to design an

535
00:24:09,569 --> 00:24:13,639
experiment for the future where we can

536
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:17,429
really get at some of those questions

537
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:19,530
but we'll see if we get money so the

538
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:21,150
great thing was we salvaged some of

539
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:23,399
enough of the cabbage from the

540
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:25,710
porcupines for our data that we also

541
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:31,169
donated about 3000 pounds of cabbage

542
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:33,730
bag so that was awesome felt good yeah

543
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:40,650
so that's it

544
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:40,650
[Applause]

00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:45,389
[Music]

546
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,288
[Music]

547
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:18,350
the weed communities were definitely

548
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:20,659
different the weed communities in the

549
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:25,389
tarps were really not diverse it was

550
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:31,370
really like pigweed purslane so the tarp

551
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:34,250
selected for resistant weeds but I

552
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:37,219
didn't measure the weed density

553
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:42,109
I only measured the weed biomass so I

554
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:44,950
can't definitively say but I think from

555
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:48,829
having looked at it that there was lower

556
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:51,220
density in the tarp plots but I didn't

557
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:51,220
measure that

558
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:53,349
you

559
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:08,250
yeah yeah so I didn't mention that but

560
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:12,779
that is a really important part of this

561
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:16,529
system so for that weed seed destruction

562
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:19,049
you need enough moisture so ideally

563
00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:20,849
you'd put on the tarps when the after

564
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:23,460
rain when your soils are at field

565
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:26,699
capacity or if it is dry you could

566
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:29,759
irrigate even if they're above Field

567
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:32,429
capacity they'll drain so go ahead and

568
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,589
put the tarps on when it's wet but yeah

569
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:37,230
if you put the tarps on when it's dry

570
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:39,029
there's also no moisture going into that

571
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:40,380
system so when you go to transplant your

572
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:42,299
crops there's not going to be much

573
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:45,059
moisture but if you put the tarp on I

574
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:46,619
feel capacity your soil will still be a

575
00:26:45,058 --> 00:26:47,910
filled capacity when you transplant

576
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:50,279
those crops they were basically

577
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:52,769
guaranteeing that you've got good

578
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:55,039
moisture when you're transplanting your

579
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:55,039
crops
