00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:26,419
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:28,099
University I am a fifth year now and I

3
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:32,169
came here straight out of my undergrad

4
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:32,168
which I did at University of Connecticut

5
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:50,089
I'm Katie and went to the University of

6
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:53,600
Florida and I did a bunch of different

7
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:55,130
volunteering slash field tech gigs and

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:07,368
basically what I was taking three years

9
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:09,740
off by like doing work and my name is

10
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:12,920
Kara I'm a first year PhD student in the

11
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:16,218
entomology department I went to Yale as

12
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,978
an undergrad and did various summer

13
00:01:16,218 --> 00:01:20,358
research projects through fellowships

14
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,950
that I got through the college and then

15
00:01:20,358 --> 00:01:24,349
I went on to a master's of Public Health

16
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,990
there afterwards and then I took a year

17
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:28,819
off of academia and worked on ranches in

18
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:43,459
Wyoming and Argentina

19
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:50,568
and during that time and research in

20
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:52,459
humans very good so we research hi my

21
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:56,748
name is Angie I'm not a eunuch from

22
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:57,559
Columbia and I did I have like a long I

23
00:01:56,748 --> 00:02:02,958
didn't

24
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:05,030
undergrad time I have two we are

25
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,460
required to have a cat we search for her

26
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:10,979
then

27
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:14,919
like present PCs then my work in

28
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,899
Institute as I was Research Institute in

29
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:19,419
Colombia till then I did my masters in

30
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:23,680
the University of Puerto Rico my the

31
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:34,000
West and then I work as a manager Nick

32
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:37,060
University so what we're gonna do today

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,039
is in these different sections of the CV

34
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,140
and one thing what we want to emphasize

35
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,419
that there's no real hard and fast rules

36
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:44,769
to writing a CV but these are some ways

37
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:52,179
that you can organize it that I think a

38
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:53,860
lot of people career and start off with

39
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,409
just your education section which is

40
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,830
pretty simple but should include just

41
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:26,199
wearing your undergraduate what your

42
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:39,970
major was and it's also nice some

43
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:44,319
institutions really and requirement and

44
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:46,180
some a lot of programs really but that's

45
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,509
kind of a kind of institution by

46
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,040
institution thing and then the next next

47
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:52,840
section which some people have some

48
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,870
people don't but it's kind of nice to

49
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:59,259
orient what you're interested in is this

50
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:02,049
kind of research section and so that's

51
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:03,578
actually a really short summary of what

52
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:06,790
you're interested sometimes it can even

53
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:13,209
be just keywords kind of topics that you

54
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:14,560
really kind of your kind of but anyway

55
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:18,298
that's a very short section is

56
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,298
definitely optional

57
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:50,109
[Music]

58
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,189
[Music]

59
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,838
[Music]

60
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:48,668
you don't want to make it a very long

61
00:05:48,850 --> 00:06:09,919
you don't want to publications and

62
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:11,959
presentations so depending on how many

63
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,719
you have they cancel different sections

64
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:20,599
for me mine still just once sections

65
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:22,130
both together so for publications you

66
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,689
can include any peer reviewed or

67
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:26,959
published publications it can also

68
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:29,879
include PCs if they are like archived

69
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:32,409
and online three years University

70
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,839
institution and sometimes they are kind

71
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:38,169
of readily accessible like somebody can

72
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:40,478
search it and find it online and read it

73
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:44,370
you can put it in the publication

74
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:46,689
section for presentations I would be any

75
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,840
symposiums or conferences you've got to

76
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:51,430
either it's just a great institution and

77
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:55,000
posters and oral presentations both

78
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:57,160
count and then of course when you

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,519
actually put them on your CV make sure

80
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,409
you're following citation guidelines and

81
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:04,870
you keep it consistent so pick one and

82
00:07:02,408 --> 00:07:06,029
then stick with it be the whole way

83
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:20,769
through

84
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:23,529
yes so she asked how you cite for a

85
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:26,288
poster or presentation and the way that

86
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:28,598
I've done it is that I put the title of

87
00:07:26,288 --> 00:07:31,300
the poster of presentation

88
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:37,529
what conference it was and then where

89
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:40,658
the conference was and also the date yes

90
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:41,888
and many other questions to see if you

91
00:07:40,658 --> 00:07:43,329
guys know we're going to be repeating

92
00:07:41,889 --> 00:08:09,519
the questions back to you for the sake

93
00:07:43,329 --> 00:08:11,439
of recording yes good question so she

94
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:14,439
asked how far back you should go in

95
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:18,819
terms of putting publications on your CV

96
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:21,279
that is a good question and it's I think

97
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:23,800
it's going to depend on the person so if

98
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:26,859
you have a lot of publications you might

99
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,168
not want to put the ones from no 2007

100
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,990
that aren't necessarily relevant or what

101
00:08:29,168 --> 00:08:33,879
you want to do moving forward but like

102
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:40,719
if you don't have you have like two or

103
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:43,299
three I would say it depends on what the

104
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,490
CD is for like a lot of the grad school

105
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:47,349
ask for a two-page CV so it's moving

106
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:50,080
like a resume so then you'd have to kind

107
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,250
of narrow it down to fit it on then you

108
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,778
might just want to select the most

109
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,028
relevant one so type of research you're

110
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:58,649
applying to but if it's a true CV then

111
00:08:55,028 --> 00:08:58,649
it's really everything you've ever done

112
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:31,899
yeah so I'd like more and more concise

113
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:34,719
over the years and I think so you might

114
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:36,429
list the title if it's basically the

115
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,629
same across conferences you change a

116
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:39,929
couple of words but it's still

117
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:46,200
essentially the same poster pick a title

118
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:46,199
and then list the locations and the ears

119
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:56,349
so for me I usually keep a copy of my

120
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:59,458
full resume that that it will be very

121
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:03,720
helpful and then when you're applying to

122
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:07,539
decision you like make it concise and

123
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,730
very specific to the position of your

124
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:11,139
body so that that's really helpful like

125
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:19,180
keep a copy in your computer with

126
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:20,679
everything that you have done so I I

127
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:23,588
find that there's like a lot of

128
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:29,289
variation between schools what do you

129
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:32,980
ask in terms of resumes or CDs I I think

130
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:34,509
a lot of the work that is started the

131
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:38,079
very beginning when you emailed the

132
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:40,600
professor to start a contact that you

133
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:43,359
need to basically show as much as you

134
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,389
don't I'm whatever it is relevant for

135
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:50,379
this professor is when you wanted to

136
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:52,720
highlight so you can have like their

137
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:56,049
resume with everything that you have

138
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,440
done and a disco in pace

139
00:10:56,049 --> 00:11:05,169
some produced partial ratification but

140
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:07,029
or to highlight but it's when you want

141
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:09,879
to choke that professor you are

142
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:13,028
contacting that moment so if there's a

143
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:14,679
little variation but if you have like a

144
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:18,909
long research experience

145
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:21,269
it's better to show like that experience

146
00:11:18,909 --> 00:11:24,939
you don't need to put every poster every

147
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:26,649
talk you just want to go maybe the most

148
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:30,339
prestigious conference that you had gone

149
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:32,259
and you can estar sometimes people like

150
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:34,930
to see the history which is started in

151
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:38,049
the desert 10 years ago that's pretty

152
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:40,989
good something like that so you want to

153
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:43,889
emphasize that you have been consistent

154
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:46,240
in a long history of doing research and

155
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:48,909
you can highlight just maybe the most

156
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,440
prestigious so they want I think have

157
00:11:48,909 --> 00:12:00,909
most of the daily they are something

158
00:11:50,440 --> 00:12:03,220
like no other questions ok so next I'm

159
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:05,559
going to be talking about two more

160
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,750
sections you can experience and

161
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:10,389
volunteer and extracurricular so I were

162
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:13,028
just for context these are important to

163
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:14,799
grad schools first of all on a common

164
00:12:13,028 --> 00:12:16,570
way if funding students is through to be

165
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,159
a chips so if you can show that you've

166
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:22,750
got some sort of experience you're still

167
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:25,360
on teaching then that maybe looks an

168
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,339
application process so she's been an

169
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,930
undergraduate ta that's definitely

170
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:32,920
something you're gonna want to put into

171
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:34,689
your CV for your application or if

172
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:36,849
you've done any sort of tutoring whether

173
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:40,029
it's a college level or even if you

174
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:41,589
tutored younger children that shows that

175
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:43,990
you have experience teaching someone and

176
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:48,699
can explain concepts in a way that's

177
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:50,370
understandable to others and then curl

178
00:12:48,698 --> 00:12:53,198
your volunteer an extracurricular

179
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:55,120
experience one important thing is to

180
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:57,519
highlight any leadership role as her

181
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,959
managerial role as you pass so even if

182
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,759
you've been in the club for all four

183
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,259
years

184
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,240
you've just been president this past

185
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:05,639
year something you're gonna want to put

186
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,310
that like upfront in your description of

187
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,620
that topic so maybe like highlighting

188
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:11,969
your president role in the title or

189
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,210
something like that you're just and

190
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,980
beside those who whoever's looking at it

191
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:19,980
you know that you have this experience

192
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,200
leading others and you're gonna want to

193
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,460
be selective and succinct I'm speaking

194
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,870
with some of you guys it sounds like

195
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:28,680
you've done like a million and one

196
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:30,629
things and that's amazing but you aren't

197
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,819
going to have all that room for a

198
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:35,009
two-page CD so you're gonna want to

199
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,840
choose what's most relevant or what you

200
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:39,029
feel most passionate about you expect

201
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:43,170
the most time on um if you're feeling

202
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:46,409
like you're pressed for space better

203
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:47,729
tech to elaborate on the things that you

204
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:50,309
care about I've done a little bit more

205
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:59,250
with then it was something II did it

206
00:13:50,309 --> 00:14:02,039
maybe one day one year and yeah so you

207
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:04,889
can use this to support other sections

208
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:07,500
of your of your resume but you don't

209
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:09,449
want to be redundant so for example if

210
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,980
you volunteered in a lab you're gonna

211
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,900
want to put that under research

212
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,730
experience it's not only pollen to your

213
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:16,409
experience first of all he is writing

214
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,990
care more about your research experience

215
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:19,469
so that's probably where I was gonna go

216
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,060
first

217
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,920
did you have that experience even if

218
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:23,909
it's volunteer or not okay you're gonna

219
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:25,199
want to put that under research

220
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:27,990
experience to highlight it more

221
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:34,170
effectively and then don't repeat it in

222
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:36,360
the volunteer obsession and yeah so I

223
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:37,829
mean I guess it is important if you have

224
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,519
done any volunteer extracurricular

225
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:43,050
experience to add that in because just

226
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,689
like your applications for undergrad

227
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:49,229
grad schools Karen and you're gonna add

228
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:53,280
something to the community a more

229
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:56,700
vibrant place so like for example all

230
00:14:53,279 --> 00:15:00,299
the students here working on this it's

231
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:01,980
because of people who care our active

232
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,179
and engaged community so if you can show

233
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,340
you're gonna be that type of person when

234
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:09,959
you come to school then that's gonna add

235
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:11,460
something to the grad and grad schools

236
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,629
are gonna want you more for that type of

237
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,629
personality trait

238
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:30,710
so say you're helping someone learn

239
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:32,899
English yes I would definitely I I think

240
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:35,120
first of all you're teaching second of

241
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:37,879
all that shows that you're engaged in

242
00:15:35,120 --> 00:16:00,440
the community and care about others and

243
00:15:37,879 --> 00:16:02,330
I think that's something for Jeff yes so

244
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,950
the question is if you have some sort of

245
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,660
qualification for the past and then

246
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:07,580
didn't necessarily follow up on that

247
00:16:05,659 --> 00:16:09,110
it's not actually a negative thing to

248
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,620
put in because it shows that you weren't

249
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:14,419
committed to it um I think that would

250
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,850
depend on on the situation but I would

251
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:18,860
say I would still include it because you

252
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:23,090
have that qualification and that

253
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:26,360
training and so it could come in handy

254
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:28,250
I think especially if you at some point

255
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,289
in your application can explain why you

256
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,419
didn't pursue that and that it's not

257
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:37,879
because you hate teaching people or

258
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:40,429
something and I would make it clear why

259
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:45,230
you get away from that but I think it'll

260
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:49,519
depend on like the context remember this

261
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:51,289
is this is all complimentary with the

262
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,259
rest of the package don't think that

263
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:56,719
this is my unique professors you are

264
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:58,819
flying to a lab or to a department and

265
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,029
there's going to be a professor they say

266
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:05,570
his sister looks interesting and that

267
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:08,869
person is going to read your CV and you

268
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:12,769
SOP and detail because it's a commitment

269
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:14,419
it's because in both weight so it's

270
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:16,279
going to read everything and you don't

271
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,050
want to be redundant and then you can

272
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:18,889
say yeah I have this experience and then

273
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:20,899
you enjoy

274
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:26,390
it's a bead you can say yeah I have

275
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:29,320
things like my coal was go it's

276
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:32,840
complimentary you put your the CV

277
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:35,720
highlights basically two skills what you

278
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:39,049
are done and then you Nestle feed you

279
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:43,069
basically invalidation but it's nice

280
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:46,009
words about the experience and decisions

281
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:47,599
of life things like that also doing

282
00:17:46,009 --> 00:17:49,369
about the question about something

283
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,589
that's maybe seems slightly irrelevant

284
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:54,039
to what you're applying for I think also

285
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:55,789
you can find surprising or unexpected

286
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,389
connections with the person you're

287
00:17:55,789 --> 00:17:58,129
applying to

288
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:01,190
by adding things that aren't necessarily

289
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:03,800
about science like for example I added

290
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:05,840
in my work with horses on ranches in my

291
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:07,849
application to grad school and the P I

292
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:08,959
that I worked with now that's worth of

293
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:10,459
courses for life so it's actually

294
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,250
something we talked about during her

295
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,779
interview and so I I didn't just ignore

296
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,369
that part of my interest in my life

297
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:20,389
because it didn't have anything to do

298
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:22,279
with mosquitoes so yeah I think you

299
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:34,700
weigh what's important and what you have

300
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:36,980
space work that's right alright a tricky

301
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:39,650
section just because terminology can

302
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:41,839
vary so probably a lot of you have

303
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:45,460
received some kind of a scholarship or

304
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:48,859
fellowship or financial aid in college

305
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,940
so you want to be careful that first of

306
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:52,669
all the things that you're putting on

307
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:55,250
your CV in a great fashion in a word

308
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:58,220
section you differentiate according to

309
00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:00,220
the type of for it is I'm so fellowships

310
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,890
are generally it's some sort of program

311
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:06,799
where you your status is as a felon

312
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:09,530
so usually like the words will be in the

313
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:13,339
program name but it may or may not

314
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:14,809
include financial aid or a stipend

315
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:16,939
usually it's a fellowship that's

316
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:18,169
associated with research usually when

317
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:22,090
people see fellowship they think

318
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:24,590
research fellowship scholarships can be

319
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:26,179
other sorts of financial aid or you may

320
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:28,519
have received the scholarship that's not

321
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:30,080
research or maybe you just didn't have a

322
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:31,129
title of fellow it was a part of a

323
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:34,059
program but you

324
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:37,490
applied for it and got it generally Oh

325
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:38,809
maybe the others can speak to this to

326
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,380
you but I would sleep with either

327
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:43,759
scholarships or research grants as

328
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,590
descriptions because that's kind of what

329
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:47,059
the eyes are used to reading the

330
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:48,559
scholarships is something that's like

331
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:50,899
it's a turn the optics of the

332
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:54,500
undergraduate level but not as much as

333
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:56,780
the graphical address so if you

334
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,029
specifically got money for research we

335
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:00,769
can call it a research grant you're part

336
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:05,629
of a fellowship program you should pull

337
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:07,339
your scholarship program and generally

338
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,570
if you got any meat based scholarships

339
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,819
that's not something that goes on your

340
00:20:08,569 --> 00:20:12,289
CV just because it's you know need-based

341
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:16,039
and it's not something that you applied

342
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:18,409
for giving your experience um and you

343
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:20,180
want to clarify especially the best

344
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,950
thing that you can put in this in this

345
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,930
section is that you applied for money

346
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:25,519
for your own independent research which

347
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:28,519
is probably what you're going to put in

348
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:30,200
there and you know that's something that

349
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:33,289
if you haven't done already like it's a

350
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:41,990
really great thing to ask your senior

351
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:45,230
year but yeah so like the general idea

352
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:47,660
with this section is to say funding for

353
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:49,849
my research and I got some even if it's

354
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,860
just a couple hundred dollars like the

355
00:20:49,849 --> 00:21:00,259
amounts at this stage really doesn't

356
00:20:51,859 --> 00:21:02,569
matter as much as you apply but yeah and

357
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:06,500
works on an application with someone in

358
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:08,839
your lab either the kiai of the lab or

359
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:12,410
the post postdoc in the lab or HD

360
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:35,389
student you can state that either a CV

361
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:39,200
that you apply it with X Y Z yeah so Y

362
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:41,330
is a more general statement so in it it

363
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,980
can definitely capture those things if

364
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:45,619
you've gotten multiple travel awards I

365
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:48,410
might put that in a different section

366
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:50,719
but that's definitely something that can

367
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:52,970
go in you would just want to state

368
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,860
clearly that that you received to travel

369
00:21:52,970 --> 00:22:15,980
over to attend just conference and

370
00:21:54,859 --> 00:22:18,769
that's a really good thing so the

371
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:20,000
question is about if you get two awards

372
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:27,259
and you can only choose one which is

373
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:31,039
wrong you can just say this needs a word

374
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:35,799
X&amp;Y for conference flank I don't think

375
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,799
you need to say that I only use this one

376
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,759
that's that's like a general point to

377
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:45,710
make if you have fights for something

378
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:47,089
and you received it or even if he

379
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,710
received an honorable mention for

380
00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:51,230
something this is something that comes

381
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:53,720
up a lot like you know minorities and

382
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:56,599
women tend to say less often when

383
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,339
they've received an honorable mention

384
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:00,139
but that matters it shows that you

385
00:22:58,339 --> 00:23:02,179
worked for it and that you were almost

386
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,680
there near a high quality candidates so

387
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,110
it's something like that as sort of like

388
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,570
borderline but it shows that you did the

389
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:10,689
work and that you were you know either

390
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:14,559
got accepted or an honorable mention

391
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,559
included especially for research

392
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:41,890
question so it's about if you're

393
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,890
acknowledged know

394
00:23:46,259 --> 00:24:06,759
did you help develop I feel like that's

395
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:08,710
something if you're developing materials

396
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:10,960
for any kind of course even if you're

397
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:12,850
like not an official author on anything

398
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,759
that's something that should probably go

399
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:19,029
to your teaching section it doesn't have

400
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:21,640
to be like author manual XYZ but it can

401
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:27,279
be just a description of what you did so

402
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:29,470
developed materials for manuals you know

403
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:33,629
named just like brief words they like

404
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:36,220
and capture the you know the content

405
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:38,950
yeah yeah if you have a citation for the

406
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,329
manual that's awesome you know if not it

407
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:43,539
can be just sort of a description of

408
00:24:40,329 --> 00:24:46,059
your own it's nice when you can sort of

409
00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:49,210
plug in a way that's like author or like

410
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:51,129
co-author or editor or something because

411
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:54,130
that's just like it like helps people

412
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:56,200
key in on it but if it's not that simple

413
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,940
then just trying to state what you did

414
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,430
it in concise way it's the great you

415
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,500
know alternate it I just want to quickly

416
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:04,600
go back to the second half of a previous

417
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,910
question I'm at this weekend

418
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:09,549
does the camp put it on the CV and you

419
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:15,060
can apply for it and you guys are not

420
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:26,680
accepted so you put it on your CV under

421
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:29,319
yeah okay so for the skill sections of

422
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:33,060
birds or your CV you should be very

423
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:35,250
specific and concise you should

424
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:40,089
experience that you have had in previous

425
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:43,210
jobs undergraduate research or film or

426
00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:47,619
lab courses it will be great if you can

427
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:49,420
be as specific about specific about the

428
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:51,609
the type of position that you apply in

429
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:54,279
for example if you're applying for a

430
00:25:51,609 --> 00:25:56,649
molecular lab that require molecular

431
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:58,420
techniques you should like

432
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:02,970
you should add that you know how to do a

433
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:02,970
PCR and you know how to do Westar blood

434
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:10,960
I do that you also looking at if you

435
00:26:08,589 --> 00:26:14,889
know any type of programming language

436
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,210
like C C++ or Java if you know any if

437
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:18,460
you are proficient in another language

438
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:21,940
like Mandarin Spanish or French that's a

439
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:24,309
great skill to have if you are very

440
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:26,950
proficient in working with a computer

441
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:29,649
software like R or barrel that's a great

442
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:32,769
skill to taught you to skill Saoirse on

443
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:35,710
your CV and not so great to add in this

444
00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:46,000
in the skill section and personal

445
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:48,279
attributes like responsible teamwork and

446
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,829
Microsoft form a kinship or Macintosh

447
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:52,269
software proficiency and that's

448
00:26:50,829 --> 00:27:01,720
something that you would like to take

449
00:26:52,269 --> 00:27:03,279
care of you okay so we'll probably

450
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,950
discuss this a lot as we're going

451
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,539
through your CDs with you but these are

452
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:09,759
just a few things about formatting and

453
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:11,349
by the way we're going to post all these

454
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:16,269
powerpoints online so don't feel it

455
00:27:11,349 --> 00:27:18,549
needs a you know type furiously but

456
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:20,349
generally you know just really simple

457
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:22,299
the first bullet is just about contact

458
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:23,980
information so you want to have like

459
00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:28,629
your name pretty clear on the first page

460
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:30,900
nothing super fancy but clear and your

461
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:35,440
basic contacts email and phone number

462
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:36,850
and mailing address european cds tend to

463
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,490
like add a lot of personal information

464
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:42,279
but like you know even like if you're

465
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:44,019
married or like a photo for american CDs

466
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:46,869
you keep it simple it's basically how to

467
00:27:44,019 --> 00:27:51,279
contact me and you want your full name

468
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:52,569
on the rest of the pages and so you want

469
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,849
to make sure all of your dates are

470
00:27:52,569 --> 00:27:57,009
aligned to the right or to the left not

471
00:27:54,849 --> 00:27:59,230
just kind of somewhere in the middle so

472
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:02,819
that they're easy to see and so people

473
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:05,200
can track your experience over time and

474
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:08,379
you want to just generally keep your

475
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,860
formatting really clean and simple and

476
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,110
you

477
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:12,819
want to try to cram things in it's

478
00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:16,808
always better to be concise and

479
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:19,389
selective than to make it denser because

480
00:28:16,808 --> 00:28:20,649
your pies would be reading a ton of cv

481
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:24,160
so they want to be able to find things

482
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:26,470
really easily and you want to keep your

483
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:29,470
font somewhere between 11 and 13 points

484
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:31,450
so fun fact I printed all your CDs so I

485
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:33,220
know that like there are some that we're

486
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:35,200
like really big or like really small and

487
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,539
so one good trick is like hand it to

488
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,569
someone tell them to like hold it right

489
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:42,789
here and then see if they squint or see

490
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:46,470
if they move the paper away so you want

491
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:50,048
it at a comfortable reading distance and

492
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:53,860
you want to use caps and bold to

493
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:55,990
emphasize headers or subsections I've

494
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:58,629
been guilty of overuse of italics in the

495
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:01,929
past but it tends to make things less

496
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:03,850
readable not more readable and this all

497
00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:07,059
relates to just make sure you print it

498
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:08,649
before you send it because that'll

499
00:29:07,058 --> 00:29:11,200
really help you catch things that are

500
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:14,019
outside of the principle area

501
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:17,710
most people want things within one inch

502
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:19,690
margins on all sides and it'll just help

503
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:21,220
you catch typos and stuff so if you have

504
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:22,840
access to a printer definitely do at

505
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,000
least one final print before you're

506
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:27,308
emailing it out to a PI that you're

507
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,390
really interested in or submitting it to

508
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:34,808
a grad school application and one quick

509
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:37,960
fix for a lot of Microsoft Word issues

510
00:29:34,808 --> 00:29:39,849
is to save it as a PDF then print it and

511
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:45,069
then any formatting thing problems might

512
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:48,279
come up so just a quick summary of what

513
00:29:45,069 --> 00:29:50,409
we've been talking to you about we want

514
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:53,259
you to align your experiences and skills

515
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:54,640
the lab that you're applying to as we've

516
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:55,990
sort of mentioned there's a couple

517
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,690
different stages at which you might

518
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:00,819
submit your CV either in an email to a

519
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:02,380
PI where you're describing what you're

520
00:30:00,819 --> 00:30:04,808
interested in and asking if they're

521
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:07,480
accepting applicants of graduate school

522
00:30:04,808 --> 00:30:10,599
or if their department is it can vary a

523
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,190
lot by institution then there's the

524
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:14,379
stage at which you submit it online

525
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:16,840
through the department in a more formal

526
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:19,120
process so you want to make sure that

527
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:19,740
you're tailoring your CV the length of

528
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:21,629
it and

529
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:25,620
what you're saying in it so what who

530
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:27,690
you're sending it to and when you want

531
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:29,849
to identify your strengths don't bury

532
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:32,250
them it's like really easy to do that

533
00:30:29,849 --> 00:30:35,308
so really emphasize them on your CV and

534
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:37,859
make sure they stick out and focus on

535
00:30:35,308 --> 00:30:41,099
clarity and ultimately the best thing

536
00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:43,589
that you can do is do more research look

537
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:45,449
for more research opportunities apply

538
00:30:43,589 --> 00:30:57,959
for grants for doing research and things

539
00:30:45,450 --> 00:31:01,049
like that about the two pages the more

540
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,690
concise is the better and more clear for

541
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:08,308
people but I will not kill myself is

542
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:11,039
like 22.5 yeah when I apply to schools

543
00:31:08,308 --> 00:31:13,950
my CV had like four page but you know

544
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:18,149
I've been like in a long journey before

545
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:20,580
HD so I would not kill myself but I I

546
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:23,790
know I will probably remove some of the

547
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:26,730
stuff I put there for application and at

548
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:28,529
this moment when I look back but I don't

549
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:31,110
kill yourself is like I have like a

550
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:34,109
little longer or is like one page it's

551
00:31:31,109 --> 00:31:37,049
okay yeah if it's less than two pages

552
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:38,969
also don't worry like that's fine and

553
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:40,678
especially like it depends on what point

554
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:46,049
you're at and where you're where you are

555
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:48,480
in your academic career so these are

556
00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:50,700
just a few resources will email this out

557
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,009
to you guys so but these are generally

558
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:56,549
like places where you can find out more

559
00:31:53,009 --> 00:32:00,179
about science careers and about how to

560
00:31:56,549 --> 00:32:03,480
you know sell yourself as a scientist

561
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:05,580
and just little things like that this

562
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:11,360
has been a production of Cornell

563
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:11,359
University on the web at cornell edu
