1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,369
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,370
University

3
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:12,230
but I our four project I'm not going to

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,480
talk a lot about this but what we do is

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:17,000
we're a publicly funded program actually

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,710
it is USDA funds but some of the money

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,179
comes into the university I work at

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,989
Rutgers University I'm actually a

9
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:25,879
Rutgers employee and then the money

10
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:27,980
comes in and we really develop

11
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:30,500
regulatory type of data to register

12
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,539
products for specialty crops and minor

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,030
uses we're really looking at those those

14
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:37,159
growers that industry doesn't find

15
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:40,579
registering products for them profitable

16
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:42,739
so then we do it for them so so that's a

17
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:45,079
word from my sponsor we've actually been

18
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,640
been doing this type of work for 50

19
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:48,829
years we're celebrating our 50 year

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,390
anniversary this year but what I really

21
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:53,689
want to talk about today is really AG

22
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:56,870
trade and talking with Brad I have a new

23
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:59,059
new name for what it is now I said free

24
00:00:56,869 --> 00:01:01,250
trade is it really Freight free trade

25
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,960
but it's really a technical barrier to

26
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:06,799
trade and I'll talk about pesticide

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,140
residues and whatnot in in the in the

28
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,420
coming slides but I really want to just

29
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,210
give you an idea of what trade looks

30
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,280
like egg egg trade and where it's been

31
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:17,658
and really what's the most exciting is

32
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,590
what's really happened in the last five

33
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:23,090
five this really since well 2008 things

34
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,799
kind of dropped a little bit but it's

35
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,680
just been on a rapid growth since then

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,530
and you can see from 2010 it was a

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,780
hundred and fifteen billion dollar US

38
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,579
exports going out to other countries and

39
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,710
then it increased to one hundred forty

40
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:40,368
one thousand one hundred and forty 1

41
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:42,019
billion in just those two years so you

42
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:44,209
can really see the rapid amount of

43
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:46,548
increase that we've had and and I think

44
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:50,349
in many of the AG industries we can see

45
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:52,700
what we can see those increases as well

46
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:55,099
Canada and Mexico has always been the

47
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,890
u.s. major AG trade partner and we've

48
00:01:55,099 --> 00:02:00,319
always run with the surplus in our trade

49
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:02,719
to Canada but we have Canada here the

50
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:05,750
red line Mexico again we had a little

51
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,670
drop in 2008 many of the markets but

52
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,979
then it's been a steady increase with

53
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,378
Canada Mexico but the one to really look

54
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:14,120
at it is really a China and the way that

55
00:02:12,378 --> 00:02:16,878
it's just been a steady increase from

56
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:20,009
about 7 billion up to over 25 billion

57
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:22,419
dollars of AG commodities going to

58
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:24,639
the II use a little bit more of a mature

59
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:26,169
market so it hasn't really changed too

60
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,659
much and there's been a number of

61
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:30,489
legislative and other policies that have

62
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:32,079
been in effect that I think is probably

63
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,890
precluded some of the growth in that

64
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,710
area too

65
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:37,209
I put India on here just to see you know

66
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,430
we have another country there with over

67
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,900
a billion people in it is that a market

68
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,920
that's still out there that's waiting to

69
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:47,819
be exercised them and see if we can

70
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:50,829
increase our exports to India as well

71
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:52,409
just looking at it by commodities I'm

72
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:56,290
looking at China

73
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:58,960
here's soybeans almost 15 billion

74
00:02:56,289 --> 00:03:00,519
dollars of that 25 plus billion going to

75
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,750
China that soy beans going over there

76
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:09,280
then soybeans in our other Canada Mexico

77
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:11,159
and the EU you can see there's there's

78
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,780
several billion dollars there as well

79
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:16,870
when I get to the next commodities you

80
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:19,060
can see that it's a the value isn't

81
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,890
nearly as high but if we look at fresh

82
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,430
vegetables going to Canada that's our

83
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:25,959
primary market so the lettuce onions you

84
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,550
know a lot of the fresh vegetables that

85
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:32,560
we export a lot of those are really

86
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:37,530
going to Canada then we look at pulses

87
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,849
beans peas dry beans dry peas Mexico's

88
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:45,280
probably one of our largest markets

89
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:47,379
there but but then the EU is also

90
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,360
significant amount of market there and

91
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:51,159
some of these commodities they actually

92
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,930
may be exported to the EU but then they

93
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:54,930
go to other countries as well from there

94
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:03,219
tree nuts the EU is our primary exporter

95
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:07,770
for tree nuts 1.7 billion dollars going

96
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:07,770
there and then other markets as well a

97
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,400
lot of the products this this is

98
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:17,889
actually from 2001 to 2003 but this is

99
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,530
this is the percent of crop growing that

100
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:23,289
is going out to the other markets out

101
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:25,329
for export so you can see like the

102
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:28,600
almonds in cotton you know it's almost

103
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:32,409
70 percent of the commodities being

104
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,950
export of grapes almost 60 percent

105
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:38,880
soybeans pulses apples probably citrus

106
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:41,800
pears I put these on here this was 2001

107
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,959
2003 but I think most all of the AG

108
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,759
expansions not been domestic it's hoping

109
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:47,979
though in export markets so I think

110
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,649
really even though this is from 2001

111
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:53,560
2003 probably these commodities that

112
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:55,719
have far exceeded this this twenty to

113
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,459
thirty percent of the market going to

114
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,810
export it's probably closer to fifty

115
00:04:57,459 --> 00:05:07,569
percent now and then again this this is

116
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:09,250
from 2005 exports for about sixty two

117
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:11,889
billion I mentioned earlier what we're

118
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:14,439
over 140 billion now but how does that

119
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:17,169
impact the the work environment and

120
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:19,870
contributing to other economic activity

121
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:22,360
so US agricultural exports that support

122
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,579
additional services so when we're

123
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,230
shipping things international you have

124
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:28,810
the truck drivers that are taking it to

125
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:32,770
the ports you have other commodities

126
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:34,810
potatoes gets chipped french fries so

127
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:37,990
supporting all the other business

128
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,879
activity more than doubles the economic

129
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,879
impact that you have from these export

130
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:43,839
commodities so it's a pretty good story

131
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,439
there on what's happening

132
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:49,209
internationally but what i really want

133
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,160
to talk about is you have past you had a

134
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:52,930
control past you have to maintain a high

135
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,120
quality product when you're going to be

136
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:58,319
exporting these commodities and past

137
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,319
really influence that

138
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:07,539
so the pesticides currently are really a

139
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,370
reality for these these large volumes of

140
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,100
commodities that were producing and

141
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,019
exporting and I've borrowed a lot of

142
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,640
slides throughout my presentations from

143
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:17,919
the foreign AG service from different

144
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,539
grower groups so this was a comment that

145
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,370
was provided by the California citrus

146
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,770
Quality Council at a meeting that I was

147
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,230
at and they feel that the pesticides I

148
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:30,009
really they need those technologies to

149
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:31,780
control plant diseases and insects they

150
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:34,949
really have to have it to maintain a

151
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:38,709
high level of phytosanitary demands and

152
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:40,509
and then growers large and small depend

153
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:43,029
on pesticides to control plant disease

154
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:46,509
insects and I had it weeds here to

155
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:48,729
arrive and I couldn't that go so and

156
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:49,810
then also the the pesticides and I'm

157
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,400
going to talk about some of the

158
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,589
pesticides that are really more

159
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:55,870
important to the IPM programs a lot of

160
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:57,939
the newer ones that actually work into

161
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,689
IPM programs more so than the older

162
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:04,779
products but I'm going to talk to those

163
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:07,689
in a few slides but they'll continue to

164
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:11,289
play a key role in the IPM programs as

165
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:15,399
well so this technical trade barrier

166
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:17,710
this thing that may cause problems with

167
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:20,500
our so-called free trade it's the

168
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:22,389
maximum pesticide residue levels and

169
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,418
that's really what a legally allowable

170
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:28,180
amount is is allowed on food and feed

171
00:07:25,418 --> 00:07:30,399
stuff and that that's what results on

172
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:33,189
the commodity after it's been used

173
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,620
according to a good good agricultural

174
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:37,719
practice or according to the pesticide

175
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,060
label so sometimes you have some of

176
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:43,380
these residues from the pesticide that

177
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,379
persist on the commodity

178
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:49,949
and then for import tolerances the

179
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:52,738
import tolerances and mrl it's that set

180
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:59,879
on the basis of the form registered good

181
00:07:52,738 --> 00:08:03,178
agricultural practice and then just some

182
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:06,149
other considerations again to maintain a

183
00:08:03,178 --> 00:08:09,928
high level of productivity of the

184
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:12,959
growing world population the food

185
00:08:09,928 --> 00:08:16,768
exports and imports will obviously

186
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:18,088
continue to rise and now the growers

187
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:21,059
especially here in the United States

188
00:08:18,088 --> 00:08:26,278
really a growth to support a global

189
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:28,559
market and as we all know we all like to

190
00:08:26,278 --> 00:08:34,318
have fresh fruits and vegetables when we

191
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:36,870
go to the supermarket so again this is

192
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:39,318
from the citrus growers but the growers

193
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,310
really don't don't grow a commodity

194
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:42,688
they're not really sure where that

195
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:45,838
commodity is gonna go when they're

196
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:48,448
growing it in the field so they don't

197
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,069
really manage their production for a

198
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:52,919
specific market that they're going to

199
00:08:50,068 --> 00:08:56,128
and then even the processors will mix

200
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:58,259
lots and and mingle things together if

201
00:08:56,129 --> 00:09:00,420
there's no mrl in any of the markets

202
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:04,289
that they're going to then generally the

203
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:06,568
pesticide isn't used so and you can see

204
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:13,409
for citrus some of the major markets

205
00:09:06,568 --> 00:09:15,659
that they're shipping to here the food

206
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:19,078
quality Protection Act was was passed in

207
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:21,990
1996 and it really changed the paradigm

208
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:24,508
of products that we use when we grow our

209
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:26,759
crops now it's so reduce risk products

210
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:29,159
that's probably ninety to ninety percent

211
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,659
of the markets that are that are 90

212
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:33,958
percent of the products that are on the

213
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:36,980
market are reduce risk products many of

214
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:40,558
the organophosphate insecticides and

215
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:42,360
other classes of insecticides have

216
00:09:40,558 --> 00:09:44,818
either been removed from the market or

217
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,409
they've been significantly restricted in

218
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:50,188
the amount of use that they come in to

219
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:51,899
eat that can be used and many of these

220
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:56,129
uses have been replaced by safer

221
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:57,610
products and one thing to mention is as

222
00:09:56,129 --> 00:10:00,789
a result of the the

223
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:02,740
food quality Protection Act it actually

224
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:05,110
required a more comprehensive risk

225
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:08,680
assessment of each of the products and

226
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:10,419
in that risk assessment process they

227
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:12,759
actually determined it wasn't really the

228
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:15,699
commodities that were the issue but in

229
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:17,799
most cases it was the applicator so most

230
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,600
of those insecticides were removed from

231
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:22,449
the market because of the applicator

232
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:27,519
exposure and they were exceeding the

233
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:29,410
safe levels for the applicators and also

234
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:33,820
finally uh many of the new products are

235
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:36,519
really more IPM compatible oops the more

236
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,350
IPM compatible because they don't impact

237
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:42,009
the beneficials to the level that the

238
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:46,389
older products did they can be used in

239
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:47,980
more specific sites of action this this

240
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:49,809
was a slide that was given to me from

241
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,490
the Northwest Council and they

242
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:53,169
just kind of went through what were the

243
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,440
products they use in nineteen ninety

244
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:59,159
nineteen eighty three to control

245
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,399
coddling moth A's and foster methyl

246
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,958
Bosman

247
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,190
I don't even know what this one is

248
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:08,768
fossil owned methyl parathion I mean we

249
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:12,339
all knew methyl parathion was bad in 83

250
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:14,649
I was still being used in 98 but now now

251
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:16,660
really the only organophosphates foz met

252
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:18,909
and many of these other ones are

253
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:21,578
considered reduced risk products

254
00:11:18,909 --> 00:11:24,639
especially the chlorine Tran 'april and

255
00:11:21,578 --> 00:11:26,769
the methoxy femicide but these work on

256
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,259
very specific sites of action on the

257
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,669
insects you could continue to use a lot

258
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:33,039
of them you're going to get resistance

259
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:35,289
so the toolbox has to be bigger so you

260
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:38,370
can rotate your chemistry's and prevent

261
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:38,370
resistance as well

262
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:48,840
yeah I have another slide coming up and

263
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,299
I'll talk about that a little more but

264
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,009
really when you talk about risk you're

265
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:56,669
talking about the hazard and the

266
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:58,740
exposure so when you talk about reduce

267
00:11:56,669 --> 00:12:01,439
risk products you mostly focus on the

268
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,990
hazard part of the equation the exposure

269
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,960
may be equal to or greater on the

270
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:09,570
reduced risk products you know the

271
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,490
exposure may be equal to or greater on

272
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:14,580
these because you don't many of these

273
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:16,019
you don't need a applicator protection

274
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,050
equipment when you're making the

275
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:21,779
applications because they are the level

276
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:23,099
of hazard is so low that they don't they

277
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:25,079
don't have to be concerned about it

278
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,210
obviously if they're applying FA's net

279
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,889
they're gonna have you know the overalls

280
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:31,200
on they're going to have a mask on

281
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:33,240
but with a lot of these other compounds

282
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,650
really probably all you need is like

283
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,759
rubber gloves and maybe so a splash

284
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:40,590
apron or something like that

285
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,850
so but we're really with the reduced

286
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:45,540
risk we're really talking about the

287
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:47,009
hazard part of the risk equation and I'm

288
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:49,949
sorry I have a little bit of a cold

289
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:54,689
right now some sound a little rougher

290
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:56,759
than I normally do so IPM again I think

291
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,830
we talked about a lot of that but how

292
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:00,990
these new products really fit into IPM

293
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:03,330
programs and one actually that was

294
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:06,779
submitted to the agency really just

295
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:09,420
about a year ago is actually even safe

296
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:11,610
to the pollinators so it's safe to bees

297
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:13,500
and other pollinators as well so you can

298
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:16,440
see this transition from the Opie's

299
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,299
reduce risk and these products that are

300
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,800
moving into it but the problem that

301
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:22,079
we're having is we've registered these

302
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,370
products for the growers in the US but

303
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,840
some of the other countries don't

304
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,730
recognize those products they've never

305
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,649
seen them they've never seen the tox

306
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,870
packages that were used to support them

307
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:33,539
so when we're exporting our commodities

308
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,220
abroad then they say well I don't know

309
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:37,829
if the residues from this compound are

310
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:40,529
safe or not so that's really what I'm

311
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:42,120
going to focus my talk on today and the

312
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:45,000
growers don't always know where their

313
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,039
commodities are going a globalization

314
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,580
could preclude the use of a new pest

315
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:52,319
control product a new a new pest control

316
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,889
product that may be very valuable to an

317
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,609
IPM

318
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:58,528
Oh Graham as well and the use of any

319
00:13:56,609 --> 00:14:00,778
pesticide and actually what I've seen is

320
00:13:58,528 --> 00:14:02,458
even some of these newer products were

321
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:05,159
actually seeing probably a little bit

322
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:06,748
higher residues from the pesticide they

323
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:09,028
got very short treatment the harvest

324
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:11,489
interval and some of them actually stay

325
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:13,409
stay active in the plant for a longer

326
00:14:11,489 --> 00:14:15,059
period of time too so we're actually

327
00:14:13,409 --> 00:14:17,428
seeing probably a little more residues

328
00:14:15,058 --> 00:14:18,899
present in the plant than we did it like

329
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:20,909
with the pyrethroids or the

330
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:23,068
organophosphates because a lot of those

331
00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:24,719
are just kind of you go on you make your

332
00:14:23,068 --> 00:14:26,789
application and then the compound would

333
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,230
break down fairly quickly but the newer

334
00:14:26,789 --> 00:14:31,368
products don't break down quite as

335
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,369
quickly but they're a lot safer

336
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:44,009
all right so major market export flow

337
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:47,250
you know we I talked about the trade

338
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:49,259
within the US Mexico Canada we have a

339
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:51,149
lot of trade going going back and forth

340
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:54,779
there but then we have trade to Europe

341
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:58,740
we have trade to Asia Australia New

342
00:14:54,779 --> 00:15:01,769
Zealand South America trades with us

343
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,930
they bring the trade up to us but then

344
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:05,610
we even find that we have trade going we

345
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:07,469
may be shipping something out from one

346
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:10,080
place and then something else comes back

347
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:12,360
so it's very complicated now that the

348
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:16,080
trade paths and there's a lot of people

349
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,820
that are studying you know the the

350
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,610
citrus people for example what are our

351
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:23,220
major trade our markets that we're going

352
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:25,379
to the companies that develop some of

353
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:28,350
these products okay if I develop it

354
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:30,419
develop it for use on lettuce where do I

355
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:32,580
need to make sure that I have trade MRLs

356
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:35,789
established for those markets that our

357
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,770
growers are going to use and then just

358
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:39,029
some other considerations is it's not

359
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:42,029
necessarily even that you're going to

360
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:43,860
consume it but I mean from my discussion

361
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:45,750
with the cranberry growers they grow the

362
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,879
cranberries in Maine Massachusetts New

363
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,440
Jersey sometimes they'll just ship them

364
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:51,149
right across the border just to get them

365
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,560
juiced and then they want to bring them

366
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:54,629
back into the country but if there's a

367
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:57,389
pesticide residue on them they can't do

368
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:59,639
that because the Canada didn't recognize

369
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:02,580
that mrl that was was being used on it

370
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:05,850
in some cases in other cases it it may

371
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,770
be uh it may be okay to attack export it

372
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:09,659
to Canada and then grapes that we've

373
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:11,970
seen a similar thing even grapes coming

374
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:14,250
from Ontario into New York we've had

375
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:18,930
some issues with some pesticide residues

376
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:21,299
appearing on the commodities so the the

377
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:23,370
maximum residue limits the pesticide

378
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:25,969
residues can really preclude some of

379
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:29,279
these shipments and and really more

380
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:31,139
efficient and and more use of the

381
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,120
resources that are available to the

382
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:38,279
growers like the juicing plants and

383
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,690
whatnot so my friend from the Northwest

384
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:42,059
Council he said why do you always

385
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,490
use apples and you know that's like the

386
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:46,589
commodity that we've decided to use but

387
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:49,690
you know in the u.s. we may have a use

388
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:51,639
pattern and it results

389
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:55,630
in in a five part per million residue

390
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:57,639
level on the apples and then you have in

391
00:16:55,629 --> 00:17:00,399
Canada well maybe they don't need so

392
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:02,889
much so they have a lower mrl on the

393
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,359
apples in Canada and then you have you

394
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:06,940
go around the world there's different

395
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:10,149
use patterns you know maybe summer use

396
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:11,380
pre bloom post bloom so depending on

397
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:14,470
where you are in the world you may have

398
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:18,490
a different pesticide residue limit on

399
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:19,930
that commodity so you can imagine when

400
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:23,319
you're trying to trade your apples in

401
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:25,480
the US that were treated and and they

402
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:26,980
could result in a and five parts per

403
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,509
million and you're trying to export to

404
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:34,289
other parts of the kind of issues that

405
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:38,250
you can run into so in the ideal world

406
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:40,869
then everybody would have the same RL so

407
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:45,339
that's kind of where we want to get with

408
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:47,289
the harmonization so I'm going to kind

409
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:49,959
of switch gears a little bit just talk

410
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:51,609
about registration and how pesticides

411
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,930
are regulated for a few minutes and then

412
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:55,629
I'm going to come back to some of some

413
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:58,330
of the other trade issues but in the

414
00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:00,460
u.s. really EPA is the only body that

415
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:04,000
really regulates pesticides it's it's

416
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:06,759
regulated under the federal insecticide

417
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,200
fungicide rodenticide Act and there's

418
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:09,490
just been a number of amendments that

419
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,920
have been made from from year-to-year

420
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:16,150
the food quality Protection Act actually

421
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:19,300
made amendments to the the FIFRA Act and

422
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:21,280
then in the in the North American

423
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:24,339
countries we have PMR a pest management

424
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:27,039
regulatory anat agency that regulates

425
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:28,659
pesticides in Canada and then Mexico

426
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,159
it's a little similar to what we used to

427
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,600
do here in some of the other countries

428
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,580
do it as well they have they have like a

429
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,259
Health Department and they have an Ag

430
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:39,309
Department and then they work together

431
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:41,049
to regulate the pesticides and then

432
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:45,519
globally we have the EU the European

433
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:47,200
Commission Korea China and I think

434
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:48,879
probably what we'd like to see is that

435
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,860
all of these countries work under the

436
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:55,030
Codex standards Codex is an author

437
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:57,099
marius kind of a global standard that's

438
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:59,879
recognized in some countries but not all

439
00:18:57,099 --> 00:19:04,139
countries as a standard for pests

440
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:06,870
residue limits and then the organization

441
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,600
of Economic Cooperation and Development

442
00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:12,569
they don't really set standards but they

443
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:17,759
provide a guidance documents to the

444
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:19,409
member countries that work with them so

445
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:22,379
in in the US when you're going to submit

446
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,759
a pesticide you have to generate data in

447
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,289
all these different areas this is a

448
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,440
conventional product I'm going to talk

449
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:30,750
about bio pesticides and microbials in a

450
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,460
few minutes but yet that you have to

451
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:35,339
generate data in all these different

452
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:42,048
areas before you can get your product

453
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:45,089
registered in the US so you have your

454
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:47,480
your product properties fate transport

455
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:50,009

458
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:57,538
are all your cancer studies that you're

459
00:19:54,659 --> 00:20:00,840
doing with various tests test animals

460
00:19:57,538 --> 00:20:02,339
that's actually going through changes

461
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:04,980
now we're at where they're gonna they

462
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:07,259
call it century 21 talks and they're

463
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:10,589
going to be doing more in vitro testing

464
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:13,349
instead of animal testing occupational

465
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:15,928
resident to exposure these all these

466
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:18,449
studies actually could cost probably up

467
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:20,100
to from when a company decides to

468
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,630
develop a product and they're going to

469
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:23,158
take it to the registration it's about

470
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:25,470
two hundred fifty million dollars worth

471
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:27,390
of studies that they invest and then

472
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:30,690
some of the the more recent studies that

473
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:32,190
they were required but most people use

474
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,048
waivers in the past but now they

475
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,759
actually have to generate data but

476
00:20:34,048 --> 00:20:38,119
developmental neural talks and immuno

477
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:38,119
talks

478
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:45,808
and then for some of our other areas

479
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:49,019
like the microbial pesticides bio

480
00:20:45,808 --> 00:20:51,149
chemicals for the the conventional

481
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:53,548
products there's three divisions in EPA

482
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:55,440
that that review the data that comes in

483
00:20:53,548 --> 00:20:56,900
form for these products are they're

484
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,820
independent

485
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:02,610
divisions that that cover themselves for

486
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:04,259
the bio chemicals no in most cases

487
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:06,779
you're going to get an exemption from an

488
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:08,970
mrl exemption from a tolerance but the

489
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:11,220
division still has to review what we

490
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:13,230
call a 6-pack of talks data just to make

491
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,390
sure that there's no toxology code

492
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,099
with those biologicals and then

493
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:20,190
microbials that's more of your your

494
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:22,048
counter cleaners and items like that and

495
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,169
and again they don't have to go through

496
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:27,210
the extent of environmental fate and

497
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:30,150
type of studies there but they do have

498
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:34,919
to do up more performance testing for

499
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:36,509
the mic microbial pesticides so I talked

500
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:38,580
about this already we got a risk

501
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:39,808
equation in this this is the global

502
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:42,449
definition of risk

503
00:21:39,808 --> 00:21:45,210
it's hazard times exposure equals your

504
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:47,340
risk the hazards identified through all

505
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:50,069
those toxicity studies that I mentioned

506
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:52,139
and then exposure you have some studies

507
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:55,349
that you conduct but a lot of it's also

508
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:59,220
modeling and when your model obviously

509
00:21:55,349 --> 00:22:00,629
you can you can do various aspects of

510
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,220
the modeling and I'm going to talk about

511
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,679
some of the refinements that you can do

512
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,298
with some of this modeling but and then

513
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,669
as I mentioned earlier to the reduce

514
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:11,609
risk products are really lower hazard

515
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:13,590
products and some of the products that

516
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:16,589
are actually being registered now they

517
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:18,029
can't seem to find any tox endpoints not

518
00:22:16,589 --> 00:22:24,379
all of them but but there's some of them

519
00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:26,730
that they really so and then fqp a

520
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:31,679
really all these items were looked at

521
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:34,079
separately before fqp a but now it's all

522
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:37,350
put in to the same risk up under that

523
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:39,089
active ingredient so if you're using

524
00:22:37,349 --> 00:22:40,949
something on your pet and you're

525
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:42,329
consuming peas and it's treated with the

526
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:44,308
same thing that's all part of the risk

527
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:46,769
assessment if you're using it around

528
00:22:44,308 --> 00:22:48,418
your house for termite control but then

529
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:50,339
you got a grower that's using it it's

530
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:51,809
still considered in the risk of all

531
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:53,069
these items used to be looked at

532
00:22:51,808 --> 00:22:58,798
separately but now they're looked at

533
00:22:53,069 --> 00:23:01,019
together on their F qpa so the maximum

534
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:02,400
residue limits the use for enforcement

535
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:04,740
to make sure that there's proper

536
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,660
application that's what it's at the

537
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,950
local level they're looking at okay if

538
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,660
you're exceeding your tolerance you're

539
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,340
not probably you're probably not using

540
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,440
the product according to the label that

541
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:15,418
was out there so they'll use it for

542
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,400
enforcement then it's also used for

543
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:19,590
standards for commodities and trade and

544
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,259
that's also domestically as well as

545
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:24,678
internationally so if somebody's

546
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:26,129
shipping something across state lines

547
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:28,019
California I think

548
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:30,419
they probably have a monitoring program

549
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:32,339
to make sure that the the pesticide

550
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:36,538
residue limits are underneath those

551
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:38,970
standards that were set the MEK the

552
00:23:36,538 --> 00:23:40,919
maximum residue limit is only set if the

553
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:43,710
dietary exposure risk assessment

554
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,570
confirms that there's no no human health

555
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:47,940
concerns to any segment of the

556
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:49,798
population obviously kids are the

557
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,350
biggest segment probably that were the

558
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:55,410
most concern about maybe women of the

559
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:57,119
childbearing age is the next segment of

560
00:23:55,410 --> 00:24:01,080
the population now that we're concerned

561
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:02,908
about so the EPA as well as any

562
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:06,689
regulatory agency they will not set an

563
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:08,520
mrl unless there's no human health

564
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:12,870
concerns to any segment of the

565
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:14,700
population and then we also have every

566
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:17,038
country has or is developing their own

567
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,080
regulatory system some of them are

568
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,970
independent like the EPA is independent

569
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:23,788
and then some of them actually default

570
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:25,769
the Codex as a standard but one of the

571
00:24:23,788 --> 00:24:27,179
problems is with commodities and trade

572
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:32,609
is that not all countries recognize

573
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:35,309
codex at the global standard so talking

574
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:38,428
about risk again we have our risk

575
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:41,308
endpoint and what I want to mention here

576
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:44,190
is that the noah noel level is a no

577
00:24:41,308 --> 00:24:48,359
observable effect level so when you do

578
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:50,490
your your your tox testing so you have

579
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:52,798
different levels that you're testing so

580
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:54,569
most of the reduced risk products and

581
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:56,519
the newer products are really a no

582
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:58,558
observable effect level some of the

583
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:00,839
older products there is a lowest level

584
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:04,769
of observable effect and depending on

585
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:06,689
where you ran your studies you could

586
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:08,400
either have you know if you're below

587
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:10,830
that level you probably would never seen

588
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,230
anything in the studies in the first

589
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:15,869
place and then and then from that level

590
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:19,079
you're no observable effect level then

591
00:25:15,869 --> 00:25:21,918
they automatically add a 10x interest

592
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:25,470
species and another 10x interspecies

593
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:28,440
safety factor and with FQ PA they also

594
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:30,808
added another 10x for kids so you have

595
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:34,590
your 10x you know from humans and dogs

596
00:25:30,808 --> 00:25:37,158
and then another 10x from within humans

597
00:25:34,589 --> 00:25:40,158
so Robin and I we may have different

598
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:42,349
our genetic profiles so they want to add

599
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,629
another 10x safety factor and then four

600
00:25:42,348 --> 00:25:47,028
kids add an art that's the risk endpoint

601
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:49,009
here that they're started from and then

602
00:25:47,028 --> 00:25:50,628
when they register a new product most of

603
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:53,659
the time they don't have any refinements

604
00:25:50,628 --> 00:25:56,478
so they're kind of way out here but but

605
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:58,549
if if the risk up seems to be filling up

606
00:25:56,479 --> 00:26:00,348
with no refinements then they may look

607
00:25:58,548 --> 00:26:03,108
at refinements such as percent of crop

608
00:26:00,348 --> 00:26:05,089
treated obviously not all the crop may

609
00:26:03,108 --> 00:26:07,878
be treated with the pesticide they look

610
00:26:05,089 --> 00:26:09,858
at the diet and then the Tier three

611
00:26:07,878 --> 00:26:12,469
they'll even take the market data that

612
00:26:09,858 --> 00:26:14,388
that's being generated by the USDA and

613
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:16,308
see what the values are that they're

614
00:26:14,388 --> 00:26:17,808
finding there when we do these residue

615
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:20,058
studies we're looking for what we call

616
00:26:17,808 --> 00:26:22,009
the worst case scenario so if there's

617
00:26:20,058 --> 00:26:23,839
three applications that that we think

618
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:26,058
the grower may need we'll put the three

619
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:28,398
applications on there if it's cucumbers

620
00:26:26,058 --> 00:26:31,190
it's an insecticide it's probably be a

621
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:33,378
one-day pH I so then we harvest that

622
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:35,749
sample as it's at the farm gate with the

623
00:26:33,378 --> 00:26:38,118
one-day pH I then it goes out to the

624
00:26:35,749 --> 00:26:39,470
market and but but for us when we do the

625
00:26:38,118 --> 00:26:43,999
regulatory work we're looking at really

626
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:45,710
what the farm gate value is so the

627
00:26:43,999 --> 00:26:47,379
registration process you know

628
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:50,269
Discovery's probably two to five years

629
00:26:47,378 --> 00:26:53,238
regulatory research three to five years

630
00:26:50,269 --> 00:26:55,220
and then EPA review two years so what's

631
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:56,869
being developed now is probably really

632
00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:01,848
not going to be available to growers for

633
00:26:56,868 --> 00:27:03,228
another ten years and that that's one of

634
00:27:01,848 --> 00:27:05,358
the issues we get when we have our

635
00:27:03,229 --> 00:27:07,519
workshops Robin because we have we had

636
00:27:05,358 --> 00:27:09,798
our workshop a week ago to set what our

637
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,989
priorities are and we're not doing a

638
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:13,729
discovery or even some of the long-term

639
00:27:11,989 --> 00:27:15,499
regulatory data we're just doing a

640
00:27:13,729 --> 00:27:18,499
residue study and then we're submitting

641
00:27:15,499 --> 00:27:23,210
it to EPA but our timelines about five

642
00:27:18,499 --> 00:27:25,308
years to registration and then you stack

643
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:27,858
on top of that you have the EPA review

644
00:27:25,308 --> 00:27:31,220
of the Canadian review EU review codex

645
00:27:27,858 --> 00:27:33,048
review you can just see that you know by

646
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,149
the time a commodity can actually use

647
00:27:33,048 --> 00:27:37,429
the product and tray can be quite long

648
00:27:35,148 --> 00:27:39,048
some of these there's a global joint

649
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:41,659
review process and some of these are

650
00:27:39,048 --> 00:27:42,950
done concurrently but then codex it

651
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:47,000
always does it after

652
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:50,090
reviews been approved so some of the

653
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:55,369
international cooperation in these areas

654
00:27:50,089 --> 00:27:58,069
oops you can see all the different

655
00:27:55,369 --> 00:28:03,668
regulatory agencies that are working on

656
00:27:58,069 --> 00:28:03,668
on harmonizing the mrl that are in trade

657
00:28:06,308 --> 00:28:11,000
so now just a comment about the global

658
00:28:09,138 --> 00:28:13,398
joint review process it's where several

659
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,169
national authorities work together to

660
00:28:13,398 --> 00:28:19,119
review an active ingredient at the same

661
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:21,620
time so they receive the same submission

662
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:23,959
they develop a joint schedule they

663
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:25,398
divide up the work and then at the

664
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,399
conclusion they make their own

665
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:30,709
regulatory decision which is independent

666
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:33,138
but what the hope is is that they end up

667
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:35,090
with similar endpoints and the MRLs are

668
00:28:33,138 --> 00:28:37,579
similar to so them meant ratings not

669
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:38,778
impacted so just there's a lot of

670
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:40,970
information on here but I really just

671
00:28:38,778 --> 00:28:44,589
want to focus on this chlorine Tran

672
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:46,788
'april product that was registered and

673
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:48,918
these are all the partners that

674
00:28:46,788 --> 00:28:51,619
participated in the global joint review

675
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:55,389
process so you can see the US reviewed

676
00:28:51,619 --> 00:28:55,388
the talks up toxicology studies

677
00:28:55,538 --> 00:29:01,638
Australia reviewed the residue chemistry

678
00:28:58,099 --> 00:29:04,250
the United Kingdom the Eco talk studies

679
00:29:01,638 --> 00:29:06,019
Ireland the environmental fate and then

680
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:08,298
Canada reviewed the product chemistry so

681
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:09,649
you can see where you know it's less

682
00:29:08,298 --> 00:29:13,970
redundant and you're using your

683
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:16,569
resources more wisely that way so in the

684
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:20,839
end the the compound was submitted in

685
00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:22,548
2007 registered for joint review in

686
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:25,699
their countries have participated in

687
00:29:22,548 --> 00:29:27,619
2008 and now it's registered in over 100

688
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,480
countries and the commodities that are

689
00:29:27,619 --> 00:29:30,678
treated with that product don't really

690
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,298
need to be concerned when they're in

691
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:36,679
trade channels if they're going to be

692
00:29:32,298 --> 00:29:38,480
detected as an issue and it's it's

693
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:41,899
really becoming a way of doing business

694
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,700
but the one thing I can mention is in

695
00:29:41,898 --> 00:29:46,579
the EU for example they had a

696
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:48,679
legislative change of two years ago and

697
00:29:46,579 --> 00:29:51,109
it made it very difficult for them to

698
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:52,759
participate in this process so now they

699
00:29:51,109 --> 00:29:54,109
they were kind of working along

700
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:55,730
everything was going fine they have a

701
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:56,929
legislative change then they got a

702
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:58,430
retool

703
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:05,240
and then decide how they can participate

704
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:06,860
in this this global process what but

705
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,819
what the hope is is with these joint

706
00:30:06,859 --> 00:30:10,519
reviews is that we can have a

707
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:13,849
harmonization of the tools harmonization

708
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:16,490
of the the data evaluation records that

709
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:19,459
are used in reviewing of products then

710
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:21,799
those submissions are all the same that

711
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:23,960
if you're in the u.s. if you're in the

712
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:27,980
EU your review is going to look the same

713
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:29,329
as any other country in the world so

714
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,039
then hopefully the process will be

715
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:33,049
something that builds on itself more

716
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:37,730
more countries will participate in it

717
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:39,859
more international organizations and and

718
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:41,720
the other thing we hope is that the

719
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:46,519
minor uses or special uses will be

720
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:48,950
dovetailed into those reviews as well so

721
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:52,400
the grower concerns diminishing reliance

722
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:54,769
on codex MRLs or reach or just the

723
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:58,970
refusal to use codex as an international

724
00:30:54,769 --> 00:31:01,849
standard that's a that's a problem for

725
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:04,250
the growers there's a growing backlog of

726
00:31:01,849 --> 00:31:06,500
reviews at codex so we already have the

727
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:08,299
new products registered in the US but

728
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,670
we're still waiting for codex to review

729
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:13,009
it so then we can export to those

730
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:15,560
countries that that respect the Codex

731
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:20,049
standard and then there's a

732
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:24,049
proliferation of country-specific MRLs

733
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:26,750
and that's what we call a positive list

734
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:29,809
so japan has a positive positive list

735
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:32,720
Korea used to respect codex now they

736
00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:34,549
want their own positive list India used

737
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,490
to respect codex now they want their own

738
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:39,589
positive list if the product you use on

739
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:42,289
your commodity is on that positive list

740
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:43,639
you're okay but if the product you're

741
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:45,409
using is not on that list

742
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:49,490
then you're not going to be exporting to

743
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:50,960
that country and then the other thing

744
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,880
I'm going to talk about a little later

745
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,880
is just the secondary standards with the

746
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:59,210
food retailer MRLs and they're even

747
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:03,130
lower than the national standards or

748
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:03,130
pesticide use restrictions so

749
00:32:03,869 --> 00:32:09,189
so the main main challenges is a

750
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:10,960
continued loss of key key protection

751
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:14,289
products and this was actually something

752
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:18,910
I got from a grower in the UK they grow

753
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:21,220
salads green crops but what he indicated

754
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:22,660
is their loss of key protection products

755
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,329
what we saw here with the loss of the

756
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:27,700
organophosphates and then there's a more

757
00:32:25,329 --> 00:32:29,319
limited mechanism of action for the

758
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:32,519
products that they are using so there's

759
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:35,079
more pressure on resistance management

760
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:36,849
and then once you have resistance and

761
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:40,000
obviously you're losing your efficacy

762
00:32:36,849 --> 00:32:41,529
and then we're already seeing resistance

763
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,869
to the pyrethroids and other other

764
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:46,740
compounds so what they really need is

765
00:32:43,869 --> 00:32:51,209
effective control with minimum residues

766
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:51,210
to meet the demands of their customers

767
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:57,790
another grower reality growers need a

768
00:32:55,180 --> 00:33:00,160
wide variety of pesticide tools to

769
00:32:57,789 --> 00:33:02,559
control their pests but also to manage

770
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:05,380
resistance and and integrate with the

771
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:08,470
IPM programs and also the with the

772
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:11,590
greater demand on trade so in conclusion

773
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:14,019
it's really there's a scarcity of MRLs

774
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:18,119
that prevents trades and delays

775
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:18,119
transition to the newer safer products

776
00:33:21,369 --> 00:33:28,509
and listen this one's up this one also

777
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:30,880
focuses on on the secondary standard so

778
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:33,579
you have food retailers that set

779
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,620
arbitrary pesticide residue levels or

780
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:39,250
limit specific pesticides that can be

781
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:42,399
used to convince their consumers that

782
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:45,069
their food is safe but then the growers

783
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,810
are forced to manage residues there's no

784
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:48,759
late season uses because they're

785
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:50,740
managing pesticide residue limits

786
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:53,410
they're trying to mitigate the resset

787
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:55,809
residue levels and then then they have

788
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:58,810
lost the quality because poor insect

789
00:33:55,809 --> 00:34:01,629
control and less residue leads to

790
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:04,000
resistance as well and fewer pesticide

791
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:10,240
cause resistance and disrupts the IPM

792
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,199
program I think one thing I'd like to

793
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,869
add there too is uh

794
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:16,869
you know we developed these IPM programs

795
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:19,179
and then we have something like that the

796
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:21,819
brown marmorated stink bug that comes in

797
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:24,039
and the growers are basically throwing

798
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:26,530
anything they can at the the stink bug

799
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:28,750
and it completely destroys their IPM

800
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:34,360
programs it's almost almost like they

801
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:36,070
have to start over but these trade

802
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,530
standards also affect their organic

803
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:40,570
production as well we registered thymol

804
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:44,560
for use in beehives that control

805
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:45,760
tracheal mite and bee hives in the US

806
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:49,329
it's an exemption from the requirement

807
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:52,900
of Tolerance but in the EU it has it has

808
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:55,960
an actual mrl value so so we have an

809
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:59,309
issue because we don't regulate the the

810
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:05,380
residue level in the US but the EU does

811
00:34:59,309 --> 00:35:08,279
spinosa it has MRLs in the US it's

812
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:10,960
probably going to be regulated as a

813
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,990
conventional product internationally so

814
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:17,260
it'll be it will require MRLs but most

815
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:19,959
of the bile pesticides really they don't

816
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:22,020
have MRLs or they're what's called an

817
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:25,559
exemption from the requirement of

818
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:27,780
tolerance in the US but there's a lot of

819
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:30,179
variability for biopesticides across the

820
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:32,010
world on how they regulate them some of

821
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:34,649
them actually require certain levels

822
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:36,390
some of them like the u.s. they're

823
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:42,210
exempt from tolerance but but they do a

824
00:35:36,389 --> 00:35:44,549
safety finding on a secondary standards

825
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:46,889
is it's a way in which retailers try to

826
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:50,010
respond to their consumer needs and

827
00:35:46,889 --> 00:35:51,569
their expectations but they're not

828
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:54,450
really established following any

829
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:56,789
principles or guidelines that's actually

830
00:35:54,449 --> 00:35:59,819
used as a rule of trade between

831
00:35:56,789 --> 00:36:01,679
countries so it really kind of I say

832
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,809
ignore here but it really complicates

833
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:05,069
all of these other trade efforts that

834
00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:07,049
are going on because we you have

835
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:09,480
regulatory bodies working together

836
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:11,250
trying to harmonize trade and then you

837
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,990
throw another standard on top of that

838
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:17,489
and the growers just don't know what to

839
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:18,719
do I mean they can use a product that

840
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:20,759
they think it's going to be fine going

841
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:23,579
to the EU but then when it gets there if

842
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,590
the retailer's reject it it's a

843
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:27,539
commodity that's going to be lost so

844
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:32,160
it's not necessarily risk-based or

845
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:34,050
science based it really doesn't really

846
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:36,420
take into account special needs of

847
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:38,250
developing countries either and I say

848
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,579
that because a lot of these secondary

849
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:42,869
standard slides that I use was from a

850
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:45,929
colleague of mine that gave a

851
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:48,119
presentation on this but it's really a

852
00:36:45,929 --> 00:36:50,460
market strategy and they're really

853
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:52,349
arbitrarily setting the standards when I

854
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,690
talked about setting the MRLs earlier I

855
00:36:52,349 --> 00:36:56,610
talked that the MRLs are set on what the

856
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:59,760
use pattern is that the grower has and

857
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:02,070
then it's determined to be safe so if

858
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:08,090
the levels were higher or lower it would

859
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:11,100
still meet the safety finding so if if

860
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:13,680
if a secondary standard set and they say

861
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:16,650
well you know that mrl is 5 we're just

862
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:18,629
going to we want ours to be 2.5 well

863
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:20,309
it's not really set on science it sort

864
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:23,390
of just said on what they think their

865
00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:23,389
consumers want to hear

866
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:28,510
and then finally it can crowd out

867
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:31,769
smallholders it can be adding

868
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:35,260
unnecessary cost and also effects

869
00:37:31,769 --> 00:37:37,869
efficacy of the product and yield and

870
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:39,900
and for the growers it really doesn't

871
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:42,489
mean a better price either

872
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:46,510
so let me just close with a few closing

873
00:37:42,489 --> 00:37:48,609
thoughts global trade of Ag products

874
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:50,920
it's increased tremendously over the

875
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:53,079
past five years and that's in spite of

876
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,700
the economic factors and and maybe

877
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:57,130
that's kind of a look into the future

878
00:37:54,699 --> 00:38:00,699
where the global population is going it

879
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:03,280
continues to increase but this is really

880
00:38:00,699 --> 00:38:04,659
the bright bright spot of our economy is

881
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,630
really agriculture it's really kind of

882
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:09,399
an exciting place to be right now but

883
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:11,500
there's a lot of regulation of

884
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,329
pesticides not only at the local level

885
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,699
but the national and also international

886
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:18,719
levels and all that is really to ensure

887
00:38:15,699 --> 00:38:21,009
consumer safety from the get-go

888
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:23,739
pesticide residues do have a major

889
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:26,430
impact on trade and it really requires a

890
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:29,349
significant effort by the brokers

891
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:31,149
traders and the growers to manage to

892
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:33,489
make sure that that the trade continues

893
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:36,190
to expand and that that's one thing we

894
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:38,500
really want to see that that trade

895
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:40,750
continue to expand in the way that it

896
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:43,210
has been in the last five years and

897
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:46,030
growers are certainly impacted by the

898
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:49,619
the pesticide residue limits and how it

899
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:49,620
affects their pest control decisions

900
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:55,240
well what will some of the regulatory

901
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:57,459
cooperation agreements with Canada we

902
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:59,889
have a regulatory cooperation Council

903
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:02,019
that was signed by Prime Minister Harper

904
00:38:59,889 --> 00:39:03,849
and President Obama they want to remove

905
00:39:02,019 --> 00:39:08,949
some of the regulatory hurdles that

906
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:10,690
impact trade well will that increase our

907
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:13,719
trade and harmonization

908
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:17,230
EU is also considered another type of

909
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:20,259
regulatory trade agreement the Pacific

910
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:25,929
Rim countries there's also discussions

911
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:27,760
there about harmonizing some of the

912
00:39:25,929 --> 00:39:31,359
regulatory barriers that that impact

913
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,180
trade continued movement the

914
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,630
harmonizations required to support

915
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:37,759
expansions and should be

916
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:39,950
sitter as more countries are developing

917
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,110
new systems so instead of each company

918
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:43,960
reinventing the wheel we should all be

919
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:46,700
working together to make sure we're

920
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:49,610
really inventing the same wheel or using

921
00:39:46,699 --> 00:39:51,649
the same wheel and then I have to ask

922
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:53,390
what will the next paradigm shift be in

923
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:55,099
pesticides we see what the flu quality

924
00:39:53,389 --> 00:39:57,650
Protection Act did to the products that

925
00:39:55,099 --> 00:40:00,500
are being used now but can we get to a

926
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:02,720
point where where the MRLs may be no

927
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:05,329
longer required I talked about the bio

928
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:08,209
pesticides most of those are exempt from

929
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:09,829
Tolerance some of the conventional

930
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:12,889
products that EPA's reviewed they're

931
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:14,449
actually establishing exemption from

932
00:40:12,889 --> 00:40:17,089
tolerance on the products that they're

933
00:40:14,449 --> 00:40:18,739
registering internationally it's not

934
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:20,120
respected so we still have to generate

935
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:23,119
residue data if we're going to be

936
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:24,799
exporting commodities abroad so what I

937
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,409
hope is that we can get to a point where

938
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,450
we have some harmonization and the new

939
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:32,179
products that are developed really won't

940
00:40:29,449 --> 00:40:38,000
require these these trade barriers to

941
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:40,219
impact them so with that I thank you for

942
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,300
your attention and I'll take any

943
00:40:40,219 --> 00:40:43,299
questions or comments
