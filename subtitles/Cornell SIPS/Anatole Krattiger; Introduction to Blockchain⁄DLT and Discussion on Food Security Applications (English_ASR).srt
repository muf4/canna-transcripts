1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,940
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:08,939
University so it's a little bit of an

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:12,870
experimental lecture it's the first time

4
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:16,429
I'm talking about blockchain and food

5
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:20,519
security but it's something I started

6
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:24,390
working my way into about six eight

7
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:29,118
months ago and the more I looked into it

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:33,509
the more I got absolutely excited and

9
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:36,960
imagination got going what I want to do

10
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:39,659
in the next 41 minutes is with 75 slides

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,140
so bear with me is to provide you a

12
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:46,859
broad basic understanding of what

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,170
protein is and what it isn't get you

14
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:51,840
excited with lots of applications that

15
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,809
are growing up everywhere from all

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:59,329
directions and then end up with some

17
00:00:54,808 --> 00:01:03,448
fundamental questions I think that we

18
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:05,129
will need to we as a society but also I

19
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:09,239
think a scientists will need to think

20
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:11,790
about and grapple with so I want to

21
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:14,489
dispel some myths give you a few

22
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,990
essential elements that I think are

23
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:19,109
really important to understand

24
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:21,478
blockchain give you a plethora of

25
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:23,849
current applications I'll go through

26
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:25,759
very quickly including on on food

27
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:29,129
agriculture and so forth and

28
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,688
philanthropy and then as I said some

29
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:31,709
questions and hopefully we'll have a

30
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:35,429
good discussion

31
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:39,709
first of all five myths blockchain is

32
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:42,030
all about Bitcoin well know Bitcoin

33
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:44,789
you've heard about it price went up

34
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,820
price crash price goes up again

35
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:51,570
it's just one application but Bitcoin

36
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:55,379
when Bitcoin started it has been a

37
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:58,459
seismic shift in the way computers in

38
00:01:55,379 --> 00:02:01,408
fact can talk to each other and execute

39
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:03,530
programs and that's what makes this so

40
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,530
exciting

41
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,090
another method is Bitcoin use more

42
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:11,939
electricity than Denmark that may be not

43
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,500
necessarily a be a myth but the point is

44
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:16,340
it's not really a prop

45
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,930
because bitcoin is just the first

46
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,270
application and there are already so

47
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:24,240
many follow-on innovations that are

48
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,700
coming that radically changed a business

49
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,520
model and that loose use very very

50
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:32,909
little electricity or computing power

51
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:37,110
for the same transactions I'll give some

52
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:40,849
examples on that the value of

53
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:43,020
cryptocurrencies Bitcoin currency

54
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:45,389
encrypted in the blockchain is

55
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:48,810
fictitious it's imaginary it has no

56
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:52,549
relationship to reality well that may be

57
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:56,009
true but it's basically about the use of

58
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:58,230
these tokens and I'll come back later to

59
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:03,179
what their token and the crypto currency

60
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:06,599
is yes there is a certain truth to that

61
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:09,510
but there can also be a direct link with

62
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:11,669
a fiat currency that could be or there

63
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:15,889
could be a direct link with something

64
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:15,889
solid something real like your house

65
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:22,799
just on the value Amazon you wish you

66
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,830
had invested or your parents had

67
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,189
invested even ten dollars only or

68
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:31,950
hundred dollars and look where it is now

69
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:34,109
we often forget that many

70
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:37,259
companies that were completely changing

71
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:40,860
the paradigm look at the share price at

72
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:42,389
the dot-com bubble of Amazon well many

73
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,670
people lost complete confidence this is

74
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,500
not going to work this whole well same

75
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:49,139
with Bitcoin it's gone up it's come down

76
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,750
it's going up again it's absolutely

77
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:54,439
nothing unusual what we are seeing today

78
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,598
to what we are familiar with

79
00:03:54,439 --> 00:04:01,500
historically with any new paradigm

80
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:04,199
shifts in technologies Amazon as as an

81
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,060
example of that we also hear that

82
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:07,949
cryptocurrencies enabled criminal

83
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,729
activities money laundering and so forth

84
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:13,500
yes they can and yes they are safeguards

85
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:17,250
that are being implemented for

86
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,978
regulations but nothing unusual you can

87
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,949
take a suitcase of cash and pay somebody

88
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:26,339
to do something bad for you so it just

89
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:29,969
makes this easier on the blockchain but

90
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:33,079
in essence it's nothing unusual about a

91
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:36,630
tool that you can use for dual purposes

92
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:38,759
perhaps over time blockchain will be of

93
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:41,509
cryptocurrencies will be the least

94
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:46,168
likely wants to be used for criminal

95
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:48,389
activities but that's the subject that

96
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:53,069
would take us too far to go into why I

97
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:55,710
think that is then Satoshi Nakamoto you

98
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:58,110
may have heard of him he is or her or

99
00:04:55,709 --> 00:05:01,500
she or they are the ones who wrote a

100
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:04,020
white paper that became Bitcoin a white

101
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,300
paper is to describe the system it was

102
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:09,659
absolutely a watershed moment in this

103
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:13,740
area but whoever that person or persons

104
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,750
are we don't know who he is

105
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,418
stood on the shoulders of giants there

106
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,939
were many precursor technologies that

107
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:24,709
were essential to enable his

108
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:24,709
groundbreaking or her groundbreaking

109
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:31,050
invention of Bitcoin and of course

110
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:35,359
others as you see a theorem hash graph

111
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:40,020
are becoming almost as if not even more

112
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,158
game-changer than Bitcoin itself so what

113
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:43,049
is

114
00:05:41,158 --> 00:05:45,209
blockchain I'm using blockchain and

115
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:48,060
distributed ledger the

116
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:50,638
ecology sin synonymously they are not

117
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,780
quite necessarily the same they can be

118
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,848
but you hear distributed ledger or

119
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:59,698
blockchain for all practical purposes

120
00:05:56,848 --> 00:06:06,779
it's the same and it's all about

121
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:09,598
Ledger's this in fact ancient from Giza

122
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:13,079
from the Pyramid of Giza it's a list of

123
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:15,538
items you're familiar with your lab

124
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:17,728
notebooks that's in fact a ledger the

125
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:19,079
date what you did what came out of it

126
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:23,728
how you did it what do you think about

127
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:25,918
it it's a ledger your bank account a

128
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:27,180
ledger how much you have how much you

129
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:31,399
spend where it went

130
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:35,069
etc in fact it started with your life

131
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:38,279
when your mother gave birth the hospital

132
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:41,579
brought down in a ledger the day to time

133
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:44,008
the name the parents it's a ledger now

134
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:46,050
if you lose your birth certificate you

135
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:49,319
have a little problem in future this

136
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:53,490
will all be on the blockchain you can no

137
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:56,339
longer lose it so basically that's it

138
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,930
that's the protein it's a legend it's

139
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:02,848
just distributed on the Internet

140
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:04,530
sorry distributed across computers so

141
00:07:02,848 --> 00:07:08,129
we're familiar with the centralized

142
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:11,008
nature of the Internet you go shopping

143
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:14,430
on amazon.com to take the same example

144
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:15,930
you go to central Amazon server in the

145
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,180
cloud but still it's an Amazon own

146
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:20,430
server and transactions happen between

147
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,728
you and a third party and your credit

148
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,180
card

149
00:07:20,728 --> 00:07:27,000
well Amazon is really decentralized now

150
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:30,870
they have many service cloud service all

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,649
over but it's still owned by them what

152
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,959
is this

153
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:37,589
different with blockchain is distributed

154
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:41,789
so there's no more central authority

155
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:44,279
if one of them gets corrupted gets

156
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:47,189
infected is operated by a criminal gang

157
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:51,000
or is suddenly inoperative because the

158
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:54,300
country closes off firewall the system

159
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,730
is resilient and continues happily to

160
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:01,050
live thereafter up to a certain point

161
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:03,840
and that's the point and this is the

162
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:06,629
Byzantine generals problem this alone

163
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,359
would take an hours lecture but in a

164
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:12,779
nutshell what blockchain does it solves

165
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:16,580
this particular problem let's assume you

166
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:19,189
have in this case 2 4 6 8 10 11 generals

167
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:24,839
with their own armies surrounding

168
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:27,449
Byzantine city they can't communicate by

169
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,399
radio they're you know 3,000 years ago

170
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:32,129
that wasn't invented so they have to

171
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:34,799
send messengers to the others at what

172
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:35,849
time on what date will we attack and are

173
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:40,399
you in or not

174
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:43,440
do you agree and if everybody agrees on

175
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,139
that particular time and date they all

176
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:50,670
attack and they are bound to take over

177
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:55,909
the city if that's not the case if one

178
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:58,860
of them fails or lies or is a spy then

179
00:08:55,909 --> 00:09:01,980
if one general arm if one general or one

180
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,129
army doesn't make it they will all get

181
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:07,080
killed so how do you solve this problem

182
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:10,470
when all you can do is send a message to

183
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,300
others that says I'm going to attack do

184
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,580
you agree messenger comes back yes I

185
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:17,519
agree well you don't know if that

186
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,960
general has been in is lying what about

187
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:24,539
if that general sends a different

188
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:25,980
message to somebody else and that's one

189
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:32,009
of the big problems

190
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:36,170
in computers databases security since

191
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:41,338
the invention of the internet in fact

192
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:44,729
but blockchain or Bitcoin satoshi

193
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:50,459
nakamoto date solved this problem others

194
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:53,279
tried before with elements of it but the

195
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:55,729
real breakthrough was again Bitcoin and

196
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,980
its cryptographically solved

197
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:02,100
mathematically solved I will leave it at

198
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:05,940
that at the moment and the point that I

199
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:11,329
said earlier up to a point is if more

200
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:14,459
than 1/3 of the generals are spies then

201
00:10:11,328 --> 00:10:18,149
you're out of luck so there's a limit to

202
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:19,289
how many can be bad guys I mean if

203
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:21,569
you're not if you're in the city of

204
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:24,659
course the spy is a good guy but all

205
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:28,620
practical purposes if you want to attack

206
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:31,409
you can only do with 1/3 or less that

207
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:34,440
are bad guys otherwise the system really

208
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:37,129
doesn't work but that's a fairly

209
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,480
formidable threshold

210
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:41,279
especially when you have thousands or

211
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,610
hundreds of thousands of computers

212
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:48,629
around one blockchain then it becomes

213
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:52,680
pretty nearly impossible not completely

214
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:54,779
impossible but nearly so that's an

215
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:57,049
essential concept that has been solved

216
00:10:54,779 --> 00:11:00,088
you just have to take my word for it

217
00:10:57,049 --> 00:11:02,729
now another concept to understand is the

218
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:05,570
hash so you see these long strings of

219
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:09,389
numbers and letters that represent

220
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:11,820
underlying data and many of you in the

221
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:15,149
DNA sequencing you're familiar with how

222
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:17,579
do you compare DNA sequences while not

223
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:22,529
by comparing billions of pairs but by

224
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:28,649
using hash so a hash is a series of

225
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:36,019
letters numbers that represents a series

226
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:39,198
of DNA database in a CG TAC so

227
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:43,818
the example here is John Smith there is

228
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:47,479
a hash function and John Smith is 0 2 so

229
00:11:43,818 --> 00:11:52,548
0 2 represents John Smith but you can't

230
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:53,720
deduct from 0 from knowing 0 2 what that

231
00:11:52,548 --> 00:11:55,879
is John Smith

232
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:59,809
for that you need two cryptographic keys

233
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:01,579
and so they can never be a hash that is

234
00:11:59,808 --> 00:12:04,368
identical if there's another John Smith

235
00:12:01,578 --> 00:12:05,988
that John Smith because it's uploaded on

236
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:08,540
a different time different place gets a

237
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:11,809
different hash all that is embedded in

238
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:14,659
the function and so big stuff becomes

239
00:12:11,808 --> 00:12:17,238
much smaller and can be transmitted

240
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:28,879
through the internet very very fast in

241
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:31,519
nanoseconds please so there are several

242
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:34,369
ways of doing this with public and

243
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:38,919
private keys some of you may be familiar

244
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:40,999
with that if you have an RSA stake or so

245
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:43,458
but yes there's a direct function

246
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:46,399
because the 0 to cannot represent

247
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:48,409
anything else but John Smith but you

248
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:52,249
need the entire key the public in the

249
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:54,458
private to come back to that hence this

250
00:12:52,249 --> 00:13:00,740
is one layer of security which makes

251
00:12:54,458 --> 00:13:06,729
blockchain enormous Li hacker-proof

252
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:10,068
so far there have been no hacks of

253
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:11,839
exchanges yes but that's different to

254
00:13:10,068 --> 00:13:14,990
the blockchain itself having been acted

255
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:18,410
so there's no known hacking that has yet

256
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:22,428
occurred and not likely to occur in the

257
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:26,298
near future something else to understand

258
00:13:22,428 --> 00:13:29,149
very briefly is the consensus how do all

259
00:13:26,298 --> 00:13:32,870
these nodes all these computers come to

260
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:35,620
consensus think of it a following way

261
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:38,299
give birth to John Smith in the hospital

262
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,929
that gets into the ledger and then

263
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:45,289
distributed to all the computers and

264
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:47,059
that John Smith gets a hash how do all

265
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:49,879
the computers the thousands or hundreds

266
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:52,009
of thousands computers agree that this

267
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:56,019
is really the right hash for this John

268
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:58,549
Smith well either the computers do some

269
00:13:56,019 --> 00:14:00,500
proof of work a lot of computations

270
00:13:58,549 --> 00:14:03,949
mathematical computation hence our

271
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:07,309
consumption or there is a proof of stake

272
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:11,000
where if they have a certain stake in a

273
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:13,250
particular platform they are the ones

274
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,649
that solve it that solve certain

275
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:18,860
mathematical cryptographic problems and

276
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:21,439
then validate that yes this entry is the

277
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,690
right one and everybody didn't agrees

278
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,540
that this is a knows that this is the

279
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:30,770
only strong Smith born by these parents

280
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:33,079
in that hospital at that time because

281
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:35,149
when you have databases especially when

282
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,450
they are distributed you can't have one

283
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:39,949
that is slightly different to the other

284
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:43,040
those who you share point here Cornell

285
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:45,440
to upload your your data you sometimes

286
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,569
you have synchronization errors that's

287
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,850
really the issue here and again the

288
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,920
blockchain solves by making it

289
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:57,379
impossible that is an in synchronization

290
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:59,240
error next one is what I mentioned over

291
00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:01,759
lunch with the students there are two

292
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:05,740
types of block chains and I'm soon

293
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:08,958
ending with the key concepts one is

294
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:10,789
permissionless so you can use it you

295
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,609
don't need any accreditation you can buy

296
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:16,490
bitcoins trade with bitcoins doesn't

297
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:19,009
matter and there are lots of permission

298
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:21,200
ones where you need an account you need

299
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:23,838
to be accredited you need to be allowed

300
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:27,230
to use it you need to abide by the rules

301
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:31,070
and if not you're thrown out or pay

302
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:33,570
penalties and so forth so these two

303
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:35,879
systems are

304
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:40,520
both can exist he theorem is in fact

305
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:40,519
both depending on the application and

306
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:47,129
the state of the technology is maybe

307
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:50,430
early 90s mid-90s when the world wide

308
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:52,889
web just started many of you weren't

309
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:55,889
born by that time you have no idea how

310
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:57,509
life was before the internet we had to

311
00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:01,289
go to an actual library and look up

312
00:15:57,509 --> 00:16:05,929
cards and go and look for books to get

313
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:08,969
information so we are early in that

314
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:11,179
development and who knows what the

315
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:14,279
future holds and that's part of the

316
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:19,319
fascinating thing about it what the

317
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:24,659
future could hold the last concept is

318
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:27,470
smart contracts so smart contracts are

319
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:31,769
nothing else but an algorithm again a

320
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:36,029
what-if then function a computer program

321
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:40,139
that says if I sell you through a

322
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:42,120
blockchain a book you give me bitcoins

323
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:45,929
or whatever and let's say it's a

324
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:48,929
permissioned application where we both

325
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:51,659
are we may not know who you are

326
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:54,629
who each other is but we are on that

327
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:57,829
blockchain on that application and if

328
00:16:54,629 --> 00:17:00,330
you don't upload within and say 24 hours

329
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:02,850
proof of shipment of the book that I

330
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:06,930
bought or that I whichever way around

331
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:10,410
then the smart contract says oh he did

332
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:12,959
not upload on time therefore he is going

333
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:15,150
to refund twice the amount that he on

334
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,850
one plate that's a simple what if

335
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:22,130
function and so you can embed those

336
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:28,939
functions and dispute resolution

337
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:35,550
everything can be written in code that

338
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:36,360
accompanies certain transactions just

339
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:38,190
think of

340
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:40,349
buying a house how long does it take a

341
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,900
couple of months to put money in escrow

342
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:46,169
you get title search you get documents

343
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:48,809
certified by lawyers a mortgage pay down

344
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:50,700
this and that it takes ages and meetings

345
00:17:48,808 --> 00:17:54,329
and lots of money goes to lots of

346
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:56,850
middlemen and middle women sorry well

347
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:59,159
with blockchain and the first houses

348
00:17:56,849 --> 00:18:02,069
have been sold on a blockchain this is

349
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,350
automated it takes a couple of hours of

350
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:06,480
course somebody has to upload the title

351
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:08,730
and certify that the original title that

352
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,599
was uploaded on the blockchain is

353
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,319
authentic

354
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:14,730
so that first step needs to be done once

355
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,529
but if there's a lien on the house if

356
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:19,890
there's a mortgage if there's something

357
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:23,250
wrong with it it's all on the blockchain

358
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:25,620
can be verified by the buyer and if

359
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:28,789
something were wrong the smart contract

360
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:32,489
would then take care of some penalties

361
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:35,609
in whatever way that particular

362
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,960
blockchain has written the code so it

363
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:41,939
takes a couple of minutes or a couple of

364
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:45,720
hours and all is automatic obviously not

365
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:48,808
everybody likes this but Amazon wasn't

366
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:52,769
liked by bookstores and it changes the

367
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:57,240
world so it's not whether or not it's

368
00:18:52,769 --> 00:19:00,058
liked but how fast will new minds you

369
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,669
come up with new applications like

370
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:04,918
incline reading for example that may

371
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:08,220
make certain technologies that we know

372
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:10,259
today completely obsolete so a couple of

373
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:16,339
minutes a couple of seconds on summary

374
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:19,679
it's decentralized that's the key and

375
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:22,168
trusted so you don't need to trust a

376
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,620
particular computer or particular player

377
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:30,059
but you the system is the one that gives

378
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:31,949
trust you have trust in your credit card

379
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:34,139
bank bank today should your credit card

380
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:38,700
you put your money there you have trust

381
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:41,419
implicit well this is now done online

382
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:46,200
where this did not exist before

383
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:47,820
blockchain okay how does it work very

384
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,960
briefly you have a smartphone for

385
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:54,779
example you request a transaction it

386
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,789
goes into that cyberspace there with

387
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:59,279
these computers doing their number

388
00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:01,859
crunching they all come up with a

389
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,808
consensus remember different ways there

390
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:05,759
many different ways of consensus I only

391
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:08,460
gave to proof of state proof of work and

392
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:11,039
then in the end it's a proof transaction

393
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,529
it goes into the block and it's there

394
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:21,808
forever it can never ever be changed

395
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:25,230
again so it's tamper proof you can't

396
00:20:21,808 --> 00:20:28,079
later change and change forger document

397
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:29,610
and you get confirmation the other

398
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:31,678
person gets confirmation on their smart

399
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:35,549
phone within minutes or seconds

400
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:39,480
depending on the system you use very

401
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:42,299
last concept to briefly touch on is I

402
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:48,490
used words coins tokens and

403
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:50,200
cryptocurrencies so far it's actually

404
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,240
the difference but actually very very

405
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,929
difficult in practice because there's so

406
00:20:52,240 --> 00:21:02,980
much overlap of the two concepts coins

407
00:20:54,929 --> 00:21:08,440
or cryptocurrencies are money it's money

408
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:13,019
in the cyberspace that may or may not

409
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:17,230
relate to something real dollars or

410
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:20,319
houses and tokens tokens are more used

411
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:23,950
in permission chains for transactions

412
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:29,409
and most tokens have to be purchased

413
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:31,720
with coins I think in one minute that's

414
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:36,850
as good definition I can give off the

415
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:39,279
two for practical purposes think of the

416
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:44,019
coins more like money and the tokens

417
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:45,730
more like fudge double fungible ways of

418
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:46,179
transacting things your AIA airline

419
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,579
miles

420
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:50,350
it's fungible so you may get it token in

421
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:53,279
the future and you can use it for

422
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:59,169
airline miles or to buy flowers for your

423
00:21:53,279 --> 00:22:01,690
loved ones so where do we stand today I

424
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:03,580
said it's really early but we're already

425
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:06,480
in the version five probably of

426
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:12,639
blockchain depending on whom you agree

427
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:14,650
with whom you agree I think Bitcoin got

428
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,280
the whole financial industry FinTech

429
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:23,259
really going he theorem a twenty year

430
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:25,829
old guy started that with smart

431
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:29,470
contracts it's not the most ubiquitous

432
00:22:25,829 --> 00:22:33,329
way of doing rock chains the apps I

433
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:38,440
won't touch on it today it has now seen

434
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:40,808
early industrial use applications and lo

435
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:44,820
and behold new technologies I invented

436
00:22:40,808 --> 00:22:48,519
hash graph that may once again

437
00:22:44,819 --> 00:22:52,859
revolutionize I won't dwell into it but

438
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:57,339
I can strongly urge you to look at this

439
00:22:52,859 --> 00:23:00,539
description by the inventor of it it's

440
00:22:57,339 --> 00:23:00,539
an absolutely beautiful

441
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:05,819
new type of blockchain if you want

442
00:23:02,638 --> 00:23:08,008
Ashcraft it's not quite blockchain the

443
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:10,558
difference is Bitcoin you have a couple

444
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:14,990
of thousand transactions every five to

445
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:19,678
ten minutes with hash graph you can have

446
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:22,409
250,000 and more per second and then you

447
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,929
can layer them and have 500,000 1

448
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:28,259
million and million transaction per

449
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:31,309
second so think of these are processing

450
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:33,509
your credit card processing all of that

451
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:36,569
it's already being developed by hash

452
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:39,028
graph by swear all the company for visa

453
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:41,519
in order they have hundreds of thousands

454
00:23:39,028 --> 00:23:44,788
of transactions a second where this will

455
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:47,519
all eventually be done paperless on the

456
00:23:44,788 --> 00:23:49,648
blockchain the terminals in the shop you

457
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,240
won't even notice the difference you may

458
00:23:49,648 --> 00:23:54,508
want they just put your smartphone there

459
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:58,950
as you do with wallet pay Apple pay and

460
00:23:54,509 --> 00:24:03,480
it will all be done by a blockchain so

461
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:06,929
let's move on to current 23 minutes and

462
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:09,778
I might Wow one minute ahead of time not

463
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:12,090
bad so we'll get through this 75 slides

464
00:24:09,778 --> 00:24:15,179
don't worry because the next ones will

465
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:19,459
be very fast so these are the different

466
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:22,559
areas I'm going to cover very quickly

467
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,749
row on the left and then spend a bit

468
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:28,589
more time on the food production and

469
00:24:24,749 --> 00:24:31,889
food distribution so where can you buy

470
00:24:28,589 --> 00:24:34,648
stuff using crypto currencies of coins

471
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:37,969
or old coins old coins by the way are

472
00:24:34,648 --> 00:24:40,378
normally referring to not being Bitcoin

473
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:42,450
well these are just some examples and

474
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:46,829
there hundreds more you can buy pizza

475
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:48,749
you can buy beer you can buy a flight

476
00:24:46,829 --> 00:24:51,778
into space on Virgin Galactic the

477
00:24:48,749 --> 00:24:55,319
Bitcoin or crypto currencies and I will

478
00:24:51,778 --> 00:24:57,388
talk about open Bazaar in a minute but

479
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:59,368
the first one I want to show is whistle

480
00:24:57,388 --> 00:25:03,678
and I'm from Switzerland so you can

481
00:24:59,368 --> 00:25:06,928
already buy rail tickets using Bitcoin

482
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:10,019
the ID you see the ID here that's all

483
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:11,940
you need if your application you take

484
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:14,309
the photograph like a barcode just the

485
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,799
ID and you buy your train

486
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:21,779
take it with Bitcoin and that already

487
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:26,720
exists since 2016 so we are quite ahead

488
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:29,940
of time actually I find this pretty neat

489
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:33,200
open Bazaar was on my list open Bazaar

490
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:35,549
is something a permission block chain I

491
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,850
won't say this anymore because most of

492
00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:40,529
the implications are you set up an

493
00:25:38,849 --> 00:25:44,849
account you get accredited you buy

494
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:47,430
tokens and I now sell my book on open

495
00:25:44,849 --> 00:25:51,029
Bazaar somebody on the other side of the

496
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:53,940
world can buy them no transaction fees

497
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:56,119
with foreign currencies nothing in the

498
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:59,250
way I described earlier with the book

499
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:02,549
there is a way of doing that seamlessly

500
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:05,229
this could potentially disrupt Amazon's

501
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:08,210
business model

502
00:26:05,229 --> 00:26:10,519
Amazon when I sell a book on Amazon and

503
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:12,288
I'm selling some an on through a

504
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:14,929
non-profit they take forty five percent

505
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:18,288
of the sale price and if your company

506
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:24,048
takes fifty five percent well here it'd

507
00:26:18,288 --> 00:26:26,298
be a fraction of that I think the

508
00:26:24,048 --> 00:26:28,009
biggest applications today industrial

509
00:26:26,298 --> 00:26:30,710
scale is in the supply chain supply

510
00:26:28,009 --> 00:26:33,009
chain management that are enormous ly

511
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:36,079
cumbersome just think of shipping

512
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:38,929
Microsoft and mask are have developed

513
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:41,329
already a prototype where all the

514
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:45,590
documentation for insurance for

515
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:47,589
cross-border for destinations content

516
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:51,678
taxation everything is on the blockchain

517
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:55,459
everything is executed automatically the

518
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:58,669
container arrives in the port scan the

519
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:02,899
truck loads it scan goes through custom

520
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:06,099
scan ends up in Walmart scan you buy it

521
00:27:02,898 --> 00:27:11,388
scan and that's it

522
00:27:06,098 --> 00:27:14,388
an example of some insurance companies

523
00:27:11,388 --> 00:27:16,519
in Asia try it across eight

524
00:27:14,388 --> 00:27:17,928
jurisdictions if you have insurance

525
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:21,138
across countries

526
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:24,048
its enormous lis paper and regulatory

527
00:27:21,138 --> 00:27:26,238
intensive and so many checks and

528
00:27:24,048 --> 00:27:28,579
double-checks and putting in the into a

529
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:30,858
database and another company a different

530
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:33,348
database and it takes about four months

531
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:35,799
to settle an insurance claim between

532
00:27:33,348 --> 00:27:38,559
Hong Kong and the Philippines

533
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:40,629
so they sure in Hong Kong issues and a

534
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,669
policy to accompany in the Philippines

535
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:46,060
if there's an incident takes four months

536
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:49,080
with that blockchain a prototype that

537
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:49,079
they did it took four hours

538
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:57,960
quite a few people will lose their jobs

539
00:27:54,410 --> 00:28:01,670
those that have to check and put paper

540
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:05,250
in photocopy scan classify and so forth

541
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:08,720
the benefit is of course that everything

542
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:12,529
will be faster and essentially foolproof

543
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:17,130
or as foolproof as the blockchains

544
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:20,339
applications one of the most advanced is

545
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:23,880
ever ledger for diamonds so from the

546
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:27,269
point of mining photographed all the way

547
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,850
to the sale on your wedding ring

548
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:32,789
all on blockchain there are millions of

549
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:35,279
diamonds already if they're cut that

550
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:38,339
gets on it that gets recorded in a

551
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:42,990
blockchain and just a few numbers on

552
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:45,319
fraud prevention 45 billion estimated in

553
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:47,880
the diamond industry to be lost to fraud

554
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:51,928
most of that can be prevented with

555
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:54,320
blockchain most fraudulent claims go

556
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:54,320
undetected

557
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:04,710
and I rest my case there so in future

558
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:06,480
you'll buy the wedding ring diamond you

559
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:09,298
will know the minor you'll see the face

560
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:13,069
on your phone on your smartphone you

561
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:15,298
will know that it's not a blood diamonds

562
00:29:13,069 --> 00:29:16,019
distributed cloud storage another

563
00:29:15,298 --> 00:29:18,240
application

564
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:22,048
you can rent out your computer your

565
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,630
laptop for others to store their files

566
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:27,179
if you have space left and make some

567
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:30,650
money along that way you can't read

568
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:35,660
again encrypted cryptographically

569
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:37,220
essentially foolproof its Turin

570
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:40,310
that are familiar with BitTorrent

571
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:42,769
similar system to be torrent so the same

572
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:46,210
is in many different computers if one is

573
00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:46,210
down you still have access to your files

574
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:51,140
here's what FinTech the I think the

575
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:53,660
conclusion on FinTech is somebody from

576
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:55,970
Berkeley high up our belief at Barclays

577
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:59,029
is that blockchain is a fundamental part

578
00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:03,680
of the new operating system for the

579
00:29:59,029 --> 00:30:06,289
planet so when you hear that central

580
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:09,350
banks and banks are against Bitcoin and

581
00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:11,539
blockchain well yes until they figured

582
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:18,250
out that they could probably benefit

583
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:22,220
from it as well this will fundamentally

584
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:28,190
transform our way of interacting with

585
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:30,880
each other at every level of life our k

586
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:35,120
city will take over Eva maybe one day

587
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:40,370
uber takes quite a cut central authority

588
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:45,139
again Arcade City you have drivers you

589
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:48,739
me again permission blockchain and a

590
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:50,830
fraction of the cost to me or to you the

591
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:53,240
rider

592
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:58,099
will completely change the way we do

593
00:30:53,240 --> 00:31:01,220
transport that's just for taxi type of

594
00:30:58,099 --> 00:31:03,219
transports think of parcels think of

595
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:05,870
distribution of the postal system

596
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:09,110
mind-boggling if you just dare to think

597
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:11,379
of the potential implications renting

598
00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:14,379
it's just finished it's ico

599
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:16,789
rent Berry that's for long-term rentals

600
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:19,280
Airbnb will be history maybe one day

601
00:31:16,788 --> 00:31:21,679
let's look at some medical applications

602
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:25,250
and broses tracking the origin of the

603
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:29,450
medicines all the way to bedside from

604
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:32,000
bench from production to bedside think

605
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:35,330
of what it means for vaccines where

606
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:39,460
every storage has been monitored was it

607
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:39,460
too long at room temperature etc

608
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:48,769
fraudulent medicines fakes and so forth

609
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:50,089
a tremendous technology to all but

610
00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:53,750
eliminate it completely

611
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:55,668
another medical application is or health

612
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:59,419
research application is a professor at

613
00:31:55,669 --> 00:32:02,179
MIT just started recently a block chain

614
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:04,909
where you put up your DNA every

615
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:07,009
sequenced gets on the blockchain and if

616
00:32:04,909 --> 00:32:09,470
companies come and steal your DNA or

617
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:12,200
compare or fish out certain sequences

618
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:23,120
you actually get paid per view so to

619
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:25,880
speak with tokens Jim managing medical

620
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:29,569
records it's just one of many that are

621
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:32,690
already starting this

622
00:32:29,569 --> 00:32:36,169
revolutionize the health industry just

623
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:39,019
that fact alone and then imagine what

624
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:40,840
you could do if you superimpose AI

625
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:43,549
artificial intelligence machine learning

626
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:45,308
having access to some of those medical

627
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:47,288
records

628
00:32:45,308 --> 00:32:50,109
you get tokens by the way if they

629
00:32:47,288 --> 00:32:52,179
pay-per-view along the way they don't

630
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:53,589
know who you are but now suddenly you

631
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:55,720
have everybody who's on that blockchain

632
00:32:53,589 --> 00:33:01,808
the medical records could now be mined

633
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:04,778
for science a new world you can pay

634
00:33:01,808 --> 00:33:08,740
casinos now you can gamble with on the

635
00:33:04,778 --> 00:33:11,558
blockchain with an advantage it's not

636
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:13,720
stacked against you you go to gamble

637
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:15,970
it's always stacked against you yards

638
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:18,159
the house always wins at the end of the

639
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:21,308
day not here it's zero that's why the

640
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:23,080
zero coin they still make a little bit

641
00:33:21,308 --> 00:33:26,158
of money with the transactions and

642
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:29,499
that's it so it's fair gambling

643
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,230
III don't suggest you try it out I'm

644
00:33:29,499 --> 00:33:34,058
just giving you examples but you can

645
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:36,839
then think further what this could mean

646
00:33:34,058 --> 00:33:40,329
for democracy

647
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:41,349
think about that when you walk home okay

648
00:33:40,329 --> 00:33:45,789
governments that brings me to

649
00:33:41,349 --> 00:33:47,379
government's just a few dubai they want

650
00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:50,559
to get the whole state everything on

651
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:54,970
blockchain Estonia all public records

652
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:56,799
you identities on blockchain South Korea

653
00:33:54,970 --> 00:34:00,519
all the transportation will be on

654
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:02,740
managed on blockchain the UK is still

655
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:05,589
studying whether they should do pensions

656
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:08,159
payments of pensions again fraud

657
00:34:05,589 --> 00:34:12,099
prevention and then you have other

658
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:16,169
interesting applications voting one day

659
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:17,648
will be on the blockchain inevitable and

660
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:21,309
guess what

661
00:34:17,648 --> 00:34:24,609
two days ago Arizona passed a bill to

662
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:28,779
allow tax payments with Bitcoin and this

663
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:31,329
is not a hose so one day here's what

664
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:37,360
will happen you will buy something at

665
00:34:31,329 --> 00:34:40,389
Green Star Wegmans it will already the

666
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:43,628
blockchain for which you bought it will

667
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:45,370
deduct all the right taxes instantly

668
00:34:43,628 --> 00:34:47,360
almost transfer the taxes to the right

669
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:49,980
players

670
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,659
your income from Cornell or from

671
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:54,750
wherever will come through the

672
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:56,130
blockchain and the smart contracts

673
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:59,639
associated with the blockchain

674
00:34:56,130 --> 00:35:04,640
will know how much taxes you are owed to

675
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:13,079
pay to whom I when will all be automated

676
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:13,650
HR block goodbye let's go into some fun

677
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:18,000
stuff

678
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:21,059
philanthropy bit give look it up it's a

679
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,420
way to know exactly what you're giving

680
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:29,099
where it ended up with to whom by when

681
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:33,840
at what time crowdfunding on the

682
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:38,190
blockchain Kickstarter is history this

683
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:39,809
will be the future this developed by the

684
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:43,349
Gates Foundation Bill and Melinda Gates

685
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:46,009
Foundation to enable the to point some

686
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:49,769
billion people that are non not banking

687
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:52,260
to have wallets and be able to actually

688
00:35:49,769 --> 00:35:54,179
have money in their pockets and not to

689
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:57,750
have to walk to another village with

690
00:35:54,179 --> 00:36:00,239
cash for a transaction so it's to

691
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:03,539
empower the poor let's come to some

692
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:05,699
agricultural applications and there's so

693
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:09,000
many I didn't know which ones to choose

694
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:10,949
I'm selected a few random ones some for

695
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,349
fun some because I think they are

696
00:36:10,949 --> 00:36:15,389
groundbreaking in their technologies

697
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:18,630
this one I've put first because I'm

698
00:36:15,389 --> 00:36:20,940
still trying to get my head around what

699
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:22,950
exactly their business model is but it

700
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:27,869
looks done promising that's all I can

701
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:30,419
say this one is a bit more advanced from

702
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:32,759
the Netherlands out of offering you can

703
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,559
when you go to Green Star you can know

704
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,320
exactly the provenance of each

705
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:39,799
individual honey of course you can also

706
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,380
use it for whiskey

707
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:48,320
I know which island which I'll a which

708
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:50,329
farmer milled it awry and all that and

709
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,870
weight was distilled you will all see

710
00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:56,809
that on the blockchain one day this

711
00:36:53,869 --> 00:36:59,359
probably is another one that is really

712
00:36:56,809 --> 00:37:02,509
neat permissioned of course you need to

713
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:04,670
have an account but what they do is they

714
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:07,910
already have certain certifications that

715
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:12,019
they provide its audited and so forth it

716
00:37:07,909 --> 00:37:16,429
will reduce the cost of producing as

717
00:37:12,019 --> 00:37:19,699
certified let's say organic trademarked

718
00:37:16,429 --> 00:37:22,849
products where you have collective marks

719
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:27,079
for quality this will be the only way

720
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:28,429
things will be sold in the future think

721
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:30,710
of it for developing country suddenly

722
00:37:28,429 --> 00:37:33,109
it's becoming easier for a developing

723
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:36,199
country farmer to participate because

724
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:39,710
the transaction costs here are minuscule

725
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:41,539
compared to what they used to be using

726
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:43,940
banks and shippers and importers and

727
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:48,170
exporters and storage and so forth all

728
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:50,900
the middle men block grain in Australia

729
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:55,070
where payments are happening almost

730
00:37:50,900 --> 00:38:00,740
instantaneously again on quality a

731
00:37:55,070 --> 00:38:02,360
variant of the above be Fletcher you

732
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:04,759
know it will be fine I don't know what

733
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:08,120
it means because but what's-his-face

734
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:10,000
there will be vegan and I did when I

735
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:12,769
googled and try to find vegan

736
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,860
blockchains I couldn't find any except

737
00:38:12,769 --> 00:38:18,590
one that didn't take off but I found an

738
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:20,660
interesting blog and the title was

739
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:22,850
cryptocurrencies are turning me vegan I

740
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:26,089
just thought it was fun

741
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:30,019
a couple of more minutes global cannabis

742
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:32,660
chain here you see all the different

743
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:38,280
functions that this chain is integrating

744
00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:41,759
taxation of course as well profit

745
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,800
fishermen in Indonesia you buy you eat

746
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,010
you order fish on the plate tonight for

747
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,750
dinner on the menu is the barcode you

748
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,700
scan it you see the fishermen you see

749
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:52,530
the route he or she took when it was

750
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:54,809
fished how it was transported how much

751
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,670
the fishermen got every stage you know

752
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:58,799
how much they got paid and if you want

753
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:01,550
you add a tip for the fishermen at the

754
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,830
end of your meal if the fish was good

755
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:08,400
seriously and that provenance has it now

756
00:39:04,829 --> 00:39:13,219
in in many different sectors so it's all

757
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:15,690
about tracing verification and Trust

758
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:17,699
they claim to be the blockchain of food

759
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:20,880
as I'm saying there are many of those

760
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:24,059
starting many will fail some will become

761
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,349
the ubiquitous Amazons calm and one day

762
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:28,139
the question will be how will the

763
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:30,420
different block chains interrupt what is

764
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:32,879
the interoperability of the different

765
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:35,070
block chains and the inventor of a

766
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,110
theorem is writing a white paper as we

767
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:39,600
speak and promises to come up with a

768
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:41,160
solution just to stretch your mind a

769
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,429
little bit more Monsanto paid over a

770
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:48,960
billion dollars for climate calm climate

771
00:39:44,429 --> 00:39:51,960
data now think of integrating that

772
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:55,349
information with artificial intelligence

773
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:58,190
machine learning and blockchain I'm just

774
00:39:55,349 --> 00:40:01,500
putting that out to stretch your minds

775
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:04,980
this is why Monsanto bought paid a

776
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:08,969
billion dollars for the data and then

777
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:11,039
there are lots on IP but that would be a

778
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:14,159
subject for another talk let's come back

779
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:16,710
to a few forward-looking questions what

780
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:19,259
is the future price of Bitcoin I don't

781
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:23,119
know all I can say is now is a good time

782
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:26,700
to sell and I'll buy them

783
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:29,460
ok joke apart what does the future hold

784
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:32,009
at the interface of distributed ledger

785
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:34,740
technology or blockchain and artificial

786
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:35,460
intelligence I valued it to it a few

787
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:39,299
times

788
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:41,880
just think of breeding phenotype

789
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:44,250
screening putting all that stuff on

790
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,630
blockchain and having a wheat breeder at

791
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:47,940
the other side of the world and

792
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:50,160
artificial intelligence that makes sense

793
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:52,139
of all that data that comes together

794
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:53,969
that no longer sits in

795
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:56,489
god knows what different databases and

796
00:40:53,969 --> 00:40:59,779
singers and singer whatever it's called

797
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:59,779
and I know if that still exists

798
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:05,099
diversity

799
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:09,420
trust what is it called for the DNA all

800
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:11,579
of that will be on blockchain and with

801
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:14,579
artificial intelligence it will

802
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:17,730
revolutionize breeding like I think

803
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:19,920
molecular genetics has done by when will

804
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:25,590
blockchain make Airbnb and uber obsolete

805
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:28,260
I think the writing is on the wall will

806
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:31,350
block trade applications be regulated as

807
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:34,200
public goods they have the quality of a

808
00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:38,400
perfect public good non-rival rain

809
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:41,639
consumption and non-excludable at least

810
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,340
they're not the permissionless so that

811
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:48,329
alone would be a couple of hours to

812
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:51,680
discuss or will blockchain enable an

813
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:56,369
Orwellian future where the government

814
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:59,460
controls everything from your birth

815
00:41:56,369 --> 00:42:01,349
certificate to your income to your taxes

816
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,690
to your transportation you can't

817
00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:06,059
transport unless you have a part of a

818
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:07,470
blockchain and if for some reason they

819
00:42:06,059 --> 00:42:09,119
don't like you or think you should be

820
00:42:07,469 --> 00:42:13,519
incarcerated they turn off the switch

821
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,519
and you can't move anymore

822
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:21,030
so the very technology Bitcoin that was

823
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:23,190
supposed to be completely decentralized

824
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:27,960
make governments and central banks

825
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:32,150
obsolete and take away their power could

826
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:35,550
one day be turn against them just

827
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:37,200
putting out food for thought and of

828
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:40,289
course the question for the discussion

829
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:43,769
forty-two minutes exactly can we harness

830
00:42:40,289 --> 00:42:45,480
our institutions your minds to actually

831
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:49,590
use blockchain for all the good

832
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:51,869
applications bring different values

833
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:54,230
different cultures together around a

834
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:56,250
system that we can all understand

835
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:59,360
address the sustainable development

836
00:42:56,250 --> 00:43:04,829
goals of the United Nations

837
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:07,289
that's for evening lecture a summary of

838
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:09,029
the benefits I just want to spend 30

839
00:43:07,289 --> 00:43:13,800
seconds on the last one on governance

840
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:16,070
with two examples one is what is the

841
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,019
parallel to the executive its the nodes

842
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:21,450
the judiciary is the miners that make

843
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:24,989
sure that come to consensus the

844
00:43:21,449 --> 00:43:28,409
legislature is in fact the system that

845
00:43:24,989 --> 00:43:32,089
was built the platform itself and then

846
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:34,819
we have all the users but you also have

847
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:37,500
fundamental questions how blockchain is

848
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:40,050
going to fundamentally change the

849
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:42,719
governance of corporations because it

850
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:46,019
changes the power structure and who has

851
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:49,139
power this professor by the way New York

852
00:43:46,019 --> 00:43:52,550
University is fantastic one of the world

853
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:52,549
authorities on economics

854
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:03,100
and that's it here's a farmer sweet

855
00:43:59,889 --> 00:44:07,089
potato farmer in the Red River Delta in

856
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:08,849
outside Hanoi I haven't asked her what

857
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:12,490
she thinks of blockchain

858
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:17,768
but that's worth a discussion

859
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:17,768
[Applause]

860
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,030
[Music]

861
00:45:05,179 --> 00:45:15,750
yeah like everything related to your

862
00:45:08,608 --> 00:45:17,489
house yeah the builders the materials

863
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:19,469
that were used in the building in the

864
00:45:17,489 --> 00:45:23,298
construction the paint's when it was

865
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:25,409
renovated everything

866
00:45:23,298 --> 00:45:27,568
but-but-but-but that's real actually

867
00:45:25,409 --> 00:45:30,509
that application exists today and has

868
00:45:27,568 --> 00:45:33,058
been solved and it's been solved by you

869
00:45:30,509 --> 00:45:35,880
don't need to transact transfer all the

870
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:46,140
information all the time that's how it's

871
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:48,900
solved right so you have to not much

872
00:45:46,139 --> 00:45:52,338
it's nanoseconds couple of packs and

873
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:55,980
fourths well

874
00:45:52,338 --> 00:46:00,150
bitcoin is is what ten twelve megabytes

875
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:03,480
per block a theorem makes transactions

876
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:07,740
much faster hash graph is front

877
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:10,259
kilobytes for the same amount where what

878
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:13,379
you need to transfer all the time is

879
00:46:10,259 --> 00:46:15,690
proof that you are who you claim you are

880
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:18,150
and that you want to execute a certain

881
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:20,909
transaction that is a certain specified

882
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:22,410
and allowed transaction and that the

883
00:46:20,909 --> 00:46:25,259
system then allows you to do the

884
00:46:22,409 --> 00:46:27,389
transaction and transfer ownership title

885
00:46:25,259 --> 00:46:29,849
or whatever it is that's where the

886
00:46:27,389 --> 00:46:32,219
transactions take place their underlying

887
00:46:29,849 --> 00:46:34,430
data you don't need to transfer all the

888
00:46:32,219 --> 00:46:34,429
time

889
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:46,769
yes because you have it transferred once

890
00:46:38,409 --> 00:46:49,440
and it's there once the first time

891
00:46:46,769 --> 00:46:52,358
that's why the blockchain is immutable

892
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,849
unchangeable once it's in a block is

893
00:46:52,358 --> 00:46:56,828
unchangeable then that's it

894
00:46:54,849 --> 00:46:59,500
it stays there look at all the data

895
00:46:56,829 --> 00:47:02,500
sense centers of amazon.com again to

896
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:04,539
pick on Amazon yeah I mean tetra bytes

897
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:06,750
or flops I don't even know what the

898
00:47:04,539 --> 00:47:09,608
terminology is for the amount of storage

899
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:18,039
how much data goes across every

900
00:47:09,608 --> 00:47:21,130
nanosecond this is not a problem no no

901
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:23,139
the energy goes into useless

902
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:30,579
mathematical processing actually for the

903
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:32,199
Bitcoin because you have it centralized

904
00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:56,318
with block chain you will use less

905
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:58,269
energy to do the same function but it'll

906
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:00,579
be transferred once and then it's

907
00:47:58,269 --> 00:48:03,699
locally among computer and you can

908
00:48:00,579 --> 00:48:06,068
access it it's immutable it's it's

909
00:48:03,699 --> 00:48:08,889
associated with a particular code or

910
00:48:06,068 --> 00:48:11,318
hash and when I looked up that hash I

911
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:13,210
can see what I want to see and get that

912
00:48:11,318 --> 00:48:14,769
from the blockchain I don't need to get

913
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:17,068
it from all the million computers only

914
00:48:14,769 --> 00:48:17,068
one

915
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:36,900
other questions I hope you guys will

916
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:39,929
come up with those answers and your

917
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:42,059
minds will solve that well I think the

918
00:48:39,929 --> 00:48:44,519
Mojo the one that I mentioned from Gates

919
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:47,699
Foundation which they developed three

920
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:51,480
years ago by the way or four is in ten

921
00:48:47,699 --> 00:48:54,269
in fact intended to enable to develop

922
00:48:51,480 --> 00:49:38,969
the infrastructure needed precisely to

923
00:48:54,269 --> 00:49:43,369
connect those yeah I'm not sure how

924
00:49:38,969 --> 00:49:48,509
immediate its relative of course but I

925
00:49:43,369 --> 00:49:52,429
mean it takes us to another subject

926
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:52,430
which is what is the limit of democracy

927
00:49:55,190 --> 00:50:01,019
these two are very closely related what

928
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:15,599
do the people what do we allow our

929
00:50:01,019 --> 00:50:18,059
governments to actually do so the same

930
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,980
blockchain can be used either to curb

931
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:24,779
that power and make it really democratic

932
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:27,860
or to bring that ovarian future and the

933
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:27,860
choice will be ours

934
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:59,349
so there was one slide on food safety

935
00:50:54,489 --> 00:51:03,710
the cost of false meat for example

936
00:50:59,349 --> 00:51:05,539
recalls with blockchain because you know

937
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:08,210
the provenance and every step and

938
00:51:05,539 --> 00:51:11,390
wherever it was you can't just add 50

939
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:14,048
more pounds because that will be locked

940
00:51:11,389 --> 00:51:17,449
at the point of origin but yes you can

941
00:51:14,048 --> 00:51:20,239
cheat but you will be on a permission

942
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:23,629
blockchain so you will have to have been

943
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:26,478
accredited to use it and if you play bad

944
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:32,028
once there will be consequences

945
00:51:26,478 --> 00:51:33,588
so is it completely foolproof no but

946
00:51:32,028 --> 00:51:36,528
take the diamond you take the picture of

947
00:51:33,588 --> 00:51:40,998
the diamond once that picture and

948
00:51:36,528 --> 00:51:44,179
assuming it's not from a blood blood

949
00:51:40,998 --> 00:51:46,578
diamond but taken from somewhere else

950
00:51:44,179 --> 00:51:49,518
and then photographed here those things

951
00:51:46,579 --> 00:51:52,999
are always possible but I think the

952
00:51:49,518 --> 00:51:55,159
blockchain reduces and the accreditation

953
00:51:52,998 --> 00:51:57,468
and the auditing that will go with it

954
00:51:55,159 --> 00:52:01,098
that goes with it it reduces that

955
00:51:57,469 --> 00:52:04,219
potential significantly it's not

956
00:52:01,099 --> 00:52:07,068
completely it doesn't eliminate it

957
00:52:04,219 --> 00:52:13,849
doesn't put everybody doesn't make

958
00:52:07,068 --> 00:52:14,539
everybody honest overnight anymore

959
00:52:13,849 --> 00:52:18,559
question

960
00:52:14,539 --> 00:52:21,710
can contact me here and just for my own

961
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:29,659
honesty credits of some of the images I

962
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:32,119
downloaded from this has been a
