00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,439
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,439
university

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,199
thank you very much for the introduction

4
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:15,759
dr korsovich

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,519
and i want to say good afternoon to

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,519
everyone

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:24,879
and i want to thank the

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:26,320
yes i want to thank the plant breeding

9
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,198
and genetics

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,000
seminar committee and the chairman for

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,239
this opportunity

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,359
to present on the activities of the

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,320
innovation lab for

14
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,320
crop improvements

15
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:42,640
um here is a snippet of what i'm going

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,359
to talk about today i'm going to give us

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,960
a brief

18
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:48,799
background of myself and i'll go ahead

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,160
and introduce you all to the innovation

20
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,878
lab for crop improvement

21
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,519
and i'm gonna round up by talking about

22
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,960
our

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,320
centers of innovation which i believe is

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,640
the heartbeat of elc

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,239
so for those of you who do not know me i

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,040
am

27
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,439
originally from nigeria just like i was

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,320
introduced by dr krusevich

29
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:12,798
and um my first introduction to plant

30
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,719
science

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:20,960
research was through iid

32
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:23,519
so um that was where i received uh

33
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,640
inspiration actually to pursue a career

34
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,519
in plant research

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,359
prior to that encounter my family

36
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:32,158
routinely processed cassava

37
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,879
to make gary ourselves just for personal

38
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,118
consumption

39
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,239
not to take it to the market or any

40
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:38,799
anything like that so

41
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,879
the men would have his cassava and the

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,079
women were tasked to turn the cassava

43
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,078
into gary

44
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,478
and we would peel and process into gary

45
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:49,279
and that was short-lived because of

46
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,399
the death in the family you know as a

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,920
breadwinner

48
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,478
died and then life especially feeding

49
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,280
for

50
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,799
you know i have i was just like never uh

51
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,960
seven year old

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,960
feeding became very difficult you know

53
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,559
and a child what does a child know

54
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,279
rather than to eat breakfast lunch and

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,359
dinner

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,719
and there was a point in my life where i

57
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,520
witnessed poverty

58
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,359
you know firsthand and experienced food

59
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,480
insecurity and of course

60
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,560
all the while i craved i desired

61
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,840
to find a solution to these problems

62
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,080
because children

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,520
shouldn't have to worry about you know

64
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,040
where the next meal is going to come

65
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,599
from and not knowing

66
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,719
you know i would end up working in crop

67
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,759
improvement research

68
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,840
and cassava for that matter

69
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,598
so after this encounter i was privileged

70
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,680
to serve

71
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:40,560
a gay united that i was able to do for a

72
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,920
year and i worked with uh itabow tech at

73
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,680
that time

74
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,839
and it's now called the i.t about

75
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,040
science center

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,200
after which i was inspired to continue

77
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,878
plant research to obtain a master's in

78
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,759
crop protection and pursued

79
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,840
my phd in germany i did like the

80
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,840
molecular biology work at the max punk

81
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,239
institute for pampering research and i

82
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,360
had

83
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,158
the cassava transformation work um at

84
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,319
see it and

85
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:10,479
uh the the theme was uh proof of concept

86
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:13,439
that genes from arabidopsis italiana can

87
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,598
regulate flowering in cassava

88
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,959
because as we all know cassava is

89
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:21,679
recalcitrant of flowering

90
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,519
and flowers are very important for

91
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,799
breeders

92
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,680
so um this this research was so

93
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,560
interesting that we had flowers we have

94
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,680
cassava

95
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,920
in vitro plants flowering cassava

96
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,400
flowering in vitro so we were able to

97
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:41,359
prove that the ft over expression

98
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,239
uh increases the prolificacy of

99
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,480
flowering

100
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,480
production and extends the longevity of

101
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,000
flower development and i also

102
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,719
characterized the component

103
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,840
of the circadian clock upstream of the

104
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,759
ft

105
00:03:51,840 --> 00:04:00,080
in cassava so after i obtained

106
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:03,759
my phd from the university of cologne

107
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,159
um i tried to secure a position

108
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,878
in the african continent and that was

109
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,679
kind of

110
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:11,280
a struggle but by divine providence i

111
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,400
found my way to the u.s

112
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,238
and i came to texas where i began my

113
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,759
immigration journey

114
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:21,198
and that is where i studied the

115
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:24,080
mechanisms by which legume plants

116
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,600
in in this case my chicago truncatula

117
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,800
control symbiotic

118
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,120
nitrogen fixation occurring nitrogen

119
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,360
without the use of energetically and

120
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,319
monetarily expensive and polluting

121
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,680
synthetic nitrogen fertilizers

122
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:43,279
so um typically we would

123
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,079
search for mutant lines in

124
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,198
or our robert's noble foundation is

125
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,839
close by

126
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,680
and then the mutant we found showed

127
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:55,359
nitrogen deficiency syndrome

128
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,840
symptoms rather the mutant fails to form

129
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,120
pink nitrogen fixing nodules that occur

130
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,079
in the wild type

131
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,639
symbiosis but instead it develops small

132
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,599
bomb

133
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,240
like noodles on its roots that are

134
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,320
blocked

135
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,720
at an early stage of development and

136
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:14,159
later off and has a lateral root

137
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,520
uh defect the functional nip

138
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,600
like d gene was cloned and shown to

139
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:23,439
encode a protein

140
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:27,520
in the broad substrate nitrate reductase

141
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:30,800
uh transporter family and the

142
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:33,439
nip lady lateral root deficient

143
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,160
transporter is essential for nutrition

144
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,160
and appropriate

145
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:43,600
and appropriate root architecture

146
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:48,879
so here is um some of the publications

147
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,879
and um after that experience i came to

148
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,079
to cornell where i walked out with team

149
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:57,038
setter

150
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,560
and um i continued you know came back to

151
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,038
working with cassava

152
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,399
after that detour um uh on over

153
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:05,839
expressing

154
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:08,318
uh redux's ft that elicits

155
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,439
extremely early flowering indicating

156
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,120
that cassava has

157
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,478
the necessary signaling components to

158
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,079
interact

159
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:21,279
with and respond to the ft gene product

160
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:23,120
so um my work was to advance

161
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,119
my work was to advance our understanding

162
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,840
of the molecular and physiological basis

163
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,959
of flowering in cassava

164
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,519
under different environmental conditions

165
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,959
where i investigated the expression of

166
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:39,038
cassava ft like

167
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:41,198
genes we characterized the

168
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,959
phosphatidyl ethanol amine binding

169
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,038
protein

170
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,198
family of genes it happens that in

171
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,759
cassava we have 10 of them

172
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,240
and we identified like a putative ft

173
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,280
like homolog ft like is like

174
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:59,199
um in arabidopsis it's the rate limiting

175
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:01,198
um gene that is responsible

176
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,038
for switching from vegetative to

177
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,639
reproductive production

178
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:08,719
implants and we compare the expression

179
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,000
of this homologues in various tissues

180
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,360
and uh we illustrated illustrated the

181
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,478
expression of this

182
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,759
homologues in various experimentally

183
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,199
controlled for the period and

184
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,680
temperature environment

185
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,360
in relation to the effects on cassava

186
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,400
regulation

187
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,240
another important roles in cassava so we

188
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,519
were able to advance the potential for

189
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,840
applications

190
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,159
in breeding program ultimately we found

191
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:38,000
out that i mean some of your sessions

192
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,479
that we used um the cassava is a long

193
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,918
day

194
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:46,639
flowers in if flowers early

195
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:48,240
under a long day for the period and

196
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,478
if you put them in shorty the flower

197
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,478
late

198
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:57,120
so um when i rounded up my um research

199
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,439
my postdoctoral experience i i was

200
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,478
serving on the board of the cornell best

201
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:05,038
program and best used to be called

202
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:07,120
broadening experiences in scientific

203
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:10,719
training and it's now known as um

204
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,598
careers beyond academia

205
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,120
it's a platform where phd students and

206
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:18,240
postdocs can

207
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,319
like find a fulfilling career outside of

208
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,680
academy it's more like your test driving

209
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,639
you know different career options so

210
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,720
even those

211
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,560
who pursue academic careers will need to

212
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,599
develop skills beyond the technical or

213
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,720
research skills

214
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:30,639
they are developing in their current

215
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,599
programs so best

216
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,320
provides opportunities for increasing

217
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,680
awareness

218
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:41,519
of the broad range of careers that exist

219
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:43,598
and examples are like in policy making

220
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,000
governance risk and compliance

221
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,040
industry entrepreneurship and management

222
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
communication

223
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,199
and research administration so um when i

224
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,480
now found myself

225
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,080
in the office of the vice provost for

226
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,200
research and the office of advice pools

227
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,000
for academic

228
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,879
integration it was excitingly different

229
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,879
environment for me where i learned more

230
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,399
about administrative research

231
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,919
administration

232
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,720
cornell leadership compliance issues the

233
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:13,199
office of the sponsor programs orion

234
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,839
worked on special projects i worked with

235
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,440
our research division communications and

236
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,839
ctl later i administered a startup

237
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,120
incubator for

238
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,120
commercialization of cornell technology

239
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,278
ventures in engineering

240
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,200
digital and physical sciences called

241
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:32,320
practice center just like uh

242
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,000
dr kressovich uh mentioned

243
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,920
where i manage the diverse

244
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,278
administrative functions of six

245
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:40,879
independent

246
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:41,519
venture teams with up to 50 individual

247
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,720
client

248
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,159
team members rested in the center

249
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,920
for those of us who don't know proxy

250
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,519
center it's like a sister center to the

251
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,039
kevin mcgovern center

252
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,039
which is a startup incubator for

253
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:56,159
commercialization of cornell life

254
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,159
sciences technology

255
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,839
so at that point when this current

256
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,679
position came up

257
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,200
i became excited and ready to take on

258
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,879
this challenge i'm

259
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,600
inspired really by the potential impact

260
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,919
that this work that the innovation lab

261
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,320
is

262
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,519
doing could have not only on the african

263
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,240
continent

264
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,120
but also on millions of people around

265
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,480
the globe

266
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,879
so i thought that this is a perfect

267
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,240
opportunity for me to fulfill like

268
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,759
that that desire and um

269
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,000
i found myself having a career

270
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,799
trajectory that starts with research and

271
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,720
continues with a large

272
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:37,838
ag research grant management

273
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:41,120
so that brings me to

274
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,680
elc excuse me

275
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,120
so um talking about innovation life for

276
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,759
crop improvement we cannot talk about

277
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,200
innovation

278
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:49,039
for company permit without talking about

279
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:54,399
the fit the future

280
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:58,159
and the global food food security

281
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,799
um so the future is a

282
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,078
us government initiative to sustainably

283
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,479
reduce

284
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,838
global hunger malnutrition and poverty

285
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,200
through agriculture led

286
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:12,880
economic growth to strengthen resilience

287
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:16,399
and improve human nutrition

288
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:20,879
this is led by um the usaid

289
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:24,240
um it was a a global food security act

290
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:27,039
and then it's implemented by uh the

291
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,759
global food security strategy

292
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,199
and these are the us partners that are

293
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,799
involved

294
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,278
uh the u.s government agencies and

295
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,799
departments are involved in

296
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,480
this research and the feed the future

297
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:42,159
has a 12

298
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:45,440
target um target countries

299
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,078
so um the implementing the implementing

300
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,959
partners

301
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,239
are important and these implementing

302
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,479
partners are

303
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,919
research funding organizations their

304
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,839
innovators and their

305
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,838
development partners

306
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,320
i would say that um we're about 21 for

307
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,360
the future innovation labs

308
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:09,200
that ranges on topics

309
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:12,639
about animal science research

310
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:17,200
to uh policy food policy and

311
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:19,919
um to plan research and the eoc

312
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,320
was um previously there are innovation

313
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,159
labs

314
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,399
that specifically deal a work on

315
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:30,240
specific crops but the eoc

316
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:33,120
is um working on a

317
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,680
broad range of crop with a global impact

318
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,519
and

319
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,799
this was awarded it was a competition

320
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,759
and um cornell

321
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,919
was awarded we are excited that cornell

322
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,399
was awarded it's a five-year effective

323
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:44,159
uh

324
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,559
last year and the award amount is

325
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,399
between five million and to develop

326
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,239
a crop improvement portfolio for

327
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,360
daenerys

328
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,320
so what is our mission our mission is to

329
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,440
partner

330
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,399
with national programs to identify help

331
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,480
them identify

332
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,919
develop pilot and transfer appropriate

333
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,879
tools technologies

334
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,519
and methods to equip them so they can

335
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,559
deliver

336
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,200
increased genetic gain for for better

337
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,479
seats

338
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,920
into the market for small older farmers

339
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:21,839
so we ultimately reduce um

340
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:21,838
malnutrition and hunger our approach

341
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:28,399
so historically donald organizations

342
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:31,039
um will provide funding for

343
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:34,480
research but the they drive the goals

344
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:38,719
and priorities for research but in illc

345
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:41,120
we we have this approach of um

346
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,000
bottoms bottoms up approach where the

347
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,959
ilc dr

348
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,039
the sorry daenerys the drive the goals

349
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:50,719
and priorities for research

350
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:53,919
why because we believe that sustainable

351
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:58,399
solutions will have a long-term effect

352
00:13:53,919 --> 00:14:00,319
if the um if daenerys specifically

353
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,399
identify their unique needs

354
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,120
you know and target innovations or

355
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:09,440
design innovations to solve them

356
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,600
so and um we focus on providing

357
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,040
you know resources in terms of

358
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,680
cutting-edge science

359
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:18,078
and collaboration and all that they need

360
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:20,799
that we believe that will help them

361
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:20,799
to succeed

362
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:28,879
so what is our tactic um our tactics

363
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:31,519
um is include this core

364
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,240
interdisciplinary team of scientists

365
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,679
that focus

366
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,039
on party setting you know of breeding

367
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,120
interventions that will increase the

368
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,319
responsiveness of this interventions and

369
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,440
potentially improve

370
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,560
uptake of new varieties we have a trade

371
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,560
discovery

372
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,239
team genomics phenomics brilliant

373
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,278
informatics and instrumental capacity

374
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,560
evaluation

375
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:55,600
that we believe are the core

376
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:59,518
um excuse me

377
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,720
core research areas we call them area of

378
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,839
inquiry

379
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:08,000
that are essential for success in

380
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,600
daenerys and here is like a sketch that

381
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,519
talks about the area of inquiry

382
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,639
deploying tools technology

383
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,440
methods through a breeding pipeline for

384
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,839
a healthy crop improvement system

385
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,800
and i'll take you uh quickly through the

386
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,680
management team

387
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,799
we have dr christopher harley as our

388
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,239
associate director

389
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:29,359
and monifa as a program assistant and we

390
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,839
also have

391
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,120
the team of um communications support

392
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,800
and administrative

393
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:40,480
and event um personnel

394
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:41,359
just a brief uh uh going through the air

395
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,560
of inquiry

396
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,919
team leads the faces behind tactics

397
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:51,518
these are these are um our

398
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:55,360
core core uh era of inquiry team

399
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:57,278
and uh we have uh jeff morris from

400
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,519
colorado state so we have jessie poland

401
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:02,159
from kansas state we have um

402

deal tavaraja from clemson university

403
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:08,240
that works on phenomx and the rest of

404
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,839
our team are all cornell

405
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,680
cornell beast we also have a

406
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,680
cross-cutting theme

407
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,120
we believe that um we have a

408
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,679
cross-cutting thing lead just

409
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,879
designated leading in elizabeth and we

410
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,120
have d

411
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,000
and margaret also working together and

412
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,919
the cross-cutting theme

413
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,399
is very important in that is about

414
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,479
increasing awareness and understanding

415
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,399
of the importance of addressing and

416
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,360
incorporating addressing and

417
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,799
incorporating

418
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,480
gender youth nutrition and resilience

419
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:37,838
and crop improvements

420
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,759
i want to i like two things that the

421
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:45,040
cross cut cutting

422
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:45,039
theme team have done um so far

423
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:53,359
and that is um training and translation

424
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,120
training due to kobe they were just

425
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,959
talking about cover 19 it has been

426
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,560
difficult to travel in person

427
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:02,719
and with the rising numbers of infected

428
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,480
uh cases travel restrictions were

429
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,240
probably not easy so

430
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,318
our cross-cutting theme they have

431
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,599
designed outline

432
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:15,359
and online excuse me sensitization

433
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:18,318
training to reach

434
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,639
our cois more quickly than would have

435
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:22,318
been

436
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,640
in person so that work could continue

437
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,240
just by the travel restrictions and i

438
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,640
think that this is a

439
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,079
very great idea that they have initiated

440
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,200
two trainees already in

441
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:34,798
gender and youth to serve as a framework

442
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,558
for additional

443
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,000
two trainings in nutrition and

444
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:40,160
resilience and

445
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,919
the trainings will also serve as a

446
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,400
public tools

447
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,759
accessible by any way as well as

448
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,720
templates for the other area of

449
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,359
encourage

450
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,160
whom we wish to pursue the same for

451
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,199
their own

452
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,200
area of expertise

453
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:55,839
so the other

454
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:03,038
accomplishment that they have you know

455
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,319
done is that we know that all the

456
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,160
centers of innovation i'm going to talk

457
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:08,000
about later

458
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,400
they are awarded in countries that are

459
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,200
primarily non-english speaking

460
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,880
or they speak english as part of its

461
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,880
colonial heritage

462
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:21,840
and we have um

463
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,640
we have stated that the objective of uh

464
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,599
the eoc

465
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,440
includes diversity and inclusion and we

466
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:29,359
have reinforced those through our

467
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,120
strategic management and prioritization

468
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,719
of cross-cutting themes throughout the

469
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,519
project

470
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,919
so they are working to formalize access

471
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,119
in fact

472
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:41,440
amazon say also that um

473
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:44,000
i just read an email that was sent to

474
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,200
one of our cois in senegal

475
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,240
in french and i'm impressed that

476
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,200
you know we are working so much to make

477
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,519
sure that

478
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,960
uc succeeds and if that means that we

479
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,558
want to translate

480
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,679
you know the work to remove

481
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:04,000
any communication gaps and you know so

482
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,120
they're working to formalize access to

483
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,599
translation and

484
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,479
or interpretation services to support

485
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:10,798
inclusive

486
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,160
outreach and capacity building for the

487
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:16,960
cross-cutting theme

488
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:18,798
as well as the eoc team and initiative

489
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,160
all right and then i'll just go through

490
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,160
um our

491
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,519
advisory committee our advisory

492
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,919
committee uh as

493
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,359
they are seasoned professionals with

494
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,679
international experience

495
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,519
in leading research and development in

496
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,600
the private sector

497
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,279
one of them is linked with a private

498
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,199
sector in asia

499
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:38,720
and together we believe that our core

500
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,319
team irreverent curry leads

501
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,079
and a cross-cutting theme together with

502
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,000
the management entity will leverage its

503
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,639
connections to engage

504
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,839
efforts that connect with private sector

505
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,600
priorities

506
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:54,399
so we can ensure technology and method

507
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:57,519
advancements and transfer them to

508
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,360
advance our married partners

509
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,519
now it takes me to our tiger crops our

510
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,558
target crops are root tubers and bananas

511
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:05,038
legumes

512
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,639
excluding um soybean and peanut we have

513
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:10,240
minutes

514
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,000
and sargon and i would also talk about

515
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,798
the quick wings who are the quick things

516
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,759
the quick wings were

517
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,879
um were identified as short-term

518
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,119
projects

519
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,120
with a moderate investment and for a

520
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,759
long-term impact are we identified at

521
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:30,719
the time that the proposal was submitted

522
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:30,720
and we have quick win partners in um

523
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,319
in uganda we have two in uganda we have

524
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:37,199
uh

525
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:37,678
one in 80 we have one in nepal and one

526
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,480
in

527
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,480
in senegal

528
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:47,359
so a quick queen in uganda one of the

529
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:50,959
quick wins in uganda is um

530
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:53,678
working on vivo resistant sweet potato

531
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,519
a quick queen and other quick winning

532
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,640
uganda is working on fast cooking

533
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:00,720
iron and zinc buffer five being using

534
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,200
genomic selection pipelines and our

535
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:07,200
nipple quick queen is working on

536
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,640
high protein quality uh lentils using

537
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,840
non-destructive you know

538
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,000
typing tool and our quick win in senegal

539
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,038
is working on staggering and drought

540
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,480
resistant

541
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:22,158
chrome millet using quantitative traits

542
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,960
um using by cross nested associated

543
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,960
mapping excuse me

544
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:30,079
and our quick win in aiding

545
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,000
is working to increase the rate of

546
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,960
genetic gain in low budget

547
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,839
developing countries some breeding

548
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,440
program using

549
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:42,319
um genomic assisted selection

550
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,159
so um i would share some of is the

551
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,399
progress she has made so far

552
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,080
and his forward product for profile is

553
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,200
sugarcane effect resistant

554
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:54,558
multipurpose sorghum

555
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,679
he works on a point

556
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:59,839
proof of concept proof of concept to

557
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,480
demonstrate the possibility

558
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,079
of enhancing genetic gains in sargon

559
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,360
with rapid

560
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:08,000
cycling genomic selection excuse me so

561
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,959
it has

562
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,200
several genomic cycles or from sugar

563
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,480
cane if it resists that multipurpose

564
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,279
sorghum with broad adaptation to

565
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,000
tropical growth environments those were

566
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:22,480
completed

567
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
and then we went to genomic cycle

568
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,880
selection theory machine

569
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,759
selected families with yields exceeding

570
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,480
the yield of the

571
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:34,000
phenotypic recurrent selection and um

572
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,360
the best breeds from this genomic

573
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,200
selection cycles and phenotypic

574
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,359
recurrent selection cycle are currently

575
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,960
on their multilocation trials and then

576
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:44,399
we can see that

577
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,038
um the genetic genomic selection cycle

578
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,880
three

579
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:49,599
which is under a lot of stress water

580
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,720
stress and severe effect infestation

581
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:55,918
um yielded you know it had

582
00:22:52,720 --> 00:23:00,720
increased in green yield and

583
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:02,960
um it's going to continue um some work

584
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,640
to validate new varieties and

585
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,720
participatory trials it's going to

586
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,640
validate id types and

587
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:14,240
evaluate new training set

588
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,240
for more locations

589
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:21,440
and i'm going to talk about our centers

590
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:24,158
of innovation and it's the i believe

591
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,798
they are the heartbeat of um

592
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,799
of the uc

593
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:36,639
so first of all to identify uh

594
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:39,600
the centers of innovation we requested

595
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,919
for an application because our goal is

596
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:47,119
to build the top tier scalable building

597
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:49,360
programs and co-create a toolbox

598
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:50,959
package covering all the six areas of

599
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:54,079
inquiry

600
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:57,679
and we are we had a goal to select

601
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:59,678
one nari in each region

602
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,000
the east african region the west african

603
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,440
region and the southeast asia region and

604
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,960
the latin

605
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:11,120
american caribbean region

606
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:14,159
and then the

607
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:17,199
the requirement was that they

608
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,200
write a proposal

609
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:23,440
for projects for three years

610
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,798
and define clearly the product profiles

611
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,679
for tiger crops

612
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,319
the rfa will impact it must be led by

613
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,000
narys

614
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,000
in defeated future countries and they

615
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,839
should articulate

616
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
the development goal and clearly

617
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,519
indicate how becoming a ceo will

618
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,359
increase benefits for women

619
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:43,599
youth climate resilience and nutrition

620
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:45,359
still on the global food security

621
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:48,399
strategy

622
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,038
three objectives um and the budget is a

623
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,400
maximum

624
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:54,000
of a million and um entity start date

625
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,960
was october

626
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,640
first of this year priority was given to

627
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,880
institutions that have

628
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,159
linkages with the us minority serving

629
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,240
institution

630
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,240
the minority group of women and early

631
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,480
career scientists

632
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,839
and also essential that they partner

633
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,038
with nuri's

634
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:15,038
universities and institutions and cgr

635
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:16,480
centers and proposals should be

636
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:19,278
submitted

637
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,558
well an advantage is if it's submitted

638
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:24,079
by inter interdisciplinary groups of pi

639
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,158
and they should include capacity

640
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:29,119
building plans that is articulated at

641
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,679
the individual and institutional level

642
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,798
and then their product profiles should

643
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,480
address gender

644
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:36,480
and youth-based constraint and they

645
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,839
should show potential

646
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:43,839
for all these three global food security

647
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,839
strategy objectives

648
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:49,278
so the rfa process the rfa process

649
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:54,319
was started by um

650
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,960
the reading questions and webinars so

651
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:04,079
for the webinar we had about

652
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:07,360
150 registrants from 41 countries

653
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:10,480
and um the letters of intent

654
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:11,918
uh it's the letters of intent uh were

655
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,120
submitted by

656
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:18,159
a hundred and four applicants

657
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:22,239
across 26 countries

658
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,840
and we filtered those 104 applications

659
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,480
to about

660
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:28,319
40 using different criteria if they

661
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,919
they followed if you were doing a

662
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,399
research in the mandate crop

663
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,679
or have mary p.i or the country is

664
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,679
eligible

665
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,278
another supporting document 1012 was

666
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,480
shortlisted during the

667
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:44,240
the co-creation uh phase

668
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:47,038
we um we merged

669
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,599
out of those shortlisted candidates we

670
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,119
merged

671
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:52,879
two of um the projects together

672
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:55,199
and then there was like a matrix of

673
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,559
calls with the area of inquiry

674
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,480
and cross-cutting themes team leaders

675
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:01,759
to make sure that they prepared a

676
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,519
proposal

677
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:08,558
to um reflect

678
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:11,200
all the priorities of evc in the areas

679
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:14,000
of inquiry and the cross-cutting team

680
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,840
and then we had ten final proposal that

681
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,759
was submitted

682
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:23,519
and four and four was friday

683
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:27,119
these four are um costa rica

684
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:30,240
this are the ones that emerged

685
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:32,959
and the one from senegal

686
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,000
and uganda and malawi we have already

687
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,919
worked with 80

688
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,599
in senegal so

689
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:44,640
um it's really exciting to

690
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:48,079
um work or have

691
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:51,200
you know footprints in the global

692
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:54,240
spectrum and uh

693
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:58,080
we are also um working to

694
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:01,200
include you know in

695
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:04,079
um work in in asia

696
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,480
so the centers are the central america

697
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:09,918
and caribbean crop improvement alliance

698
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,960
casia the center for of innovation for

699
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,080
crop improvement

700
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,200
for east and southern africa ccsa is

701
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:19,038
in malawi in uh with

702
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,519
michael japan and the east african

703
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:22,398
center of innovation for finger murder

704
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:25,839
and slogan

705
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:28,158
in person of uh scorpio at the king

706
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:29,359
that uh there's national seminary

707
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,520
resources

708
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:35,678
research institute in canada and we have

709
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:37,038
crop improvement innovation in west

710
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,480
africa

711
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:44,079
and that's a personal key

712
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,798
so um the central america the casia is

713
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:48,798
led by

714
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:51,839
jose and gail and

715
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:53,519
nari is institut instituto national the

716
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:54,240
innovation in transparency and

717
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,918
technology at

718
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,960
gopicaria inter and cascaya university

719
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,880
and their crops

720
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:06,640
are common beans soccer and sweet potato

721
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:12,080
so they have um the year they're set out

722
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:16,399
to to work on

723
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:19,359
the year plan is uh they want to

724
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:20,000
validate product profiles in coastal

725
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:23,439
curricula in

726
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,278
80 and they want to test uniform

727
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,919
regional nurseries using participatory

728
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:29,440
approaches

729
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:32,080
and expand the sagam rapid recurrent

730
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,840
and genomic selection approaches both in

731
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:37,678
costa rica and 80 because um

732
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,678
gael is already working on sargon

733
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:41,038
and also they want to incorporate

734
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:44,398
physiological breeding

735
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:46,879
and with the the beans the crop

736
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:47,678
they want to begin the magic population

737
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,480
development

738
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,120
and for their sweet potato they will

739
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,839
work on

740
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:59,199
rapid recurrence selection and

741
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:59,199
physiological breathing

742
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:07,519
and the the other

743
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,120
the second center of innovation i'm

744
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:11,038
going to talk about is the east african

745
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:14,398
center of innovation for finger

746
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:15,679
millet and socom this the lead country

747
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:17,199
is uh

748
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,880
it's uganda and we have partner

749
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,440
countries and cairo and

750
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:26,320
atari and um excuse me

751
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,480
and the crops are going to work on these

752
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:30,960
soccer man finger millet

753
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,919
and uh this coffee the plan that jovia

754
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,319
asked for

755
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,159
this year is that she wants to conduct

756
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,240
her finger millet and sodom

757
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,520
value chain and do like a market

758
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,839
analysis

759
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:42,960
to document the drivers for adoption of

760
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:46,398
technologies

761
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:50,798
so and then she wants to identify

762
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:54,879
sources of resistance to some stresses

763
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:59,038
and also nutritional quality

764
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:01,200
sources she wants to um

765
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:02,798
do regime and molecular market discovery

766
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,640
for normal traits

767
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:06,240
and develop and optimize tools and

768
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,559
methods for efficient

769
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,399
phenotyping and rapid regeneration

770
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:12,079
regeneration and advancement of

771
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:14,398
desirable traits

772
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:15,839
and digitized virgin programs for

773
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:19,518
targeted breeding

774
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:23,439
in east east africa

775
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,679
and this work is is very

776
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,038
very important because we know that

777
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,759
having the right

778
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:31,919
tools technologies and methods they will

779
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:33,519
be able to execute this and she also

780
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,759
wants to um

781
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,359
build like an irrigation system because

782
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:41,519
i understand that um

783
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:44,839
it's a semi-arid area so they lack

784
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:48,159
this drought so to have

785
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:49,918
more to expand the nurseries they need

786
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,399
to be able to keep the plants alive

787
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,720
so and they need water so these are one

788
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:58,558
of the major investments

789
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:02,079
that we are going to um be making

790
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:04,879
and the next uh uh center of innovation

791
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:08,158
is the crop innovation in west africa

792
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:11,919
see why it's led by guido

793
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:15,200
and um the pi kopi

794
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,840
is uh mermaid and uh we have affiliated

795
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,240
um

796
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:19,199
countries in burkina faso in era and uh

797
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,240
in brad

798
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,200
immediate and the crops they're working

799
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,480
on is um

800
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,759
pramilit sorghum and kerby the work they

801
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,360
have

802
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:34,798
set up to um do in in year one is to

803
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:39,119
update their existing

804
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:42,558
reading product profiles to seek

805
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:46,158
to understand adoption differences

806
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:47,278
and improve like accept market access

807
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,799
accessibility

808
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:54,720
uh for the sogom the permanent and

809
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:57,038
copy and you want to implement more than

810
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,000
ttms for arabic discovery and validation

811
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:00,640
of

812
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,440
traits for genetic gain and product

813
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,960
concept

814
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,200
development and also it wants to use

815
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,640
some genomic selection and

816
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,080
whole genome prediction of carb breeding

817
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,799
values using simulation

818
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:15,439
and gs pipelines for optimizing the west

819
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:18,319
african reading programs

820
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,640
and it's going to do this using uh

821
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:21,918
modernized phenotyping and data capture

822
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,038
platforms

823
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:27,679
of breeding pipelines and ultimately

824
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:31,440
digitize breeding activities

825
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:33,600
and fair data and that face the capacity

826
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,080
of computational systems to assess

827
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,759
to find access interoperability and

828
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:41,199
reuse data

829
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:44,000
and now the last

830
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,960
center is the center of innovation for

831
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,319
crop improvement

832
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,840
for east and southern africa and is led

833
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:52,079
by

834
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:54,079
michael chipetter who is the principal

835
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:58,480
investigator and

836
00:33:54,079 --> 00:34:02,398
and jessica is a cool is a copyi

837
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:06,480
in malawi and the partner countries

838
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:08,719
are mozambique and tanzania

839
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,559
and they are located in longwoo

840
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,319
university of agriculture and natural

841
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:16,639
resources

842
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:21,679
and they're working on happy

843
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:23,599
so is um here one plan

844
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,079
is uh to conduct genetic gender

845
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:29,200
sensitive healthy value chain analysis

846
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:31,599
and that is um more of designing like

847
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:34,878
study tools and framework

848
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,679
for comprehensive gender sensitive copy

849
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:38,000
value chain

850
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,358
analysis using questionnaires and

851
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,559
checklists

852
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:45,759
and conduct trade preference uh

853
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:49,599
surveys and is going to characterize

854
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:52,720
phenotypic and genomic diversity calpe

855
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:55,200
gem plasm you know

856
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,078
um phenotype selective geoplasm or

857
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,279
britain lines

858
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,079
and collect for key traits in multiple

859
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,440
sites

860
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:05,280
and it's going to genotype some of the

861
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:10,559
calcium geoplasm

862
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:12,960
and we sequence copy from the lines

863
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,159
and just like some nutrition variety

864
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,800
profiling and

865
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:19,199
under developing and selecting more

866
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,359
productive and nutritious copy lines

867
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,118
they will

868
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:25,279
it's basically selecting like the best

869
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,480
parental lines for generating

870
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,640
crosses and i included copper's

871
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:35,199
development here

872
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:38,639
as an important um

873
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:42,000
an important part of

874
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:44,639
our work in in uc

875
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,760
it's important that the develop capacity

876
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:50,559
so that they can

877
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:53,599
self sustain and they're going to train

878
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:56,480
on deployment and implementation of

879
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,160
ems in malawi you want to train on

880
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,320
gender responsive breeding

881
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:03,039
and training genomics enabled breeding

882
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:06,800
and informatics it's it's clear that

883
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:08,719
they lack all these tools so

884
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,640
these are some of the targets and you

885
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:12,879
want to ultimately train

886
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:14,960
post-graduate students and project

887
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,230
personnel who can

888
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,039
continue to

889
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:22,880
[Music]

890
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:24,960
work in this three countries

891
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,240
so if they have this capacity

892
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,358
institutional

893
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:31,838
development they can

894
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:35,039
you know be self-reliant or to continue

895
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:37,519
to sustain themselves so

896
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:39,440
um that's i think that's very very

897
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:42,960
important

898
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:46,480
um part of their

899
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:49,760
year one plans and with that

900
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:52,719
i have come to the end of my of my

901
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,240
talk and i'm excited that um we are

902
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:57,598
working on these

903
00:36:54,239 --> 00:37:00,639
different regions because i believe

904
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,880
that uc is strategically positioned

905
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:03,679
to deploy crop improvement research to

906
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,280
the narys

907
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:11,279
and one of the take-homes

908
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,200
is that nari is our brand we are working

909
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,280
for the narratives

910
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:16,239
so that they can be self-reliant they

911
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,839
can

912
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:23,199
self-sustain they can breed their own

913
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:27,199
crops just so that they can

914
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:30,159
um eliminate

915
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:32,879
food insecurity and i believe that our

916
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:35,759
cows and quick win research

917
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,400
will ancillary breeding locally and

918
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,920
originally adapted crop varieties

919
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:45,280
that target small older farmers and

920
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:48,159
other seeds systems related outreach

921
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,119
so that their work and their product can

922
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:52,319
be received

923
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:55,519
by the end users and

924
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,960
families and people that need the seats

925
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:59,119
and ultimately

926
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,079
of course that's the ultimate goal to

927
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,680
advance

928
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,400
and fulfill the three um global food

929
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:07,440
security

930
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,880
strategy which is economic growth

931
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:14,079
resilience and human nutrition with this

932
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:18,800
i'd like to thank our partners

933
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:22,400
um from kansas state clemson

934
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,400
and i'll see you guys and i've come to

935
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:32,480
