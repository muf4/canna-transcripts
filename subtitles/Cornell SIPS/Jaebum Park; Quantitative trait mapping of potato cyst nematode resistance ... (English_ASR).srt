1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,740
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:06,740
University okay

3
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:13,429
and today I'm going to talk about

4
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:17,129
QTL mapping or potato cyst nematode

5
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:19,460
resistance and to trace up to agronomic

6
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:21,989
trace in

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,719
I've performed really from research

8
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:26,909
project evaluating to merkel markers for

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,910
selecting potato system at the recent

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,609
clone and cutie analysis of new potato

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,799
cyst nematode registers and cutie

12
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:37,200
analysis of cheap coal and specific

13
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,839
gravity so to help you understanding I

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:45,240
start with introduction of potato cyst

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:47,720
nematode there are one of them is global

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:51,450
Durazo Kenzie's another one is global

17
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:56,670
they also have a common name old golden

18
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:59,880
nematode and this picture shows a

19
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:03,048
juvenile stage of the and for your

20
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:08,670
convenience for today I'm going to use

21
00:01:03,048 --> 00:01:12,719
these two impulses limit or this

22
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,790
pathogen is a soil borne pathogen and it

23
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,129
has a really stable dormant stage which

24
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,580
is called cyst according to the one

25
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:23,670
report the nematode could survive for

26
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:27,209
over 30 years over 30 years by

27
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,430
maintaining this and also it is it can

28
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:34,469
be easily transferred by our management

29
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:37,680
so because of these features it's very

30
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:42,000
hard to eradicate or control these

31
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:45,030
passages in the United States the golden

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,120
limited is distributed in a new here and

33
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:52,950
a pearl cyst nematode distributed in an

34
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:55,140
idle detection of the potassium at would

35
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,719
always initiate crunching action and

36
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,079
trading embargo and this is one of the

37
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:03,599
three most serious potato passing in the

38
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,090
world according to the atheist if golden

39
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,579
tomatoes became widely prevalent without

40
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,580
appropriate control and your loss would

41
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,890
reach four point eight but I think

42
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:18,510
instead of this tax I think this picture

43
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:21,179
will dispensary it is these bags are

44
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:24,060
showing the potato yield from the non

45
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,730
infested field and these bags represent

46
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,060
potentially from infested field and you

47
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:35,780
can see it like a huge difference so

48
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:35,780
this there's a reason why I study golden

49
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:43,479
in 1941 the golden immortal was first

50
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,030
observed in a united state especially in

51
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:48,669
a Nassau County on a Long Island yoke

52
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:51,280
and after the first detection golden

53
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:53,798
nematode especially pastime ro one of

54
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,269
the golden nematode gradually appeared

55
00:02:53,799 --> 00:03:01,719
in eight other counties at this moment

56
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:06,700
let me briefly explain how we can divide

57
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:08,560
into the different pests type if any

58
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:12,848
amount for example if a name I told you

59
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:16,259
take a sample from this is there are

60
00:03:12,848 --> 00:03:20,229
multiple ways but the dermatologist

61
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:22,449
inoculate the tenth take the samples on

62
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:25,179
that these three different are wild

63
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:28,659
potato species and if the nematode can

64
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:31,269
survive on one plant we can put the plus

65
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:34,239
sign and if the nematode cannot survive

66
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:36,789
aware we produce we can put - so by

67
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,030
combining this wizard we can divide into

68
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:42,189
the multiple pencil types golden

69
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:45,068
nematode composed of five different pest

70
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:48,729
types and El Sistema toad is composed of

71
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:51,539
three different pests type and I just

72
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:54,729
want to emphasize that person Arawa has

73
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:57,009
predominant pest type for a long time

74
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:59,469
not only in many European countries but

75
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:01,598
also in a New York state so many

76
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:05,500
researchers put an effort and time to

77
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:09,399
buy raises resistance genes effective to

78
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:11,379
the dispatched type fortunately they

79
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,049
could find h1 gene which is very

80
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:15,848
effective against the pests at erawan it

81
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:19,840
is known to be located on a chromosome

82
00:04:15,848 --> 00:04:22,899
five and the many potato breeding

83
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,949
program in the world using his genes was

84
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:27,069
really successful

85
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:30,159
for example Cornell breeding could

86
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:33,819
release 24 potato varieties which equal

87
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,570
to h1 and of course this potato various

88
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:39,728
works well to control the damage of

89
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:43,180
pests are one however there was one

90
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:45,610
drawback in a potato program when it

91
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,199
comes to the water basins because we

92
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:52,490
still relied on

93
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:55,218
bioassay so to reduce the amount of the

94
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:59,090
bio say maybe Markos this election is

95
00:04:55,218 --> 00:05:02,199
one of a good option you know that so I

96
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:06,579
start to evaluate these two markers

97
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:09,288
which don't to be tightly linked to the

98
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:11,359
so from now on I'm going to explain how

99
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:14,089
I evaluate that to more ocular markers

100
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:21,968
or selecting our one resistance potato

101
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:25,068
closer to all 50 similar marker and GGC

102
00:05:21,968 --> 00:05:27,199
pike this is one of the core of the

103
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:29,710
potato and this is known to be

104
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,449
resistance against the arrow one and

105
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:36,728
catalan is susceptible

106
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:40,129
Kirti burn so I use these both registers

107
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:42,468
control and susceptible control as you

108
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:46,310
can see in this picture are raisins

109
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:50,319
clump produce 450 based here PCR product

110
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:53,750
and susceptible chrome produce 1,000 500

111
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,729
base pair PCR product and when I tested

112
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:58,120
other breeding clones or cultivars I

113
00:05:55,728 --> 00:06:02,538
could get the same result like this way

114
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:05,689
when I tested the TG 6 8 9 marker from

115
00:06:02,538 --> 00:06:08,209
the race alone I could see it 114 base

116
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:11,270
pierre-pierre product and I could not

117
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:16,658
see any PCR product from the susceptible

118
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:20,359
ones because of that I also use PCA to

119
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:22,998
check the piece of quality so for your

120
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:26,509
convenience I'm going to use plus sign

121
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:29,389
for presents of the phone here when it

122
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:31,999
comes to the 57 our PCR test and I'm

123
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:37,370
going to use negative sign or presence

124
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:40,300
of the one when I talking about the 57

125
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:43,370
armor and I'm going to use plus sign for

126
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:47,899
present working base pair PCR product

127
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:51,588
when I talk about a PCR test and absence

128
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:56,538
of the this piece of work will be marked

129
00:06:51,588 --> 00:06:59,870
as a negative sign so I first tested 38

130
00:06:56,538 --> 00:07:01,939
potato kurta burrs and as I expected

131
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:04,399
before the markers work

132
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:09,069
quite well for example when I tested all

133
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:13,939
20 susceptible culture balls all pcs

134
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:17,149
negative wizard and when I tested 18

135
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:21,680
recent score to verse 17 obey me shows

136
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:25,009
party 57 are and 14 clones was positive

137
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,500
for TG 6 8 9 of course there are some

138
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:29,839
exceptions such as and over IVA and King

139
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:33,800
Harry and the word shows negative and

140
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:35,750
even though this is r1 resistance and

141
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,000
IVA and King Harry showed the negative

142
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,550
response from the TG 6 8 9 P searches

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,199
even though those are our reasons so I

144
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:47,210
suppose it is caused by the

145
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:49,519
recombination event so now I start to

146
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:52,579
talk about how I tested a corner

147
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:56,509
breeding cause my purpose was to test

148
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:59,060
whether the two markers work well in a

149
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:03,459
cone a potato breeding program or nah so

150
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:06,589
I collected 342 help reading clones and

151
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:09,439
perform the exact the same test by OSA

152
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:13,099
and two PCR tests and this table

153
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:15,620
summarized all the research as you can

154
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:19,340
see here there are multiple combination

155
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:22,780
so depending on the combination of the

156
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:25,310
research of the test and the bio say I

157
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:29,119
could divide into the 8 different cases

158
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:32,500
for example if a clump was racence in a

159
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:36,110
BIOS and show the positive research in a

160
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:39,320
57 R and the TG 6 8 9 a clone belong to

161
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:42,080
case 1 and if another Club which is

162
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,440
susceptible and show the negative

163
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:49,810
response from the to PCR test account

164
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:53,840
belong to case 8 so as I expected before

165
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:57,289
majority raises clone belong to keep

166
00:08:53,840 --> 00:09:01,790
Swan and Buzzard is susceptible clothes

167
00:08:57,289 --> 00:09:03,829
belong to case 8 8 and rest of them are

168
00:09:01,789 --> 00:09:06,110
cause I believe because of the

169
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:09,230
recombination so I'm going to call from

170
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:13,700
case 2 to 7 as a mismatches for your

171
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:15,800
convenience so order to be relative

172
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,530
small number a 6 1

173
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:21,349
and so on but when I saw the case for

174
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:24,350
compared to the other mismatches case

175
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:27,320
for shillelagh to a higher number so I'm

176
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:35,840
going to come back in the following

177
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:38,120
slide once I test the 342 clones I also

178
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,980
calculated prediction positive

179
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,320
prediction value and negative predictive

180
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:45,379
value positive prediction barriers are

181
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,540
calculated by determining the percentage

182
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:50,000
of fall with the marker that were a

183
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:52,309
distance beggar a prediction values were

184
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,279
calculated by determining the percentage

185
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:58,339
of the potato clothes licking the marker

186
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:01,039
they were susceptible so as you can see

187
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:04,759
in this table both markers really well

188
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:08,689
especially for positive prediction this

189
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:10,970
means was used so the positive response

190
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:14,410
from the PCR test the Clones has a

191
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:17,480
really high chance to have h1 gene in it

192
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:20,629
on the other hand negative preaching was

193
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,460
much lower however this cannot be a big

194
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:25,159
problem for the breeding purpose because

195
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:28,430
we potato breeders just focusing on

196
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:30,350
selecting raisin scone we are not

197
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:32,539
interested in as selecting susceptible

198
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:37,220
clothes so we conclude that from this

199
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:39,649
wizard the to PCR marker 57 rtv6 8/9 can

200
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:44,660
be applied into the corner future corner

201
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:47,990
breeding program okay now let me go back

202
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:52,009
to case for game so as you can see here

203
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:55,490
even though these balls are resistance

204
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:57,889
they show negative response from the to

205
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:02,180
PCR so to figure out what happening here

206
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:04,789
I go back to the list of the case for so

207
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:08,059
second column shows a list of the case

208
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:08,569
for clones and third chrome and FORSCOM

209
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:12,049
shows

210
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:15,140
parents information of each corn and why

211
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:18,259
analyzing this table I realized that the

212
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:21,289
clone Eve 48 dish too frequently

213
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:24,590
appeared as a either male parent or a

214
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:27,529
female parent for these clones so III

215
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:29,350
Reaper form the same bio are saying that

216
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:32,889
to PCR test for

217
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,750
- - interestingly I could not see any

218
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:38,409
difference compared to the general our

219
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:41,649
residents club so this shows resistance

220
00:11:38,409 --> 00:11:44,529
in a bioassay and also + response from

221
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:46,569
57 are and then ttcc a name so a quite

222
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:50,259
similar to the general our own race is

223
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,760
closed so I go back to the pedigree

224
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:54,490
information of this clone and

225
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:56,850
interesting I realized that Solon and

226
00:11:54,490 --> 00:12:00,180
virtuality this is one of the wild POTUS

227
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:02,050
wild potato species and these pictures

228
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:04,870
predominantly in a pedigree of the

229
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:07,839
eforea h2 according to the dilemma at

230
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:11,470
all some accession of this wild total

231
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:15,820
species all races are won so I suppose

232
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:18,519
that all previous breeders interpret an

233
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:22,060
unknown erawan racing genes came from

234
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:25,059
the s portunity so I thought that he

235
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:28,599
forged edge to include not only h1g

236
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:32,139
others so another race is located on

237
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:39,930
another chromosome may be so in research

238
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:43,059
in those kinds of on mismatch so this is

239
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:46,389
first research project so now I'm going

240
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:50,049
to explain QTL analysis of new potato

241
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:53,429
cyst nematode you put a cyst nematode

242
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:56,529
resistance as I mentioned before

243
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:58,989
first-time Arawa have been predominant

244
00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:04,179
pestle for a long time in New York State

245
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:06,399
however in 1995 the new pastime r2 was

246
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:09,009
first discovered in the Stephan count in

247
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:12,519
the New York and the problem was that

248
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:15,519
the 18 races is not effective against

249
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:20,679
our - there's a reason why I started QT

250
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:22,929
analysis of our own two registers for

251
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:25,719
this analysis for this research project

252
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:28,679
I prepared 36 population which came from

253
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:32,050
the cross between and I want 21 and

254
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:33,939
these two parents are Otto tetraploid

255
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:35,839
potatoes and both of them are

256
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:38,660
heterozygous potato

257
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,210
and and I want to and one is r1

258
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:46,219
resistance and n I'm 115 is a lot too

259
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:50,780
susceptible for QTL mapping I use 182

260
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:53,240
protein for genotyping I use a

261
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:55,549
circumcision this is quite useful too

262
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,529
because this is composed of eight

263
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:59,839
thousand three hundred three snip

264
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:03,789
position so I can have a higher chance

265
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:06,470
to find some future position or so

266
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:09,679
reference for each sniffs are available

267
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:13,220
from the spool database so you can find

268
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:15,799
the location of specification such as

269
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,320
chromosome number physical position and

270
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:22,309
also a short description for related

271
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,260
genes so after scanning the DNA sample

272
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:26,809
of the white 36 population with

273
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:29,689
dissociative I could get the raw data

274
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:32,750
which is called para score or a terrible

275
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:36,490
you fellows quiz like a number so I have

276
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:40,490
to trim transform from Farah score to

277
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:44,750
general genotype data such as a AAA or a

278
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:49,549
a a B a a B D and so on so as after

279
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:50,929
transforming the genotype data I load on

280
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:53,929
a one software which is called

281
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:57,469
tetraploid slim and tetrapods new map is

282
00:14:53,929 --> 00:15:02,349
specially designed for QTL analysis of

283
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:04,879
photo tetraploid so after loading the

284
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:08,029
Selective slim marker on a dis software

285
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,769
as we can imagine the order markers are

286
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:12,409
mixed to each other and through the

287
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:14,929
clustering function belong to this

288
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:16,939
software I could collect

289
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:19,279
steam markers which are on the same

290
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:22,640
chromosome so a potato are composed of

291
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:25,759
12 chromosomes so each circle represent

292
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,879
each cause in this case so through the

293
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,350
ordering step I could rearrange that the

294
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:33,610
selected marker which are on the same

295
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:36,800
chromosome in an order like this way and

296
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:38,659
then through the fading step I could

297
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:41,809
decide which of the four home allows

298
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:44,329
each marker which I relies on like this

299
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:47,329
way at this point

300
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:49,759
unlike the diploid cutie analysis like a

301
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:52,910
generative process

302
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,490
some manual process are necessary for

303
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:58,129
fading in the auto tetraploid QT

304
00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:02,419
analysis so compared to the diploid

305
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:06,100
unisys these process take more time so

306
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:09,139
after completing I could get linkage map

307
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,889
this is one of the example of the

308
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:15,319
linkage map since I cross the two

309
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:18,199
heterozygous parents I could draw two

310
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,690
different sets of genetic map in this

311
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:24,410
case home alone one two four represent

312
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:26,180
for home loss of the NI 121 and home

313
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:29,259
alone five to eight represent for

314
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:32,539
homeowners of the ni 115 and left side

315
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:38,419
representing the genetic male all shapes

316
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:41,799
markers are combined at this point I'm

317
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:44,029
going to share the challenges that I

318
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:46,579
encountered while performing the Auto

319
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:49,720
tetraploid QTL mapping unlike the

320
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:52,490
general of people oilskin calling

321
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:58,190
tetraploid sim cooling a little bit

322
00:16:52,490 --> 00:17:00,560
difficult let me share one example if a

323
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:04,840
cow in this case the graph showing the

324
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:09,529
ferrous core value so x axis represent

325
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:11,389
ferrous score from zero to one and you

326
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:13,970
don't need to worry about Y axis in this

327
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:20,330
case because these y axis relates you to

328
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:22,279
the polity so if a clone has an AAA age

329
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:26,269
you know type generally the clone

330
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:30,619
centered on zero and if another clone

331
00:17:26,269 --> 00:17:34,970
has a a a a B it calls general centered

332
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:39,409
on 2025 and if another clone has a AABB

333
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:41,930
the clone centered on 0.5 and so on so

334
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:44,480
if the clones are well distributed like

335
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:46,600
the first example you can easily assign

336
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,519
appropriate genotype for each clone

337
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:52,849
however look at the disk as you can see

338
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:54,769
here even though there are multiple

339
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:58,879
cluster it's not easy to assign

340
00:17:54,769 --> 00:18:02,210
appropriate you know so I spent a lot of

341
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,770
time for like a best or appropriate you

342
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:07,100
know assigning best

343
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:10,309
genotype so I was I have been struggling

344
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:13,279
for a long time but fortunately in 2017

345
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:15,200
Jeffrey released a new our package

346
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:19,660
called The Closer Pole and I can

347
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:22,250
overcome these difficulties or so before

348
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,420
the Tetra piscina that I use for

349
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,299
security analysis

350
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,660
there was only one software which is

351
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:29,779
called

352
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:31,970
tetraploid actually this is previous

353
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:34,339
version of the tetra place a map and it

354
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,319
has a lot of limitation or one of the

355
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:38,629
one example would be the number of the

356
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:40,909
same market that I can use only less

357
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:43,910
than 50 slim markers can be used for

358
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:47,210
each cause and if I rely on this that

359
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:53,000
means I I can lose many many chance to

360
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:56,779
find significant shipping so before then

361
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,920
I could not find a significant future

362
00:18:56,779 --> 00:19:03,970
people but once I started use tetra

363
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,539
persian releasing it I could find

364
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:07,069
significant future

365
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:10,299
Hicks relate you to the arrow to

366
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:13,839
resistance and finally there are still

367
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:16,730
many all steps are doing the links map

368
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:18,919
so as I mentioned before compared to the

369
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:21,589
deployed general deployed GTO mapping

370
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:27,759
what a tetraploid gto mapping takes more

371
00:19:21,589 --> 00:19:30,589
time so thanks to the newly released

372
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,990
softwares I could get the excellent

373
00:19:30,589 --> 00:19:38,029
genome coverage in my case I could

374
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:40,039
select 2061 3 markers to cover 12

375
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:42,200
chromosomes and as you can see here

376
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:43,430
Seaver 100 markers can cover each

377
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,470
chromosome that means I can have a

378
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:48,019
higher chance to find choose your pick

379
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:50,390
and look at the map coverage as you can

380
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:54,019
see here majority of them's are covered

381
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:56,450
by the same markers or I like a 99% so

382
00:19:54,019 --> 00:20:00,619
as a reason I could get really excellent

383
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:03,920
genome coverage this picture shows us a

384
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:06,769
marker that I use the green color

385
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,380
represents a marker segregated in a ni

386
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:12,829
115 and where the color represent the

387
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:15,290
same marker segregate on ni 121 and

388
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:17,019
black color represent same marker

389
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:20,049
segregate in both parents

390
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:24,029
and as you can see here same markers

391
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:28,240
well distributed across the chromosome

392
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:30,579
okay now to complete the QTL mapping I

393
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,500
had to blow the field tech data on the

394
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:35,139
Tetra person in map so I'm going to

395
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:39,160
explain how I measure the potentiometer

396
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:41,830
resistance after I prepare the y 36

397
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:44,920
population I planted into each pot in a

398
00:20:41,829 --> 00:20:47,559
greenhouse and then after two weeks

399
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:50,140
later I inoculate eight thousand bags

400
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:54,519
into each pot like this way and then

401
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:58,509
kept going for ten weeks once the plants

402
00:20:54,519 --> 00:21:01,720
start to wilt I transfer all soil and

403
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:05,890
plant material into paper bag and hey

404
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:09,339
wait for one month or drying period once

405
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:11,259
the old samples are completely dried the

406
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:15,869
samples are transferred to the fennec

407
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:18,430
for now he's a silver color fun family

408
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:20,500
especially designed for separating cysts

409
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,690
from the dirt so with a high-pressure

410
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:26,710
water and this funnel I could separate

411
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:29,590
this from the dirt and plant matures the

412
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:32,319
collected sees were couched under the

413
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:34,569
microscope like this way so as I

414
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:37,539
mentioned before this by us it takes a

415
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:40,450
lot of time for example I have to I had

416
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:42,789
to spend three months is for growing and

417
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:45,930
inflation and another one months for

418
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:48,940
drank beer and based on one labor force

419
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:52,180
pending funnel process can be performed

420
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:55,509
only for twenty to twenty-five cents per

421
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:57,880
day and counting process can be

422
00:21:55,509 --> 00:22:01,450
performed less than 20 samples per day

423
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:04,240
so in my case I use them for replication

424
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:06,880
so I had to grow around like eight

425
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,329
hundred sixty samples in a greenhouse so

426
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,700
as your readers to whole process I had

427
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:17,379
to use around like a one year so as you

428
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:20,100
can see here reducing this pile say

429
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:25,050
about it's really important for

430
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:25,049
selecting memo to recess

431
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,940
after getting the fee note original

432
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,859
phenotype data I transformed to the bow

433
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,690
10 because or you know a phenotype they

434
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:36,209
asked you toward the right side too much

435
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:37,470
once I transform I could get the

436
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:40,410
distribution close to the normal

437
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:44,700
distribution and I load this data on the

438
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:46,560
teacher person in the two pairs located

439
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,860
here and here

440
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,990
and this is the wall of example the Qt

441
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:55,679
oh man especially chromosome 5 to tell

442
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:57,750
map and in this case x axis represent

443
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:02,610
the genetic map position you need

444
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:05,730
centimorgan and y axis represent low

445
00:23:02,609 --> 00:23:09,000
score and we found the two significant

446
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:12,140
significant to TIA pics on clothes on

447
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,680
5:26 centimorgan with the lowest scores

448
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:20,250
13.4 and the second-largest future pics

449
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:23,100
at 59 centimorgan with a low score 6.6

450
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:25,710
and it's the worker mention before I was

451
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:28,109
really happy with getting this picture

452
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:30,690
because I spend around like a 5 to 6

453
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:32,869
years to see this picture so actually

454
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:35,100
when I get this one I complain about

455
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:38,689
taking a lot of time and while

456
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:38,689
discussing the worth of an even worth it

457
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:51,930
we was getting this picture

458
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:55,370
so actually QT losses was completed here

459
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:58,980
however we was wondering whether this

460
00:23:55,369 --> 00:24:01,769
represent previously known Nemo 2 with

461
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:05,789
resistance genes or not I suspect that

462
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:07,889
this would represent h1g because the h1

463
00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:10,649
gene is known to be eastern end of the

464
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:14,970
long arm of the chromosome 5 and also I

465
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:17,400
suspect this gene represent a disc

466
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:20,640
YouTube big represent TRP Onegin because

467
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,400
JP 1 gene is known to be racist suppose

468
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,290
all the nematode and a pulse is limited

469
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:29,250
as well as it is also located on a

470
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:31,819
chromosome 5 so to characterize these

471
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:35,730
two QTL pigs I added two additional

472
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:38,279
tests one of them is PCR test with a

473
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:41,460
57-ton marker so basically I performed a

474
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:43,319
PCR test or by 36 population with a

475
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:46,829
57-ton marker which is known to be

476
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:48,659
linked to the h1 gene and then I use the

477
00:24:46,829 --> 00:24:51,659
piece year we served as a phenotype data

478
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:58,950
or tetra prism or so I could map the

479
00:24:51,660 --> 00:25:00,930
location of 57 R or I can say h1 gene or

480
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:03,210
so thanks to the support of the doctor

481
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:05,880
Dan join in a universal Idol I could

482
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:09,390
achieve the Jeep elevations data of the

483
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:16,890
the same mapping population wide 36 so I

484
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:20,310
also load this and this is a wizard so

485
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:23,160
the second picture shows our two races

486
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:27,839
and third picture shows fifty seven or

487
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:32,120
eight and the last picture shows cheap

488
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:36,089
holiday raisins chutiya pa tooth

489
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:39,479
solution to Slayer 3 means a mixture or

490
00:25:36,089 --> 00:25:42,389
pass type two and three so when I check

491
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:46,740
the location as you can sit here

492
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:49,380
it was located which is very close to

493
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:52,230
the second pick of the hour to distance

494
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:55,830
and when I check the Jeep a little

495
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:57,569
resistance future pick it was perfectly

496
00:25:55,829 --> 00:26:00,809
matched with the most significant

497
00:25:57,569 --> 00:26:03,500
significant shooter pic of the arrow to

498
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:07,049
business so from these videos I also

499
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:10,579
confirmed that these second life your

500
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:13,829
pig represent each one gene and this

501
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:17,189
future pig represent GRP one because as

502
00:26:13,829 --> 00:26:19,230
I mentioned before geography one GRP one

503
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:22,289
gene is known to be racist

504
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:22,920
both olden a metal and hell cyst

505
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,799
nematode

506
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:28,230
and also I thought that h1 gene appears

507
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:30,629
to provide some races against our two

508
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:33,900
presumably due to the presence of the

509
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:36,480
low percentage ro1 in our two population

510
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:41,060
I just want to mention at this point is

511
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:44,130
that originally our to obtain from the

512
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:47,159
field which he initially infested with

513
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:50,580
Esther our one so the original our two

514
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:54,060
samples mixed with a small amount of the

515
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:56,309
r1 so I suppose it may be a twenty

516
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:58,769
nurse' works for this study but further

517
00:26:56,309 --> 00:27:01,970
analysis of course should be following

518
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:01,970
to clarify

519
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:10,029
so I also checked a percent of bears

520
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:12,640
explained at each position when I check

521
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:14,920
the our two races at the 2016 theme

522
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:21,270
organ I'm going to call for convenience

523
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:23,890
ro to a it shows 24% percent of bears

524
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:26,558
experience it's quite high and when I

525
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:31,600
check the GPL resistance you ticket here

526
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:35,710
which I'm going to use P a 2/3 a and

527
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:37,209
this also show 9.2 percent of bears

528
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:39,610
explained also dams are quite

529
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:43,779
significant and when I take this

530
00:27:39,609 --> 00:27:47,289
position our two basins pick at here I'm

531
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:51,099
going to call our to be and these are

532
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:54,190
such explained 13 so also them seem to

533
00:27:51,099 --> 00:27:55,740
be really important position or our two

534
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:59,679
reasons

535
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:02,019
and based on the information provided by

536
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:05,440
the Tetra placed in May I marked a

537
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:07,359
two-tail position on the genetic map so

538
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,420
as I mentioned before Homo I want to

539
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:12,849
four represent one and five to eight

540
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:16,830
represent for homes and then 115 and as

541
00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:22,359
you can see here ro to a and our PA to

542
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:25,329
3/8 or oval at each other and when I

543
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:28,029
check the ro to be and location both

544
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:33,399
stems are almost the same location as

545
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:38,289
well as same home alone 3 and 6 so I

546
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:41,800
also support the idea that this area

547
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:47,409
include ERP 1g and these two areas

548
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:49,659
include h1 actually this is redundant or

549
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:52,390
extra research project but for double

550
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:55,660
checking these two position I also

551
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:57,580
perform that she was the with the

552
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,679
software released by the Jeff endermans

553
00:28:57,579 --> 00:29:02,379
group our our our blog and she was

554
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:06,429
pulley so basically I use the exactly

555
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:09,000
same marker data and the phenotype data

556
00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:11,769
and as you can sit here

557
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:16,089
both of them's are perfectly matched

558
00:29:11,769 --> 00:29:18,960
because the top picture shows

559
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:23,589
a genetic map that I developed before so

560
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:27,490
the most coldest sneak marker was c2 503

561
00:29:23,589 --> 00:29:32,980
one and the most closely marker 259

562
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:35,700
centimorgan was C 2 4 5 4 3 6 5 and as

563
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:39,700
you can see here when I checked a few

564
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:42,788
out when I checked up 57 to tear through

565
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:45,940
the G was the the most significant

566
00:29:42,788 --> 00:29:48,879
future people okay Don a slim marker c2

567
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,509
5 or 360 which is perfectly matching

568
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,610
with this one

569
00:29:49,509 --> 00:29:53,890
and when I checked the r2 resistance

570
00:29:51,609 --> 00:29:56,859
there were two peak and when I check

571
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:59,380
their location this one matches with the

572
00:29:56,859 --> 00:30:02,979
Disney marker and this one matches with

573
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:06,010
Disney marker so his G was study also

574
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:07,870
support the idea that these two

575
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:12,970
positions are really important for our

576
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:16,778
two registers so based on these measures

577
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:20,140
our left decide to develop diagnostic

578
00:30:16,778 --> 00:30:22,148
marker actually shooting she's a lab

579
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:25,720
technician yeah laughs oh let it develop

580
00:30:22,148 --> 00:30:29,288
1 caps marker H oh she start from the C

581
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:32,519
to 5 and when she tested the newly

582
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:35,859
designed marker with the some several

583
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:39,190
reasons contraceptive clones now at this

584
00:30:35,859 --> 00:30:41,859
point the results are well matched so we

585
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:43,630
are going to test more clones not only

586
00:30:41,859 --> 00:30:47,109
in Europe breeding controllers in other

587
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:49,090
states such as Idol we try to apply the

588
00:30:47,109 --> 00:30:53,349
newly designed caps marker into the

589
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:56,379
corner breeding program okay

590
00:30:53,349 --> 00:30:59,259
I'm going to star the Cutie of cheap

591
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:01,000
color and the specific gravity these two

592
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:05,019
traits are really important in a potato

593
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,450
chipping industry because the lighter

594
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:09,759
color potato chip if you guys open the

595
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:11,620
lace you can see really white color from

596
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:15,009
the chips those colors are really

597
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:16,798
preferred by America so whenever we do

598
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:19,808
the breeding program we wanted to select

599
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:21,940
lighter potato chip color or so

600
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:24,639
specifically important since it is

601
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:27,429
always related to starch content and

602
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:31,000
starch density so this reason why I

603
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:34,298
perform this research project with the

604
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:38,829
same population that I used in a new

605
00:31:34,298 --> 00:31:40,119
motor which is nematode study so I use

606
00:31:38,829 --> 00:31:42,788
the same mapping population wide

607
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:45,158
pharisee population the two parents

608
00:31:42,788 --> 00:31:48,548
shows I could color by especially and I

609
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:51,340
was is extremely light or chip color

610
00:31:48,548 --> 00:31:55,119
compared to the other curricular so this

611
00:31:51,339 --> 00:31:58,808
is quite useful clone for selecting or

612
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:03,099
developing chip chipping potato and in

613
00:31:58,808 --> 00:32:06,548
this case I use the 195 cones or two TL

614
00:32:03,099 --> 00:32:08,730
nemesis now I'm going to explain how I

615
00:32:06,548 --> 00:32:11,889
measure the chip : the specific gravity

616
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:15,308
for measuring a chip color I use nine

617
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:18,640
scale this is one two three and this is

618
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:22,629
nine and to measure the specific gravity

619
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:27,520
I use this equation weight in air /

620
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:32,289
weight in air - weight in water and I

621
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:36,609
have measure during four years from 2010

622
00:32:32,288 --> 00:32:38,558
to 2013 so when I am targeting the

623
00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:41,649
phenotype data I calculate the process

624
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:43,869
heritability for each trait and as you

625
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:46,210
can see it here both of them shows well

626
00:32:43,869 --> 00:32:49,839
to be higher purity abilities chip color

627
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:55,360
was coin or unlike a7 and specific race

628
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:58,899
is 0.75 and after that I transform the

629
00:32:55,359 --> 00:33:01,629
original phenotype data to the below

630
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:04,419
there are a couple of reasons first of

631
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:07,250
all the original field data does not

632
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:10,360
show really good no more

633
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:12,829
so once i transformed to the blob is

634
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:15,949
much better no more distribution like

635
00:33:12,829 --> 00:33:18,049
this way or so when I tested when I

636
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:22,640
perform the Qt analysis we the original

637
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:25,399
phenotype data I couldn't not see the Qt

638
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,130
of pics which he consistently showed

639
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:30,920
showed up on our same position

640
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:34,010
well after I transformed the blob I

641
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:36,259
could see many qts which he showed up on

642
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:38,869
the same position on the same chromosome

643
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:42,890
so I suppose it may be those are because

644
00:33:38,869 --> 00:33:46,069
of the G by E effect so by transforming

645
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:52,340
to the block I could more focus on

646
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:56,659
genetic effect so after getting the blob

647
00:33:52,339 --> 00:34:00,909
data I could I can compare first of all

648
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:03,920
across the year and also I can compare I

649
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:07,040
checked the correlation between a chip

650
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:09,829
color and the specific gravity so as you

651
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:12,980
can see in this table there is no big

652
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:15,590
difference between two years when I see

653
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:18,168
the specific gravity all correlations

654
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:20,480
around like a nine so really there's no

655
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:22,609
difference and even though chip color

656
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,800
shows little to be smaller collation

657
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:27,019
compared to specifically but steer is

658
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,649
quite high or most of them shows over

659
00:34:27,019 --> 00:34:32,360
seven a point seven so I couldn't not

660
00:34:30,648 --> 00:34:34,460
see huge difference across the year and

661
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:37,250
when I check the correlation between

662
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:39,740
chip color and the specific gravity I

663
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:41,269
could see a negative correlation even

664
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:43,729
though the value itself is relatively

665
00:34:41,269 --> 00:34:46,190
small but this is quite good sign for

666
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:49,398
the potato peeler a breather because if

667
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:51,610
we if a breeders focus on lighter color

668
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:54,889
that means we can have a chance to

669
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:56,899
select the higher specific gravity which

670
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:59,929
is preferred by the potato chip company

671
00:34:56,898 --> 00:35:01,880
as well at the same time so I think this

672
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:08,089
is quite good sign for reading proposed

673
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:11,720
and then I found a lot of QTL pics from

674
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:12,200
the many multiple chromosomes in this

675
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:17,919
case

676
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:20,259
PC represent chip color and number

677
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,090
number 2010

678
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:25,370
represent the phenotype data from each

679
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:29,420
year as I mentioned before I measure a

680
00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:33,139
phenotype area on in 2010 11 12 and 13

681
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:38,690
so these represent each year and there's

682
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:40,609
all all miss I could get after I get I

683
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:44,690
transformed to the blood data I could

684
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:47,690
get five different set of data for

685
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:50,840
represent each year 2010 to 2013 and

686
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:53,240
last one what last one last blood

687
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,350
dataset was obtained by pulling all

688
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:56,779
finitary

689
00:35:54,349 --> 00:35:59,719
across the four years so in this case

690
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:01,460
over preserve the blood data obtained by

691
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:06,919
pulling all you know that they're all

692
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:09,829
across the four years so from this table

693
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:15,409
I first of all I could fall significant

694
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:17,750
QT on chromosome 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 and 12

695
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:22,299
there Allah and interesting in common on

696
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:25,610
3 4 7 shows the future piece which

697
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:30,310
consistently appear appeared on same

698
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:35,230
podium or very close position and also

699
00:36:30,309 --> 00:36:38,409
in this case the solely here represent

700
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:41,929
acute here making darker color and

701
00:36:38,409 --> 00:36:45,460
hollow scale represent the qtr making

702
00:36:41,929 --> 00:36:49,519
lighter color yeah and this shows where

703
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:53,619
the cutie cutie of pics okay among the

704
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:55,509
four kimonos so

705
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:58,289
I see the chromosome seven there was

706
00:36:55,509 --> 00:37:01,990
largest cute here for cheap color

707
00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:04,569
especially home alone seven which came

708
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:07,179
from the NI 115 of course and this

709
00:37:04,568 --> 00:37:09,909
explained 13% of the Bears expect

710
00:37:07,179 --> 00:37:13,899
explained for four years so I think this

711
00:37:09,909 --> 00:37:18,129
is quite important future or future a

712
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,970
chip color selection and here here to

713
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:22,269
cover genes

714
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:25,808
chuco's phosphate synthesis and plasma

715
00:37:22,268 --> 00:37:27,909
membrane proton proton ATPase located

716
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:30,369
within a one loyal support interval for

717
00:37:27,909 --> 00:37:32,528
this acutely when I checked out criminal

718
00:37:30,369 --> 00:37:37,358
three there was a binary Teochew color

719
00:37:32,528 --> 00:37:40,028
located at 6770 Morgan and a putative

720
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:43,828
invertase in Heber gene is located about

721
00:37:40,028 --> 00:37:49,298
one point be away from this cutie ax

722
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:51,490
this table showed the future pic of the

723
00:37:49,298 --> 00:37:53,528
specific gravity SG represent specific

724
00:37:51,489 --> 00:37:56,828
gravity and rest all terms are same and

725
00:37:53,528 --> 00:38:01,509
in this case arrow head toward the

726
00:37:56,829 --> 00:38:03,519
downside represent lowering lowering

727
00:38:01,509 --> 00:38:06,248
specific gravity and the arrow head

728
00:38:03,518 --> 00:38:09,608
toward the upside represent making the

729
00:38:06,248 --> 00:38:12,248
QTL making or increasing the specific

730
00:38:09,608 --> 00:38:15,278
gravity and while analyzing I realized

731
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:18,730
that comes from two three four five and

732
00:38:15,278 --> 00:38:20,588
eight shows the qtp which appeared on

733
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,929
the same question or very close position

734
00:38:20,588 --> 00:38:25,568
each other

735
00:38:21,929 --> 00:38:27,759
why analyzing the table I found that on

736
00:38:25,568 --> 00:38:30,998
the chromosome for the most significant

737
00:38:27,759 --> 00:38:32,498
cutie pics exist at the Year twenty

738
00:38:30,998 --> 00:38:35,679
eight centimorgan

739
00:38:32,498 --> 00:38:38,018
explaining sixty six point four to

740
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:40,358
eleven percent of the Bears explain

741
00:38:38,018 --> 00:38:43,058
depending on the year and a gene

742
00:38:40,358 --> 00:38:45,699
including phosphofructokinase is about

743
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:49,210
two hundred thousand base pair away from

744
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:53,288
the cheetah picks just intact playing

745
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:57,630
portal or and basically control the

746
00:38:53,289 --> 00:39:01,420
first commuted step of the glycolysis

747
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:03,759
respiration so as a starch content to

748
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:05,650
represent the amount of the starchy

749
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:07,199
synthesis less the amount of the

750
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:10,900
respired away for

751
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:14,669
this gene become like a really

752
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:19,960
interesting candidate for this cutie on

753
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:22,690
chromosome 2 has a single QTL at the 72

754
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:26,470
centimorgan and ik India team glucose

755
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:31,380
6-phosphate dehydrogenase is met or like

756
00:39:26,469 --> 00:39:35,319
a 500,000 base fare from the target GTL

757
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:38,680
and close on five verses showed us - QT

758
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:41,170
at the 31 centimorgan a gene coding for

759
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:44,619
starch granule bond ro one protein is

760
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:45,159
located 300,000 base pair from the disk

761
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:48,969
ETOP

762
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:51,219
and silently silencing this gene is not

763
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:56,649
to increase the starch level in a in a

764
00:39:51,219 --> 00:40:03,069
in ellipse so I think for future stress

765
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:05,860
security selection so let me summarize

766
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:08,710
this whole presentation as I mentioned

767
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:12,039
before these two markers can be used for

768
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:15,369
cornea breeding program and QTL at the

769
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:19,769
6070 morgan 2680 morgan of the condom 5

770
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:23,679
comfort races - both are o2 and our PA

771
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:25,780
2/3 pass type and heo engine appears to

772
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:27,489
provide some resistance against our o2

773
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:29,050
principal will get you the presence of

774
00:40:27,489 --> 00:40:32,199
the low percentage that are along in our

775
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:35,200
population and cheap : specific grades

776
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:37,569
were highly heritable and multiple

777
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:39,159
future pick for cheek color detected on

778
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:42,100
comment on 3 &amp; 7

779
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:47,440
notable feature picks for specific rows

780
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:49,900
were observed on chromosome 2 4 &amp; 5 so

781
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,409
this offer today and I just want to

782
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:56,410
appreciate my community member thank you

783
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:59,739
for water long story make sure that

784
00:40:56,409 --> 00:41:01,809
thank you for your patience and I

785
00:40:59,739 --> 00:41:04,149
appreciate science encouragement she

786
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:05,799
always encouraged me to start no like a

787
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:07,480
used research for there were interest in

788
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,080
research projects so we really

789
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,059
appreciate it

790
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:15,069
a rolling come on give me a lot of other

791
00:41:10,059 --> 00:41:17,259
work ties about a device is otherwise is

792
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:19,210
about international agriculture because

793
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:20,800
I really interested in a international

794
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,720
pretty especially reducing

795
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,480
the hunger problem and he gave me a lot

796
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:30,579
of good suggestions appreciate it and I

797
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:32,949
appreciate this is my members and they

798
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:35,549
helped me a lot to practice presentation

799
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:38,679
and they do the research project and

800
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:40,900
technicians are amazing because these

801
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:43,059
guys are works really well and so called

802
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:48,309
me Allah so I appreciate shipping and

803
00:41:43,059 --> 00:41:52,949
math and also Michael Missouri and gave

804
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:57,460
me a chance to do the TA at first along

805
00:41:52,949 --> 00:41:59,649
so I appreciate because of his he gave

806
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:01,389
me a chance I I could practice

807
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:04,030
especially like I couldn't get the

808
00:42:01,389 --> 00:42:07,779
teaching experience and Darlene help me

809
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:10,870
practice I appreciate it and their needs

810
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:14,050
help me a lot for statistical analysis

811
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:18,609
so I learned a lot of important static

812
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:21,910
statistical methods from him and I'm a

813
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:24,370
mythology like salami alike since I did

814
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:28,000
not have any experience in Animoto logic

815
00:42:24,369 --> 00:42:30,309
and the mythology but she an effusion so

816
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,429
for me to do the experiments so I learn

817
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:36,070
a lot from them and also Michigan group

818
00:42:33,429 --> 00:42:40,329
so for me a lot for genotyping and do

819
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:43,750
the Qt analysis and also Lewis help me

820
00:42:40,329 --> 00:42:46,090
to get cheap a little data so without

821
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:49,289
her support I could not complete this

822
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:51,789
research project and Chrismukkah she's a

823
00:42:49,289 --> 00:42:54,900
software developer she developed a

824
00:42:51,789 --> 00:42:57,670
terrible sin man and she's a lot of

825
00:42:54,900 --> 00:43:00,970
American research actually she stayed in

826
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:02,860
a Scotland but she frequently visit the

827
00:43:00,969 --> 00:43:04,750
US and they communicate with the many

828
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,849
American researcher and she also helped

829
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:11,159
me a lot and also Jeffrey and them I

830
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:13,869
helped me to do the she was analysis so

831
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:17,500
finally I appreciate on a whole connect

832
00:43:13,869 --> 00:43:19,659
committee because you know I was not

833
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:21,610
like a super smart student when I came

834
00:43:19,659 --> 00:43:23,649
to here first but

835
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:25,840
the corner come you changed me a lot

836
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:30,010
whenever I go to the conference I have a

837
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:35,559
really how can say that feels like I'm

838
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:39,000
really nice quite funny story but you

839
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:42,250
know it's amazing

840
00:43:39,000 --> 00:44:12,849
so I appreciate thank you for listening

841
00:43:42,250 --> 00:44:17,489
my presentation thanks which is the

842
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:22,420
reservation I have in uses mark each one

843
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:30,009
resistance is that Ernie I was in

844
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:34,119
primary primary gene his species that

845
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:42,640
was used in the breeding program or I

846
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:45,819
hate and it was so major effort we're in

847
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:51,190
high resistance before the h1 gene was

848
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:55,410
identified and managed so there's

849
00:44:51,190 --> 00:45:01,059
there's a lot of claims but we were

850
00:44:55,409 --> 00:45:07,779
using the bio as our resistance we kept

851
00:45:01,059 --> 00:45:15,309
out resistance yes hmm

852
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:21,430
I think this kind of simplicity 800 AMA

853
00:45:15,309 --> 00:45:29,739
nated but I'm afraid that when he throw

854
00:45:21,429 --> 00:45:34,019
away the marker all posted not have a

855
00:45:29,739 --> 00:45:34,019
mod that are resistant

856
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:43,039
without the light that's not a sexual

857
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:50,369
actions with each one and we won't take

858
00:45:46,920 --> 00:46:02,430
them out wait and I wait I didn't

859
00:45:50,369 --> 00:46:03,659
realize was all the items and we so yeah

860
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:06,419
you're right

861
00:46:03,659 --> 00:46:09,659
a children originated from the Solano

862
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:14,849
and me Gina he's faced a CPC one six

863
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:18,359
seven so according to my knowledge at

864
00:46:14,849 --> 00:46:22,409
least almost all breeding program to use

865
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:26,059
their specific clone as solanum and

866
00:46:22,409 --> 00:46:32,849
these you know CPC 167 three so I think

867
00:46:26,059 --> 00:46:36,119
the agency that we have and bird espana

868
00:46:32,849 --> 00:46:41,989
there's another one there's also known

869
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:41,989
to have each one gene but again

870
00:46:46,409 --> 00:46:59,589
the case for yeah the case for yeah I

871
00:46:55,630 --> 00:47:03,660
cannot clearly what happened in these

872
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:06,910
calls but worker and I while discussing

873
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:10,719
we suppose it may because as I mentioned

874
00:47:06,909 --> 00:47:15,039
as a fertility going to the one European

875
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:20,859
report so maybe another races is located

876
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:24,009
on another chromosome effect our one

877
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:33,900
races yeah but I actually I don't know

878
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:36,850
yeah what happened Eva Eva Eva has

879
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:40,410
actually I believe that Eva has H one

880
00:47:36,849 --> 00:47:40,409
gene but interesting

881
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:52,899
[Music]

882
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:31,599
so TLC mm-hmm you try to use all the

883
00:48:29,769 --> 00:48:34,719
markers on regression problems in that

884
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:39,010
College disclaimer we're set

885
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:40,808
no general lack that way of course

886
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:44,410
technically we can calculate for each

887
00:48:40,809 --> 00:48:49,230
marker but it takes a lot of time

888
00:48:44,409 --> 00:48:49,230
frankly speaking so that's the software

889
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:57,699
the tetraploid my software always

890
00:48:53,230 --> 00:49:00,250
provide QTL actually he asked about did

891
00:48:57,699 --> 00:49:05,558
I calculate percent of barriers

892
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:10,000
explained for each marker am i right so

893
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:13,650
I can say I I want to say that I didn't

894
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:21,250
but I don't need to do let me explain it

895
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:23,829
so in the Tetra poison my software

896
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:27,159
always provide the most significant

897
00:49:23,829 --> 00:49:30,250
future fix for each chromosome so once I

898
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:33,058
put appropriate genetic genotype data

899
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:38,159
and the phenotype data this number and

900
00:49:33,059 --> 00:49:42,430
where America we showed on the screen

901
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:44,710
however if you really want to calculate

902
00:49:42,429 --> 00:49:48,879
other position for example if you want

903
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:53,230
to know how much this percent of beerus

904
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:56,769
explained you have to make a like a kind

905
00:49:53,230 --> 00:50:00,969
of like a linear model for taking out

906
00:49:56,769 --> 00:50:03,369
some clones which has a alleles relate

907
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:08,189
you to this because if you keep all

908
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:10,809
population to calculus one does not show

909
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:13,599
percent of Barracks explained for this

910
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:16,859
always shows the most significant q-tip

911
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,859
its own so

912
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:26,370
I can say that really I have to explain

913
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:28,649
all the long story I mean you have to

914
00:50:26,369 --> 00:50:30,569
develop a linear model and then figure

915
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:33,780
out which clones are related to this one

916
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:40,320
which which code is now related to the D

917
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:42,690
so once you found the cause and then you

918
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:46,740
have to rewrote the whole QT analysis so

919
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:49,679
really complicating or so 24 is

920
00:50:46,739 --> 00:50:53,429
extremely high whenever I do the qtls

921
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:57,929
for other traits so I guarantee the

922
00:50:53,429 --> 00:51:23,009
other area has a really small percent of

923
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:26,159
various it's almost predictable yeah so

924
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:27,270
maybe that you don't take the first I'll

925
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:33,449
use it like that it kinda like a

926
00:51:27,269 --> 00:51:35,670
phenotype yeah okay yeah so your

927
00:51:33,449 --> 00:51:39,089
comments is really useful as well as

928
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:41,610
it's possible but I just want to

929
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:43,800
emphasize that I work in a potato

930
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:45,630
breeding especially we have a specific

931
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:49,710
reading purpose so we are only

932
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:53,610
interested in a position which is most

933
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:56,340
related to the target trait so even

934
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:59,880
though maybe other area would be related

935
00:51:56,340 --> 00:52:03,470
who is playing small amount of variance

936
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:06,599
but for the breeding purpose those are

937
00:52:03,469 --> 00:52:11,059
so we just focus on the two significant

938
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:11,059
utilities thank you again
