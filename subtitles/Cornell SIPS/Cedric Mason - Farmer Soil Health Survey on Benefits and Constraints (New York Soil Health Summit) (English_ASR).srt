1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,460
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:09,859
University

3
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:12,230
all right thank you Dave so yeah I'm

4
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:14,089
glad that Lynde I presented a few of the

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:17,179
details about the partial budget

6
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:19,339
analysis because I'm gonna follow up on

7
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:24,140
that a little bit that's what this

8
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:26,300
survey was in part about so quick

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,368
background story is that I started

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,940
working with Dave within New York State

11
00:00:28,368 --> 00:00:34,729
soil health initiative last fall and

12
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:38,989
they've had this idea to expand upon the

13
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:41,769
idea of these use case studies and look

14
00:00:38,988 --> 00:00:44,599
at a little bit of a broader picture of

15
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:47,989
the costs and the benefits that farmers

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,210
were experiencing across the state and

17
00:00:47,988 --> 00:00:54,349
try to capture many different types of

18
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:55,878
cropping systems so Dave and I came up

19
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,989
with this questionnaire that we

20
00:00:55,878 --> 00:01:02,359
distributed so farmers across the state

21
00:00:58,988 --> 00:01:06,978
during the fall in the winter of last

22
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:10,640
year and overall we collected 182

23
00:01:06,978 --> 00:01:14,179
responses covering almost all the

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,689
companies in New York and we broke those

25
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:20,080
down into when we asked farmers to

26
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:22,459
report the types of crops that they grew

27
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,090
some of the practices that they used

28
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:29,349
especially focusing on cover crops

29
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:33,290
reduced tillage and soil amendments

30
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:37,688
which included organic matter like newer

31
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:40,400
compost mulch woodchips things like that

32
00:01:37,688 --> 00:01:42,109
so we got a pretty pretty good

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,109
representation across the state

34
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:48,078
especially capturing some of these more

35
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:51,078
active agricultural districts let's see

36
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:53,419
here in this slide and then one of the

37
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:55,849
more interesting things right up front

38
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,670
that came out of this was that we asked

39
00:01:55,849 --> 00:02:00,408
first indicate some of the major

40
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:04,368
constraints that they we're seeing on

41
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:07,969
their farm and the top three that rose

42
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:11,180
to the top here were poor drainage soil

43
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:13,218
compaction and soil erosion and all

44
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,950
three of these are really problems that

45
00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:21,109
can be addressed with reduced tillage

46
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:25,250
cover crops and bring em in amendments

47
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:27,510
um so this is a this slide is a

48
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,050
simplified version of the table that you

49
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:33,419
might see on the handout that you have

50
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:36,180
and what we did here is we asked first

51
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:38,849
when testify the pot or in this one on

52
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,010
the benefits of reduced village that

53
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:45,659
they were seeing and again going back to

54
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:49,919
Lynn's talk these could be increases in

55
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:52,259
income or reductions in expenses and

56
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,689
what really Kim is up here is for

57
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:56,870
reduced tillage less labour was a big

58
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:56,870
one

59
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:05,080
and another aspect of of this this

60
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,120
result here is that we separated out

61
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,060
farmers who were using reduced tillage

62
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,789
on exclusively vegetable crops and

63
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,650
exclusively corn and soy and we were

64
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:16,750
interested in in looking at those those

65
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,939
two groups and seeing if they were

66
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:22,710
seeing different benefits and indeed

67
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:22,710
there were there were a few differences

68
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:28,019
this next slide is a super illustration

69
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:30,000
of those differences you can see the

70
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:34,050
vegetables and the green there and the

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,229
corns play is yellow this is this is

72
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:39,330
showing that vegetable growers reported

73
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:42,709
that they're seeing greater yields from

74
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:45,600
the reduced tillage practices as a

75
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:47,189
higher rate than the quantity growers

76
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,030
and then of course in the left there you

77
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:54,300
can see overall rate at which producers

78
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:58,710
were in greater yields which is

79
00:03:54,300 --> 00:04:01,569
significant so it's about 50% there

80
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:04,050
and we also looked the the difference of

81
00:04:01,568 --> 00:04:05,919
crops again we separated that out

82
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:08,189
according the strugglers and the

83
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,179
vegetable growers here those two groups

84
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:12,340
and again we see that they have

85
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:16,389
different they're experiencing different

86
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:19,600
benefits and also it's don't really

87
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:21,488
noticeable that erosion the erosion

88
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,370
control benefit of the cover crops is

89
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:27,239
really noticeable over 95% of instantly

90
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:31,149
growers are reporting that that's really

91
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,250
number one for the cover crops and then

92
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:35,459
more illustrations here these the

93
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,899
differences between the two crop groups

94
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:40,029
again we see that the vegetable growers

95
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:43,989
then are the green there and they're

96
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:46,179
reporting almost an 80% rate greater

97
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,519
cash crop yields and they're using their

98
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,110
cover crops but we're not really seeing

99
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:53,500
that benefit quite as much in the corn

100
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:55,389
so many however once my growers do see

101
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:59,918
other benefits here we see that they're

102
00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:03,069
sort of combining cover crops within our

103
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:05,009
last operations and I'm using those

104
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:08,918
cover crops as animal force and that's

105
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:12,699
if they're seeing but didn't visible

106
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:15,039
growers tend to have less integration I

107
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:18,029
think with with livestock and so they're

108
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,030
not seeing those benefits

109
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:29,109
and so David David Montgomery especially

110
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:33,360
just talked about how farmers can use

111
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,360
these practices to organic matter

112
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:38,809
over some minatom and that's that's

113
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,430
really important is trying to figure out

114
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,970
how long some of those changes might

115
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:45,769
take

116
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:48,680
so we these farmers that completed the

117
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:50,180
survey today on told us basically how

118
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,269
long they've been doing these practices

119
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,189
and we grouped them by their experience

120
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:57,319
level one to five years five to ten

121
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:59,389
years ten to twenty and twenty plus

122
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:02,509
years and what we saw were some pretty

123
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:07,550
interesting evidence that emerged from

124
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:10,519
this this slide is showing a percentage

125
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:13,730
of each group at practices reduced

126
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:17,209
tillage on the percentage of each group

127
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:21,410
reporting less erosion and we can see

128
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:24,259
here pretty clearly as time goes on on

129
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:26,570
your x-axis there you're pushing to make

130
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:29,418
plus years and the percent of farmers

131
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:31,490
reporting less erosion is almost at 100%

132
00:06:29,418 --> 00:06:33,769
whereas if we start down here and we

133
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:41,629
look at the one to five years

134
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:43,939
twenty-five percent there so um two

135
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:46,909
things maybe to note here is that you do

136
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:47,959
see some benefits right away but don't

137
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,830
likelihood that you're going to see

138
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:55,699
those benefits increase over time is

139
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:57,289
evident and we use the chi-square test

140
00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:01,459
there to show that that's a significant

141
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:04,819
association sinking here this is also a

142
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:06,620
really interesting result not necessary

143
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:09,560
necessarily related to sort of health

144
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:11,569
but we're seeing that more experienced

145
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,610
farmers who've been doing reduced

146
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:15,019
tillage in longer they're taking a

147
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:18,439
better advantage of these posture

148
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:21,469
programs so this could be a way to an

149
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:22,850
area of improvement in terms of policy

150
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,600
maybe outreach

151
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,770
trying to get some of these these

152
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,410
farmers who are getting started training

153
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:32,439
fit them enrolled in some of these some

154
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:36,580
of these programs

155
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:38,709
and finally we're seeing often yields at

156
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:40,180
about 10 years so once once these

157
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:44,139
farmers have been using cover crops for

158
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:47,139
10 years the percentage of them that

159
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:49,689
report greater yields has really jumping

160
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:51,610
up so I think that's a little bit of an

161
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:55,269
indication that it takes time for these

162
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:58,660
practices to fully fully benefit the

163
00:07:55,269 --> 00:08:03,039
farmer and the producer but finally we

164
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:05,320
looked at the ability of these different

165
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,400
practices to provide resilience to

166
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,399
extreme weather events

167
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:14,339
I missed the future climate is unknown

168
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:17,949
but it's anticipated that a severe

169
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:22,959
severe rainfall may become more frequent

170
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:24,848
and stood out as possibilities on both

171
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,299
cover crops can reduce tillage in

172
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:30,550
improve your soil spill organic matter

173
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,229
and that can theoretically improve your

174
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,629
resilience to some of these extreme

175
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:38,680
weather events but we kind of wanted to

176
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:40,418
test this hypothesis and again this is

177
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:44,620
you know this is the results of 182

178
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:46,860
farmers using these practices and we're

179
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,860
seeing

180
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:52,349
the best performances from cover crops I

181
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:55,319
would say overall but there could be

182
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,879
some wiggle room there but I guess

183
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,970
that's the takeaway here is that book

184
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:04,019
cover crops and reduced tillage are

185
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:06,050
providing resilience to to help farmers

186
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:08,370
make it through droughts helping them

187
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:12,629
create soils that retain their water

188
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:15,360
better and also helping prevent erosion

189
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:17,809
that might happen when they experience a

190
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,810
heavy rainfall

191
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,649
so I

192
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,350
guess I could take a couple questions

193
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:29,159
and I guess I'd like that

194
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,379
also add that there is this handout in

195
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:33,688
the packet though if we're gonna be

196
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:36,360
writing up and publishing some future

197
00:09:33,688 --> 00:09:39,039
papers and stuff like that so keep an

198
00:09:36,360 --> 00:10:02,839
eye out for it

199
00:09:39,039 --> 00:10:06,338
any questions I can't really say that

200
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,339
that's I can't really say that that's

201
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:12,299
that that's a real difference I think so

202
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:15,690
these bars are gonna have a certain

203
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:17,729
degree of uncertainty on this it's not

204
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,910
money that's exactly what the rate is

205
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,620
going to be stuff there's a little bit

206
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:24,120
of wiggle room there on the important

207
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,519
thing to look at is the chi-square

208
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,860
p-value so that's showing that there is

209
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,269
an association between the length of

210
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,950
time that the farmers been doing the

211
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:36,149
practice and the likelihood that they

212
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,720
responded they they were getting greater

213
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:38,720
yields

214
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:45,379
so again I mean this is also a very

215
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:47,419
complicated system that we're looking at

216
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:50,240
so there could be you know there could

217
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:52,278
be other things that come into play

218
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,289
there I can't really say for sure but

219
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:56,679
but we do know that there's there's a

220
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:56,679
pattern here

221
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:13,829
anybody else yep go ahead I would say

222
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:17,310
yeah I mean there's there's definitely

223
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,720
some other things going on here like we

224
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:21,989
also found that there was a little bit

225
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,970
of a tendency for some of these farmers

226
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,100
that have been doing the practices

227
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:29,310
longer or growing certain crops and not

228
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,139
others so to really get to the bottom of

229
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:33,299
this I think we'd have to do some kinda

230
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:37,169
more involved modeling that would really

231
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:40,849
tease out how all these factors affect

232
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:40,849
yields for example

233
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:44,389
and it's your question

234
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,000
ray it's it was it was how basically how

235
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:53,580
long have you been using this practice

236
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,980
so it could you know there could be it

237
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,810
could be something like that maybe older

238
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:05,089
farmers used slightly different

239
00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:07,889
practices and that right right right

240
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:11,329
yeah it was it was about the perception

241
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:11,328
of of the result

242
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:32,649
um we didn't express explicitly ask that

243
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:35,470
I I would imagine it would be both we

244
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:37,750
didn't we didn't really discriminate and

245
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:43,180
again it was it was farms of all sizes

246
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:45,909
all crop types and yeah I suggest you

247
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:47,500
look for one of the publications or my

248
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:50,259
contact information is on there if you

249
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:53,068
want to get in touch with us and we can

250
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:53,068
send you some more information

251
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,289
actually one in one interesting thing

252
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:02,000
that I just remembered was that there

253
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:05,750
was one farmer who wrote in a response

254
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,990
that basically indicated that the rent

255
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:11,149
that they paid to the landowner somehow

256
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:13,490
went down maybe they've had some sort of

257
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:16,189
you know they negotiated or whatever but

258
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:20,539
um that was that was an interesting

259
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:22,660
thing that somebody just wrote in thank

260
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:22,659
you

261
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:34,660
this has been a production of Cornell

262
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:34,659
