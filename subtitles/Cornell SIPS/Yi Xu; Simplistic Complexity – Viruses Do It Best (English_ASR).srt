1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,320
This is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:12,239
University. Uh good afternoon everyone.

3
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:15,838
Uh it's my pleasure to be able to speak

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,879
with you and tell you uh the work I uh

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,240
the work that I have been doing. Um my

6
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:25,839
work mainly focus on plant virus uh

7
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:28,399
movement and the A15 mission.

8
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:31,239
uh you know as as you know the plant

9
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:36,759
virus is very small with a very small

10
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:40,719
genome and just encoding uh less than 10

11
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:45,280
protein. However, the virus life cycle

12
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:48,719
requires very complex activities and how

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:52,320
and and the virus has involved

14
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:57,920
uh a lot of complex mechanism to ensure

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:00,679
that uh all the activities can be uh can

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:05,599
be performed can be performed

17
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:08,239
performed. Um so today uh I I'm I'm

18
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,719
going to tell you about three gene from

19
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:15,158
potato livers

20
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:20,239
uh that red unit that

21
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:23,360
red a multi multi activity

22
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:27,839
uh that very that are very crucial for

23
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,840
the virus survival in plant

24
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:37,600
host. Uh the potato leaf for virus

25
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:39,319
uh is the polyro virus genius in the

26
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:43,118
family of gluty

27
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:46,319
we did. The natural host of the virus is

28
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:49,719
potato and it can also infect several

29
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:53,599
other plants such as

30
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:56,840
parade tobacco. The typical symptom

31
00:01:53,599 --> 00:02:01,039
after infection of this virus is the

32
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:04,560
growing tubet necrosis and also the

33
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,560
chlorosis on the infected

34
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:12,318
li this virus is flown

35
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:15,200
preferred and transmitted by a in a

36
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,679
persistent in a persistent manner. Here

37
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:21,199
I'm showing you a picture that we

38
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:24,959
construct a virus induced gene silent

39
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:29,119
vector using the four virus. And when we

40
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:32,759
silence the TDS we can see a lot of

41
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,360
branch area that area that that

42
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:36,878
area

43
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:41,120
represent the the localization of the

44
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:41,120
virus. The virus is really bloom

45
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,319
linking. Here is the genome structure of

46
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:51,759
leaf for virus. It looks very simple and

47
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:55,598
it and it is a monopati linear signal

48
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:58,639
string RNA virus. Also the whole genome

49
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:01,158
can transcribe two subg genomic RNA

50
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:04,158
named subg genomic one

51
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:08,158
subgenomic I2.

52
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:11,120
This small this simple genome use many

53
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:14,799
translational strategy to incur their

54
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,000
protein it protein for example the re

55
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,360
mechanism ring shift liquid gaining

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,080
internal random

57
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:26,560
palite. So today my my talk will mainly

58
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,560
focus on the read through mechanism and

59
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,439
the protein included from the subg

60
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,439
genomic

61
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:37,039
one. Here's the subdenomic one in coded

62
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,920
protein.

63
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:44,000
There are several open reading frame

64
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:46,079
along the subdenomic one for the O3

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,519
being called a code protein. It's the

66
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,599
major capate protein and the whole

67
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:56,719
wiring is composed

68
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:59,759
with 188 code protein and this protein

69
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:03,359
has been recorded to take part in viral

70
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:06,079
transmission and movement. For the OF4

71
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,599
we call a movement protein. uh this

72
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,519
proteinate is related to virus movement,

73
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,079
cellto cell movement and datamic

74
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,879
movement in the plant

75
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:21,519
host. For the OS five there is RTD

76
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:23,759
domain named as through domain this

77
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,478
domain contain two part one is a very

78
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,720
conserved and terminus domain another is

79
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,959
a

80
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,800
very vulnerable domain with the order

81
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,319
sequence. This domain has been

82
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,918
recorded to take part in virus

83
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:42,439
transmission also take part in the virus

84
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:45,359
movement for the read through protein

85
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:48,879
RTP is the red through of the sticky

86
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:54,400
stop protein and generating a very large

87
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:57,918
protein about 75 kilo this protein uh

88
00:04:54,399 --> 00:05:01,679
has been very extensively studied our

89
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:03,240
formal work on that protein fction in

90
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,000
chain in flow

91
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,400
mutation this protein is on the surface

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,879
of the structure you can see this is the

93
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,879
RTD

94
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:17,680
domain so here's the outline of my talk

95
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,519
in the part one I will introduce the

96
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,478
translational read through process we

97
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:25,519
discovered a downstream translation in

98
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:28,719
hunger the structure of the

99
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:30,879
translational enhancer is critical for

100
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,880
translation of RTP

101
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:37,759
and the uh uh the translation in hunger

102
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:40,000
and the state rich element

103
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,560
uh the the interaction between these two

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,839
domain is very important for do protein

105
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:49,879
translation in the part two I will

106
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:53,599
introduce the read through protein

107
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:57,279
inspection so here the proposed working

108
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,160
models for our stop coding when

109
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:03,119
translation happened a stop coding

110
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,160
the release vector will come and will

111
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,759
arrive in the stock coding then the D

112
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,199
the R will get released. So the so the

113
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,080
translation will get termination.

114
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:18,879
However, when forming a very complex

115
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:22,800
vector structure near the stop coding

116
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,600
will inhibit the release factor coming

117
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,918
and then the

118
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:31,639
rest the rest of stop coding will

119
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:34,639
continue and the uh that mean

120
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:34,639
translation

121
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:44,239
and so of our previous work 20 years ago

122
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,759
uh using a related belly yellow draft

123
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:51,840
wire. He found that there are two

124
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:55,680
domains named 15 rich region adjusting

125
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:59,679
to CP coding and translational enhancer

126
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:03,038
located within the uh RTD domain it are

127
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,720
very important for translation when they

128
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:10,159
deleted the two domain the RTP protein

129
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,560
couldn't be detected however the nature

130
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,319
however there there no further

131
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,079
information about the mechanism and how

132
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:21,280
how the

133
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:24,959
rest are uh regulated. Uh it's little

134
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:26,918
unknown until now. So in our research we

135
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,879
will focus on study the

136
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:34,318
mechanism between these two

137
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:36,719
regions. Firstly uh to discover whether

138
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,919
there is a translational enhancer in our

139
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,039
liver virus but serious

140
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:46,399
uh mutation was

141
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:49,120
contracted. We found that when we and

142
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:52,318
the the RTP expression was detected by

143
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:57,360
western plot by western blood using the

144
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,360
in using the aggro infiltrated bend

145
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,918
lift. When we delete the nucleotide from

146
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,759
the

147
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:11,680
4854 the RTP translation was severely

148
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:14,038
uh impaired. However, when we deleted

149
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,918
the nuclear from

150
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:19,680
4933 or from the

151
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:22,038
507, the translation was withdrawal

152
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,120
protein is later

153
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:27,318
affected. Also

154
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:30,478
by autobinding also by

155
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:33,879
infin deletion. We found that the

156
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:36,679
nuclear part between the

157
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:40,679
4854 to

158
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:44,879
4933 is the minimal uh

159
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:46,799
unifor translation and we these regions

160
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:50,559
are considered as the translation

161
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,559
translational enhancer of the

162
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:58,160
former. So to to act uh the the

163
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,639
translational enhancer fraction is is

164
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,480
determined by the

165
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:05,559
nucleite in the translational enhancer

166
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:10,159
or the amino acid encoded from this

167
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:12,639
region. So a stop coding was introduced

168
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:15,919
before the translational enhancer and

169
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:20,240
making the nuclear after this will not

170
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:24,079
be translated. RTP what was detected. We

171
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:27,600
found a trumpeted RTP indicating that

172
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:31,120
the um that the nucleide in this region

173
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,000
it is define the risk translation not

174
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,278
the amino acid translated by the

175
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,320
translational enhancer domain. also a

176
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:43,480
dart RTP mutant which all the nuclear

177
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,959
part after the CP stop coding was

178
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,200
deleted as this mutant was used as a

179
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:52,719
network to control as shown in this

180
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,278
finger we couldn't find any RTP that

181
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,278
with

182
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:01,679
translation so next the nuclear

183
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:06,639
alignment of homologous translation in

184
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:09,039
her sequence among several poly virus

185
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,759
was carried out we found that the

186
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,399
nucleotide similarity is very low and

187
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:17,439
it's less than

188
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:20,879
14%. If we looked the sec the secondary

189
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,680
structure of this region we found that

190
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,480
the secondary structure is very similar

191
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:29,278
and there are several double

192
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:32,240
loops in this region.

193
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:35,519
So previous work on other system found

194
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,519
that the double loop structure is very

195
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,519
important for read through or stop

196
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:45,480
coding. So to study the the stop the

197
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:50,320
step loop structure section in our res

198
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:54,079
translation we focus on starting three

199
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:57,879
step loops loop one doop two and loop

200
00:10:54,078 --> 00:11:02,039
three and we started this loops

201
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:06,480
separately for loop one

202
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:10,000
um we introduce two mutant which the

203
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,800
will be opened up and the IDP

204
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,519
translation was detected by web. We

205
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,838
found that there the translation was uh

206
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,278
severely

207
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:24,800
impaired. However, when we made a

208
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:28,559
complement of the the signal here and

209
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:31,199
made this the made the term close and we

210
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,078
found that the RTP translation will get

211
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,759
reversed

212
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:41,319
translation. Also we introduced another

213
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:45,720
mutant which the loop of the W1 was

214
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:50,839
closed and the RTP translation was was

215
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:54,320
also impaired. So this dot here suggests

216
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:57,800
that the WOT str one is necessary for

217
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,800
RTP simulation.

218
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:05,600
We also studied the loop 2 and loop

219
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,919
three on the fraction of translation and

220
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,040
there we found

221
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:17,719
that there's no effect on it translation

222
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:17,719
after disrupting this loop 2 and 3.

223
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,519
Next we started on the charact

224
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,519
characters required for the useful

225
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:31,519
translation required for the proof one

226
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:36,320
in in useful translation. Firstly we

227
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:41,039
focus on the uh plus plastic city uh

228
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:45,079
plus city and we change the blue side by

229
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:48,120
one simpl or two inletard and the rule

230
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:52,239
translation can be detected by wing

231
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:55,839
block indicating the size of the loop

232
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,839
doesn't matter for the res

233
00:12:55,958 --> 00:13:01,838
translation also we next we studied the

234
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:04,159
position and the sequence between the

235
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:08,079
stop coding and read through read

236
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:11,039
through translational enhancer.

237
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,638
Firstly, we deleted the the nuclear

238
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,719
between the stop coding and the

239
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:20,959
translational enhancer and

240
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:25,120
generating a 500 nuclear decre decreased

241
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:28,319
RTD mutant. We could find the RTP

242
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,278
translation can can be detected also

243
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,800
when we replaced the nucleotide between

244
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:39,000
these two region with the foreign HA

245
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:42,240
attack sequence. Although the RTP can be

246
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,559
detected indicating the position and

247
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,680
statement between these two regions is

248
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:50,679
not so strictly required for the restore

249
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:50,679
translation.

250
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:57,039
So I have told you that a formwork found

251
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:59,679
that the stage element and the

252
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:03,360
translational enhancer is very important

253
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:07,120
for related virus with translation and

254
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:10,639
we found that the it's there is a very

255
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:14,278
similar secondary structure between the

256
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:18,159
uh the two related

257
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:21,639
virus to to check whether the whether

258
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:25,759
the stage region of hourly for hours

259
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:29,600
also uh required for translation and to

260
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:32,399
see whether or not the there is a

261
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,839
communication between the C element and

262
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:38,198
translational enhancer and whether this

263
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:43,320
interaction is virus

264
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:46,879
specific a several chimeic mutant was

265
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:49,760
constructed as shown in this finger this

266
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:51,639
is what type for levers they could

267
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:54,879
detect the RDP

268
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:59,440
translation. However, when we deleted

269
00:14:54,879 --> 00:15:00,439
the C element of the D4 virus, no RTP

270
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,720
could be

271
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:07,800
detected. When we replaced the virus C

272
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:13,000
reading with the related C

273
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:17,838
way element, there is also no RTP can be

274
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,480
detected. Also when we use this the

275
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:24,519
virus translational enhancer with the

276
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:27,320
related CD way translational enhancer

277
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:32,159
nop can can be

278
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:35,040
found. However, when we replaced both

279
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:38,198
both uh striing and the translational

280
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:41,799
enhancer with the state related

281
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:45,679
sequence, we can find RDP can be

282
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:49,198
translated indicating that communication

283
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:52,479
between translational enhancer with the

284
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:56,240
stage domain is virus specific and

285
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,240
indispensable for RTP

286
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,720
translation to Okay, next we asked what

287
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:06,440
the effect of RTP mutant on infection of

288
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:10,680
the plant. So the leaf virus titer was

289
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:14,800
measured in septemically infected

290
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:19,439
leaves and we we can find all the mutant

291
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:23,039
can get infection as early as 3 weeks.

292
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,959
However with with RTP translation all

293
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,399
the

294
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:31,879
mutant all the viral titer increase by

295
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:35,278
time. However for the without RTP

296
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:37,639
expression the vir decreased from three

297
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:42,120
weeks put in

298
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:45,600
population and for for example the dp

299
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:48,639
mutant you can see the titers always

300
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,800
decreased to a very low level. However,

301
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:56,120
we found there we found there are

302
00:16:51,799 --> 00:17:00,799
typewriter switch using the loop one

303
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:04,480
mutant the tighter of virus switch to

304
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:08,639
increase in six or seven week put

305
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:11,919
ination with this loop one mutant. So to

306
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:16,480
see what happened on this mutant whether

307
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:19,679
or not this sequence inter this sequence

308
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:23,599
are still kept are still kept integrated

309
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:26,880
as constructed. So RTPCR was carried out

310
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,879
to check the sequence uh integrated of

311
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,640
this mutant.

312
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,640
Firstly, we detect the the the mutant

313
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,799
sequent from three weeks post

314
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:41,600
inoculation

315
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:44,759
uh leave from three weeks post inulation

316
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:47,399
uh leave and we found that all the

317
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:50,079
mutant still keep integrity and

318
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,160
constructed. Here is the wild type

319
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:55,519
factory structure about the

320
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,558
translational enhancer and you can see

321
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:03,480
all the mutants factory structure of the

322
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:07,359
loop loop one was still being

323
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,519
impaired. However, when we detect the

324
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:13,199
sequence

325
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:16,879
from from 8 weeks put inulation infected

326
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:21,440
plant, we found we found they all have

327
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:24,880
additional mutation and we found that a

328
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:28,880
com compensatory mutation that would

329
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,559
restore a studio one structure was

330
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,080
found.

331
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:38,319
Although the the loop structure is a

332
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,319
little different with the white pipe as

333
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:45,399
sher the

334
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:48,919
uh but the this door J resto develop one

335
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:52,519
structure. So to to see whether this

336
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:55,919
difference will restore the res

337
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:59,038
translation. So we we made this mutation

338
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:03,360
into the lipo virus infection clone and

339
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:06,839
infiltrated into benzim benzima le and

340
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:10,678
did then detect the RTP

341
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:14,038
translation. We found that all the

342
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:17,840
mutant can restart RTP

343
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:19,440
translation indicating that the develop

344
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,279
structure

345
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,640
uh is very important for it through

346
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:27,119
translation and also uh the the

347
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,520
structure is in a very strong selective

348
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:31,519
pressure to maintain the RTP

349
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,840
translation. Here is the conclusion of

350
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:42,880
part one. A translational enhancer

351
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:45,678
located 640 nucleot mode CP stop coding

352
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,679
is required for use through translation.

353
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,798
Develop one of the translational

354
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:55,080
enhancer is required for efficient RTP

355
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:58,480
translation. But there is plat

356
00:19:55,079 --> 00:20:01,038
plasticity to it structure communication

357
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:05,400
between the translational enhancer and

358
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:08,558
sting which element is required and

359
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,798
fic but the length and makeup of the

360
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:13,359
sequence between them is not important

361
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:16,119
for useful translation.

362
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:20,159
There is a strong selection for mut

363
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:24,159
mutation that restore a develop one

364
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,160
structure that allow RTP

365
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:32,320
translation. Now that we found that RTP

366
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,400
can be recovered translated so it may it

367
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:37,200
it might it might have very important

368
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,919
function in the virus in the virus

369
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:44,880
survival. So in the part two I will

370
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:47,520
introduce our studies on the red protein

371
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,080
factions and we found there is the

372
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:53,519
interaction between the different uh

373
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:57,038
virus MP with the resto protein and

374
00:20:53,519 --> 00:21:01,639
finally a model was rigged to explain

375
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:01,640
the RTP MP interaction.

376
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,400
So all the floam limited

377
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:11,880
virus after they get inoculation into

378
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,960
the floam tissues by a or some other

379
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:18,480
insect they have to overcome two

380
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,360
barriers to make sure they can establish

381
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,679
the successful infection

382
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:26,599
uh the the successful infection of the

383
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:29,320
entire plant. Firstly they have to get

384
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:32,639
replication in the

385
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:35,399
inuculation field. Second, they have to

386
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:39,120
move out from the the replication

387
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,679
site both in the cell to cell level and

388
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:44,479
also they have to

389
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:47,120
move in a in a long distance level and

390
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,159
they have to move to the flow and get

391
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:54,000
sentic infection and then excite from

392
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:58,480
the flow and start new infection to so

393
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:02,000
to say whether the domain has effect on

394
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,919
virus replication. A serious RTD domain

395
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,679
was

396
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:08,880
constructed which this mutant RTD

397
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:12,640
protein was serious impaired as shown in

398
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:15,440
the in the in the Indian figure. We

399
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,960
found that the RTB do have no effect on

400
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:22,960
fire replication both in three days post

401
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:25,840
inoculation and five post inoculation.

402
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,720
uh this regard uh excludes the

403
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:31,480
possibility that RTG domain has the

404
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,558
effect on virus

405
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:38,319
replication. As I showed you before, we

406
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:42,960
can detect the systemic infection of the

407
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:46,240
vir the RTP mutant as early as civic

408
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,720
indicating that absent of RTP doesn't

409
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,519
prevent the systemic movement of the

410
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,600
virus through flow. So next we want to

411
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:57,960
ask whether RTP has effect on the cellto

412
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:02,000
cell movement of this

413
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:04,960
virus. So tissue print was performed to

414
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,519
detect the cellto cell movement in the

415
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:13,000
in the flown tissues. Here with RTP M

416
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:15,839
with RTP expression we can see a lot of

417
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,119
infection for side

418
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:22,319
um in the FL tissue between the this is

419
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:26,000
the STM this is the cross section of the

420
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:29,759
limb we can see a lot of infection for

421
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,359
however without RTP expression the virus

422
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:35,158
is present but the the infection for

423
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:39,038
both side is very

424
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:41,360
limited indicating that the RTP protein

425
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:45,960
had some role in the cellto cell

426
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:45,959
movement of the D4 virus.

427
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:54,960
So uh the MT protein is the moment

428
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:57,319
protein of this virus and has been and

429
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:01,759
our our formwork from

430
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:03,839
that the the number of infection fosi

431
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:06,640
are although decreased in tissue

432
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:09,639
infected with the leo virus mutant that

433
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:14,480
doesn't translate that doesn't translate

434
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:18,159
MP the similar phenotype between the RTP

435
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,880
mutant and the MP mutant uh inspire us

436
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,440
to study whether there is a fctional

437
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,440
interaction between the RTP and movement

438
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,440
protein.

439
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,000
So first first we studied the

440
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,960
localization of these two protein for MP

441
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,079
is the movement protein. Uh it can look

442
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:43,640
localized to the plasma matter and the

443
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:46,599
30s promoter uh agro

444
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:50,559
infotrated. We can see the PD

445
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:53,000
localization of MP. When we press the

446
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:57,119
RTP and the

447
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:00,400
30 promoter, we found that RTP can look

448
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:02,839
localized to the cytoplasm and also in

449
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:08,080
the nuclear

450
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:11,439
nuclear. However, when we express RTP

451
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:15,439
with the express with the infection for

452
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:19,038
the localization of the RTP changed

453
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,880
switch to the plasma

454
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:25,079
uh obviously there are some other

455
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:28,960
protein in encoded from the

456
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:32,240
refriation of the RTP protein. So

457
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,960
because MP has the electronic property

458
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,480
to localize to the

459
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:42,038
plasma. So next we detect the

460
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:46,640
localization of RTP uh without MP uh

461
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:48,599
translation. We found that RTP RTP

462
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,080
doesn't look like two

463
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:55,079
plasma when in fact with MP deficient

464
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,079
mutant

465
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:02,879
uh indicating the MP protein is the

466
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:06,640
protein which help the plasma domata

467
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:09,200
help the RTP protein to the plasma.

468
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,720
Next we want to know what the mechanism

469
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,159
of of this process. How the

470
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,600
MP make the RTP to the

471
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:19,679
plasma. Whether there is a direct

472
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:24,798
interaction with the two protein and

473
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,798
then the MP drag the RTP to the

474
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:32,880
plasma. So we also detect

475
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:35,240
antin when we parall alone can direct

476
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,080
the RT to the

477
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,640
plasma

478
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:44,038
indicating only ant alone can help RTP

479
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,038
to the plasma.

480
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:52,278
Uh therefore we started the interaction

481
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:55,720
between MP and RTP to to support whether

482
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:58,038
MP drag RTP to plasma doesn't

483
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:02,000
matter. So the

484
00:26:58,038 --> 00:27:04,480
BCA was carried out to detect the RDP

485
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,960
and the MP interaction. If these two

486
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,000
protein can can interact with each

487
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:13,480
other, we can see the yellow fluorescent

488
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,480
and and micro and a confocal

489
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:20,319
microscope. Here is the BC result. We

490
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:23,919
confirm the interaction of RTP and MP

491
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:27,158
and we use the CP4 virus CP protein is

492
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:31,520
the as a positive

493
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:35,960
control. So to support our idea that MP

494
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:39,839
direct RTP to the plasma through through

495
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:42,640
binding we by mutenic analysis the

496
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:45,678
reason of RTP responsible for the

497
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:49,120
interaction with MP was and was was

498
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:51,519
found out and we found that there's no

499
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:53,519
interaction between this mutant with the

500
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:56,639
movement protein. This is the posive

501
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:56,639
control Y type

502
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:04,000
RTP. So next we want to know what the

503
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:07,639
localization went. We found that the M

504
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,200
mutation that disrupt RTP

505
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,520
binding prevent the localization of RTP

506
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,399
to the

507
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:21,119
plasma both in the both co-infected with

508
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:24,199
the leo virus infection or the MP alone.

509
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:30,038
uh this this does support the idea

510
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:33,880
that MT help the uh direct to the

511
00:28:30,038 --> 00:28:37,759
plat through binding with this

512
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:41,360
protein. So next we construct this RDP

513
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:46,158
mutant into the leaf for virus infection

514
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:49,119
clone and inoculated into the plant. We

515
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,919
found that we detect the virus after

516
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:53,959
four weeks post

517
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:57,360
inoculation. We found that zero in fact

518
00:28:53,960 --> 00:29:01,360
loi observed in tissues that chemically

519
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:04,719
infected with this RTP mutant and this

520
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:07,959
phenotype is very similar with the the

521
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:11,200
one mutant which the RTP couldn't be

522
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:14,558
translated and corresponding with the

523
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:18,240
the the limited corresponding with the

524
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:22,480
limited infection low the title of the

525
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:26,159
virus is also very low in the septic

526
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:29,679
This result about that RTP help for

527
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:32,960
virus cell to cell movement depending on

528
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,960
the binding with the movement

529
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:40,399
protein. So here is the conclusion of

530
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:43,919
part two. The RTD domain of virus has no

531
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:47,479
effect on virus replication. RTP is not

532
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:50,880
impart for longist movement but it

533
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:54,000
facilitates septamic spread. RTP

534
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:58,039
interacts directly with MP binding to

535
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:02,200
the MP redirects the RTP to the plasma

536
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:04,879
domata. RTP appears to faction to

537
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:08,399
move before virus between flown

538
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:11,360
companion cells with unknown whether the

539
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:16,199
cellto cell movement requires structure

540
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:18,879
RTP or a solubable

541
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:23,200
RTP. Here is the whole summary of my

542
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,278
talk. After the nephro virus get get

543
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,919
inoculated into the plant cell.

544
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:30,960
Fortunately they have to translate it

545
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:34,080
the replication associated protein and

546
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,960
make the liars get replication. Although

547
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:40,079
they will

548
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:44,319
incur some protein such as AP and MP for

549
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:48,398
the RTP for the rich translation. There

550
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:51,759
is a translational enhancer D of the

551
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:54,479
stop coding and and it can form a

552
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:57,240
develop structure and through

553
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:01,278
communication with the 15

554
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:04,240
domain inhibit the release vector coming

555
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:07,960
and then the translation will continue

556
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:10,399
the red protein will get

557
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:13,120
translated. After this protein get

558
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:15,759
translate gets translated it will be

559
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:18,479
recognized by the movement protein and

560
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:19,960
at the help of the movement protein to

561
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:25,038
reach the

562
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:27,278
plasma and help the virus move to the

563
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:30,640
neighbor cells.

564
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:35,359
We still don't know whether MP move to

565
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:37,640
the plasma plasma associate associate

566
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:40,240
associated with the

567
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:44,000
wiring. Also there are some other

568
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:47,200
possibilities that the MP just interacts

569
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,278
with the the MP just interacts with the

570
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:54,880
the the sol the solubable

571
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:58,558
RTP and they move to the plasma and then

572
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,440
mod modify the side of the plasma.

573
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:04,398
When the virus come to come to the

574
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,558
plasma doesn't matter this modification

575
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:10,639
of the pl this modification will

576
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:12,960
facilitate the mo the virus move to the

577
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,960
neighbor

578
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:24,120
cells. So as we can see the virus is

579
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:26,639
very simple but uh it works in a very

580
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:29,119
sophisticated manner. they works

581
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,799
together both in the nucleotide level

582
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:32,798
and in the protein interaction

583
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:39,918
level. So here is the acknowledgement. I

584
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:42,319
thank all the members from student grid

585
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:46,399
lab. Thank you so much for your help in

586
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:50,319
my project and help me improve the the

587
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:53,518
talk and also I thank the collaborator

588
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:55,918
uh from Michel Mish the lab. Thank you

589
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,440

thank the funding. Without funding we

594
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,240
can't do anything. Thank you for your
