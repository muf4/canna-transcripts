1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:13,468
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:15,058
University so today I'm going to

3
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:18,660
actually I'm going to tell you a story

4
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:20,809
about rice and water I think that's an

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,469
appropriate story to tell

6
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:30,028
so rice and water so rice is a perennial

7
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:34,079
semi aquatic plant it covers 10% of

8
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:35,700
Earth's arable land and most rice has

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,739
grown on farms that are less than a

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,680
hectare in size that's about 82 percent

11
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,570
of the rice on the planet and over 90%

12
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:44,519
is consumed within the country where

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,200
it's produced and those statistics

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,390
should tell you quite a bit already

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,910
about what I'm going to situate you for

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,090
which is if most rice is grown and

17
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:56,308
consumed locally and not traded

18
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,199
internationally that leads to much

19
00:00:56,308 --> 00:01:03,289
greater diversity in terms of the

20
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:06,118
landscape rice production in terms of

21
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:08,879
countries the three largest countries in

22
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:10,769
the world account for over 50% of rice

23
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,810
produced that's China India and

24
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:14,849
Indonesia and when you look at this

25
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,728
little map showing where across the

26
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:20,519
globe we have rice production I hope

27
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:23,549
that little red spot comes forward

28
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:26,368
that's a real reason why China and India

29
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,170
out produce other countries it's not

30
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:30,030
because of the landmass it's because

31
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,909
those red areas signify that they get

32
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,790
three seasons per year so three crops on

33
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,130
the same land and you'll notice if you

34
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,900
look across the the blue is showing you

35
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:42,149
the areas that produce two crops per

36
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,079
year and the green is areas that produce

37
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:49,140
only one now in in Asia which is where

38
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:51,839
the majority of rice is grown what you

39
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,969
see is also that within those countries

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,430
that are producing the majority of the

41
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:58,709
world's rice there are a vast number of

42
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,750
different varieties in fact thousands of

43
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:02,789
varieties are produced every year and

44
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,280
because as I said they're consumed

45
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,829
produced and consumed locally every

46
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,288
locale in much of the rice growing world

47
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:12,269
has its own favorite Rice's and they

48
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:14,259
don't really trade their Rice's widely

49
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,990
so if you go from village to build

50
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:18,729
you will be treated to Rice's and

51
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,219
cuisines that have evolved with those

52
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:24,879
Rice's that are unique to that village

53
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:26,979
and that leads to preferences that have

54
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,370
to do with quality as well as to the

55
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:33,250
biology or the adapt it constraints of

56
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,390
the region where they're grown now it's

57
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,400
interesting to note that the

58
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:40,509
relationship between production and

59
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,539
export is quite unequal and so what you

60
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:45,849
see here are there's only 10% of rice

61
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:48,099
that's exported from any country so it's

62
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:50,889
a very inelastic supply there's always

63
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:54,280
more demand for importation of rice and

64
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:55,389
there is rice in the export market but

65
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,460
you see that there are two countries

66
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:59,829
that predominate that's India and

67
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,719
Thailand and Vietnam being a close third

68
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,090
and the reason is because there are

69
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:07,659
really only two types of rice that are

70
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,069
exported in any large quantity many of

71
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:11,889
you sitting here will know which those

72
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:13,629
are they're the two what we call supreme

73
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:16,449
quality Rice's on the international

74
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:18,939
market basmati and Thai jasmine and

75
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:21,310
those two Rice's alone account for over

76
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:23,229
80% of rice that's exported because

77
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,289
people are looking to pay for high

78
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:28,389
quality rice on the export market even

79
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:30,129
as countries like India are importing

80
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:33,669
lower quality rice to feed their people

81
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:35,829
so it's a very interesting kind of

82
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:38,829
market that we have and it's unlike that

83
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:41,290
of the other major cereals wheat or

84
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:43,239
maize for instance are normally very big

85
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:45,699
commodities in the international market

86
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:49,360
and they're not prized so much for their

87
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:51,280
local attributes in terms of cuisine now

88
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,720
the other thing about rice that I think

89
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,060
is very interesting is that we have

90
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,659
these different eco types and a lot of a

91
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,650
genetic diversity of rice is partitioned

92
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:01,919
partly because it's an in breeding

93
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:05,920
species and partly because they're

94
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:07,449
adaptations and whole germ polls gene

95
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,299
pools that are adapted to these

96
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:12,429
different rice ecotypes so this is about

97
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,890
rice and water so I've divided it into

98
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,168
the dry and the wet and on the dry side

99
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:20,048
we have the upland rice which accounts

100
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:23,349
for only about 9% of the land that's

101
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:25,810
used to produce it the rain-fed lowland

102
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,910
rice which we call dry rice because it's

103
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,620
completely dependent on rainfall

104
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,570
sometimes it's too wet but often it's

105
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:35,459
too dry and then there are the wet

106
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:39,430
Rice's and you'll see from this you know

107
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:41,109
topography topographical map that when

108
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,090
you get into the wet Rice's these are

109
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:46,060
Rice's that this is that semi-aquatic

110
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:47,829
nature coming forward you have the

111
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,740
irrigated paddy rice which accounts for

112
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:53,079
about 50% of the land planted to rice

113
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,710
you have the flooded de croo which is a

114
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:58,240
it's it's an idea that rice is planted

115
00:04:56,709 --> 00:05:01,719
on the shores of rivers in the rivers

116
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:05,290
flood every year and also it's often

117
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,930
planted on the shores of of the sea and

118
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:10,720
so these are saline type Rice's as well

119
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,730
so mangrove swamps and areas that flood

120
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,200
periodically and then you have the deep

121
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,120
water rice and we published a paper

122
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,370
about a month or two ago in science

123
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,560
about the mechanism of deep water rice

124
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:24,850
where Rice's can rise very very rapidly

125
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,089
to keep up with with with flood floods

126
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:29,560
that come and stay for months at a time

127
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:30,729
but the interesting thing about the the

128
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,050
talk I'm going to give today is not

129
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,210
going to talk at all about the deep

130
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,449
water rice which has grown on only 5% of

131
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:38,859
the land I'm going to talk more about

132
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:41,560
the problems that we're facing as a

133
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,710
community as we think about maintaining

134
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,389
rice production into the future so

135
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:48,250
irrigated paddy accounts for production

136
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:51,430
on about 50% of the acreage that's

137
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,529
planted to rice but it accounts for 75%

138
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,680
of the rice that's produced so it's a

139
00:05:53,529 --> 00:06:00,250
very very productive ecosystem it

140
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:02,740
requires that you have control of water

141
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,990
so the concept of irrigation is not just

142
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,750
that it's standing water but you can put

143
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:10,090
water on and take water off it will now

144
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:13,689
normally you do not plant into standing

145
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:16,179
water you plant into very low low paddy

146
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:18,250
soil and then you bring the water up and

147
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,569
then of course before you harvest rice

148
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,360
you have to be able to take the water

149
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:24,339
off and dry it down and the future part

150
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,230
of the futures discussions that are

151
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:27,789
going on in the international community

152
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:30,100
is about the concept of what we call

153
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,439
alternate wetting and drying where you

154
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,060
really need control over water you can

155
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:36,399
bring it in and pick it off and you can

156
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,220
actually pull the water off midseason

157
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:41,159
and that stimulates a lot of root growth

158
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:44,550
and it stimulates

159
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,650
in some cases better productivity but

160
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,930
then you want to bring it in during rain

161
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:52,109
filling anyway so the irrigated paddy is

162
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:54,329
the most productive ecosystem the rain

163
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,840
fed lowland rice accounts for only 19%

164
00:06:54,329 --> 00:07:00,359
of production but is planted on about

165
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:02,399
36% of land so you can see that the

166
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,110
ratio is quite different and the rain

167
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,079
for lowland rice is actually a major

168
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:09,900
ecosystem in many countries and all the

169
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:12,750
poorest farmers end up planting on

170
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:14,939
either rain fed lowland or the upland

171
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,160
and the deep water environments where

172
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:19,250
they have no control over water so

173
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,170
control over water in the rice

174
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,509
production system means that you have

175
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:27,090
the potential to manager your the

176
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:29,399
management is is usually more

177
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:33,629
sophisticated and you're not dependent

178
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:35,099
on on rain walk on rainfall so now I

179
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:36,870
have to introduce you to at least a

180
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,200
couple of these ecosystems so I can go

181
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:42,000
on and explain further many people look

182
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,529
at the paddy system and they think what

183
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,360
are we gonna do we can't produce any

184
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:46,949
rice in the future look at that standing

185
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,259
water we don't have enough water on the

186
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:51,689
planet to continue to produce rice in

187
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:53,819
this way so I just want to walk back a

188
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:56,009
little bit and explain something that

189
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:58,709
you may already know and some some of

190
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:01,259
you may not know but the paddy system

191
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:05,699
has evolved partly to take advantage of

192
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:08,099
wetland so there's land all over all

193
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:11,069
over the world of course but a lot of

194
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:13,379
the land in in Asia actually is right on

195
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:15,300
the on the edges of rivers there are a

196
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:17,850
lot of major rivers that flood every

197
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,460
year and the only crops that can survive

198
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:23,060
in those flooded areas the only major

199
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:26,669
cereal crop that can survive is rice and

200
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:28,649
the other the other real explanation for

201
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,870
why people flood and want to continue

202
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:33,120
flooding the land is because it's the

203
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,950
oldest form of weed control that we know

204
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,200
so if you have a crop that can grow in

205
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:39,030
standing water and as I've said rice

206
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,610
it's the only major cereal that can do

207
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:44,279
that then when you bring water up to a

208
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,860
certain level you do two things you

209
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:48,779
drown out most of the weed species if

210
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,460
they're not related closely related to

211
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:53,679
rice or if they're not an aquatic weed

212
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:56,350
and you provide

213
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:59,169
in water stagnant water when it goes

214
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:02,080
anaerobic we'll go we'll push the pH to

215
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:03,759
pH 7 and that optimizes the availability

216
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,020
of nutrients in the rice paddy

217
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:11,110
so having flooded rice standing water an

218
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:13,569
anaerobic situation you give rice an

219
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:16,209
advantage over weeds you give it almost

220
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,830
the perfect nutrient supply and you're

221
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,569
using land they could not be used for

222
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,639
anything else and that's sort of the

223
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:24,129
history in a package of why we produce

224
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:26,500
or why the world has moved towards this

225
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:28,269
kind of production and I just want to

226
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,509
mention that the reason rice can do this

227
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:34,059
is because it's capable of taking oxygen

228
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:35,620
down through the from the chute down to

229
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:38,289
the route through the Rankine themselves

230
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:40,060
but it has to have a chute above the

231
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:41,528
water line in order to be able to do

232
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:44,528
that because it has to access what

233
00:09:41,528 --> 00:09:49,028
oxygen from the air so it oxygenates its

234
00:09:44,528 --> 00:09:51,220
own routes by this system of passing

235
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:53,289
oxygen through now one of the other

236
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,209
really big problems with a rice paddy

237
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:57,549
today although it's optimal for growing

238
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:59,889
rice is that among the microbial

239
00:09:57,549 --> 00:10:02,169
populations in the rhizosphere and in

240
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:04,539
the paddy as a whole in these anaerobic

241
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:08,319
soils are the methanogens that are

242
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:10,149
pumping out methane and that puts a lot

243
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,250
of pressure on the rice community to

244
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:14,829
along with the lack of fresh water to

245
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:17,169
move out of the irrigated system so I

246
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:18,910
just want you to understand that when we

247
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:20,889
think about moving out of the paddy

248
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:23,860
system we're going to have to deal with

249
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:26,439
things like weeds and nutrient disorders

250
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:29,110
that the rice community has not had to

251
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,110
deal with as its as its bread Rice's for

252
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:34,450
these irrigated systems so you think

253
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,970
about the other extreme if you have

254
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:38,920
control over water and you can irrigate

255
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,190
you're very productive the other extreme

256
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:44,229
is that you live in these upland Virata

257
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:46,779
and these upland areas this is the

258
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,789
absolute poorest part of the rice

259
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:52,240
producing community this is a

260
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:54,879
slash-and-burn field in Laos and there's

261
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,519
very poor soils throughout this part of

262
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:59,078
Southeast Asia and when you slash and

263
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,819
burn you only get about two or three

264
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:03,519
years of production before you have to

265
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,440
move out and leave the land fallow but

266
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,360
the origin of upland rice is quite

267
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,890
interesting because these

268
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,220
Rice's have evolved in these

269
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:15,039
environments for thousands of years and

270
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,290
people have learned to make selections

271
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,659
these are usually traditional varieties

272
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:23,259
these are not you're not professionally

273
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:28,059
bred and there's a lot of manual weeding

274
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:29,559
and a lot of anxiety about drought so I

275
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:32,319
show you this picture this is these are

276
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:35,379
Lao and allow and community in the

277
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,990
slash-and-burn Hills but there are other

278
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:40,240
parts of the world that grow upland rice

279
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:43,299
in a very different way and this picture

280
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,709
shows you this our fathers of Brazil so

281
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:46,809
when they cleared parts of the Amazon

282
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:49,899
they started planting rice in these

283
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:51,969
cerrado areas which are upland in the

284
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:55,059
sense that they're very dry and they

285
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:56,920
plant rice with a usually they plant it

286
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:59,889
the way we do in the United States are

287
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:01,719
completely mechanized this is they flash

288
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:03,970
then they burned the Amazon and they go

289
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,430
in and and early on before they started

290
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,290
planting pastures they planted rice and

291
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:10,389
they planted upland rice and they

292
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:12,159
planted it with machines and they left

293
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:13,480
it there and they let the weeds compete

294
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,919
and they didn't irrigate and they didn't

295
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,149
worry anything about and they came back

296
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:19,629
in at the end of the season and

297
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:21,759
harvested and they got something there

298
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:24,698
so they started breeding their varieties

299
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:27,698
for this very extreme upland Brian

300
00:12:24,698 --> 00:12:30,519
ecosystem and those varieties today are

301
00:12:27,698 --> 00:12:33,069
very very in demand especially through

302
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:35,980
parts of West Africa where rice

303
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,839
consumption is growing the fastest okay

304
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,449
and the only other ecosystem I'm going

305
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,240
to talk about is the rain fed lowland

306
00:12:39,448 --> 00:12:46,899
ecosystem and this one has benefits and

307
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:49,209
and and some very severe challenges so

308
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:51,458
what you see in the top left is the

309
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:53,528
drought 'add area this is a rain for

310
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:56,009
lowland field where hasn't rained for a

311
00:12:53,528 --> 00:12:59,860
while and this gentleman is actually

312
00:12:56,009 --> 00:13:02,289
replanting trying to fill in areas where

313
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,269
his rice is thinning due to the drought

314
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:06,490
and you will see people going in and

315
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:08,709
trying to replant seedlings in these

316
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,409
areas hoping that the rains are going to

317
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:13,359
come in the lower right you see the

318
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:15,578
flash floods which is the opposite

319
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,909
problem and this is constantly a problem

320
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:20,500
and it's a growing problem with climate

321
00:13:17,909 --> 00:13:21,519
variability where you have both drought

322
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,789
and

323
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,350
submergence in the same season and

324
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:27,969
traditionally people had a rainy season

325
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,889
in a dry season they planted very

326
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,389
different Rice's during the rainy and

327
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:33,100
the dry but now they're getting rain

328
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:35,080
during the dry season and and drought

329
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,000
during the wet season and we're having

330
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,590
to breed for things that can that can

331
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,230
withstand both droughts and flooding in

332
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:44,470
the same season on the opposite poles

333
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:46,659
you see problem soils that are in parts

334
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,580
in the one is and the top right is in

335
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:50,679
Columbia the lower left is in Liberia

336
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,980
but these problems are very similar

337
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:56,799
where you have iron toxicity

338
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:58,779
unavailability of phosphorus and things

339
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:01,659
that go along with acid soil problems

340
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:03,490
and those those the breeding in those

341
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:06,879
areas is actually also a very

342
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,680
interesting endeavor and one in which

343
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,210
I've been very involved and continue to

344
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:14,250
be involved this one on the lower left

345
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:16,360
is a picture of the iron toxic fields in

346
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,340
Liberia and you can see a few varieties

347
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,620
in the front rows that are actually

348
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,269
doing quite well in that soil but

349
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,179
there's been a long history of people

350
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:27,549
looking for tolerance to iron toxic

351
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:30,009
soils in the lab Arriba which is the

352
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:33,009
rice that was domesticated in that part

353
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:34,330
of the world anyway just to move on so

354
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:36,189
I'm going to talk a little bit about the

355
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,440
geography of these ecosystems and then

356
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,840
tell you something about the breeding so

357
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,430
that the geographical distribution of

358
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:46,780
these ecosystems if you just look at

359
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:49,479
that map you see a bunch of blue dots

360
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:51,309
those are the irrigated fields and

361
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,920
they're concentrated throughout the high

362
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:57,939
producing areas of China India and

363
00:14:53,919 --> 00:15:00,549
Indonesia those three large producers in

364
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,320
the world you also see some blue dots a

365
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:06,069
little bit down in Uruguay in South

366
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,620
America in Madagascar in a couple of in

367
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:10,390
Mali there's a few areas in Senegal

368
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:14,620
where they where they irrigate and then

369
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:17,350
in the United States but what you see

370
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,659
throughout most of Africa and and parts

371
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,490
of South America are blue and red dots

372
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:23,620
indicating the rain fed lowland and the

373
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:27,340
rain fed and the upland which is of

374
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,929
course rain fed in a sense so the parts

375
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:31,540
of the world that are producing rice

376
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:32,739
outside of the irrigated system those

377
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:35,339
are the parts of the world where rice

378
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,860
consumption is growing the fast

379
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:40,430
and they as you see they don't have

380
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:44,220
controlled irrigation so breeding for

381
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:46,049
rain fed lowland and all of the income

382
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,210
in problems that come along with it is

383
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:49,889
actually serving servicing a great part

384
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:53,430
of the world you'll also notice that

385
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:55,639
within in Asia you see Southeast Asian

386
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:59,159
in vast parts of India and the fall

387
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:01,379
where you have rain fed and and upland

388
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:03,240
systems so these are the parts of the

389
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:04,649
world where the breeding has not been

390
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,778
very efficient in terms of the Green

391
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:08,990
Revolution the green revolution reading

392
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:13,559
those semi-dwarf that went out are all

393
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:16,860
require controlled water and controlled

394
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:19,949
fertilizer pesticide and and usually the

395
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,500
beginnings of mechanized labor so when

396
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:24,660
we aligned the geography of ecosystems

397
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,259
with the climate risk map of course you

398
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:29,969
see that they're on quite expectedly

399
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:33,600
across these areas where we're talking

400
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:36,778
about rice production being focused in

401
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,089
these problem areas with what we call

402
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:40,350
non ideal growing conditions meaning

403
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:42,630
there the rain fed lowland and the

404
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:44,399
uplands those are the areas also that

405
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:45,669
are being exposed to the highest climate

406
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,559
risk

407
00:16:45,669 --> 00:16:49,990
so what are the rice production

408
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:52,119
challenges so you know I've worked my

409
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,769
whole life really it's funny to be

410
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,659
working on rice and talking about rice

411
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:58,240
breeding here in Ithaca New York because

412
00:16:55,659 --> 00:16:59,469
most people don't think about it every

413
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,690
day and they're certainly not that

414
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:04,450
familiar with these environments but for

415
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:06,070
me this has been my life and I and I and

416
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:08,410
I think a lot about what the production

417
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:11,559
challenges are in the parts of the world

418
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:13,390
where rice is not only a source of food

419
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:16,359
but it's also a livelihood and a

420
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:18,190
cultural way of life so the rice

421
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:19,719
production challenges that we face are

422
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:21,850
to accelerate the breeding of high

423
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,069
yielding climate-resilient and resources

424
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:26,588
sufficient for these different

425
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:28,750
environments we have to reimagine how

426
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:31,329
rice is managed and this is a huge

427
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:33,490
endeavor that involves many people some

428
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:36,460
of whom are in this room thinking a lot

429
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:39,130
about agronomy and water management and

430
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,590
also thinking about when and where rice

431
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:43,270
is produced it's interesting that China

432
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:46,659
is already opening up new rice

433
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:50,109
production areas in the northern part of

434
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:52,570
China north of Beijing counting on

435
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:54,909
global warming to move their rice

436
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:58,019
production zone from the south farther

437
00:17:54,910 --> 00:18:00,940
north as the world as the climate warms

438
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:03,129
we're also in in the process and very

439
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,170
actively so here at Cornell of

440
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:07,690
developing predictive models to help

441
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:09,880
optimize a genotype by environment by

442
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:11,890
management by microbe and that's

443
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:15,190
predominantly the methane producing

444
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:18,610
microbes to optimize those interactions

445
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:21,130
in future rice production environments

446
00:18:18,609 --> 00:18:23,500
and then to improve the product the

447
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:26,890
connectivity among breeders farmers

448
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:29,529
Miller's service providers input vendors

449
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:31,300
policy makers and consumers and there's

450
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:32,859
a lot of work going on right now as you

451
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:34,599
know I wear another hat which is the

452
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:36,579
director of the digital AG initiative

453
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:39,099
here at Cornell there's a lot of work

454
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:42,189
going on in digital AG especially in

455
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:43,449
Indian and China to try to leapfrog over

456
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:46,120
some of the problems that they're

457
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:48,400
encountering with the traditional forms

458
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:50,829
of extension and outreach to use digital

459
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,570
technologies more wisely to try to help

460
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:54,939
make these transitions that are going to

461
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:56,589
be needed to feed their people Oh

462
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,750
and I did want to say so I have these

463
00:18:56,589 --> 00:19:01,029
themes of genetic diversity resilience

464
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,589
and resource use efficiency and today

465
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:04,480
I'm going to give you some examples that

466
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:07,539
are going to interweave some of these

467
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:11,049
ideas as we go forward so those three

468
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:13,680
themes will be coming back around so I

469
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:17,460
think it was Jim who said I when I

470
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:20,410
graduated from Cornell with my PhD I

471
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:24,250
moved with my family and my two little

472
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:25,630
kids to the Philippines and if you're a

473
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:28,059
rice breeder this is the most beautiful

474
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:30,610
thing you can do is look outside of your

475
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:33,190
lab and see all the rice paddies right

476
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:34,809
there you can imagine all the

477
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,390
experiments that you might want to do

478
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:39,819
those are those electrophoresis units

479
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:42,100
that was RFLP days that was southern

480
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:45,429
analysis that was in the early 90s

481
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:47,379
so our RFLP map consists of a hundred

482
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:50,070
and thirty-five RFLPs and it had taken

483
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:53,350
us two years with three people working

484
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:55,179
24/7 in order to produce that map so you

485
00:19:53,349 --> 00:19:58,269
have to kind of think back to what the

486
00:19:55,180 --> 00:20:00,130
early technology was like and as Jim

487
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:02,769
said I did a lot of training and during

488
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:05,260
those early years we not only trained in

489
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:07,539
Erie but I actually went out to most of

490
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:10,000
the national programs and in the early

491
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:12,129
nineties China was was in a very very

492
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,259
very different place than it is today

493
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:16,300
and trained many of the people who are

494
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:17,980
today ministers of agriculture and doing

495
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:20,500
wonderful things for their country and

496
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,000
it was it was back in that in those days

497
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,920
when I don't think any of us could have

498
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,839
possibly imagined what that country

499
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:32,050
would do in terms of agriculture so my

500
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:34,629
time at Erie was also punctuated by my

501
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:37,180
love of the team banking all that it

502
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:40,360
represents so that's just a picture of a

503
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:42,430
brick-and-mortar building the gene bank

504
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:44,619
actually isn't in that building it's

505
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,970
beneath that building the gene banks

506
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:48,909
it's in an earthquake-proof

507
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:50,680
vault underneath that building and my

508
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,750
lab was in that building so all I had to

509
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,160
do was go downstairs and there were a

510
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,049
hundred and eighty thousand different

511
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,440
accessions and they were just sitting

512
00:20:56,049 --> 00:21:01,029
there these seed packs in you know most

513
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,809
of them on youth we didn't know much

514
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:03,940
about them

515
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:05,649
usually they had passport information

516
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,480
which is that you know where they were

517
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,650
collected when they were collected and

518
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,610
sometime

519
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:14,110
you knew a little bit about some of the

520
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:15,399
morphological traits but you really

521
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:17,409
didn't know much about them

522
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,860
so there was this sort of enticing

523
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:24,340
opportunity to use this stuff but where

524
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:26,439
to begin when there 180,000 of them so

525
00:21:24,339 --> 00:21:28,599
one of the things you would do of course

526
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,549
was think about the Ecology's and from

527
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:32,019
which they'd been collected that would

528
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:34,629
tell you something about the genetics

529
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:37,299
you could think about the geography and

530
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:39,280
that might tell you something you could

531
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:41,109
also think about any comments that had

532
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:42,819
been made and registered on the seed

533
00:21:41,109 --> 00:21:44,769
packs when they were collected about

534
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:47,710
what farmers used these different rice

535
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:49,359
varieties for but my point is and I'll

536
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,130
come back to this at the end is I've

537
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:55,240
been fascinated by the idea that

538
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:57,850
traditional farmers had a kind of closer

539
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:00,370
communion with the land and with the

540
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:02,829
ecosystem and with the challenges then

541
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:04,569
most of us have today and therefore that

542
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:06,129
there was a lot embedded in these seeds

543
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:08,980
that as we could just extract that

544
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:12,400
information it would be useful to to us

545
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:14,079
as breeders now the other thing is that

546
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,780
of course when I went to Erie I had to

547
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,909
decide what to do and I we had a nice

548
00:22:16,779 --> 00:22:22,420
map we had all hundred and thirty-five

549
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:24,040
markers that was a big deal but there

550
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,750
were a lot of challenges that that

551
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:27,460
needed to be addressed and so the

552
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:30,609
Rockefeller Foundation who was funding

553
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:33,579
my position at Erie had done a study to

554
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:36,219
determine which traits were the major

555
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:37,509
constraints to rice production in the

556
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:40,240
environments in which they were

557
00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:41,859
interested and they had helped to target

558
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,200
my work in the work of many others

559
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:46,629
aguirre so that the next part of this

560
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:50,080
story is about what traits what

561
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:53,620
discoveries and what outcomes we have

562
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:55,808
seen over the last that was in 1990 so

563
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:59,619
if I calculate that I think that's over

564
00:22:55,808 --> 00:23:01,839
25 years the over that period of time so

565
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:04,359
one of the first traits of interest with

566
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:06,428
the concept of roots and roots of course

567
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:09,219
have something to do with water and

568
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:11,860
nutrients and anchoring and all kinds of

569
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:13,720
things but nobody had really got a very

570
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:16,289
good handle on the genetics of roots at

571
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,579
that time and so that was one of those

572
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:20,859
tantalizing opportunities but she see

573
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:22,538
whether these different root structures

574
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:26,168
which you see in this photograph

575
00:23:22,538 --> 00:23:29,499
could actually be tracked retractable as

576
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:32,440
genetic characteristics of the plant we

577
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:34,719
also looked at salinity and submergence

578
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,298
tolerance and iron toxicity tolerance in

579
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:39,459
a variety of things that had to do with

580
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:41,608
the soils in these rain fed areas and I

581
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:44,169
was a pathologist coming out of a

582
00:23:41,608 --> 00:23:46,718
pathology background so I was also very

583
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:49,059
interested in diseases that first one is

584
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:52,088
rice blast the other one to the side is

585
00:23:49,058 --> 00:23:54,428
the bacterial blight and then the green

586
00:23:52,088 --> 00:23:56,469
leaf hopper is a transmitter of a virus

587
00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:58,449
the yellow model virus and so these were

588
00:23:56,469 --> 00:24:00,788
early on of the tongue grow virus I'm

589
00:23:58,449 --> 00:24:03,058
sorry these were early on on the kind of

590
00:24:00,788 --> 00:24:05,578
traits that I was looking at and I had a

591
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:09,368
relationship with a guy who was a soil

592
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:11,348
scientist there and I through that I

593
00:24:09,368 --> 00:24:13,418
developed an interest in understanding

594
00:24:11,348 --> 00:24:15,428
nitrogen fixation and the rhizosphere of

595
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:17,319
rice and it turned out that this was

596
00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:19,899
genetically tractable and we published

597
00:24:17,318 --> 00:24:23,759
the very very first paper showing that

598
00:24:19,898 --> 00:24:26,558
you could track genes in the plant that

599
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:28,538
correspond to the ability to fix or

600
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:30,338
stimulate nitrogen fixation in the

601
00:24:28,538 --> 00:24:32,759
rhizosphere this is associate of

602
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:35,019
nitrogen fixation this is not nodular

603
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:36,969
but there's object there was obviously

604
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:39,338
some kind of exudate coming out of those

605
00:24:36,969 --> 00:24:42,249
roots we didn't have the tools at that

606
00:24:39,338 --> 00:24:44,618
time to study further what either what

607
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:47,259
the exudates were nor which microbes

608
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:48,548
were doing the fixation but i just

609
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:52,149
wanted to mention this paper was

610
00:24:48,548 --> 00:24:54,278
published as you see here in 1995 so

611
00:24:52,148 --> 00:24:57,218
that was a very early start and the

612
00:24:54,278 --> 00:24:59,828
material that can be used to pursue that

613
00:24:57,219 --> 00:25:01,719
today if I were looking at microbiomes

614
00:24:59,828 --> 00:25:04,509
today that's one of the things I would

615
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:07,328
certainly pursue I was also fascinated

616
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:10,710
by domestication and as I said the early

617
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:12,599
landraces so

618
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:14,340
geneticists in a breeder do you have to

619
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:16,589
do a lot of crossing while crossing and

620
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:19,019
rice you see this picture you have to

621
00:25:16,589 --> 00:25:21,298
actually mask you late every single

622
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:23,808
floor at that you're going to cross and

623
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:26,819
it's quite a laborious thing you clip

624
00:25:23,808 --> 00:25:30,058
you clip the the floor at just before

625
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:32,849
the anthers are up to the top and then

626
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:35,879
you can make your crosses it's done it's

627
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:38,009
still done manually throughout all all

628
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,929
cross eery and we were developing

629
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:41,819
populations in those days mostly by

630
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:45,210
parental populations that were the

631
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:47,668
source of QTL mapping remember this was

632
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,798
1990 okay and this was a big deal

633
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:52,559
because this was an opportunity to get

634
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:54,869
at traits genetically that had only been

635
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:58,048
able to be under selection by breeders

636
00:25:54,869 --> 00:26:00,028
at the phenotypic level and so we were

637
00:25:58,048 --> 00:26:04,918
looking for parents that were of course

638
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:07,259
they had trait contrast so one pace

639
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:08,940
susceptible or resistant they had to be

640
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:11,250
genetically divergent because we only

641
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,200
had a hundred and thirty-five RFLPs and

642
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,970
you want those rfl peas to be

643
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,830
polymorphic so if you take two lines

644
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:18,360
that are very closely related you

645
00:26:16,829 --> 00:26:20,759
wouldn't have enough markers to cover

646
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:23,158
the genome to do a QTL analysis so a lot

647
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:25,829
of these were indica by japonica crosses

648
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:27,590
they had to be crossable we wanted fast

649
00:26:25,829 --> 00:26:30,000
generation time because we were making

650
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:33,000
these immortal recombinant inbred

651
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,589
populations and I won't go on about the

652
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,148
details of this but I just want to say

653
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:38,428
that many of the populations that we

654
00:26:36,148 --> 00:26:40,648
made in the early 90s when I first went

655
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:42,778
to Erie are still the basis of what is

656
00:26:40,648 --> 00:26:45,538
being used to derive and clone genes

657
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:47,099
today and also to drive a lot of the

658
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:47,519
breeding that I'll talk about in a

659
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:50,819
moment

660
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:53,548
these were indica by tropical japonica

661
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:55,980
crosses the countries of origin were

662
00:26:53,548 --> 00:26:57,898
things like the co 39 by more bear con

663
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,360
they were from India and from Cote

664
00:26:57,898 --> 00:27:03,298
d'Ivoire though they were irrigated by

665
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:05,099
upland crosses they segregated for all

666
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:06,898
kinds of pests and diseases they

667
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:08,579
segregated for root structure they

668
00:27:06,898 --> 00:27:11,489
segregated for drought tolerance they

669
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:14,189
segregated for seed size all kinds of

670
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:16,409
things and so the the bottleneck of

671
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:18,240
course was phenotyping because you could

672
00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:20,070
genotype one population if you could

673
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,019
create the population and it would take

674
00:27:20,069 --> 00:27:24,210
several years but you had two or three

675
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:27,210
seasons a year so you could do

676
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:29,549
fairly rapidly so all I'm gonna say is

677
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:33,440
we created several populations and those

678
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:36,000
populations are in fact a source of

679
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,559
wealth today so if you can get your

680
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,539
hands on them they're publicly available

681
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:41,129
and if you're ever working on rice and

682
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:44,059
I'll tell you more about the kinds of

683
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:47,280
resources we've built these are really

684
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:49,289
good opportunities and I will say I have

685
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:52,019
the seeds right here at Cornell should

686
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:54,359
anybody want to pursue it so one of the

687
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:55,980
early papers was this paper called

688
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:57,809
locating genes associated with root

689
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:01,200
morphology and drought avoidance in rice

690
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:03,569
V a linkage to molecular markers and my

691
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,009
graduate student Mike shampoo who you

692
00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:08,490
see up in the upper right-hand corner

693
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:11,730
led this work so it was published in 95

694
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:13,349
and I only got to Erie in 1990 and I was

695
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:15,960
a lot of work and I want to just walk

696
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:17,819
through what we did so we grew rice in

697
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,500
the greenhouse using these PVC pipes

698
00:28:17,819 --> 00:28:22,429
because we were measuring route depth

699
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:26,099
and doing some character some

700
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:26,730
calibrations on route thickness we grew

701
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:28,740
them in

702
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,539
aeroponics we didn't have hydroponics

703
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,220
but we had aeroponics and if you look at

704
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:34,740
the lengths of those roots those are

705
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,769
only six week old plants these were

706
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:40,500
because we had an upland variety in our

707
00:28:37,769 --> 00:28:42,359
in our cross we also grew them in the

708
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,549
field and withheld water so it's what we

709
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:46,829
call manage stress so we were able to

710
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:49,649
apply stress when we wanted to because

711
00:28:46,829 --> 00:28:52,319
we had irrigation control and then it

712
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:54,269
was all RFLPs and so RFLP is of course

713
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:56,490
our really cumbersome and really slow

714
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:58,740
and you can see that uh kyushu they're

715
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:01,200
grinding the tissue on liquid nitrogen

716
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,569
and we produced this this is the map as

717
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,490
it was the map that I produced that in

718
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:07,889
here at Cornell before I went there

719
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:10,109
there's the I think we had about 150

720
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:12,120
markers in those days and those little

721
00:29:10,109 --> 00:29:14,639
boxes you see to the left of each of the

722
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:19,429
12 chromosomes are indicating where we

723
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:22,620
had let's say QTL is associated with

724
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:25,650
root morphology either from these

725
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:28,139
greenhouse or aeroponics and where they

726
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:30,509
overlapped is the the coloration or the

727
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:32,880
barbershop holes on the chromosomes

728
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:35,670
where they overlapped with a field level

729
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,100
drought so we were starting to show that

730
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:41,250
you could find regions of chromosomes

731
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:43,379
where you could associate root traits

732
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:46,259
and root morphological characteristics

733
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:48,420
with performance under drought in the

734
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:50,819
field and this was absolutely

735
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:54,690
revolutionary when I took this result to

736
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:56,970
my boss and URI he looked at me I won't

737
00:29:54,690 --> 00:30:00,779
name him very famous rice breeder he

738
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:04,579
looked at me and he said Susan qtls

739
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:08,190
are a figment of your imagination and

740
00:30:04,579 --> 00:30:12,599
you'll notice he was not on the list of

741
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:14,700
authors but I will note that one of the

742
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:16,980
people who is on this list of authors I

743
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:21,509
will he will come back into the story a

744
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:23,819
little later so no to Dave McGill okay

745
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:26,069
so then I'm going to highlight this

746
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:27,779
little region at the bottom of

747
00:30:26,069 --> 00:30:29,879
chromosome 9 because part of the story

748
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:31,649
I'm going to tell that has to do what

749
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,360
they've mikael comes back around and

750
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:40,980
that at the bottom of chromosome 9 that

751
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:42,839
QTL comes back around anyway so we had a

752
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:45,029
lot of cleaning and counting and

753
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:47,279
measuring of roots and I had a team or

754
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:49,769
Mike shampoo had a team of people that

755
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:52,710
were all involved and this team of

756
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:56,099
people would work day and night to cut

757
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:58,650
we had plastic bags in the PVC pipes we

758
00:30:56,099 --> 00:31:01,589
would cut them at certain depths we

759
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:04,830
would wash measure way and and with a

760
00:31:01,589 --> 00:31:07,649
caliper measure the width of these roots

761
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:10,679
to look at root characteristics

762
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:13,440
meanwhile this is a extraction of DNA

763
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:16,650
this was a lot of DNA you needed a lot

764
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:20,340
of DNA to do southern analysis and all

765
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:21,810
of these were p32 labeled blots so many

766
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:23,699
of you are shaking your head so I know

767
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:26,759
you've been around as long as I have

768
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:29,549
anyway this was a tremendous challenge

769
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:32,190
it was as we could see very clearly the

770
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:34,139
scientific potential of our mapping our

771
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:36,960
QTL analysis and marker-assisted

772
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:39,660
selection was right on the horizon but

773
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,000
this process was really slow we had to

774
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:44,370
generate by parental population we had

775
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,220
to do phenotyping and genotyping and

776
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:49,589
that was RFLPs it was really laborious

777
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,569
and it was very costly the enzymes had

778
00:31:49,589 --> 00:31:53,819
to come in through Philippine customs

779
00:31:51,569 --> 00:31:56,369
it was nothing like the work that we do

780
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:58,109
today and each population segregated for

781
00:31:56,369 --> 00:32:00,809
only two alleles so we started making

782
00:31:58,109 --> 00:32:03,209
lots of different populations because

783
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:05,309
everybody was sure that their particular

784
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:08,549
combination was the one that would be

785
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:10,740
most important so many people so many

786
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:12,539
moving parts so many expensive reagents

787
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,490
and so little connectivity so

788
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:17,009
information didn't move that easily

789
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:19,650
because these were pre-internet days and

790
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:22,710
so data sharing was difficult data

791
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:24,960
management was beginnings of Excel files

792
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:27,390
but data analytics we didn't have the

793
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,569
computational power we have today so all

794
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:32,100
of this made it into a way I started

795
00:32:30,569 --> 00:32:35,279
thinking this is not going to help

796
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:38,129
reading this is taking way too long it's

797
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,420
way too expensive and we're not making

798
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:41,130
the kind of progress meanwhile the

799
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:43,470
breeders were going along independently

800
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:45,630
and we work completely irrelevant I

801
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,460
disagreed with my boss that we that

802
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,770
these were figments of our imaginations

803
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:53,069
but we were clearly not on the breeding

804
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:56,940
pipeline anyway I came back to Cornell

805
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:58,619
after five years in Erie and genomics

806
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,160
was moving down the road we were moving

807
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:04,079
out of RFLPs and moving into SSRS and

808
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:06,120
one of my grand visions was to be able

809
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:07,769
to genotype the gene Bank a theory I

810
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:10,019
thought wouldn't that be wonderful if we

811
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:12,720
could just genotype the gene bank we

812
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:15,299
could make digital selections as to

813
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:19,289
which kinds of materials we wanted to

814
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:21,480
use and it wasn't exactly as easy as it

815
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:23,609
is today but we did get it our first NSF

816
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,769
grant to build a road map of natural

817
00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:27,539
variation in rice based on obviously a

818
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:29,849
selection of the materials in the gene

819
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:32,549
bank and we asked some questions how

820
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:34,769
much diversity is there in sativa how is

821
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:37,109
it organized and where is it found and

822
00:33:34,769 --> 00:33:39,480
that you've already seen the maps and

823
00:33:37,109 --> 00:33:41,729
the distributions of Ecology's so now we

824
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,730
wanted to add a molecular genotypic

825
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:46,950
layer to overlay on what we thought we

826
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:49,110
knew based on phenotype and adaptation

827
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:51,000
and what can we learn about genotype

828
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:53,250
phenotype associations can we start

829
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,779
making predictions and what knowledge

830
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:56,970
and tools do we need to accelerate

831
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:59,099
breeding and the management of new rice

832
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:01,259
varieties given that RFLPs were not

833
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:03,928
going to do the job

834
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:05,910
so the first thing we did was to collect

835
00:34:03,929 --> 00:34:09,418
a sample of diversity from the gene bank

836
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:12,030
based on mostly geography and the

837
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:13,710
focused on land races he had some elites

838
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:15,210
in there but a lot of land races because

839
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:17,280
that's where the maximum amount of

840
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:19,648
variation was after all

841
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,350
so our collection was from across the

842
00:34:19,648 --> 00:34:24,569
world we were using SSRS and then we

843
00:34:22,349 --> 00:34:26,159
moved quickly into snips and I think our

844
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:28,109
lab here at Cornell has been in the

845
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,490
vanguard of providing markers to

846
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:31,230
everyone in the world we've never

847
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:33,779
protected them we've put everything into

848
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:35,909
the public domain and even today there

849
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,010
isn't a QTL paper that's published that

850
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:40,019
isn't using the markers out of the

851
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:42,540
Cornell Lab so I've been very proud

852
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:45,030
actually when I go around the world have

853
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:46,789
so many people tell me that they're so

854
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:50,940
grateful that they were able to use this

855
00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:52,469
this technology as it came out so what

856
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,030
is the first thing we did of course we

857
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:55,858
looked at the sub population structure

858
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:57,930
so Tyva and it's well known that there

859
00:34:55,858 --> 00:35:00,599
are two varietal groups that japonica

860
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:03,059
and the indica and the picture in the

861
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:05,819
upper right hand corner shows you what

862
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:07,829
my breeding colleagues taught me when I

863
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:10,559
first went to Erie they said there are

864
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:13,319
three sub populations the Javan Iike the

865
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,719
japonica and the indica and the Jovanka

866
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,570
is simply the tropical version of

867
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:20,250
temperate japonica so those two are the

868
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:22,680
japonica's and then there was this thing

869
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:24,059
called indica and they told me everybody

870
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:26,669
in the world who produces high quality

871
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:32,670
high yielding rice is producing indica

872
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:35,970
rights okay what do I know fine we did

873
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:40,320
some analysis using our first of all our

874
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:42,509
SSRS and we saw sort of the same thing

875
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,820
you know we saw the japonica group and

876
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:46,320
we saw the indica group but didn't quite

877
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:48,869
conform to the picture that they had

878
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,400
painted for me and you can see that the

879
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:51,809
tropical japonica and the temperature

880
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,389
ponic of the blue and the green here on

881
00:35:51,809 --> 00:35:57,869
the left are very closely related in the

882
00:35:54,389 --> 00:36:00,299
PCA and in fact they are very distinct

883
00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:01,650
in the minds of the Erie breeders

884
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,840
because they grow in such different

885
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:06,420
environments but they're very closely

886
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:08,460
related evolutionarily meanwhile this

887
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,820
huge group that they said was indica

888
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:13,800
turns out to have two very distinctive

889
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:14,970
evolutionarily distinctive subgroups but

890
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,620
they're not well different

891
00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:18,899
Shadid either in terms of their

892
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:20,969
geography where they grow nor in terms

893
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:23,490
of their morphology and they're easily

894
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:24,929
crossable so one is called indica and

895
00:36:23,489 --> 00:36:26,969
the other is called ouch which is a

896
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:29,159
Bengali word for the season of the year

897
00:36:26,969 --> 00:36:32,339
in which these rice is grown now the

898
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:33,929
ouch subpopulation as it turns out had

899
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:36,390
always been considered part of indica

900
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:39,059
but from this PCA I think you can see

901
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:41,429
that evolutionarily it is almost as

902
00:36:39,059 --> 00:36:44,190
different from indica as the tropical

903
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:47,699
japonica is from indica so this was a

904
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:50,250
discovery it went in it flew in the face

905
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:53,669
of all that was known about rice

906
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:55,170
genetics and furthermore we applied the

907
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,119
molecular markers to the kind of

908
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:59,639
material that was being grown in the US

909
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,489
which is high yielding and subtropical

910
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:04,230
and everybody called it indica and we

911
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:06,479
showed that it's all tropical japonica

912
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:08,190
everything grown in the u.s. is tropical

913
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,849
japonica there's no indicas grown in the

914
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:13,950
US so that was revolutionary and then on

915
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:15,630
top of it all I don't know if you see

916
00:37:13,949 --> 00:37:18,659
this little thing called aromatic in the

917
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:22,289
middle that little purple that cluster

918
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:24,449
of dots those are the famous basmati the

919
00:37:22,289 --> 00:37:26,699
supreme quality rice which is exported

920
00:37:24,449 --> 00:37:29,609
which everybody most people in the world

921
00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:32,399
really value and it showed that actually

922
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:33,990
the aromatic is not indica it's always

923
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,329
called indigo because as long slim

924
00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:38,909
grains and it's not indica and it's not

925
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:40,650
japonica in fact it's an admixture

926
00:37:38,909 --> 00:37:44,519
between ouch

927
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:47,160
and japonica and that was even more

928
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:49,679
heretical for the Indians who prized

929
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:52,319
this rice and the and the Pakistanis who

930
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:55,289
prized this rice as being of indica

931
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,320
origin and it's just been an interesting

932
00:37:55,289 --> 00:37:59,369
road for me because I had no

933
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,440
preconception about any of this and I

934
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:03,569
have no national identity found up in it

935
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,579
but things didn't sort out the way that

936
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:07,380
we thought they did and it helped

937
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:09,840
explain why it was so difficult to make

938
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:12,390
basmati by indica crosses because

939
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,730
actually basmati is more japonica like

940
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:14,940
than it is indica like okay enough of

941
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:17,110
that

942
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,940
so here

943
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:21,400
geographical distribution and I just

944
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:23,110
want to say if you if your step back

945
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,420
like I hope you can see this slide

946
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:28,000
there's a lot of red and yellow in the

947
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:30,490
top right corner in the Asian on the

948
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,760
asian continent subcontinent and around

949
00:38:30,489 --> 00:38:36,099
much of the rest of the world in Africa

950
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:39,790
and both North and South America it's

951
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:42,009
mostly light blue the light blue is the

952
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:44,679
tropical japonica and the red and the

953
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:46,360
yellow are the ocean the indica and so

954
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:48,279
you'll see that the AO in the indica

955
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,010
which are predominantly grown in the

956
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:54,250
tropical zones there in Asia are

957
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:55,870
associated with this high yielding the

958
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:58,510
high yielding types that we're seeing

959
00:38:55,869 --> 00:39:00,219
but what what is interesting here is

960
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:02,140
that it's the tropical japonica's that

961
00:39:00,219 --> 00:39:03,909
are grown throughout most of the rest of

962
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:06,039
the world some of which are very very

963
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:08,500
high yielding as we see in the United

964
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:12,670
States and in parts of South America and

965
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:15,219
so it scrambled people's understanding

966
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:17,230
of both what we could do with our germ

967
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:19,899
plasm and how we were combining it and

968
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:22,500
to some extent it helped challenge some

969
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:24,789
thinking if there is a distinct

970
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,710
population which you see as these bright

971
00:39:24,789 --> 00:39:29,050
yellow circles centered in the

972
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:31,619
Bangladeshi river delta and in east

973
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:34,150
india if that is a distinctive

974
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:36,880
evolutionarily distinctive type of rice

975
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:39,119
what is it that makes it so special or

976
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,550
isn't it special

977
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,859
many people claim to grow our varieties

978
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:45,150
today but part of the rest of the story

979
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:47,190
that I'm going to tell you is what we've

980
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:50,309
been learning as we start looking for

981
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:52,500
stress tolerant genes almost a hundred

982
00:39:50,309 --> 00:39:55,559
percent of which are coming from the our

983
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:58,019
sub population today so we've

984
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:59,610
constructed diversity panels and our

985
00:39:58,019 --> 00:40:01,590
diversity panels some of which we

986
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:03,900
constructed here with NSF funding in

987
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:07,500
collaboration with our colleagues in

988
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:10,829
Arkansas at the USDA and some of which

989
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:12,960
we constructed it Erie they consist of

990
00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:14,579
all five subpopulations the indica the

991
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,130
ouch the tropical tapana cut temperature

992
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:19,409
Hanukkah and aromatic and these

993
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:21,570
varieties are they're mostly traditional

994
00:40:19,409 --> 00:40:23,489
varieties have all been purified for at

995
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:26,550
least two generations and then bred

996
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:28,919
sorry purified from single panicles for

997
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:30,510
two generations and we now have inbred

998
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,720
sources of seed that can be distributed

999
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:36,320
and my lab here thanks to NSF funding

1000
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:38,699
put seven hundred thousand snips on all

1001
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,010
1600 of these lines and these are now

1002
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:43,889
available as the basis for Association

1003
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:46,590
mapping in rice the eary group then in

1004
00:40:43,889 --> 00:40:48,629
collaboration with with China has now

1005
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:51,329
added an additional three thousand and

1006
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:54,210
those were fully sequenced so we have

1007
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:57,329
collectively about 4,500 lines of rice

1008
00:40:54,210 --> 00:41:01,470
which have been purified are publicly

1009
00:40:57,329 --> 00:41:04,079
available and have genotypes so the beg

1010
00:41:01,469 --> 00:41:06,000
for the rest of the community is what do

1011
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,650
you want to do about phenotyping you can

1012
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,409
phenotype these lines you can request

1013
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:12,960
them you could request subsets you get

1014
00:41:10,409 --> 00:41:13,559
for free you get your genotypes over the

1015
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,389
Internet

1016
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:18,090
what kind of phenotypes that we want to

1017
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:19,650
look at and we've looked at all kinds of

1018
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:21,960
phenotypes and it's a very large

1019
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:24,059
collective now of people who can use

1020
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,099
these lines or subsets of these lines to

1021
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:27,989
phenotype whatever they want in the

1022
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:30,089
field in the growth chamber in any

1023
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:32,879
country in the world that allows them to

1024
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:34,829
import those Rice's and my lab has been

1025
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:38,700
doing quite a bit on panicle structure

1026
00:41:34,829 --> 00:41:41,429
on seed size shape and color on stresses

1027
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:43,049
related to water on things like ons this

1028
00:41:41,429 --> 00:41:45,809
shows the barbed on you may have

1029
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:49,500
followed some of that work on disease

1030
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:52,079
and resistance on canopy temperature and

1031
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,710
then on this fast growth in response to

1032
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,569
rise

1033
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:56,579
water lots and lots of different

1034
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:58,830
phenotypes and so the beauty of this is

1035
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:00,449
that the students who used to come into

1036
00:41:58,829 --> 00:42:02,400
my lab could choose a phenotype of

1037
00:42:00,449 --> 00:42:05,909
interest and they had material at their

1038
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,220
fingertips to work with and then there's

1039
00:42:05,909 --> 00:42:09,989
the roots so the roots are still some of

1040
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:13,379
my favorites and one of the things we

1041
00:42:09,989 --> 00:42:15,000
did was 15 years after our first root

1042
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:17,579
phenotyping experience in the

1043
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,530
Philippines was to work with Randy Clark

1044
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:22,650
who was part of Leon coaches lab at the

1045
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:26,280
USDA and Janelle Joan who was a PhD

1046
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:28,800
student in my lab Randy built this cool

1047
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,369
little um this was just the early

1048
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,710
version of it it's even cooler now but

1049
00:42:31,369 --> 00:42:36,690
this automated or semi-automated

1050
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:41,730
phenotyping system where we grew our

1051
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:44,369
plants I think you can see the yeah

1052
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:47,338
through these plants in a gel um gum so

1053
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:50,280
that's a that's like a sort of clear

1054
00:42:47,338 --> 00:42:54,358
John gum and then we would rotate them

1055
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:57,210
we put the cylinder apart of a big

1056
00:42:54,358 --> 00:43:00,029
cylinder actually in water and then we

1057
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:02,490
had that was on a revolving table and

1058
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:05,280
then we had the camera and could take

1059
00:43:02,489 --> 00:43:09,389
revolving pictures of this so that we

1060
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:13,109
could reconstruct 3d images from these

1061
00:43:09,389 --> 00:43:15,299
2d captured images and so this was the

1062
00:43:13,108 --> 00:43:17,489
early days of what we're calling today

1063
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,560
if I throughput phenotyping and image

1064
00:43:17,489 --> 00:43:21,689
capture and then automated image

1065
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:24,630
processing and what I just want to say

1066
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:27,358
is we would take 40 images per plant as

1067
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:29,430
it turned on its on its base

1068
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:30,690
they were imaged over different days

1069
00:43:29,429 --> 00:43:34,559
because it's completely non-destructive

1070
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:36,750
and then the software that Randy built

1071
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:40,049
the root Reader 3d software could

1072
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:42,630
reconstruct single 3d images of each

1073
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:45,180
individual's root system and then

1074
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:46,619
because you could have replicated these

1075
00:43:45,179 --> 00:43:48,690
were all inbred lines and you had

1076
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:51,440
replicated versions of this you could

1077
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:54,358
start to look at population level

1078
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,119
genome-wide associations using these

1079
00:43:54,358 --> 00:43:58,949
reconstructed 3d images and this was

1080
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,690
really quite a powerful technique and

1081
00:43:58,949 --> 00:44:03,989
when I think back to the days at Erie

1082
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:06,039
where we were 40 people using a caliper

1083
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:07,269
to measure roots and

1084
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:08,860
couldn't do anything that was

1085
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:11,349
non-destructive this was completely

1086
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:13,150
non-destructive what we were able to do

1087
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:15,519
was the following so this is just one

1088
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:18,849
example we were looking at root system

1089
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:22,210
architecture we used 373 individuals

1090
00:44:18,849 --> 00:44:24,759
from all the different sub populations

1091
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:26,860
we measured 13 different traits over

1092
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:29,320
three days in the four sub populations

1093
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:31,510
we didn't use aromatic we were not using

1094
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,280
the buzz Mahdi's we were using just the

1095
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:35,980
indigo D ouch the temperate in the

1096
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,590
tropical japonica now the 12 chromosomes

1097
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:40,420
of rice are here and the big lines are

1098
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:42,370
the qtls because we had by parental

1099
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:45,460
crosses as well as our association

1100
00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:47,799
mapping panel and the little tiny red

1101
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:50,349
ones are the G was qtls or the G was

1102
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,080
signal what you can see in some cases

1103
00:44:50,349 --> 00:44:55,960
the G was signals overlap with the QTL

1104
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:57,489
in other cases they sort of expand it

1105
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:00,130
and in other cases they were completely

1106
00:44:57,489 --> 00:45:03,099
independent of course the by parental

1107
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:05,769
cross was IR 64 by also sanik captured

1108
00:45:03,099 --> 00:45:07,900
only two alleles whereas the association

1109
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:09,519
mapping panel captured many alleles so

1110
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,309
you can appreciate that they weren't all

1111
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:14,619
entirely overlapping but really one of

1112
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:17,920
the take homes of this slide is that the

1113
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:20,739
QTL resolution was so much lower than

1114
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,599
the G was resolution and so for the same

1115
00:45:20,739 --> 00:45:24,519
population size you would get month but

1116
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:28,150
much better resolve regions of interest

1117
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:30,519
if you looked if you use the G waz as as

1118
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:33,610
compared to the QPL or the by parental

1119
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:35,800
TTL so here's a man Manhattan plot and

1120
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:37,210
what you see along and I think most of

1121
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,860
you probably know how to read him and

1122
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:42,340
hatton plot but these are the 12 Pro

1123
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:44,860
Mazzone and there were 700,000 snips and

1124
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:47,710
they're all lined up in order linear

1125
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:50,410
order as they are arrayed across and

1126
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:52,720
this is the negative law of probability

1127
00:45:50,409 --> 00:45:56,440
so this is just essentially a kind of

1128
00:45:52,719 --> 00:46:00,639
p-value for an association between the

1129
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:03,820
the snip and the phenotype and here is

1130
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:06,849
the most significant snip up at 10 to

1131
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:08,530
the minus 7 on chromosome 3 corresponds

1132
00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:11,259
to this region on chromosome 3 it was

1133
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:12,970
aji was hit and it's an association for

1134
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:15,340
route length in the indica sub

1135
00:46:12,969 --> 00:46:17,709
population and when you look at what

1136
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:20,440
these beautiful concatenated images look

1137
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:22,630
like now don't get

1138
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:24,010
there is no difference here okay I'm

1139
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:27,010
showing you where there is no difference

1140
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:30,760
and it's the snip that I'm showing you

1141
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:32,049
is 66 KB away from the peak snip but

1142
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,809
these the point here is these are

1143
00:46:32,048 --> 00:46:38,108
concatenated images this one has 39

1144
00:46:34,809 --> 00:46:39,910
different individuals replicated to form

1145
00:46:38,108 --> 00:46:42,670
a concatenated image of what the root

1146
00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:44,318
length was in these indicas these are

1147
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:46,269
the indicas that carry the a allele at

1148
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:47,949
this snip and the indicas that carried

1149
00:46:46,269 --> 00:46:50,619
the b allele at the same sniff there

1150
00:46:47,949 --> 00:46:54,068
were 118 of them and the two root

1151
00:46:50,619 --> 00:46:55,869
lengths are roughly the same but when

1152
00:46:54,068 --> 00:46:58,108
you move over and you look at the peak

1153
00:46:55,869 --> 00:46:59,980
snip which is the snip that was

1154
00:46:58,108 --> 00:47:01,750
significantly associated with the

1155
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:05,048
difference in the phenotype in the root

1156
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:07,480
length what you see is it that the a

1157
00:47:05,048 --> 00:47:09,880
allele carries the short route length

1158
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:12,039
and the B allele has a longer route

1159
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:13,660
length and there's a slightly different

1160
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:16,089
number because of course there were

1161
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:17,889
recombinant between this snip and miss

1162
00:47:16,088 --> 00:47:20,949
snip so the number of plants in each

1163
00:47:17,889 --> 00:47:26,409
group has shifted slightly now to take

1164
00:47:20,949 --> 00:47:28,389
homes here to the resolution is about 60

1165
00:47:26,409 --> 00:47:30,429
KB actually if you look at the ones

1166
00:47:28,389 --> 00:47:33,038
in-between you start to see a difference

1167
00:47:30,429 --> 00:47:34,629
and so I'm just showing you you can see

1168
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:37,630
little remnants of the difference but

1169
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:40,599
it's not as significant and the p-value

1170
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:44,289
is not as high so you have a pretty good

1171
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:46,778
resolution in rice if you have a 60 KB

1172
00:47:44,289 --> 00:47:48,940
resolution you're still talking about

1173
00:47:46,778 --> 00:47:52,539
several genes and really you have 60 K

1174
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:55,480
be on either side so at a you have

1175
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:57,970
roughly a hundred 120 KB you have at

1176
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:00,250
least 20 genes in that region but you've

1177
00:47:57,969 --> 00:48:03,129
narrowed your search space considerably

1178
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:05,650
now meanwhile okay we were doing this

1179
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:07,298
work here our NSF funding we were very

1180
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:09,220
excited about the new phenotyping

1181
00:48:07,298 --> 00:48:11,829
possibilities we were moving quickly to

1182
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:13,838
get a much higher resolution view of the

1183
00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:16,298
associations between genotype and

1184
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:17,739
phenotype and our colleagues at Erie had

1185
00:48:16,298 --> 00:48:20,920
continued down the road of the by

1186
00:48:17,739 --> 00:48:24,250
parental mapping for 15 years and they

1187
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:25,838
were doing amazing work measuring not

1188
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:27,730
only with calipers but they'd also

1189
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:29,528
started to automate their phenotyping

1190
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:32,318
and they were able to do it in the field

1191
00:48:29,528 --> 00:48:33,849
which I clearly is not and so some of

1192
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:36,039
the collaborations that I've had

1193
00:48:33,849 --> 00:48:38,170
these years I've kept me in in touch

1194
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:40,329
with this work and I just want to say

1195
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:41,680
that while I was doing the work here

1196
00:48:40,329 --> 00:48:44,590
they were doing the work there and one

1197
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:46,899
day a pag the two groups were getting up

1198
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:48,789
I got up to give a talk and my colleague

1199
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:51,820
Eddie or he got to give up talk right

1200
00:48:48,789 --> 00:48:53,409
after me and we realized we were doing

1201
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:55,289
the same work he was doing in the field

1202
00:48:53,409 --> 00:48:57,219
and we were doing it with this automated

1203
00:48:55,289 --> 00:49:00,070
phenotyping the question was are we

1204
00:48:57,219 --> 00:49:02,799
discovering any of the same any of the

1205
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:05,260
same region and I just want to show you

1206
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,840
that this work involved planting rice

1207
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:10,960
seedlings into a spaghetti colander

1208
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:13,539
which was then planted into a tub which

1209
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,639
was sunk into the soil so that you could

1210
00:49:13,539 --> 00:49:17,769
manage drought if that's what you wanted

1211
00:49:15,639 --> 00:49:20,469
to do and so that you could pull it up

1212
00:49:17,769 --> 00:49:22,630
and clean off the roots much as we had

1213
00:49:20,469 --> 00:49:25,059
been doing 15 years before at Erie and

1214
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:26,860
what you see is then you could clean off

1215
00:49:25,059 --> 00:49:28,659
the roots and then clip the roots and

1216
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:31,079
you could measure them as they came out

1217
00:49:28,659 --> 00:49:33,009
of the colander and so the different

1218
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:35,619
phenotype that was being measured by

1219
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:37,750
this group was whether the roots grew

1220
00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:40,539
straight down or whether they seemed to

1221
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:43,510
sprawl out across the soil at a

1222
00:49:40,539 --> 00:49:45,579
different angle and another group at

1223
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:48,580
area had been doing phenomenal work

1224
00:49:45,579 --> 00:49:50,739
looking at what we call phosphorous

1225
00:49:48,579 --> 00:49:53,230
uptake it actually is called phosphorous

1226
00:49:50,739 --> 00:49:55,929
starvation tolerance and again they had

1227
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:57,880
come back to the understanding that it

1228
00:49:55,929 --> 00:50:00,339
was a root phenotype that determined

1229
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:03,340
phosphorous uptaken scavenging ability

1230
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:06,700
so back to my theme about roots and the

1231
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:08,380
next slide shows what the discovery that

1232
00:50:06,699 --> 00:50:10,000
was being made by the groups who had

1233
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:13,000
been doing this for 15 years in the

1234
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,960
field entailed and it entailed a cross

1235
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:19,210
between IR 64 and a traditional upland

1236
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,690
variety from the film the Philippines

1237
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:22,630
called

1238
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:24,820
Kenan Don Fatone and Kenan Dom Patong

1239
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:27,730
had very deep roots because was an

1240
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:30,400
upland variety in IR 64 which is the

1241
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:32,769
quintessential indica out of Erie it is

1242
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,720
planted on more acreage even today than

1243
00:50:32,769 --> 00:50:36,759
any other rice variety in the world and

1244
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:38,169
it has very shallow roots because it's

1245
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,720
grown in the irrigated system and it

1246
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:43,329
doesn't need deeply and he crossed those

1247
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:45,069
two and then he back crossed and intra

1248
00:50:43,329 --> 00:50:47,529
breast the region with the largest

1249
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:49,950
effect QTL for deep roots in

1250
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:53,019
the IR 64 background and he created an

1251
00:50:49,949 --> 00:50:55,539
near isogenic line of IR six before

1252
00:50:53,019 --> 00:50:59,259
carrying one region on chromosome nine

1253
00:50:55,539 --> 00:51:03,730
that carried the deep-rooted QTL from

1254
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:06,130
Keenan danke Thome and the trait donor

1255
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:08,170
was of course one of those early land

1256
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:09,910
races that we had selected for one of

1257
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:12,670
those by parental crosses made back in

1258
00:51:09,909 --> 00:51:15,369
the early 90s and that was publicly

1259
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:18,220
available and what did he discover when

1260
00:51:15,369 --> 00:51:21,039
he cloned that gene he found that this

1261
00:51:18,219 --> 00:51:23,259
gene which he calls draw one and many of

1262
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:26,309
you are familiar with this work that a

1263
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:30,070
single base pair deletion in Exxon four

1264
00:51:26,309 --> 00:51:32,559
changed the route angle and that change

1265
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:34,750
in route angle so this is the deep

1266
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:39,219
rooted and this is the shallow rooted

1267
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:41,980
and that change in route angle had no

1268
00:51:39,219 --> 00:51:44,829
effect in yield under irrigated

1269
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:48,039
conditions but went under moderate

1270
00:51:44,829 --> 00:51:50,349
drought the IR 64 could no longer keep

1271
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:51,969
up with yield and the ni L that had that

1272
00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:54,460
one introgression on chromosome nine

1273
00:51:51,969 --> 00:51:56,739
associated with a cutie L was doing

1274
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:59,949
quite well and under extreme drought

1275
00:51:56,739 --> 00:52:01,629
where I are 64 died the ni L was still

1276
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:04,659
able to survive and produce offspring

1277
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:06,190
and so what is really remarkable is he

1278
00:52:04,659 --> 00:52:09,750
showed that that one base pair deletion

1279
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:12,220
in exon for that changed the route angle

1280
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:14,530
enhanced brain yield under drought and

1281
00:52:12,219 --> 00:52:17,169
he could show it because he developed

1282
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:19,990
the NI ELLs these are pairs of lies that

1283
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:22,300
can go out and be planted in the field

1284
00:52:19,989 --> 00:52:23,889
under the same conditions now for those

1285
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:27,789
of you who are wondering what this gene

1286
00:52:23,889 --> 00:52:31,449
does it's an unknown protein it says no

1287
00:52:27,789 --> 00:52:33,909
it has no and no correspondence to

1288
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:35,649
anything with known function but we do

1289
00:52:33,909 --> 00:52:38,649
know that it's negatively regulated by

1290
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:41,200
oxen it shows a higher expression of the

1291
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:43,780
drawn protein causes the downward root

1292
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:46,839
growth so it is quantitative and there

1293
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:48,519
are variants across the in the germ

1294
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:50,950
plasm array that have more or less

1295
00:52:48,519 --> 00:52:52,989
production of the draw one protein it's

1296
00:52:50,949 --> 00:52:55,029
involved in cell elongation at the root

1297
00:52:52,989 --> 00:52:56,769
tip and it localizes to the plasma

1298
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:58,570
membrane and I'm going to move quickly

1299
00:52:56,769 --> 00:53:01,360
because I have a feeling I'm running out

1300
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:04,630
of time I want to go on and say and I

1301
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:06,760
hope pen on you is on at in Geneva

1302
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:10,240
because I'm going to feature some of the

1303
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:12,220
work that canal Jew did in he did it

1304
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:14,109
originally at UC Davis but this is an

1305
00:53:12,219 --> 00:53:16,359
important story and I really want to

1306
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:18,579
tell it it has to do with the sub-1

1307
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,890
aging which confers submergence

1308
00:53:18,579 --> 00:53:23,319
tolerance so the one I just talked about

1309
00:53:20,889 --> 00:53:24,940
was draw one which is related to the

1310
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:26,769
downward growth of roots which confers

1311
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:29,230
drought tolerance and this is a

1312
00:53:26,769 --> 00:53:31,750
different phenotype entirely it has

1313
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:34,030
nothing to do with roots but it this is

1314
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:35,949
a phenotype now that is of the great

1315
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:37,269
importance in the same rain-fed systems

1316
00:53:35,949 --> 00:53:39,699
where the drought is important and this

1317
00:53:37,269 --> 00:53:41,789
is for submergence tolerance and in this

1318
00:53:39,699 --> 00:53:44,199
case the submergence tolerance is

1319
00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:46,500
conferred by what they call the sub one

1320
00:53:44,199 --> 00:53:50,109
aging and it's not a single base pair

1321
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:52,989
change in a gene of unknown function

1322
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:56,079
it's a complete addition of a new member

1323
00:53:52,989 --> 00:53:59,259
of an ethylene response factor gene

1324
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:01,509
family and so in this case canal showed

1325
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:05,440
in his work when he actually cloned this

1326
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:07,480
gene that the sub1a was the new member

1327
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,630
the B and C are shared with the

1328
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:12,909
reference genome but a the a gene was

1329
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:14,680
not present at all in the reference

1330
00:54:12,909 --> 00:54:18,339
genome which is why it was a challenge

1331
00:54:14,679 --> 00:54:20,829
to clone in 2006 and this particular

1332
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:23,590
donor was called fr 13 a it's a now

1333
00:54:20,829 --> 00:54:26,319
schland race it carries this incredible

1334
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:28,059
opportunity to survive under submergence

1335
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:31,000
and it basically holds its breath

1336
00:54:28,059 --> 00:54:34,289
so it's an ethylene response factor gene

1337
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,429
and I want to tell this bit of the story

1338
00:54:34,289 --> 00:54:38,199
because if you look at the citation

1339
00:54:36,429 --> 00:54:39,219
that's up there some of you may

1340
00:54:38,199 --> 00:54:42,789
recognize the name

1341
00:54:39,219 --> 00:54:45,599
Kaufman William Ronnie Kaufman

1342
00:54:42,789 --> 00:54:48,670
so Ronnie Kaufman was a breeder before

1343
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:51,699
myself and before Dave McGill he was a

1344
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:55,720
Tyria in the 1970s and one of the papers

1345
00:54:51,699 --> 00:54:58,419
that he produced in 1981 was called

1346
00:54:55,719 --> 00:55:02,259
inheritance of submergence tolerance in

1347
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:04,889
rice and the take home of that paper was

1348
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:07,060
that there was a single major gene

1349
00:55:04,889 --> 00:55:08,710
associated with submergence tolerance

1350
00:55:07,059 --> 00:55:12,130
and that it would be important in the

1351
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:15,309
range fed lowland areas throughout South

1352
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:18,579
Asia where flash floods were a problem

1353
00:55:15,309 --> 00:55:21,519
that was followed by a paper by Dave

1354
00:55:18,579 --> 00:55:22,839
mcil who came in as Ronnie's replacement

1355
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:25,508
for the rain for lowland breeding

1356
00:55:22,838 --> 00:55:27,518
program at Erie and he published a paper

1357
00:55:25,509 --> 00:55:29,259
where he had actually improved

1358
00:55:27,518 --> 00:55:31,088
semi-dwarf varieties which were high

1359
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:33,969
yielding varieties by introducing this

1360
00:55:31,088 --> 00:55:36,518
gene and for those varieties and dave

1361
00:55:33,969 --> 00:55:40,838
mcgill when ronnie came back to Erie

1362
00:55:36,518 --> 00:55:42,399
came back to Cornell David Hill took his

1363
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:44,889
place at Erie and was still there when I

1364
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,259
went there and dave mcgill was trying to

1365
00:55:44,889 --> 00:55:48,788
breed based on phenotype and he had to

1366
00:55:47,259 --> 00:55:51,188
flood these things and see which one

1367
00:55:48,789 --> 00:55:53,769
survived and it took quite a long time

1368
00:55:51,188 --> 00:55:55,958
and so when I got there Dave McGill came

1369
00:55:53,768 --> 00:55:57,278
to me and said I know exactly what I

1370
00:55:55,958 --> 00:56:00,129
want to do I want to make this

1371
00:55:57,278 --> 00:56:02,949
population with this donor because it

1372
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:05,108
survives under its emergence and I want

1373
00:56:02,949 --> 00:56:07,028
to do a QTL analysis with your markers

1374
00:56:05,108 --> 00:56:09,458
and I want you to give me markers so me

1375
00:56:07,028 --> 00:56:11,228
I as a breeder can start moving it into

1376
00:56:09,458 --> 00:56:15,038
the backgrounds that I really want and

1377
00:56:11,228 --> 00:56:18,568
so that project which again started in

1378
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:21,219
the early 90s took the form of

1379
00:56:18,568 --> 00:56:24,278
eventually a cloning project back at the

1380
00:56:21,219 --> 00:56:26,438
University of California and canang Zhu

1381
00:56:24,278 --> 00:56:29,199
who is today an apple breeder up in

1382
00:56:26,438 --> 00:56:30,998
Geneva did this incredible work where he

1383
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:33,459
had to clone a gene that didn't exist in

1384
00:56:30,998 --> 00:56:36,068
the reference genome and it took quite

1385
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:37,568
it was quite challenging for him but

1386
00:56:36,068 --> 00:56:40,318
once they'd cloned it they were able to

1387
00:56:37,568 --> 00:56:42,969
move this gene quite readily into other

1388
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:45,278
backgrounds but let me just say before

1389
00:56:42,969 --> 00:56:47,469
they'd cloned the genes they knew where

1390
00:56:45,278 --> 00:56:50,018
it was based on the early work and they

1391
00:56:47,469 --> 00:56:51,489
had markers and those markers went to

1392
00:56:50,018 --> 00:56:53,798
the genome mapping lab that I had

1393
00:56:51,489 --> 00:56:55,900
initiated at Erie and people started

1394
00:56:53,798 --> 00:56:57,989
putting it into the major varieties that

1395
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:01,479
were planted in the flooded zones across

1396
00:56:57,989 --> 00:57:04,298
South and Southeast Asia and so they had

1397
00:57:01,478 --> 00:57:06,368
a line in the Schwerner background which

1398
00:57:04,298 --> 00:57:08,498
is one of the most commonly planted

1399
00:57:06,369 --> 00:57:10,959
farmer preferred varieties throughout

1400
00:57:08,498 --> 00:57:13,328
this rain-fed lowland area in India and

1401
00:57:10,958 --> 00:57:15,458
Bangladesh they had put the sub 1 gene

1402
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:18,039
into through back crossing had put it

1403
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:20,558
into SH warna and those varieties were

1404
00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:22,390
already in the early testing phases and

1405
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:24,849
what I'm showing you here is what

1406
00:57:22,389 --> 00:57:27,489
happens under a drought or sorry under

1407
00:57:24,849 --> 00:57:29,100
submergence of 10 days though 30 days

1408
00:57:27,489 --> 00:57:31,170
after planning the crop is

1409
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:33,119
beautiful and then a flash flood comes

1410
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:35,400
and sits on top of the rice for ten days

1411
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:37,259
and it pretty much wipes out the shore

1412
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:39,750
now it doesn't have the sub one in it

1413
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:42,060
the sub one has come from a now schland

1414
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:45,469
race called fr 13a and when you have

1415
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:48,269
that introgression in your line your

1416
00:57:45,469 --> 00:57:50,369
material holds its breath until the

1417
00:57:48,269 --> 00:57:52,980
water subsides it can do that for about

1418
00:57:50,369 --> 00:57:55,799
14 days and then when the water subsides

1419
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:57,000
it can regrow and this saves people from

1420
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:59,100
what they're doing here is they're

1421
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,039
trying to go back in and replant that

1422
00:57:59,099 --> 00:58:04,019
field in order to salvage their crop for

1423
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:07,259
that season where here they don't have

1424
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:11,820
to replant so that is the value of this

1425
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:14,370
gene and it took a lot of foresight

1426
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:17,010
because the first crosses were made in

1427
00:58:14,369 --> 00:58:21,089
the early 90s and the gene was cloned in

1428
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:22,920
2006 and then the back the back crossing

1429
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:26,370
had already begun at Erie once they had

1430
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:28,110
markers from the earlier by parental QTL

1431
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:30,509
mapping and what you should what we're

1432
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:32,160
showing here is the number of different

1433
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:35,160
backgrounds that they use or

1434
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:38,039
introgression of that gene as dave mcil

1435
00:58:35,159 --> 00:58:40,409
with great foresight thought if we're

1436
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:42,300
successful this gene needs to be put

1437
00:58:40,409 --> 00:58:43,859
into different backgrounds for different

1438
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:45,660
countries where different farmers have

1439
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:47,460
different brain quality preferences and

1440
00:58:45,659 --> 00:58:49,799
if we get it into the varieties that

1441
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:51,809
they already like then it'll be an easy

1442
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:53,160
swap for them we're not asking them to

1443
00:58:51,809 --> 00:58:55,829
do anything different than they've

1444
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:57,539
always already done will make near

1445
00:58:55,829 --> 00:59:00,360
isogenic lines and they'll see for

1446
00:58:57,539 --> 00:59:02,699
themselves whether this is better and so

1447
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:04,680
this started at Erie and this was set

1448
00:59:02,699 --> 00:59:07,439
these works F he also was a student out

1449
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:09,569
of my lab who then was at Erie doing

1450
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,280
this work and they moved it through back

1451
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:13,289
crossing into a variety of different

1452
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,570
backgrounds and what you see in this

1453
00:59:13,289 --> 00:59:18,599
graph is that the sub one varieties

1454
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:21,210
always outperform the non sub one

1455
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:23,219
varieties and under increasing days of

1456
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:27,539
submergence although they all decline a

1457
00:59:23,219 --> 00:59:29,609
bit the submergence quality quality the

1458
00:59:27,539 --> 00:59:32,820
sub one varieties always do better and

1459
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:34,920
so within five years the first release

1460
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:38,730
is the actual first variety releases

1461
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:41,400
were in 2009 within five years ten

1462
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:42,809
million farmers and ten million hectares

1463
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:45,900
of rain fed

1464
00:59:42,809 --> 00:59:48,329
a flash flood prone rain-fed little and

1465
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:50,338
land who are covered with sub one

1466
00:59:48,329 --> 00:59:53,249
varieties so the backgrounds are

1467
00:59:50,338 --> 00:59:55,469
different this one gene is the same and

1468
00:59:53,248 --> 00:59:57,328
there were four hundred and fifty

1469
00:59:55,469 --> 00:59:58,979
different government NGO farmer

1470
00:59:57,329 --> 01:00:00,989
organization and seed companies that

1471
00:59:58,978 --> 01:00:03,149
were involved in getting this material

1472
01:00:00,989 --> 01:00:05,999
out from Arian from that breeding

1473
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:08,039
program out to farmers and that is one

1474
01:00:05,998 --> 01:00:10,858
of the record up takes and I think the

1475
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:14,278
fact that they chose to do this by not

1476
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:16,679
about redefining the variety just

1477
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:19,139
redefining one trait helped with that

1478
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:21,028
uptake and I just want to say that they

1479
01:00:19,139 --> 01:00:23,578
had a whole strategy for doing this and

1480
01:00:21,028 --> 01:00:26,188
being part of a strategy any of you who

1481
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:28,528
do work that even if you start by

1482
01:00:26,188 --> 01:00:30,928
cloning a gene if you can plug into one

1483
01:00:28,528 --> 01:00:33,599
of these networks your work may take off

1484
01:00:30,929 --> 01:00:34,858
and really have an impact and it's very

1485
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:37,109
important that you understand the

1486
01:00:34,858 --> 01:00:39,630
strategy behind the work that you do

1487
01:00:37,108 --> 01:00:41,728
because these strategies are not simple

1488
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:43,979
they involve many many many people

1489
01:00:41,728 --> 01:00:46,708
public sector private sector government

1490
01:00:43,978 --> 01:00:49,108
NGO as we were saying and in this case

1491
01:00:46,708 --> 01:00:50,879
here are a few pointers the sub one gene

1492
01:00:49,108 --> 01:00:53,009
was interest in the farmer preferred

1493
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,219
varieties as I've said each one

1494
01:00:53,009 --> 01:00:57,809
different for a different target site

1495
01:00:55,219 --> 01:01:00,208
the flood prone areas themselves that

1496
01:00:57,809 --> 01:01:02,429
were being targeted were identified

1497
01:01:00,208 --> 01:01:04,918
using remote sensing GIS and ground

1498
01:01:02,429 --> 01:01:06,568
intelligence in other words there are a

1499
01:01:04,918 --> 01:01:09,509
whole slew of people in the government

1500
01:01:06,568 --> 01:01:12,498
already using digital technologies to

1501
01:01:09,509 --> 01:01:14,759
figure out where the most likely

1502
01:01:12,498 --> 01:01:17,698
occurrence of certain stresses is

1503
01:01:14,759 --> 01:01:19,769
especially with climate change at-risk

1504
01:01:17,699 --> 01:01:22,139
villages then we're targeted for a

1505
01:01:19,768 --> 01:01:24,958
variety that we call participatory

1506
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:27,268
varieties selection or PDS and this was

1507
01:01:24,958 --> 01:01:29,969
all prior to release so it was part of

1508
01:01:27,268 --> 01:01:32,129
the selection process and they used male

1509
01:01:29,969 --> 01:01:34,889
and female farmer input to make sure

1510
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:37,169
that women were on the side of preparing

1511
01:01:34,889 --> 01:01:39,058
this on the culinary side or who were

1512
01:01:37,168 --> 01:01:41,308
involved with the transplanting were

1513
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:43,259
involved in a decision-making they also

1514
01:01:41,309 --> 01:01:44,459
included local checks so everybody could

1515
01:01:43,259 --> 01:01:46,168
see for themselves whether these

1516
01:01:44,458 --> 01:01:49,489
varieties were something they wanted or

1517
01:01:46,168 --> 01:01:53,668
not and instead of trying to plant one

1518
01:01:49,489 --> 01:01:55,849
target area with a large expanse they

1519
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:58,699
chose to distribute many kids

1520
01:01:55,849 --> 01:02:00,680
about five kgs of seed per village they

1521
01:01:58,699 --> 01:02:02,649
were provided to thousands of targeted

1522
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:05,210
villages to allow for farmer-to-farmer

1523
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:07,460
dissemination of seed the seed is all

1524
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:09,079
inbred farmers save their own seed and

1525
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:11,449
when it's good it moves very quickly

1526
01:02:09,079 --> 01:02:13,430
from farmer to farmer so they didn't

1527
01:02:11,449 --> 01:02:16,009
require seed companies in the in the

1528
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:18,618
beginning and the coordination that was

1529
01:02:16,009 --> 01:02:20,179
required was quite considerable and this

1530
01:02:18,619 --> 01:02:22,460
was all coordinated under what they

1531
01:02:20,179 --> 01:02:24,228
called the stress of project thanks to

1532
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:25,519
the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

1533
01:02:24,228 --> 01:02:27,618
and the Bill and Melinda Gates

1534
01:02:25,518 --> 01:02:28,998
Foundation is very big right now in

1535
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:31,309
trying to provide the kind of

1536
01:02:28,998 --> 01:02:33,558
coordination that is needed between the

1537
01:02:31,309 --> 01:02:36,829
scientists the breeders the government

1538
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:39,170
and agencies and the technology exchange

1539
01:02:36,829 --> 01:02:41,809
that is that is required to really make

1540
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:43,430
this kind of thing work so I'm coming

1541
01:02:41,809 --> 01:02:47,298
down to the end of my talk and I just

1542
01:02:43,429 --> 01:02:49,068
want to say there's a lot of you know a

1543
01:02:47,298 --> 01:02:49,849
lot of beautiful stories about the one

1544
01:02:49,068 --> 01:02:52,068
gene at a time

1545
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:55,460
that make a big difference in sub-1 and

1546
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:58,099
the semi dwarf before it and the pistol

1547
01:02:55,460 --> 01:03:00,469
which is the phosphorus starvation

1548
01:02:58,099 --> 01:03:02,509
tolerance gene and others I could tell

1549
01:03:00,469 --> 01:03:06,050
many of these stories but really the

1550
01:03:02,509 --> 01:03:09,019
question is is one gene at a time enough

1551
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:10,390
we have to think about what's happening

1552
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:13,849
around us and the climate is changing

1553
01:03:10,389 --> 01:03:16,879
faster and people are fleeing the

1554
01:03:13,849 --> 01:03:19,130
countryside in droves partly due to

1555
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:21,920
climate change and the civil unrest and

1556
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:23,660
the disasters that follow particularly

1557
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:26,539
as I go back to the think about the

1558
01:03:23,659 --> 01:03:29,059
beginning of the talk because the export

1559
01:03:26,539 --> 01:03:30,650
market for ice is so inelastic that when

1560
01:03:29,059 --> 01:03:31,279
there's a crop failure due to climate

1561
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:32,900
change

1562
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,269
there isn't enough in the international

1563
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:38,090
market to make the rice available that

1564
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:40,190
people need so there's a massive kind of

1565
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:43,640
feeling of unrest and an accelerated

1566
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:46,519
desire to move breeding forward so I

1567
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:48,980
just I know I've gone a little bit over

1568
01:03:46,519 --> 01:03:51,710
time and I apologize I just want to take

1569
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:54,559
you down this road so we have the rise

1570
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:57,559
of the Walmart model we're all affected

1571
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:59,068
by it and breeding is affected by it as

1572
01:03:57,559 --> 01:04:00,958
well you

1573
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:02,958
infinite amounts of data on every aspect

1574
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:06,868
of your subject matter

1575
01:04:02,958 --> 01:04:09,899
maybe it's toothpaste right Walmart it's

1576
01:04:06,869 --> 01:04:12,660
not all about breeding and and other

1577
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:14,160
people that that need our products you

1578
01:04:12,659 --> 01:04:16,409
use machine learning algorithms to

1579
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:19,259
define patterns and generate hypotheses

1580
01:04:16,409 --> 01:04:20,969
in other words learn from the data you

1581
01:04:19,259 --> 01:04:23,519
validate your models you redefine your

1582
01:04:20,969 --> 01:04:25,708
hypotheses by testing on new populations

1583
01:04:23,518 --> 01:04:27,568
and new environments you know the way

1584
01:04:25,708 --> 01:04:29,219
that Walmart moves is they figure out

1585
01:04:27,568 --> 01:04:30,958
what works in one population they look

1586
01:04:29,219 --> 01:04:33,449
for the population that's most like it

1587
01:04:30,958 --> 01:04:34,978
and they take that exact retail model

1588
01:04:33,449 --> 01:04:37,858
and they start applying it somewhere

1589
01:04:34,978 --> 01:04:39,568
else and it works really well you use

1590
01:04:37,858 --> 01:04:41,219
validated models that to predict

1591
01:04:39,568 --> 01:04:43,558
behavior or performance of future

1592
01:04:41,219 --> 01:04:45,389
populations and environments and you

1593
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:47,278
beat the competition using data and

1594
01:04:45,389 --> 01:04:49,889
intelligence to speed up the delivery of

1595
01:04:47,278 --> 01:04:53,639
project of products that people want and

1596
01:04:49,889 --> 01:04:56,400
sometimes that they need this model is

1597
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:58,259
the model right now the big data model

1598
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:01,588
that most of us are working under and

1599
01:04:58,259 --> 01:05:03,059
it's a challenge we have our parallel

1600
01:05:01,588 --> 01:05:06,208
inbreeding in genetics where you collect

1601
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:08,579
lots of data on phenotype on environment

1602
01:05:06,208 --> 01:05:10,528
on genotype you develop models as

1603
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:12,209
quickly as you can that integrate all of

1604
01:05:10,528 --> 01:05:14,099
those and help you predict the

1605
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:16,078
performance of your lines you

1606
01:05:14,099 --> 01:05:18,390
continuously update your models you

1607
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:20,160
iteratively improve them you use

1608
01:05:18,389 --> 01:05:23,219
predicted breeding values to increase

1609
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:25,440
selection intensity increase accuracy

1610
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:27,119
and decrease cycle time and then you

1611
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:29,458
modify your breeding design to take

1612
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:31,440
advantage of new efficiencies that's the

1613
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:33,598
name of the game it's the Walmart model

1614
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:36,119
inbreeding and we're all being asked to

1615
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:38,489
try to accelerate for reasons that we

1616
01:05:36,119 --> 01:05:41,849
all understand but it's taking us down

1617
01:05:38,489 --> 01:05:44,999
this road of more constantly more faster

1618
01:05:41,849 --> 01:05:46,829
and hopefully better but it's creating

1619
01:05:44,998 --> 01:05:48,448
this two world phenomenon the thing I

1620
01:05:46,829 --> 01:05:50,099
call or my colleagues over an

1621
01:05:48,449 --> 01:05:52,920
engineering call the digital twin

1622
01:05:50,099 --> 01:05:54,989
phenomenon you have breeding pipelines

1623
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:57,180
which are basically a collage of genetic

1624
01:05:54,989 --> 01:05:59,208
resources reading populations and

1625
01:05:57,179 --> 01:06:02,159
improved lines that are crossed

1626
01:05:59,208 --> 01:06:05,068
evaluated selected and recombined in a

1627
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:07,528
recurrent cycle in biological time under

1628
01:06:05,068 --> 01:06:09,958
field conditions that material is

1629
01:06:07,528 --> 01:06:12,989
physical knowledge about that material

1630
01:06:09,958 --> 01:06:15,599
is dynamic and evolutionary

1631
01:06:12,989 --> 01:06:17,849
and side by side you have a genomics

1632
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:20,039
pipeline which is a collage of

1633
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:23,789
algorithms and analytical procedures

1634
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:26,039
that process reprocess intersect and

1635
01:06:23,789 --> 01:06:28,860
integrate data in parallel computing

1636
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:31,050
streams generating a series of models

1637
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:34,230
and predictions about future performance

1638
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:36,119
to guide selection the information is

1639
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:38,849
representational and it resides in

1640
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:41,760
cyberspace and hopefully it reflects the

1641
01:06:38,849 --> 01:06:43,799
reality the physical reality of the food

1642
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:46,020
that we need to produce in order to

1643
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:49,080
maintain livelihoods and to maintain

1644
01:06:46,019 --> 01:06:50,880
adequate human health but the challenge

1645
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:52,739
for our generation or for actually I

1646
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:55,110
would say the younger generation is

1647
01:06:52,739 --> 01:06:57,079
really the challenge of how you're going

1648
01:06:55,110 --> 01:07:00,180
to integrate automation and Big Data

1649
01:06:57,079 --> 01:07:03,059
into a conception of the world that is

1650
01:07:00,179 --> 01:07:04,769
still maintains touch with reality we

1651
01:07:03,059 --> 01:07:06,539
have digital tools data streams

1652
01:07:04,769 --> 01:07:08,639
simulation and prediction and it's

1653
01:07:06,539 --> 01:07:10,440
completely revolutionized the way we see

1654
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:12,900
the world and our ability to make

1655
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:15,840
predictions about the future world it's

1656
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:17,970
imposing disruptive change and I

1657
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:20,430
question as I come to the close of this

1658
01:07:17,969 --> 01:07:23,129
is can we integrate the best of both

1659
01:07:20,429 --> 01:07:26,250
worlds can we continue to discover

1660
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:28,440
diverse alleles and mechanisms that you

1661
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:32,039
confer resilience and nutrient use

1662
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:34,289
efficiency and also to use genomic

1663
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:36,090
selection or genomic prediction to

1664
01:07:34,289 --> 01:07:38,340
efficiently combine them with all the

1665
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:40,890
alleles that we have for yield and

1666
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:45,210
quality in our elite breeding material

1667
01:07:40,889 --> 01:07:46,789
and I want to just end by this these few

1668
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:49,440
thoughts I have at the end of this

1669
01:07:46,789 --> 01:07:52,079
presentation which is that beyond

1670
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:54,929
breeding and statistics rice is also a

1671
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:58,559
bridge to human history and deeply held

1672
01:07:54,929 --> 01:08:00,539
cultural values and perspectives it is a

1673
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:03,269
source of beauty it's an essential

1674
01:08:00,539 --> 01:08:05,849
natural resource it's a product that

1675
01:08:03,269 --> 01:08:08,909
provides livelihoods promotes health and

1676
01:08:05,849 --> 01:08:12,358
well-being and it's the foundation for

1677
01:08:08,909 --> 01:08:16,409
partnership education and innovation and

1678
01:08:12,358 --> 01:08:18,298
for me a source of inspiration so with

1679
01:08:16,409 --> 01:08:19,739
that I thank you all for listening and I

1680
01:08:18,298 --> 01:08:22,259
thank the group that I've worked with

1681
01:08:19,739 --> 01:08:25,130
and my funding sources over many years

1682
01:08:22,259 --> 01:08:25,130
thank you
