1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,359
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,359
University hello my name is keny

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:11,599
Rodriguez I am a PhD student at Cornell

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:13,599
and I'm with hi I'm Chris smart I am a

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,160
professor of vegetable pathology at

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,879
Cornell and today our video is about

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,759
diseases of korbit and today we will

8
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,399
talk about korbit jelline disease so

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,760
Kenzie what do we have here what's this

10
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:28,358
plant so this is a squash plant and we

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,640
have here um some of the one of the

12
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:33,440
diseases that we just found um couple of

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,120
years ago here at New York we can see

14
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:39,839
here some of the scorching margins and

15
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:42,679
um there's also some jello on the leaves

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,559
if you can check it out here so this

17
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:47,238
disease is called Curby Jell-O bind

18
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:49,479
disease and this bacteria is transmitted

19
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:51,878
by the squash BG so previously the

20
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:54,679
squash BG is known as a pet was known as

21
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:56,320
a pest but it was not known to transmit

22
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:59,039
any disase creas so I think it's

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,359
important to know this because now the

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,160
squash book it's a it's a threat to

25
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,079
transmit this disease and we can see

26
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:06,798
here in the plant we can see some of the

27
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:11,920
name of the squash book so the squash

28
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:14,118
book life cycle um it has some uh NES

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,040
and then it can become as sadle so we

30
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:19,400
can also see here some eggs and these

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,320
eggs will hatch and will become uh like

32
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,040
these n and you can see here are like

33
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:25,039
two stages of the NES these are the

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,799
smaller ones that are the ones that

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,640
hatch and look like this and then they

36
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,399
will become bigger and they will get

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,280
this um like grayish color later on they

38
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:36,920
will uh grow and they will will

39
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,759
becomeing adult and so not all the

40
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,240
squash books can have the can bring the

41
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,040
disease cuz like they have it in their

42
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:47,560
guts but if one squash bug um have the

43
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,880
disease or have the bacteria in it and

44
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,159
will feed on the plant then the bacteria

45
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:53,839
probably will um get into the plant and

46
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,439
will the plant will get diseased

47
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,159
eventually so does a squash bug have to

48
00:01:56,438 --> 00:02:02,158
feed on every leaf and is that how the

49
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,640
plant dies or or does the bacteria move

50
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,320
in the plant how does that work so

51
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,920
actually the squash book have to the

52
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,840
squash book fit in every part of the

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,318
plant but for the bacteria to be

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,239
transmitted it has to Fed in the flowing

55
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,679
of the plant and it doesn't have to feel

56
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,920
fit in every leaf as long as they they

57
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,080
can feed out the um in the stem and uh

58
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,958
mainly the disease will um start the

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,560
crown because the bacteria just like can

60
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,959
feed can be in the Flo and this will clo

61
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,280
the flo of the plant and it will create

62
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,120
Yello that we see here so actually what

63
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,479
happens is that since the bacteria is

64
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:40,360
CLO um clo the flm it will get this

65
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:42,280
yellow wish because um the nutrients are

66
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,480
not getting into the plant as well as it

67
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,039
will be if the plant will be healthy oh

68
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,518
so it's like you're clogging the veins

69
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:51,878
of the plant yes yes wow what do we do

70
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,840
about this so the main thing is to

71
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:55,840
control the squash bug or manage the

72
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,959
squash book because once the bacteria is

73
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,280
in it's hard to control so one of the

74
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,840
main things is getting rid of the squash

75
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,719
book we can do it uh manually maybe

76
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,080
removing some eggs that we see in the

77
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,919
plant or we can also remove the um idles

78
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,799
that we see because the idle can

79
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:15,199
overwinter so it's important to scout a

80
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:17,080
field at the beginning of the season to

81
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,719
see if we can see some adles and take

82
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,879
them out of the field and be on the

83
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:23,759
lookout during the whole season for the

84
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:27,518
eggs for the nemes and also for the

85
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:30,318
adults huh so this plant looks to be uh

86
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,599
a pumpkin or winter squash plant um does

87
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:36,238
it go to to all the squashes does it go

88
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:39,878
to other cucurbits like melons or or

89
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:44,120
cucumbers it does so this uh disease can

90
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:47,158
be seen in zucchini in watermelon in

91
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:50,640
squash winter squash pumpkin but we have

92
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:52,598
seen if we plant different um species or

93
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:56,759
varieties of these ones we will see that

94
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:59,119
they mostly like um so the squash book

95
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:04,199
preference is mostly seen in Winter

96
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,680
squat in um zucchinis in acorn squash so

97
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:09,679
we will probably see that this is more

98
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,439
present in this um varieties or these

99
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,360
cultivar but it also can go to

100
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,840
watermelon maybe if you just have like

101
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,040
watermelon or even cantaloup you will

102
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,639
see that this is there probably too ah

103
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:24,720
so it depends on which plant the squash

104
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,918
bug likes the best yes so it's mostly

105
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,880
dependent on what the squash book um

106
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:30,519
like the best cuz as as we said the

107
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,519
squash book is the want the transmit the

108
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:34,399
disease so the more squash book The the

109
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:36,079
higher the probability that you will see

110
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,599
that disease in that a specific plant

111
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:39,038
and once a squash book is start

112
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,840
reproducing you will see like thousands

113
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:42,918
and thousands of eggs and NES in only

114
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:44,319
one plant so that will highly increase

115
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:46,599
the chances for you to get in the

116
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:49,240
disease wow that's really interesting so

117
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,639
so how does this disease get into the

118
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,960
plant every year like does it does it

119
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:55,519
live in the soil or or does it come in

120
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:58,359
on on the seeds that we plant how does

121
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:00,319
that work so we mostly know that the

122
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,000
squash bug is the one that that uh can

123
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,038
keep that disease in their God so the

124
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,079
squash B will overwinter with the

125
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:07,959
disease in their God and then with the

126
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:11,399
bacteria in their God sorry and then

127
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:13,638
whenever the new season start and the um

128
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,159
adults start coming in the plant they

129
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,879
will be the one that will feed and will

130
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,600
transmit that disease and we will also

131
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:22,959
see that if we leave some leftovers of

132
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,600
the plant that we are harvesting whether

133
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:28,839
it's uh pumpkin that might be an

134
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,479
overwinter side too for the squash book

135
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:33,799
in the bacteria

136
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:36,719
oh wow so it's really important to to

137
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,680
try to clean your garden or your field

138
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,160
at the end of the season yes it's really

139
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,639
important that you get rid of all the um

140
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,880
let's say all the things that you're not

141
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,879
going to need so you already Harvest and

142
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,759
you have like the leftover plant is

143
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,120
important that we get rid of that so we

144
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,879
make sure that at least we keep the

145
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,600
population of squash boook low and

146
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,199
Kenzie I know you're doing your research

147
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,720
in this area um you know do do you think

148
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,038
that we you'll be able to help the

149
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,919
farmers in the state of New York reduce

150
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,079
the chance of their plants dying from

151
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:10,680
from this bacteria yes so that's the

152
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:13,240
idea I'm really excited for this because

153
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,319
I am trying to determine what is the

154
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,079
preference of the squash book and as of

155
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:20,560
now we are trying to have different

156
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,439
varieties and cultivar to see what is

157
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,399
the most preferred by the squash book

158
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:27,478
and then we will be working with um

159
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:29,918
doing some screenings to see if there

160
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:32,918
are varieties that are like uh

161
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:34,839
less likely to have a lot of squash BS

162
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:36,639
and we also want to determine where the

163
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:37,918
disase is in the state Chris because I

164
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,319
think that's that's very important we

165
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,879
don't know a lot about the disease here

166
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:43,560
in New York because we just reported uh

167
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:45,879
the disease this year but we are really

168
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,120
hopeful that we will be able also to

169
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:51,000
determine or detect the disease because

170
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,120
sometimes it's confused with other um

171
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
diseases or people think that they have

172
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,800
like uh nutrient deficiency in their

173
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,478
field but actually what they have is the

174
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,759
disease person but they just don't know

175
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,359
so I think diagnos ICS is one of the

176
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:04,520
first thing that we have to focus on in

177
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,038
the state right because the symptoms can

178
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:09,519
be really similar to other things yes

179
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,759
well good luck getting identifying

180
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,719
plants that are more resistant to this

181
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,000
devastating disease thank you so much so

182
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,160
if you want to check out more about

183
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,240
these disease um we will have more

184
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,160
information available in the Cornell uh

185
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,120
vegetable website thank you this has

186
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:29,520
been a production of Cornell University
