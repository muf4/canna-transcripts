1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,960
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,960
university

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,320
okay so we've been talking about the

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,320
physical aspects of soil

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,199
but there's a chemical aspect of soil

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,240
that we can test very easily

7
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,480
that is ph which is measures the acidity

8
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,799
or

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:26,160
alkalinity of any substance and in soils

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,320
ph determines very much what

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,518
nutrients are available to plants so

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,518
some plants

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,439
can tolerate a wide range of ph and some

14
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:34,879
have a very narrow range of ph where

15
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,280
they grow well in so we need to know

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,000
this in terms of plant selection

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,760
the ph test is very simple we use a

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,878
cornell ph

19
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,799
kit which is a color metric test

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,079
and we'll take we'll try two different

21
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,640
soils there's a

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,640
two parts of the kit one is the standard

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,480
and one is a wide range we always start

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,120
with the standard

25
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,959
so we have these cups where we're going

26
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,839
to put a little bit of soil in one of

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,840
the depressions

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,319
i'm not going to fill it up just a

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,840
little bit of soil

30
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,319
and then we're going to take one of the

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,200
reagents here

32
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,798
there are two we always start with

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,960
bromothymol blue

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,400
which is the neutral range we want to

35
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,679
start with the neutral range and then we

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,960
can go up

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,960
more alkaline or go down more acid

38
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:28,559
so using brown thymol blue we're going

39
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,559
to drop drop by drop

40
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,478
until we have a little bit of free

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,960
solution

42
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:44,719
we're going to mix this oh yes

43
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:48,959
for about 10 to 20 seconds

44
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,959
so that the reagent mixes with the soil

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,560
and then we're going to allow that

46
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,000
solution to go down the channel

47
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,519
in this case there's quite a bit of soil

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,519
there but i can still see a color

49
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:08,000
what we're looking for is the color in

50
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:10,560
the channel

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,360
so we use a color chart to determine

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,598
what

53
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:18,560
that ph is saying uh there's reading

54
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,519
and we in this chart it says brom final

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,199
blue on the top

56
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,840
so we're going to look at the color we

57
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,839
find

58
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:34,159
in the channel versus the color chart

59
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,159
i'd say somewhere between 6.0 and 6.2

60
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,000
based on the color of the chart maybe

61
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,000
6.0

62
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,400
okay so if we're at one end of the color

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,360
chart we want to go

64
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,760
further because we may not see exactly

65
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,879
what

66
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,759
the final ph would be so in this case

67
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,199
we'll use

68
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,318
another reagent in the kit which goes

69
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,280
from ph

70
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:02,318
5 to 6.2 it's at the lower end so we

71
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:07,120
take another bit of soil from our

72
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:11,199
sample put it in the other bowl

73
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:19,519
and using chlorophenol red

74
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:23,439
we're going to wet the sample

75
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,439
and mix it by tapping it

76
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,839
so that the solution bathes the soil in

77
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,839
the

78
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
cup

79
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,920
now we're going to allow that

80
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:47,439
bead to go down the channel

81
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,759
back and forth and we're going to use

82
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,759
the

83
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,439
color chart at the bottom which says

84
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:55,438
chlorophenyl red

85
00:03:51,439 --> 00:04:00,400
to see what our

86
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:03,280
color is you can see

87
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,280
we're at the six

88
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,840
to six point two range so in fact the

89
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,039
six point two which we

90
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,598
saw with brampton blue is correct

91
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,158
because we've uh corroborated that with

92
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,560
another

93
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:21,599
solution so here is six six point two

94
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,000
pretty close so i'd say it's about

95
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,759
six to six point two ph and that would

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,040
be the final

97
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,840
determination for this soil now when

98
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,919
we're changing soils and we're going to

99
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,839
do another soil or another sample we

100
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,680
always want to clean our plate with

101
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,959
deionized water so we're not going to

102
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,879
change

103
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:44,478
use the ph of the tap water to change

104
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,040
our

105
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:47,039
our reading

106
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,360
so i have another soil here which you

107
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,360
want to test

108
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,280
you can't tell anything about the soil

109
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,360
by looking at it in terms of what the ph

110
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:02,239
is and that determines

111
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,720
very importantly how much certain

112
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,918
elements are available to

113
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,440
plant roots so we're going to put a

114
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,519
little bit of

115
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,519
soil in the bowl start again with

116
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,079
bromothymol blue

117
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,319
which is the neutral range drop drop

118
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,319
drop

119
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:27,360
do we have a little bit of free

120
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,360
solution

121
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:34,639
mixing it with the soil and then getting

122
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,639
a bead down the channel

123
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,478
and here instead of that kind of

124
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,038
yellowish green we have almost a blue

125
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,079
green

126
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:47,279
color which would be

127
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:50,478
at the end of the bronzer blue chart

128
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,000
sort of 7.2 but again being that we're

129
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:56,318
at the end we need to go further

130
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,279
to see if that's the final range of ph

131
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,960
so here we take the wide range test kit

132
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,439
which has goes higher

133
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,799
with phenol red or much lower with brom

134
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,478
crease or green

135
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,199
we're going to go higher with phenol red

136
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:09,758
because we start stopped at 7.2 we want

137
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,720
to go

138
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,280
up in terms of the seeing what the real

139
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,080
ph

140
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:19,279
is so here we're going to put some more

141
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,279
soil in the second bowl

142
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,000
by the way you want to have your hands

143
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:27,038
clean when you do this

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,680
so you're not introducing anything into

145
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:29,680
the sample

146
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,679
so here we're going to take phenol red

147
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:37,439
which is the wide high range

148
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,439
to see what the soil actually is

149
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,840
and we're going to mix it sometimes you

150
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,839
see the color change when you're mixing

151
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,839
it

152
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,840
and then we're gonna get a bead down the

153
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,839
channel

154
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:03,598
and what we're looking for is the film

155
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:06,560
the color film

156
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,360
in this case we use the color chart for

157
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,680
phenol red

158
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,680
which is pretty bright

159
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,120
and here we're seeing we're not up at

160
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:20,560
seven we're

161
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,560
more toward i'd say

162
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:31,840
it's quite blue so we're probably at 8.4

163
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:31,839
or 8.6

164
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,598
so we have a much more alkaline soil

165
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,719
here than we did

166
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,000
in the first sample and that's going to

167
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,759
determine

168
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,360
which plants can grow well in some of

169
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,800
those types of soils

170
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,000
so we need to know that for plant
