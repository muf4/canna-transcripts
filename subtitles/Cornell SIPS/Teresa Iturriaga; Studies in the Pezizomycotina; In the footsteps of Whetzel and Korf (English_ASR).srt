1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,879
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:06,068
University

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:09,969
[Applause]

4
00:00:06,068 --> 00:00:11,929
well thank you Cathy there was a most

5
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:14,419
wonderful introduction

6
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:16,789
I feel kind of embarrassed I didn't I

7
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:23,810
think I have done those things that you

8
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:26,679
mentioned so I am asking as Kathy's

9
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:30,969
Kathy said I am an expert on taxonomy

10
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:36,469
insist I'm a system arrest and I work on

11
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:39,799
naming and describing and deciding the

12
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:42,619
names of organisms and also

13
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:44,929
understanding their phylogeny so that's

14
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:47,359
what I've been doing since the start of

15
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:50,000
my career with mr. Cerf and of course I

16
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:54,229
have moved and evolved in the field as

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,960
it has evolved itself I'm terribly

18
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:59,750
excited to be back at Cornell and I know

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,980
some of the faces here were my

20
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:06,109
professors or my colleagues then and

21
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:06,799
it's absolutely wonderful to be back at

22
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:08,390
the herbarium

23
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,420
where there's so much to do just

24
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,700
entering that herbarium is entering into

25
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:18,230
one of the most precious places in the

26
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:20,810
world because of other wonderful wealth

27
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:23,480
of fungi that are there not only from

28
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:29,299
the region but also in that disk of my

29
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:33,520
seeds so my my work has I work with

30
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:36,620
mainly with fungal diversity of tropical

31
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:38,959
fungi and I will not say only these

32
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,659
kamae seeds because some my students

33
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,459
back in Venezuela were interested in

34
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:48,320
other groups that were not discs my seed

35
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:49,789
so I had two broad and brought my

36
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,419
interest and work with other groups as

37
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:56,060
well I also work with ecology life

38
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,978
history and fungal communities I try to

39
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,109
understand the biology of this fungi

40
00:01:57,978 --> 00:02:01,849
what are they doing why are they in that

41
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:05,150
environment

42
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:10,579
and in for this talk I want to wrap up a

43
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:12,780
bit and and place myself where I come

44
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:17,130
from in my lineage

45
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:21,210
of Cornell mycologist because as I stand

46
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:24,750
as they say in the soldier of giants and

47
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:27,210
it's true I totally do and most of them

48
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,780
in my cases the in Cornell mycologists

49
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:33,209
and I will one of the goals of this talk

50
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,699
is also to excite you and to make you

51
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,259
very interested in this in Co P

52
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:40,199
herbarium and in that Cornell herbarium

53
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:42,389
so that we you will deposit your

54
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,839
specimens there and you'll understand

55
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:48,149
after this stop why is that so important

56
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,789
so just to start with fungal diversity

57
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:55,560
this is a slide you must all know very

58
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:57,659
well there's all this saying about how

59
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,489
many funds are they are there 1.5

60
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:02,750
failure are there five million fungi

61
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:05,580
every time somebody goes and samples

62
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:09,090
does environmental sampling all of a

63
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:14,760
sudden from one centimeter of soil there

64
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:17,009
comes 100,000 sequences so nobody really

65
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:21,449
knows but if there are that amount of

66
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:25,319
fungi which probably there are we know

67
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:28,649
very little about them we know less than

68
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:31,769
5% probably of what's out there and we

69
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,659
understand even with as time goes by we

70
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:35,760
understand less and less about these

71
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:39,419
organisms because now it's all about

72
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:42,899
sequencing and if people have forgotten

73
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:45,259
how to describe or how to even look at

74
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:50,969
their organisms in the field less

75
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:53,789
understand their biology so I try that's

76
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:57,299
what I do I I try to understand the

77
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:59,879
whole picture that colette i go out to

78
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:02,340
the field i collect this fungi these are

79
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:05,750
all cup fungi as you can see there's

80
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:11,159
some of them maybe you will recognize as

81
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:13,079
for example this is a beautiful entre

82
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,048
cobia which we will be talking about and

83
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:18,750
this is herpes Isis and this is Vice

84
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:21,389
perilla some of this fungi or percolate

85
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,108
and some are in a particulate and I work

86
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:24,108
on both groups

87
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:32,189
so the first group I'll mention is the

88
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,020
group of or percolate fungi that precise

89
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:38,550
on my seeds and this is a real picture

90
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:41,129
it's not fake can you imagine a frog

91
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,800
just I see there and the person being

92
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:45,959
there at the time where that happened I

93
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,629
always dreamed it would happen to me but

94
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:51,389
it didn't this is a this is a photo that

95
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:53,819
somebody sent to me from Borneo it's a

96
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:57,029
collaborator that's working with a group

97
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:59,159
of us in a beautiful genus that I

98
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:02,159
mentioned I will mention in a little

99
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:06,090
while that's called cooky aina the name

100
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,820
over here so this comes from Borneo as I

101
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:10,319
mentioned this will percolate this kamae

102
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:13,469
seeds have the characteristics that

103
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:17,430
they're asked us opens by a lid it just

104
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:21,780
pops up and pops open and they're in the

105
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:24,329
spores are dispersed in that way that

106
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:27,479
that lid can be on the top or can be a

107
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:31,979
little err on the side the best majority

108
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:33,780
of this fandom the vast diversity the

109
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,569
highest diversity is in temperate

110
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:38,699
regions but in the tropics particularly

111
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:41,370
and or in the project throughout the

112
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:44,670
world the genus cookie ina which is of

113
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:49,920
the group that has a lateral lid is very

114
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:52,379
very abundant so for years and still up

115
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:56,250
to date we have been studying the genus

116
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:59,430
cookie ina with a group of people and it

117
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:02,009
since 2002 we thought it was way before

118
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,840
2002 with other word only for species

119
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:06,480
which were all that have been described

120
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,639
so there was a very hairy one that we

121
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,500
called one name a little one I was less

122
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,259
hairy like this one the kooky ina

123
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,420
speciosa group which we noticed had a

124
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:16,800
lot of difference in colors but when we

125
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,710
went to the microscope it looked the

126
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,230
same so we called it cocaine speciosa

127
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:24,569
and then a third one which was a little

128
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,370
smaller and then another one which I'll

129
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:28,980
show you the pictures there were four

130
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,990
species in the world we almost didn't

131
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,450
care to look very much Adam or for other

132
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,550
microscopy because we thought they were

133
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:38,500
those four and that's it throughout the

134
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:41,829
world in 2006 we started

135
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:46,449
working with colleagues from the follow

136
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:48,219
herbarium at Harvard Don Feaster and we

137
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:50,050
started working with molecular on these

138
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,090
groups of fungi and I was in Venezuela

139
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,370
then looking at all these different

140
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:57,269
color variations on this copy ina

141
00:06:54,370 --> 00:07:01,060
speciosa and we started noticing things

142
00:06:57,269 --> 00:07:03,459
so we started understanding a bit more

143
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,370
and going back to the morphology so

144
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:08,829
since 2006 only three species have been

145
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:12,129
described and it's not because we are

146
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:14,229
sloppy it's just because we still do not

147
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:18,790
understand what's going on with that

148
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:21,129
group it's so it's so this is just a

149
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:26,379
kooky Ines physios a complex and I'll

150
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:28,449
sure it ranges from all all colors but

151
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:31,889
that's the only thing that we see colors

152
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:34,930
and geographical variation there's no

153
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:36,789
morphological and as we start the

154
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:39,250
morphology at under the microscope

155
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:41,850
there's nothing that at content that

156
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:48,610
tells us there's any differences but

157
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:51,340
when we have done sequences of these we

158
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:54,490
we can see that's the spacer that's up

159
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:57,269
here it has different clay and this

160
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,650
clades really relate with colors and

161
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:01,959
which I have not marked there but this

162
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:03,159
is for example it's a coral this ones

163
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:06,759
are the more yellow

164
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:09,490
yellowish this words are the the whitish

165
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:12,569
and the brown one so they there are some

166
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:16,030
differences so people at the beginning

167
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:19,029
when they started describing all those

168
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:21,909
names they had for each color and I'm

169
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:24,939
talking about even the 1700s and the

170
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:26,800
1800s they were right they they're all

171
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:30,819
these names which were gonna probably be

172
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,620
needed to go back to and rescue but we

173
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:35,049
have been going back to the cookie ina

174
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,759
looking them under the microscope and we

175
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:38,829
have been noticing a few good things

176
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:40,750
that we had not seen before we have been

177
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:43,450
noticing some difference in the hair

178
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,519
some difference instructors and some

179
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:48,370
differences also in the growth and who

180
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,189
knows how many other differences there

181
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,830
are in the in their physiology which we

182
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,790
have not

183
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:58,009
look at so trickle OMA is a very

184
00:08:55,789 --> 00:09:00,110
homogeneous played throughout the world

185
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:02,960
and this is the clade were called Cana

186
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:05,300
is it ISA is which doesn't mean much to

187
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:09,080
you at this point I just want to show

188
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:12,039
you this is an edible fungus it's it's

189
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:16,100
edible it's not a big fungus it's a

190
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:18,379
about 2 inches high and 1 inch in

191
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,590
diameter or smaller but it's the

192
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:24,350
abundance that it and it and because of

193
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:27,470
its colors when you're in the Amazon for

194
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:29,600
example in low tropical forests it

195
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:32,139
occurs so abundantly that you can even

196
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:37,460
pick them up like if there were seeds or

197
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:39,049
flowers so they are edible and in Mexico

198
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,150
if they're even sold in the in the

199
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:43,129
market I didn't believe this the first

200
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:43,819
time that's in an Indian community in

201
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:45,830
Venezuela

202
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:49,700
somebody told me and I said oh no you're

203
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:51,560
no you must be wrong and they didn't

204
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,320
tell me anything else so I totally was

205
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:57,019
in disbelief until I heard of course a

206
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,330
BSA word and they actually I tried them

207
00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:02,449
and they're pretty pretty they don't

208
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:06,470
taste like anything but they have but

209
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:09,320
they have protein so this is a beautiful

210
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:12,080
drawing by madame legal expert on the

211
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,570
disc of my seeds were the intricacy of

212
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,520
this para feces is shown and also the

213
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:20,650
striation of the spores which is an

214
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:23,149
important character this fungus is very

215
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:24,889
particular this is only this cookie Ines

216
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:27,740
fisty also complex so that you can see

217
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:29,840
the color variation again from white to

218
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:34,970
brown from all these incredible colors

219
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:36,710
so this this is pre Coloma you can see

220
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:40,220
that the longhairs

221
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:42,680
it's very easy to identify and the clade

222
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:46,389
is very homogeneous throughout the world

223
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:49,339
there's just a specimen from China which

224
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:52,580
has smooth course and it's very related

225
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:55,970
to it and the last clay that we have is

226
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:58,009
a cookie ina is it is a clade which it

227
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:01,639
comes together with the other species

228
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:03,600
that we know and this one occurs only in

229
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:05,939
Asia

230
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,560
there are some cautions when studying

231
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,690
this fungus if you ever go to the

232
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:12,268
tropics and there are several programs

233
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:14,370
where Cornell takes you dance to the

234
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:17,759
tropics so you'll be able if you're

235
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:19,318
there you'll be able to find one if

236
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,649
you're in the lowland tropics you will

237
00:11:19,318 --> 00:11:24,689
find cocaine a tree Coloma and and call

238
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:27,000
and speci uh the two that I've shown

239
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:30,360
mostly but there's a third one called

240
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,328
kooky I know Venezuela which can also

241
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:38,579
that occurs in Highlands in cloud

242
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:41,278
forests and that and I watch up so you

243
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:43,078
may be able to have some times in your

244
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:45,889
life to look at these fungus under the

245
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:50,039
microscope and I want to make sure that

246
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:52,740
you remember that color is important

247
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:56,669
that geographical region is important

248
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:59,789
and also that in this particular family

249
00:11:56,669 --> 00:12:01,769
there's a phenomenon which doesn't occur

250
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:04,349
in other groups which is that ASCO

251
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:07,709
sports matter but you're simultaneously

252
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:09,899
so in h epithelium in each fruit body

253
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:12,508
all the sports will be in the same state

254
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:13,860
of development all the acai will be in

255
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:16,259
the same state of development

256
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:18,629
professor curve always was very excited

257
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:21,259
with this fact because it doesn't occur

258
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:24,120
in other groups of founders so it's

259
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:29,789
probably something very interesting to

260
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:33,839
study evolutionary by some of you so but

261
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:36,899
this has led to problems in the

262
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:40,680
descriptions some people have described

263
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:43,198
new species based on immature spores

264
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:45,508
because that this is not something we

265
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:47,849
see in general when we look at an

266
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:53,579
opposite on a fruit body spores are in

267
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:56,189
all different stages of development and

268
00:12:53,578 --> 00:13:00,088
about what do we know about the biology

269
00:12:56,188 --> 00:13:05,698
will we know very little at a certain

270
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:09,779
point I was painting placing pink

271
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:12,088
colored pins in the under besides he

272
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:14,338
tripathi's I did this for years but this

273
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:16,199
was in the Amazon and then uh there was

274
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:16,730
a huge rainfall and everything got

275
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:18,649
washed

276
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,240
way so then I did it with another

277
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:22,549
species that occurred at my university

278
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,370
in Venezuela again the same thing

279
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:30,559
happened although this these things grow

280
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:32,929
on little twigs and little seeds so you

281
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,458
know you can imagine having a pin next

282
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:37,069
to it and trying to watch its

283
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:40,278
development throughout time it's not

284
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:43,310
very very easy so after maybe one month

285
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:46,370
they are they are resistant they they

286
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:49,969
are long long-lived nothing had happened

287
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:53,089
but we do know there's an an imperfect

288
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:55,160
state called mole er diem Isis that was

289
00:13:53,089 --> 00:14:00,230
described and as you know now there's

290
00:13:55,159 --> 00:14:02,870
one fungus one name so now of course

291
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:06,170
this is called this would be called the

292
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:09,740
--it sexual state of cocaina in this

293
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:13,009
case speciosa and they said one fungus

294
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:15,709
one name is a big decision that was that

295
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:17,720
happened in the in Melbourne in in the

296
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:21,439
code in the in a meeting there in

297
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:24,319
Melbourne already in 2014 so it's been

298
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,620
quite a few years that this new rule has

299
00:14:24,318 --> 00:14:29,269
been there in the code of nomenclature I

300
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,250
meant to bring the canoe code to show it

301
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:35,839
to you but I have it in the office if

302
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:37,429
you'd like to look at it so this second

303
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,680
group of find out that I work with are

304
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:42,620
the Leo show my seeds and these are the

305
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:45,828
ena percolate disco my seeds so this in

306
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:49,940
order of this group they're supposed to

307
00:14:45,828 --> 00:14:53,479
be a very homogenous kind of Spore

308
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:57,260
discharge which is what by a poor I am

309
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:59,449
poor India in the apex of the Oscars so

310
00:14:57,259 --> 00:15:04,120
through that little tiny pore which you

311
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:08,269
which frequently stains blue under

312
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:12,679
reagents that have a iodine so this poor

313
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:14,810
supposed to have some starch in it it's

314
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:16,599
it has been used in taxonomy to divide

315
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:19,338
these two groups and it holds

316
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,680
phylogenetically they sit the highest

317
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:24,620
diversity of cup fungi are in this group

318
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:27,139
and it's much more diverse than the

319
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,188
lyosha might seem worldwide the thing

320
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:30,330
with this groups is that in general

321
00:15:28,188 --> 00:15:32,969
they're very very tight

322
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:35,670
some of these are beautiful and have

323
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:39,779
been really used throughout history for

324
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:44,459
example flora Siberia which stains wood

325
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:47,490
Green has been used in in making

326
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:50,040
furniture and when one sees those

327
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:52,799
beautiful pieces of old furniture where

328
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:56,939
there's all these little flowers for

329
00:15:52,799 --> 00:16:00,719
example made in wood they're what every

330
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:04,440
screen has been made from wood work that

331
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,160
mycelium of this fungus is included and

332
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,920
these are other

333
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:13,529
lyosha that you know and Vice perilla

334
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:15,059
and one of the hollow siphay see so one

335
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:18,750
of the fungi I've been working in the

336
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:21,659
last few years the last two years it was

337
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:24,779
published I think last year is this

338
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:27,659
fungus which is kind of bizarre I had it

339
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:30,029
on my post on FaceTime and somebody

340
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:32,250
asked me what's that horrendous fungus

341
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:35,250
that you have there on your on your on

342
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:36,929
your post but actually it's very

343
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:41,039
interesting and the interest of this

344
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:45,029
fungi is that I look at it for a lot of

345
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:46,709
years and I I just started looking at it

346
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:48,449
and then I left it there I was

347
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:50,519
continuing with other things and then I

348
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:54,870
came back to it and there was something

349
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,620
wrong and it's placement has does not

350
00:16:54,870 --> 00:17:02,720
prove anything

351
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:07,230
we did a I TS sequence and LSU and also

352
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:10,110
transect elongation factor of the of

353
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:12,450
this industry and studied other genes as

354
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:16,619
well and it just comes somewhere there

355
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:19,350
in the in the Leo show my seeds so

356
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:22,079
there's no placement and why is there no

357
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:23,939
good placement for this fungus because

358
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,569
they're very few of these hundred that

359
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:29,490
have been that have been sequenced so

360
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:32,279
really every time that we work with on

361
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:34,380
of this your show my seeds we find that

362
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:37,019
it comes to something it doesn't give us

363
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,540
much information phylogeny doesn't

364
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:42,450
really give us much information because

365
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:43,089
in the case of Bulgaria Lapua there is

366
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,120
an

367
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:49,839
cause there it has brown ascospores and

368
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:51,639
it has weird parentheses and I could

369
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,639
tell you much more about this fungus but

370
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,520
I will not I will just tell you that the

371
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,919
way the ask us breaks is very

372
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:02,470
particularly very particular it doesn't

373
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,690
break through a pore it just breaks like

374
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:08,230
another totally different and unrelated

375
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:11,769
group of fungus which which is by the

376
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:14,288
total break of the rupture of the of the

377
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:20,019
spore wall so at the end we end up just

378
00:18:14,288 --> 00:18:23,379
with two walls and the apex of a site

379
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:26,918
disintegrates and thats how spores are

380
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:29,679
released there's there is here you can

381
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:32,799
see and little by little this took years

382
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:37,028
to understand and many many months at

383
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:40,569
least of understanding how all this

384
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:43,419
process started and continued and how

385
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:46,240
the world broke until only the two walls

386
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:48,700
were there and it has not been described

387
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,120
here yet lots of people had looked at

388
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:55,298
mulberry Ella and this only happened

389
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:57,778
because I looked and looked and looked

390
00:18:55,298 --> 00:19:00,908
for a long time under the microscope

391
00:18:57,778 --> 00:19:03,700
even to the point where I thought why am

392
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:06,100
I looking so much until until I

393
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,278
understood what it happened and he was

394
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:13,240
published like a important thing because

395
00:19:08,278 --> 00:19:17,048
this had not been recorded yet so it is

396
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:19,720
important to look another thing another

397
00:19:17,048 --> 00:19:22,778
issue I've been very interested in since

398
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,519
my PhD work and that was in 1990 under

399
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:26,019
professor course have been the

400
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:28,839
connections between the sexual and

401
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:30,940
asexual States which before each of them

402
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:34,480
as I've already mentioned have their own

403
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:36,278
name so I studied this little fungus due

404
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,950
to the persistence of professor course

405
00:19:36,278 --> 00:19:40,869
which because this fungus is a quarter

406
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:44,528
of a millimeter in diameter very

407
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:46,658
difficult to find in nature and it took

408
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:50,798
a lot a lot of going throughout the

409
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:54,190
world and a lot of time in the field in

410
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:57,519
order to find a few of the species so we

411
00:19:54,190 --> 00:20:01,870
did a monograph under on this

412
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:04,509
and also looked at its Animorph as it's

413
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:06,789
a sexual form which was called an pseudo

414
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:09,700
spy rupees now it's called straw Samaria

415
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:12,899
this is a very uncommon fungus in the

416
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:16,240
sense that they're usually not Brown

417
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:19,300
limitations animals connected to your

418
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,829
show my seeds they're very few and also

419
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:24,009
there are other characters in this

420
00:20:20,829 --> 00:20:27,009
fungus so in this sense I have been

421
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:28,900
working at that time how did we do the

422
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:32,019
connections you must wonder there was no

423
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:34,590
molecular involved so there was no way

424
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:37,769
to know we did cultures very carefully

425
00:20:34,589 --> 00:20:41,740
cultures have the ASCO spores of the

426
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:44,889
sexual body and single ascospores and

427
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,779
waited is it almost a leak or a turret a

428
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:49,360
leak is there something there so after

429
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:51,879
months when we had totally forgotten

430
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,559
that the cultures were there all the

431
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,630
sudden all of a sudden professor Corps

432
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:57,609
was shouting it's growing it's growing

433
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:01,210
and there was the pseudo spy rope is

434
00:20:57,609 --> 00:21:03,389
growing there so again connecting this

435
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,890
and a morphing tree until you morphs

436
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:09,070
there is this fungus called tricolor

437
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:11,980
Javan iike and last year I went to

438
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:14,319
Mozambique in a very very bad time of

439
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,900
the year for a collecting trip I had

440
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:18,789
been invited to and they says you know a

441
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,790
national park Gorongosa National Park

442
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:24,339
and we have one has to collect with and

443
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:27,460
with a guard because of the elephants

444
00:21:24,339 --> 00:21:29,169
and other animals so nobody's permitted

445
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:31,329
but to be under Jeep so it's very

446
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:34,000
exciting because you see an elephant

447
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:36,129
over there and you think there's a tiger

448
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,430
gonna come to attack you but nothing of

449
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:40,480
that happened we were scraping the floor

450
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:42,820
scrapings of everything because there

451
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,710
were so few fungi we were we were really

452
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:46,960
depressed and why did we come at this

453
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:49,450
time of the year until we started

454
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,740
finding things that were totally unusual

455
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:55,720
that we started finding these hairy

456
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:58,509
thing we didn't know at all what it was

457
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:01,750
I send it to some colleagues experts in

458
00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:03,519
in animals nobody knew what it was so we

459
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,470
grew it in cultural group beautifully

460
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:07,809
lots of hairs coming from those petri

461
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,720
dishes and we were able to sequence it

462
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:12,690
and it's sequence

463
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,410
one of the few times it happens

464
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:17,110
identical with a hundred percent

465
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:21,519
similarity to trickle arena germanica

466
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:24,039
which was only known by its fruit body

467
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:27,789
and just a few years before there had

468
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:29,980
been somebody working on the on the

469
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:33,129
sexual state and had been able to obtain

470
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:35,650
the fungus in Indian culture the animal

471
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:38,140
fin culture but had never seen it in

472
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:40,420
nature neither knew anything about where

473
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:46,630
it occurs so that's pretty exciting when

474
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:49,360
that things happen so this is I've been

475
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:51,970
I am NOT going to mention other examples

476
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:55,479
and there are many of this animal TV

477
00:22:51,970 --> 00:23:00,400
Merkle connection which now we are lucky

478
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:04,059
to be able to do using molecular if if

479
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:08,590
there has even been bullet molecular

480
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:10,659
molecular its DNA has been studied this

481
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:14,349
usually the case is not that usually it

482
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:21,150
lasts to nothing so then we describe it

483
00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:24,639
as again the old method so the the third

484
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:28,870
thing I've been working with our fungal

485
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:34,870
communities and also last year there was

486
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:38,139
a big fire in the Smoky Mountains and it

487
00:23:34,869 --> 00:23:42,039
was a fire that started in 2016 we

488
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:47,200
started studying it in 2017 it started

489
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:49,869
in November and it was it was contained

490
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,110
by mid December people died structures

491
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:55,750
were lost it was really the town of

492
00:23:53,109 --> 00:24:00,189
Guttenberg was when we started going

493
00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:02,109
there in March of 2017 it was very sad

494
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:06,100
of course you've all seen the recent

495
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:08,349
fires on the west coast and and that's

496
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:12,159
not unusual for the west coast but it is

497
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:15,089
unusual for the East Coast well it's a

498
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,860
sad sad to say that probably with

499
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:22,428
weather changes etc and I don't want to

500
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:26,178
use a word climate change but

501
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:28,879
it may be it may it may happen that we

502
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:31,460
get the abundance of water or more fires

503
00:24:28,878 --> 00:24:35,569
also so when we started going there

504
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:38,028
visit what we saw there was nothing but

505
00:24:35,569 --> 00:24:41,028
that's not true there was not there was

506
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:43,878
really when looking carefully at the

507
00:24:41,028 --> 00:24:49,308
soil fungi in March were already growing

508
00:24:43,878 --> 00:24:51,740
there and fungi specifically cap fungi

509
00:24:49,308 --> 00:24:56,028
and some of the agarics were already

510
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:59,028
growing there so we went for once a

511
00:24:56,028 --> 00:25:01,659
month during a whole year and we've

512
00:24:59,028 --> 00:25:05,509
understood there was a fungal succession

513
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:09,789
present there many fungi repeated

514
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:13,669
themselves and some of his fungi we're

515
00:25:09,788 --> 00:25:17,240
like where are they coming from all of a

516
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:19,278
sudden they were particularly - a fungal

517
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,220
community that's already known to occur

518
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:24,349
so it's some of these fungi already

519
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:27,409
known from the western United States and

520
00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:28,699
all of a sudden did they come from the

521
00:25:27,409 --> 00:25:31,639
west to the east

522
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:34,340
all of a sudden through the air are they

523
00:25:31,638 --> 00:25:36,109
all around and then just land so I'm

524
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:39,138
gonna talk a little about the hypothesis

525
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:42,229
that exists about how are these

526
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:45,979
communities how do these communities

527
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:48,139
occur so some of the questions where

528
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:51,288
this disfranchised sorry are called

529
00:25:48,138 --> 00:25:55,579
perilous fungi fungi that grow after

530
00:25:51,288 --> 00:25:58,249
fire they're friends of fire and this is

531
00:25:55,579 --> 00:26:00,918
geo Pyxis carbonaria on the top this is

532
00:25:58,249 --> 00:26:03,110
more moral and I have some in my lab if

533
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:05,119
some of you want to see I'm not giving

534
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:07,099
out anyone because I'm gonna eat them

535
00:26:05,118 --> 00:26:09,138
myself but I've been waiting for a

536
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:11,298
special occasion so I made make a dish

537
00:26:09,138 --> 00:26:14,240
at some of the departmental parties and

538
00:26:11,298 --> 00:26:16,638
we can all eat it so what is a fungal

539
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:21,829
community like post-fire and what

540
00:26:16,638 --> 00:26:24,378
explains that distribution there's as I

541
00:26:21,829 --> 00:26:27,230
said there was we found like 50 species

542
00:26:24,378 --> 00:26:29,058
specific to burned sites and that's a

543
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:31,399
succession that was evident especially

544
00:26:29,058 --> 00:26:33,648
on your number one i'm your number two

545
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:35,089
therefore there's forests growing again

546
00:26:33,648 --> 00:26:35,719
and their other many other things

547
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:38,629
growing

548
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,490
but we did find new records and some of

549
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:43,040
them with totally unresolved taxonomy

550
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:45,250
still being work work that so this is a

551
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,539
group of ascomycetes that we found

552
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:51,079
specifically I am working right now with

553
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:53,389
an track obeah which is bringing again

554
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:56,269
some of the same things that happen in

555
00:26:53,390 --> 00:27:00,310
cocaina are being repeated with entre

556
00:26:56,269 --> 00:27:03,619
cobia Myrcella was the first report for

557
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:07,250
in the east this species of more

558
00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:09,739
commercial exuberance and in the passage

559
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:12,559
of my kata there were new ecology things

560
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:14,450
that started up appearing in spring that

561
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:18,079
were known only from other seasons as

562
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:19,819
the same as my Cena and folio Highland

563
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:23,029
dances which was everywhere

564
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:25,069
wasn't a very much smaller form I do not

565
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:26,450
study agarics but there's a huge group

566
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:29,119
of colleagues from the University of

567
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:31,430
Tennessee working on this so these are

568
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:34,069
the most frequently the folio de geo

569
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:37,310
pixels Carbonari everywhere and this

570
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:40,279
fungi which are growing clusters and

571
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:43,039
they're difficult to get out of soil

572
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:46,879
because a whole clump of soil comes with

573
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:48,920
it so one can start understanding why

574
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,600
are there there this is the first report

575
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:54,320
of that wartella

576
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:56,449
which was already published and I have

577
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:57,889
mentioned and the interesting thing with

578
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:59,779
anta cobia is that they're also

579
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:02,420
different colors of hunter cobia

580
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:05,420
different morphologies in answer cobia

581
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:07,340
and undoing the 'enter cobia phylogeny

582
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:10,640
and on working on several genes of

583
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:12,549
hunter cobia this is only ideas we can

584
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:18,680
see that there are different clades and

585
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:21,139
here in a very rough manner just to

586
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:23,299
start with a one can see that probably

587
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:25,700
there's a species present but there are

588
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:28,250
other plates in between which we know

589
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,700
nothing about and this is probably not

590
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:34,579
on a track obeah in Ecuador but another

591
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:36,140
genus and there are other things

592
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:38,269
involved there which have been very

593
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:43,520
mixed up so at this point we're trying

594
00:28:38,269 --> 00:28:45,379
to solve it and we have gone back to

595
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,359
trying to understand the morphology of

596
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:49,130
these groups and also we're finding lots

597
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:50,719
of cryptic species

598
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:52,340
there so there's a lot that we're

599
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,640
working on and we don't understand yet

600
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:58,159
only about these Geno's in particular so

601
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,900
I think you'll be interested in these

602
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:03,259
three hypotheses that I mentioned

603
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:05,330
already of what what explains the

604
00:29:03,259 --> 00:29:07,730
distribution and I'll just mention them

605
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:10,759
very briefly the first one is the spore

606
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:14,299
dispersal hypothesis which says that the

607
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:18,230
spores come from elsewhere and finding

608
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:20,619
an environment totally with nothing with

609
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:23,509
no competition at all they start growing

610
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:27,619
but if this hypothesis has not been a

611
00:29:23,509 --> 00:29:29,869
very if true genetic diversity should be

612
00:29:27,619 --> 00:29:31,879
low in the population and spores to

613
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:35,809
germinate easily and none of these

614
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:38,540
things happen the second hypothesis says

615
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:40,839
there is for a sports corrosion or

616
00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:44,569
sclerotium bank that doesn't get

617
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:48,619
eliminated when fire passes through I'm

618
00:29:44,569 --> 00:29:50,960
sorry and and then they're dormant until

619
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:55,429
fire comes and they start growing and

620
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:57,799
the third hypothesis is the one that we

621
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:59,960
are working on some of my colleagues and

622
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:02,659
me which is called the Body Snatcher

623
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:06,350
hypothesis and it says that fungi are

624
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:10,880
present there in put inside plants so

625
00:30:06,349 --> 00:30:12,919
this plants we have C sequence my

626
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,950
colleagues and myself we have been

627
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:18,769
working in sequenced sequencing masses

628
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:20,750
and sequencing lichens from the Smoky

629
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:25,039
Mountains and from other parts of the

630
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:28,430
world and the preliminary results prove

631
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:30,769
that that they are present in mosses and

632
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:33,320
that they said fungi are present in

633
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:35,029
mosses not only on the Smokies but

634
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:37,099
elsewhere so now there's an

635
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:40,069
environmental sequencing going on there

636
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:41,689
have been and I don't do not have the

637
00:30:40,069 --> 00:30:43,339
results with me because they have not

638
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:45,559
been published and they're still being

639
00:30:43,339 --> 00:30:48,619
worked by colleagues in the University

640
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:52,519
of Tennessee and Illinois and it's

641
00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:54,229
really their work so but but they are

642
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:56,150
there and they're present though this

643
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:59,059
will probably be the most common

644
00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:01,340
hypotheses the most real hypotheses that

645
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:02,720
they survive how do they first survive

646
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:04,939
well no but

647
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,710
sure yet but it can be related to the

648
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:09,590
amount of water that mussels have oh

649
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:13,279
that dry somes maybe fire sometimes

650
00:31:09,589 --> 00:31:16,490
passes very quickly and the rhizomes are

651
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:18,529
there and who knows there may be a

652
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:20,960
combination of methods there may be also

653
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:23,690
some structures that persist on the soil

654
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,309
though it's that could be it's more

655
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:28,370
uncommon because here in the eastern

656
00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:31,609
coast there that that particular region

657
00:31:28,369 --> 00:31:36,469
had not had a fire in hundreds of years

658
00:31:31,609 --> 00:31:40,279
for example so so that's a question for

659
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:42,950
you and the last part of my I'm

660
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:45,230
switching now completely to talk about

661
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:47,660
her barium and why do I talk about her

662
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:50,890
barium oh this beautiful fungi that

663
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:54,470
you've seen there and somewhere and

664
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:56,720
they're important to be there it's

665
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:59,450
important that they are that they end

666
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,900
somewhere and that they end as a

667
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:06,350
collection in a herbarium so this is

668
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:09,380
photographs that are taken from superior

669
00:32:06,349 --> 00:32:11,179
barium which is a Cornell University

670
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,760
Plant Pathology herbarium that used to

671
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:17,509
be housed in this building in the third

672
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:19,549
floor and it's now it's in not too far

673
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:23,869
away some of you work have been there

674
00:32:19,549 --> 00:32:31,549
and it's a it has a a wonderful space of

675
00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:33,169
its own now in a game farm road so there

676
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:35,419
are all sorts of different kinds of

677
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:40,370
specimens starting by the password tool

678
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:44,840
which are just for for for classes or

679
00:32:40,369 --> 00:32:47,209
for showing diseases etc to students

680
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:50,059
they are mounted in a way with cotton

681
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:51,829
etc that are very easy to pass around

682
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:53,960
and to show them and there you're

683
00:32:51,829 --> 00:32:56,629
welcome to use them it doesn't have only

684
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:59,140
fungi have bacteria it has viruses it's

685
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:02,450
a it has all sorts of plant diseases

686
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:04,970
that they're very very nicely preserved

687
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:07,789
in this bus / - there are thousands of

688
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:10,779
password tools so the the most of the

689
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:14,269
collection started with Wetzel are in

690
00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:16,579
they were they they are in this huge

691
00:33:14,269 --> 00:33:19,730
boxes and

692
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:24,859
these are some of the atkinson's slides

693
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:28,788
so there are about 500,000 specimens in

694
00:33:24,859 --> 00:33:33,250
the at COP herbarium find out from all

695
00:33:28,788 --> 00:33:36,519
over the world and a new project were

696
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:40,759
COP herbarium has been involved since

697
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:44,870
May well I don't know 10 years ago it

698
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:47,778
has been the digitisation of herbaria

699
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:50,000
so the micro portal it's a project that

700
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:51,798
I was in both ways and see you Peter

701
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,769
barium has been involved with for many

702
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:58,460
years doing macro fungi and microphones

703
00:33:54,769 --> 00:34:03,440
oh so now all of these specimens are are

704
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:05,538
digitized and 85 institutions from all

705
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,370
of the United States have participated

706
00:34:05,538 --> 00:34:12,469
and from other parts of the world also

707
00:34:07,369 --> 00:34:16,210
have participated CU p had an and kathy

708
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:18,918
had a kathy Hodge had a very good idea

709
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:21,559
in digitizing not the specimens

710
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:24,069
themselves but all the card catalog that

711
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:26,719
was there thanks to Wetzel and Korff and

712
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:29,539
so the whole herbarium was able to be

713
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:31,309
digitized in the sense that people all

714
00:34:29,539 --> 00:34:34,668
over the world because this is of open

715
00:34:31,309 --> 00:34:37,668
access can see what's there and can ask

716
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:44,628
for specimens that we have so we keep

717
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:46,789
getting requests for fungi that we have

718
00:34:44,628 --> 00:34:49,368
and that people only learn off because

719
00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:52,190
of the micro portal in the micro portal

720
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:56,210
they're almost 4 million records from

721
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:58,670
all of those institutions and I just did

722
00:34:56,210 --> 00:35:01,849
a little sample that took me 15 minutes

723
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:04,099
because it's there are several tools in

724
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:06,019
the micro portal where I just said I

725
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:08,660
want to know what's the latin-american

726
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:12,130
fungal diversity and it just popped up

727
00:35:08,659 --> 00:35:14,829
all these numbers of course this only is

728
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:17,380
including specimens are in herbaria and

729
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:19,909
the specimens that have been digitized

730
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:22,700
usually geo-referenced of course because

731
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:25,429
we know they're from Latin America so an

732
00:35:22,699 --> 00:35:27,318
image sometimes so all of these

733
00:35:25,429 --> 00:35:29,659
countries the number of records and the

734
00:35:27,318 --> 00:35:32,298
number of species

735
00:35:29,659 --> 00:35:37,608
besides that the micro portal can keep

736
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:41,630
can permit making heat maps so and

737
00:35:37,608 --> 00:35:46,338
that's also done in minutes so it's

738
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:48,769
amazing when one tries this and what

739
00:35:46,338 --> 00:35:52,880
other all the information that one can

740
00:35:48,769 --> 00:35:54,588
retrieve from this portal and I did just

741
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,059
because of course I'm from Venezuela I

742
00:35:54,588 --> 00:36:00,170
was interested in knowing that heat map

743
00:35:56,059 --> 00:36:02,089
from Venezuela my own country so well

744
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:06,409
this is a little further down than

745
00:36:02,088 --> 00:36:08,599
Venezuela but it includes because there

746
00:36:06,409 --> 00:36:11,058
Nestle are usually should end here so

747
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:12,440
there's some must be some little problem

748
00:36:11,059 --> 00:36:16,339
there within my capital I shouldn't tell

749
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:18,460
you that but it's true but here the

750
00:36:16,338 --> 00:36:22,730
problem has been solved so this is

751
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:25,039
Venezuela and each of this that's

752
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:28,420
another kind of map that one can do in

753
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:33,440
seconds also where each dot represents

754
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:36,769
are collecting spot a just clicking on

755
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:39,769
the dot you'll find the species the

756
00:36:36,769 --> 00:36:43,519
collector and the and the locality so

757
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:46,429
it's really a wonderful tool to use with

758
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:48,739
this tool one can learn also how fungi

759
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:51,739
are moving throughout the world if clay

760
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:54,709
is climate change affecting some

761
00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:58,399
diseases and how some diseases are

762
00:36:54,710 --> 00:37:02,449
moving from one place to the other when

763
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,889
they does DC start and where so there's

764
00:37:02,449 --> 00:37:06,528
a lot of information that can be

765
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:10,670
retrieved from the literature and from

766
00:37:06,528 --> 00:37:14,139
the micro portal so voucher specimens

767
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:17,990
are a vital source of information

768
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:20,690
nowadays we can of course the dude may

769
00:37:17,989 --> 00:37:23,568
obtain DNA from specimens there are

770
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:26,119
hundreds of years old and new techniques

771
00:37:23,568 --> 00:37:29,329
if that that did not happen when I was a

772
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:31,880
graduate student when I was sitting down

773
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:35,750
listen in this same room like you guys

774
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:38,420
some a few guys are there we we didn't

775
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:42,019
have those tools so in I won't say how

776
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:43,519
many years this has changed can you

777
00:37:42,019 --> 00:37:47,179
imagine in 50 years

778
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:49,369
thirty years 100 years what information

779
00:37:47,179 --> 00:37:51,889
will we be able to retrieve from those

780
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:53,539
samples so that's why we care for these

781
00:37:51,889 --> 00:37:56,839
samples that's why it's important for

782
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:59,960
all of you to deposit your samples there

783
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:02,990
the organisms you're working with we

784
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:05,389
sometimes we get some organisms

785
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:07,368
deposited there but very seldom so

786
00:38:05,389 --> 00:38:09,230
please do please count on the herbarium

787
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:12,050
there are many questions that can be

788
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:14,990
answered and you're welcome to come we

789
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:17,660
have great facility we have space we

790
00:38:14,989 --> 00:38:22,129
have a dissecting scope so it's there

791
00:38:17,659 --> 00:38:24,259
for you and we welcome anything that you

792
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:27,410
be interested for your research

793
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:30,710
oh this was supposed to be a before this

794
00:38:27,409 --> 00:38:33,289
slide just but I I will talk about a

795
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:36,110
little just very quickly about a lineage

796
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:39,139
where I come from and as I said I stand

797
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:42,440
in the shoulder of giants and this is

798
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:44,569
the Cornell lineage you know all these

799
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:49,190
people which I was not named with their

800
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:51,530
students so Dudley Atkinson Wetzel

801
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:55,099
Fitzpatrick Korff and that's my name

802
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:58,250
over there we all come and we call each

803
00:38:55,099 --> 00:39:02,900
other brothers uh so I call for example

804
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:04,250
Don Pfister my mycological brother and I

805
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,440
don't think I'm gonna have time to

806
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:08,989
talking in detail about some of these

807
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,358
people but Dudley was the first one and

808
00:39:08,989 --> 00:39:13,699
I just want to say that there was like a

809
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:16,009
traditions like Dudley was the professor

810
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:18,579
of Atkinson and Duran and he has this

811
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:22,700
beautiful fungus named after him and

812
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:25,340
Cornell first president purchased

813
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:29,118
Cornell first herbarium in 1870 five

814
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:31,640
years after Cornell started why did they

815
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,710
was that important because having

816
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:35,900
collections was a pride of an

817
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:39,740
institution having collections and

818
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:43,820
having museums was as it still is

819
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:47,539
important so and people knew it so

820
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:49,730
Atkinson was as we know this wonderful

821
00:39:47,539 --> 00:39:53,420
and incredible person who was a student

822
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:55,519
after what had to run fitzpatrick and

823
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:57,670
wets office students

824
00:39:55,519 --> 00:40:01,190
what a wonderful photographer and

825
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:06,800
recorded and what did this great book on

826
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:08,630
mushrooms wet so how we how can we not

827
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,780
know wetter winter standing in the room

828
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:14,450
called after him he was the father of

829
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,950
Cornel Plant Pathology he started he

830
00:40:14,449 --> 00:40:17,989
established the first department in

831
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:20,000
Plant Pathology in the United States

832
00:40:17,989 --> 00:40:23,089
and the and the Plant Pathology

833
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,579
herbarium so he was as the professor of

834
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:29,809
Fitzpatrick under and in word with

835
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:31,969
Sclerotinia well he traveled extensively

836
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:35,829
throughout the world and had

837
00:40:31,969 --> 00:40:39,919
collaborators but you can see over there

838
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:41,750
and I just want to mention to run

839
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,389
because we have in our herbarium that

840
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:46,280
around herbarium all this kamae seeds he

841
00:40:44,389 --> 00:40:47,809
studied here but that wouldn't went

842
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:51,170
elsewhere but then he donated his

843
00:40:47,809 --> 00:40:56,090
herbarium to see you P Fitzpatrick was

844
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:58,130
professor course professor and he was

845
00:40:56,090 --> 00:41:00,740
responsible for the herbarium and also

846
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:03,079
taught a lot of my ecology courses which

847
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:06,829
then of course professor course which

848
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:09,590
died three years ago and many of you may

849
00:41:06,829 --> 00:41:11,750
have known him he continued the work of

850
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:14,450
Fitzpatrick wonderful work in the

851
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:16,909
herbarium the herbarium grew throughout

852
00:41:14,449 --> 00:41:19,219
the years with Wetzel and him until some

853
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:21,829
more or less four hundred thousand five

854
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:25,519
hundred thousand that it has today he

855
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:27,619
did an incredible amount of publications

856
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:29,449
as you can see there was a member of the

857
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:33,019
nomenclature committee for fungi and

858
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:38,480
when he retired I kind of I took his

859
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:41,329
place but I in that committee and he was

860
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:44,329
also a talented actor he was very good

861
00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:46,099
in acting as can be seen here in his

862
00:41:44,329 --> 00:41:48,829
photo and he was a student at Cornell

863
00:41:46,099 --> 00:41:51,699
and this is not how he how he dressed to

864
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:54,679
come to class I don't think he was here

865
00:41:51,699 --> 00:41:57,529
impersonating Elias freeze one of the

866
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:59,659
very important mycologists and he did

867
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:01,820
this and what asked was asked several

868
00:41:59,659 --> 00:42:04,190
times to impersonate him in several

869
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:06,650
international congresses and he loved it

870
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:09,470
and he was he really was very good at it

871
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:12,019
this is a photograph Richard because

872
00:42:09,469 --> 00:42:14,809
a president of the mycological Society

873
00:42:12,019 --> 00:42:18,009
of America and this is a photo that

874
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:20,900
Cathy took of him on his 18th birthday

875
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:23,210
where there's professor Corp and there's

876
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:26,119
some of you there and I can see one

877
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:28,849
person over here which is Professor

878
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:35,300
professor nor peers standing at the door

879
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:38,359
so you see that tradition continues well

880
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:41,869
I've come now to to the acknowledgement

881
00:42:38,358 --> 00:42:43,309
part and I want to I will not go through

882
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:46,190
the whole acknowledgements but I want

883
00:42:43,309 --> 00:42:48,559
especially to thank Kathy Hodge

884
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:53,539
professor Hodge for inviting me to give

885
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:58,608
this talk for her many insights into

886
00:42:53,539 --> 00:43:00,980
this talk and also for being a major the

887
00:42:58,608 --> 00:43:03,440
major person that brought me back to

888
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:04,820
Cornell to be a curator at a plant

889
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,070
pathology herbarium I didn't I'm

890
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:08,930
delighted to be here and we have a lot

891
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:12,230
of projects that we are already starting

892
00:43:08,929 --> 00:43:14,899
and we hope many of you will get excited

893
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:17,599
and also start working with us and I

894
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:19,130
want to thank all of these people that

895
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,109
are that you see there which have

896
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:24,588
collaborated in different projects

897
00:43:21,108 --> 00:43:26,329
perfect donald Feaster from Harvard and

898
00:43:24,588 --> 00:43:28,429
the Miller from the University of

899
00:43:26,329 --> 00:43:31,519
Illinois besides all the other

900
00:43:28,429 --> 00:43:33,409
colleagues Karen Hughes also from the

901
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:35,989
University of Tennessee they have all

902
00:43:33,409 --> 00:43:40,159
been relevant people

903
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:44,229
Meredith blackwell from two on the in

904
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:46,940
this presentation in different ways so

905
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:49,309
thank you to all and I end with this

906

picture Venezuela or another two boys

907
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:54,230
which we cannot go at the moment but we

908
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:58,380
hope to be able to be able to go back in

909
00:43:54,230 --> 00:44:04,940
a new need not so far future

910
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:04,940
[Applause]

911
00:44:09,659 --> 00:44:19,929
logical significance colors well there

912
00:44:17,469 --> 00:44:24,759
have been many hypotheses and the some

913
00:44:19,929 --> 00:44:28,179
of them are dispersion there are logs

914
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:31,030
and there are different lots of insects

915
00:44:28,179 --> 00:44:36,039
that that feed from the high minium of

916
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:41,410
this fungi so there may be there there

917
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:44,289
it may be a color may be there to

918
00:44:41,409 --> 00:44:46,750
attract them also it's been said a lot

919
00:44:44,289 --> 00:44:48,820
that their secondary metabolites and and

920
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:52,179
there are really toxins that accumulate

921
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:56,530
in in that the fungus doesn't have a

922
00:44:52,179 --> 00:44:59,469
better way to get rid of and that's a

923
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:03,400
theory that I have read I myself have

924
00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:05,139
not studied it but there are all these

925
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:09,670
sort of relationships they're also

926
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:12,519
mammals that feed from fungi and the

927
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:15,039
color may have some attraction towards

928
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:17,650
them but mostly we see worms and

929
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:21,909
arthropods a little insects are usually

930
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:25,090
feeding on them but you know I they're

931
00:45:21,909 --> 00:45:27,149
not too many studies made on them and on

932
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:30,400
the Koki I know special so specifically

933
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:33,039
why are they growing just one next to

934
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,869
each other sometimes and having totally

935
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:37,449
different colors now we know that they

936
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:39,460
may be different species but what is the

937
00:45:37,449 --> 00:45:41,529
color significance there you know you

938
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:43,960
can find white and brown and oranges and

939
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:46,180
all of them we thought it could be

940
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:49,179
related to light at some point but it's

941
00:45:46,179 --> 00:45:51,609
not so we really and truly to answer

942
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:53,589
your question we have not much idea and

943
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:57,360
it may different of differ of course

944
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:57,360
with a group that we're talking about

945
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:05,460
your insights on the one fungus

946
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:07,599
nomenclature and I know a couple of the

947
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:09,820
agriculturally significant species there

948
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:13,509
have been some heated debates on what

949
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:18,160
the name will be are there some guiding

950
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:20,230
choosing what name yes and there is a

951
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:22,269
whole code that I have in the room next

952
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:24,820
door and I have all the codes of

953
00:46:22,269 --> 00:46:28,989
nomenclature there's there these debates

954
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:31,090
are very very heated and very very long

955
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:34,479
as you're saying only to take the way

956
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:38,170
that one named the over one day one

957
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:40,809
fungus one name took 30 years so so you

958
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:43,780
can see there were there were all sorts

959
00:46:40,809 --> 00:46:47,909
of debates in the Congress and the

960
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:54,340
panels and open panels and even boats

961
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:57,789
until finally it came to that there is

962
00:46:54,340 --> 00:47:00,130
there still now so now at a certain

963
00:46:57,789 --> 00:47:02,409
point it was decided that the sexual

964
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:04,780
stage would would be the prevailing

965
00:47:02,409 --> 00:47:06,879
stage but not anymore

966
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:09,010
so tonight following Congress so lots of

967
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,230
people said why is the sexual stage

968
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:13,600
gonna be more important than the sexual

969
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:16,860
stage you know so let's go to let's

970
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:19,449
let's go by priority whichever name was

971
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:22,390
described was erected first that should

972
00:47:19,449 --> 00:47:25,149
be the name but what about all the fungi

973
00:47:22,389 --> 00:47:29,019
that pathologist know by one name or

974
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:31,139
that people in a medical mycology know

975
00:47:29,019 --> 00:47:34,389
by a particular name or that have

976
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:36,369
economically importance of economical

977
00:47:34,389 --> 00:47:39,579
importance so there have been committees

978
00:47:36,369 --> 00:47:41,679
created to avoid this really terrible

979
00:47:39,579 --> 00:47:44,469
fights they have in committees created

980
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:47,769
for each others of the different groups

981
00:47:44,469 --> 00:47:51,129
and these subcommittees intensely debate

982
00:47:47,769 --> 00:47:53,860
and decide together with with lots of

983
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:57,190
experts which name should prevail so

984
00:47:53,860 --> 00:48:00,190
these are called now conserved names so

985
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:02,740
this lists are are of conserved names

986
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:05,530
just to make them different to some

987
00:48:02,739 --> 00:48:08,379
central names which is another group of

988
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:12,340
names that were erected by freeze and

989
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:18,220
person and they have their own status so

990
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:22,090
but still but those those names have the

991
00:48:18,219 --> 00:48:25,059
ability to be discussed so if somebody

992
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:25,960
and those are proposals so somebody is

993
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:28,058
not happy

994
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,429
with a name that all of a sudden the

995
00:48:28,059 --> 00:48:33,099
organism has the person presents a

996
00:48:30,429 --> 00:48:34,750
proposal and the basis it and then we

997
00:48:33,099 --> 00:48:38,410
discuss it at the committee where I am

998
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:40,838
in and that takes forever and and we

999
00:48:38,409 --> 00:48:42,519
vote one time and then we vote a second

1000
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:44,858
time when we vote a third time and then

1001
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:47,980
a year after we come for it and then

1002
00:48:44,858 --> 00:48:50,380
finally at the Congress now not the

1003
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:52,630
botanic congresses but now a rule has

1004
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:56,318
change also and we are able my colors

1005
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:58,390
are able to change the rules in their

1006
00:48:56,318 --> 00:49:00,400
own Myka logic International mycological

1007
00:48:58,389 --> 00:49:03,818
congresses which are every three years

1008
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,760
and of course then if they have to be

1009
00:49:03,818 --> 00:49:09,039
approved in the botany Congress so we

1010
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:11,020
are still you know little by little

1011
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:15,219
getting there if you want to ask me

1012
00:49:11,019 --> 00:49:18,940
about DNA type specimens no it's not yet

1013
00:49:15,219 --> 00:49:21,308
possible you cannot erect feel that was

1014
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:24,309
debated a lot in the last Congress and

1015
00:49:21,309 --> 00:49:27,400
some of you were there and it didn't

1016
00:49:24,309 --> 00:49:29,530
pass so and there are a lot of I won't

1017
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:33,130
get into that but I will be very happy

1018
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:35,530
to talk to any of you about about why it

1019
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:43,530
was not approved it will be eventually

1020
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:43,530
approved but not yet many trees

1021
00:49:51,838 --> 00:50:02,250
sequencing has been done just how what

1022
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:10,059
to what extent sequencing was done

1023
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:13,239
thousands of well now now everybody

1024
00:50:10,059 --> 00:50:15,369
sequencing and we not only the

1025
00:50:13,239 --> 00:50:20,558
mycological community or the experts

1026
00:50:15,369 --> 00:50:25,599
also amateurs are sequencing all the

1027
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:28,210
time so m so that's why we're having

1028
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:33,039
more and more sequences and amateurs

1029
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:37,838
have had a very important tool have been

1030
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:39,500
a very very important group in in

1031
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:41,860
in sequencing

1032
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:45,860
because nowadays you can send a sample

1033
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:48,800
somewhere and for $30 or sometimes less

1034
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:51,710
you obtain a sequence so of course after

1035
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:54,560
particular genes but amateurs have

1036
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:56,840
become very good at this and in their

1037
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,699
associations so that's why you see that

1038
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:01,730
amount of sequence and we've been

1039
00:50:58,699 --> 00:51:03,409
already sequencing since 30 years ago so

1040
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:07,250
some of these treats that you saw are

1041
00:51:03,409 --> 00:51:09,589
one gene some are five genes and and now

1042
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:12,619
there's a tendency and a huge project to

1043
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:16,130
sequence at leap try to sequence the

1044
00:51:12,619 --> 00:51:18,319
whole genomes which amazingly doesn't

1045
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:21,470
cost that much you know in money value

1046
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:25,190
it costs about three hundred dollars to

1047
00:51:21,469 --> 00:51:27,439
sequence a whole genome and so that's

1048
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:29,869
that of course it's not little money for

1049
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:33,769
any of us but it for a project for

1050
00:51:29,869 --> 00:51:35,980
example that makes sense so what you see

1051
00:51:33,769 --> 00:51:38,119
is true there's a whole lot of

1052
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:40,579
sequencing that has been done but

1053
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:54,769
there's so many fun joy there's still so

1054
00:51:40,579 --> 00:51:57,799
much more to do this has been a

1055
00:51:54,769 --> 00:52:01,840
production of Cornell University on the

1056
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:01,840
web at Cornell edu
