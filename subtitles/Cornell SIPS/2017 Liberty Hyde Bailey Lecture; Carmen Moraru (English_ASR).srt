University

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,379
thank you Chris good afternoon everybody

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,989
it's really my honor to be here and

5
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:15,298
speak with you today and now that we've

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:18,519
heard about all of these wonderful

7
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:21,309
veggies and fruits it's upon us with

8
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:23,710
Francis to bring them to your table and

9
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:27,309
try to preserve that goodness and that

10
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:29,440
freshness and I'm going to just tell you

11
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:31,209
some of the things that we do in food

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,879
science to make that happen

13
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:37,198
now food we do take for granted

14
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:40,599
oftentimes and we do have as consumers

15
00:00:37,198 --> 00:00:43,839
big expectations when it comes to food

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,960
and I try to let here some of the most

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,270
important elements that are expected

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,130
from food some we think about some we

19
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,020
don't like safety we take it for granted

20
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:57,690
we buy it from the store we think yes

21
00:00:53,020 --> 00:01:00,730
it's got to be safe from time it's

22
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:03,009
easier to have it safe than other times

23
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:06,399
and as food scientists now quite a bit

24
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:09,218
about that and work in that area so what

25
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:10,959
we do in food science touches on pretty

26
00:01:09,218 --> 00:01:15,188
much all of these points here safety

27
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:17,549
nutrition and that's wholesomeness of

28
00:01:15,188 --> 00:01:20,858
the food that gives us enjoyment to

29
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:25,950
we're trying to work on that too and

30
00:01:20,858 --> 00:01:28,298
then also when we apply these methods of

31
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,450
manufacturing or processing we're trying

32
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:32,439
to do it in a sustainable

33
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,909
environmentally friendly way and there

34
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:38,108
are more and more efforts in that area

35
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:39,819
at Cornell we do work primarily on fruit

36
00:01:38,108 --> 00:01:41,649
and vegetable products and dairy product

37
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:45,278
but we touch pretty much all food

38
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:47,439
commodities and I try to capture them on

39
00:01:45,278 --> 00:01:50,019
the slide here I can't forget this

40
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:52,028
because we are actually speaking of

41
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:53,888
enjoyment now where we're working in

42
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:58,569
those areas and they have become quite

43
00:01:53,888 --> 00:02:00,899
popular just a few examples of some of

44
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:04,629
the work that happens in food science

45
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,968
safety I mentioned earlier that often

46
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:09,489
times consumers take the you know for

47
00:02:06,968 --> 00:02:11,859
granted and it should be there it should

48
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:15,180
be in the foods that you buy in the

49
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:19,569
supermarket or in the local market but

50
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:21,700
there are things that happen to the food

51
00:02:19,568 --> 00:02:24,929
where it can get contaminated with

52
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:27,669
bacteria that can make us sick so as a

53
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:30,489
program we're looking at first of all

54
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:33,638
how bacteria can get into foods and what

55
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:35,739
are the bacteria that can make us sick

56
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:38,560
and how can we prevent them from getting

57
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:41,259
into our food and we've had programs

58
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,769
like this very successful for for many

59
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:47,168
years and I just brought it except for

60
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:49,239
you to see that we are getting

61
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:50,799
recognition we're getting national and

62
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:54,849
international recognition for some of

63
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:57,730
that work our dairy team our dairy

64
00:02:54,848 --> 00:03:01,658
microbiologist and the board has helped

65
00:02:57,729 --> 00:03:03,448
build that program have helped over the

66
00:03:01,658 --> 00:03:08,979
years both consumers and the industry

67
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:11,819
with achieving safety but we're here to

68
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:14,709
talk today about what's coming up new

69
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:17,048
so-called revolution I well I don't know

70
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:19,299
if we can call it exactly revolution but

71
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:21,669
certainly we're leading some new ways in

72
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:24,040
which we can keep our food safe we're

73
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:26,859
working for instance on some materials

74
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:29,408
that one can use in manufacturing plants

75
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:33,540
to prevent bacteria from attaching and

76
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:36,969
then from from perpetuating this

77
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:39,969
contamination and you see here a photo

78
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:42,789
of some bacterial cells on a surface

79
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:46,269
that in my group we have developed

80
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:48,608
collaboratively with a group in nano

81
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:51,009
engineering that doesn't use any

82
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:52,900
chemicals that just uses the surface

83
00:03:51,008 --> 00:03:55,598
features to prevent bacteria from

84
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,719
sticking to that surface so that in the

85
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,969
end we mitigate contamination and also

86
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,968
use less chemicals to clean the

87
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:06,269
equipment so it could be in the end a

88
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:10,239
more sustainable way of doing food

89
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:12,968
processing something that I'm personally

90
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,000
very excited about is what's happening

91
00:04:12,968 --> 00:04:19,389
now in food science on our both

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,548
locations Attica and Geneva we have seen

93
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:23,889
in recent years an increased interest in

94
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:25,899
these alternatives new processes there's

95
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:28,840
not a sort of new processing

96
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:32,718
technologies where we rely less on heat

97
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:37,458
to treat the food to make it safe and

98
00:04:32,718 --> 00:04:39,649
and last on the shelf so we do now have

99
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:43,389
a big initiative here at Cornell where

100
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:46,218
we are getting some of these new novel

101
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:48,288
technologies that enable us to keep food

102
00:04:46,218 --> 00:04:52,459
safe without the use of heat or using

103
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:56,709
minimal heat and we do have for for

104
00:04:52,459 --> 00:05:02,360
example this new high pressure treatment

105
00:04:56,709 --> 00:05:05,869
technologies that we are using to kill

106
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:08,689
bacteria in certain foods and we have in

107
00:05:05,869 --> 00:05:11,419
Geneva one of the best piece of

108
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:14,239
equipment that could could be at any

109
00:05:11,418 --> 00:05:16,368
University actually I don't I'm not

110
00:05:14,238 --> 00:05:19,338
aware of many places that have that that

111
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:25,399
help us help the industry maintain the

112
00:05:19,338 --> 00:05:30,110
safety of foods and more about that in

113
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:32,899
in a little bit the longest thin line we

114
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:37,429
are getting some other technologies that

115
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:41,829
help us make new foods foods that are

116
00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:44,388
fresher and these we hope will help us

117
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:47,199
restructure the way some foods are being

118
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:51,319
manufactured we've relied on feet for

119
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,658
you know many decades for centuries now

120
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:57,739
to make food and that's fine and heat is

121
00:05:53,658 --> 00:05:59,808
actually sometimes you can't you can't

122
00:05:57,738 --> 00:06:01,758
make a food safe without heat but we're

123
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:04,099
also looking at some of these novel

124
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,439
technologies that will allow us to use

125
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:08,149
different principles to make food just

126
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:10,218
one example that I want to show you

127
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:11,778
because you may not be even be aware

128
00:06:10,218 --> 00:06:13,699
that you're buying already some of the

129
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:16,269
foods that are made using these

130
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:19,929
technologies I mentioned high pressure

131
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:23,569
what do I mean by that well imagine

132
00:06:19,928 --> 00:06:25,458
putting the food on the bottom of the

133
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:27,588
ocean actually at the deepest point in

134
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:31,668
the ocean in the Mariana Trench you only

135
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:34,728
have about a sixth of the total pressure

136
00:06:31,668 --> 00:06:39,318
that we can that we are using now in

137
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:43,128
food manufacturing to treat foods so

138
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:45,139
that bacteria is killed and it's been

139
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:46,080
successful for a number of products and

140
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:49,348
these are commercial

141
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:51,180
product that you might have bought and

142
00:06:49,348 --> 00:06:53,009
you didn't realize that they were

143
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:57,060
treated with high pressures that's how

144
00:06:53,009 --> 00:07:00,500
we can now buy fresh guacamole from from

145
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,759
the store and well it's processed but it

146
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,069
retains that freshness and the variety

147
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,930
of foods you see all of these well

148
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:10,468
highly expensive right now juices like

149
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:13,769
six dollar bottle of you know the Suge's

150
00:07:10,468 --> 00:07:16,500
were naked juices all of these very cool

151
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:18,568
things your green juices that if you had

152
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,978
he treated them they certainly wouldn't

153
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:22,919
look like that they wouldn't taste as

154
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:24,918
fresh and they were made possible by

155
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:27,029
using these technologies

156
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:28,889
unfortunately correctly you can't put

157
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:30,418
you know strawberries in that high

158
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:34,860
pressure unit and still have them

159
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:38,758
maintain their structure but in in many

160
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:40,490
cases you can do that now what are we

161
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,800
doing here we're actually helping

162
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:46,110
understand better which microorganisms

163
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:50,278
you can kill using this technology which

164
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:52,050
foods you can make safe and also improve

165
00:07:50,278 --> 00:07:55,829
their shelf life using this technology

166
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:57,689
and we're trying to also help industry

167
00:07:55,829 --> 00:08:03,389
to adopt this technology in their own

168
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:06,199
plant but we're also trying to utilize

169
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:10,740
these new technologies in different ways

170
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:12,330
because you can now use raw products and

171
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,610
treat them with hydration really use

172
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:16,439
them to manufacture new types of food

173
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,060
products this is just an image of the

174
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:22,228
high pressure treatment unit that we

175
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:24,199
have in Geneva New York but what we are

176
00:08:22,228 --> 00:08:28,889
doing for instance in in my program

177
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:31,770
right now we're understanding more and

178
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:34,740
more what the this treatment does to

179
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:37,019
different cause different chemical

180
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,180
compounds in foods different for

181
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:41,399
instance proteins so there are some

182
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:43,769
structural changes that happen and you

183
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:48,389
can actually take proteins from milk or

184
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:51,419
take proteins from your your pulses and

185
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:53,639
and other sources and expose them to

186
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:57,509
pressure you don't add any ingredients

187
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:58,830
you don't add any acid you don't add

188
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:01,740
heat and

189
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,690
yes you can obtain these interesting

190
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,330
structures here that you know you kind

191
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,910
of have a jello type product or yogurt

192
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,950
type product just by views of pressure

193
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:13,049
and we're leading the way in making

194
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,660
those things happen and these are not

195
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:17,879
products that you have on the Shelf

196
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:21,360
right now but we're hoping that will be

197
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:25,230
part of the making of these products in

198
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,000
the future and they will be both you

199
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:29,789
know interesting products retain

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,700
freshness nutrition and safe at the same

201
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:39,449
time and with that like to thank you for

202
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:42,480
your attention this has been a

203
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:46,700
production of Cornell University on the

204
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,700
web at cornell edu
