00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,310
this is a production of Cornell

University

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,730
all right thanks Neal well good

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,669
afternoon everyone and thank you for

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,960
coming you know it really means a great

6
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:19,509
deal to me that you would show up today

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,800
to hear about this presentation on the

8
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:25,118
work that I've been conducting over the

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,759
past two years so I often get asked the

10
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:32,820
question why would you work on a crop

11
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:36,519
that is so small and well so meaningless

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,488
and when I first came into this I asked

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:42,640
myself where do I want to go and where

14
00:00:39,488 --> 00:00:45,189
do I want to take this degree and one of

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,079
the first things that came to mind was

16
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:49,659
work with a traditional green house

17
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:52,539
cultivated crop such as tomatoes or

18
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:55,299
lettuce and doing some work with

19
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:59,379
lighting or production systems as a

20
00:00:55,299 --> 00:01:01,209
whole but as I became more introduced

21
00:00:59,378 --> 00:01:04,209
into New York's greenhouse industry I

22
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:06,640
became so infatuated with just how many

23
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:07,329
growers are less than ten thousand

24
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,200
square feet

25
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:13,769
about 85% to be exact that I got this

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,259
urge to help the little guy

27
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:20,199
so as Neil my adviser took me around

28
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:21,819
various operations I began to see this

29
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,899
trend in the cultivation of these

30
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:29,069
microgreens now one of these growers we

31
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:31,390
visited let's call them Timothy farms

32
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:33,609
started asking Neil and I questions

33
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:38,968
about these crops and the difficulty

34
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:41,319
they were having and producing them so

35
00:01:38,968 --> 00:01:44,649
so when we went to visit these

36
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:47,319
subsequent operations days and our weeks

37
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:50,939
and months to follow I began to notice

38
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:53,468
that regardless of experience or size

39
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:56,379
growers were struggling with reliably

40
00:01:53,468 --> 00:01:58,809
producing these crops and it became very

41
00:01:56,379 --> 00:02:01,209
apparent very quickly that the source of

42
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:03,039
this trouble stemming from factors many

43
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:05,769
of us often take for granted in

44
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:10,659
well-established crops just being simple

45
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:13,659
production protocols now this is where

46
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:16,560
my work really began and is well defined

47
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:18,068
in my thesis as two distinct chapters

48
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,140
chapter one

49
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:21,030
really

50
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,399
focused on this idea of establishing

51
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,740
optimal cultural practices for the

52
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,730
production of these crops

53
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:31,319
these were seed density substrate depth

54
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:33,179
fertilizer concentration with nitrogen

55
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:37,619
being the focal point for adjustment and

56
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:39,300
air temperature once I establish optimal

57
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,289
cultural practices that resulted in

58
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,450
reliable growth

59
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:44,549
I started chapter two of my research

60
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:47,069
which looked at the effects of varying

61
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,540
daily light integral and carbon dioxide

62
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:56,400
concentration on the growth of these

63
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:57,750
crops now before I really begin and dive

64
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,120
into the work that I've been conducting

65
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:03,389
we need to step back for a moment and

66
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,620
define what microgreens truly are now

67
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:08,579
most people know the difference between

68
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:11,069
sprouts and baby leaf greens and really

69
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,110
the best way to define a micro green is

70
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:16,739
by sticking them right between those two

71
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:19,230
crops in short a micro green is just a

72
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,939
vegetable or herb harvested shortly

73
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:23,609
after emergence of the first true leaf

74
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:25,349
or leaves but prior to true leaf

75
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:30,209
development and senescence of the

76
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:31,889
cotyledons now one of the drivers for

77
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,739
growers to start producing these crops

78
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:38,159
is their high-value this falls in the

79
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,409
range of roughly 65 to 110 dollars per

80
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,479
kilogram and fresh weight which can be

81
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:45,650
highly incentivizing for growers as a

82
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:48,119
supplementary income source however

83
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,640
because their growing period only goes

84
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,560
between 10 to 20 days they are

85
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:56,429
considered a protected cultivation crop

86
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,739
due to their sensitivity and with very

87
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,170
little known about these crops there's

88
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,420
only a handful of publications primarily

89
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:05,849
focusing on their nutritional content

90
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:10,798
and the effects of variations in light

91
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:13,049
regimes now the image on this slide is a

92
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,909
prime example of the variability you can

93
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:17,069
find in microgreens where this

94
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:19,199
particular example does not meet the

95
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:24,709
attributes of the definition I just put

96
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:26,509
forth now you might be asking yourself

97
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:28,310
what is the

98
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:32,300
I heard for this crop that is so small

99
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:34,939
yet so expensive well I did not conduct

100
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,710
any consumer preference research there

101
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:39,379
have been numerous publications across

102
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:41,120
various social outlets praising the

103
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,219
health promoting benefits of microgreens

104
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,750
and the elegance that they impart on any

105
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:49,790
dish in fact this article by NPR is one

106
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:52,100
of the most accurate representations of

107
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:54,170
the crop that I could find serving as a

108
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,379
healthy side of science with your micro

109
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,379
green salad

110
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:04,420
now experiments to establish the various

111
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:07,339
cultural practices on the growth

112
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,199
morphology and days the harvest of these

113
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:11,869
crops were really targeted towards the

114
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,459
grower what this meant was that the

115
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,709
experiments that we wanted to devise

116
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:18,799
needed to be obtainable by the average

117
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:20,870
small-scale grower as I pointed out

118
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,120
earlier these manifested and treatments

119
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,340
for seed density substrate depth

120
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,769
fertilizer concentration and air

121
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:29,839
temperature now the reason why this is

122
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:31,759
important is because when you purchase

123
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,679
seed from a seed company the

124
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:37,430
recommendations made by the various seed

125
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,769
companies vary widely in addition these

126
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,860
recommendations are not species or genus

127
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:46,189
specific nor do they vary by seed size

128
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,410
or plant growth habits so when you

129
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:50,800
receive your seed in the mail the back

130
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:53,660
of the package has a general descriptor

131
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,090
recommending an average of 1.1 seeds per

132
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:59,600
square centimeter growing area and 2

133
00:05:56,089 --> 00:06:00,349
temperature recommendations 24 degrees C

134
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,430
for germination

135
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:06,590
and 16 degrees C for growth but what

136
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,889
happens if the growers temperatures are

137
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:11,869
not within those recommendations what

138
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:15,289
about if the growers media is expensive

139
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:18,590
whose isn't and they want to get the

140
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:20,689
best bang for their buck with many

141
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:23,269
microgreens sold in the containers in

142
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:26,029
which they are grown in there is no room

143
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:28,129
for poor stand development so over or

144
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:31,729
under seeding can result in unappealing

145
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:34,129
product now these pictures here are just

146
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:36,410
a small subset of images that I have

147
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:38,629
stored on my computer from growers who

148
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:40,320
struggle with struggle with reliably

149
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:41,459
producing these crops

150
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,490
simply because they don't know where to

151
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:47,250
start the image on the top is from an

152
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:49,319
aquaponics operation this as you can see

153
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,870
is struggling from seed density issues

154
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,969
irregular development rates and in

155
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:57,060
numerous flats extensive disease

156
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:59,340
pressure the image on the bottom is from

157
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:03,439
an operation that truly believed that

158
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:03,439
fertilizing these crops was unnecessary

159
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:11,519
so I initially started with 15 different

160
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:14,699
species and through trials I narrowed it

161
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,199
down to three distinct species now there

162
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,569
are a number of reasons why I chose

163
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,029
three and only three but they were

164
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:23,909
primarily chosen due to their presence

165
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:25,859
and local markets similarity and feed

166
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:28,590
size and number of days from seeding to

167
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:33,420
harvest and variability and sensory

168
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:35,159
attributes while there are upwards of 70

169
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,100
different varieties to choose from

170
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,140
I chose only three based on limitations

171
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,000
and experimental design from a hardware

172
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:44,189
standpoint as you will see in my

173
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,110
discussion of the DL I in co2 component

174
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:51,089
in my research so the first parameter

175
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,730
that I really looked at with seed

176
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:55,799
density when you purchase a bag of seed

177
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,810
from Johnny seed for example they

178
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,300
recommend an average of 1.1 seeds per

179
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:03,420
square centimeter of growing area now

180
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,129
when I utilize this rate I noticed that

181
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,800
it happened to result in a lot of unused

182
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:12,000
media which in turn resulted in a

183
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:14,550
relatively sparse canopy given the cost

184
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,980
of substrate seed and other input

185
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:19,430
variables I wanted to find that optimal

186
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:22,290
density that resulted in greatest growth

187
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:25,230
so I investigated five different seeding

188
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:27,600
densities four of which corresponding to

189
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:30,720
50 percent increments in density above

190
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,969
the recommended rate what we found was

191
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,710
the population fresh weight increased in

192
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:36,990
a quadratic fashion for all three

193
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:39,210
species as see density increased from

194
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:43,379
one point one to three point three seeds

195
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:46,139
per square centimeter on the flip side

196
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:48,210
four escalate per plant decreased in a

197
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:50,399
quadratic fashion for all three species

198
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,780
as seed density increase from one point

199
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,789
one to three point three seeds per

200
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:55,620
square centimeter

201
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:57,689
now this is something that we expected

202
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,840
to see due to competition for resources

203
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,610
such as light and growing space but we

204
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,519
did not start to see this reduced

205
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:09,240
population yield component until 2.5

206
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,340
times the recommended seeding rate now

207
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,549
this is really great for growers because

208
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:16,310
it allows them to get the best it allows

209
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:18,870
them to get the best bang for their buck

210
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:24,809
and make the most out of their bench

211
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:27,779
space even though this factor reduced

212
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:30,449
population even though this fresh way

213
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:33,149
per plant decreased that had no

214
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:35,190
noticeable effect on the maturity rate

215
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:37,259
of the crop so regardless of your

216
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,480
density that crop is sitting on the

217
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:41,279
bench for the same amount of time so

218
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,060
it's besting utilised that space as

219
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,059
efficiently as possible

220
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:51,870
the next factor we looked at or the next

221
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,870
factor looked at with substrate depth as

222
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:57,210
I visited growers in the area I happen

223
00:09:54,870 --> 00:10:00,149
to notice that many of them only utilize

224
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:02,550
the small fraction of the volume of a

225
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:04,409
standard 10 by 20 inch tray with

226
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:08,189
substrate depths often as shallow as

227
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:10,259
only one to two centimeters now the

228
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:13,050
principle behind using less substrate is

229
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:15,110
feasible because let's face it these

230
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:18,240
crops are only growing for 10 to 20 days

231
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:21,269
after which all those inputs are then

232
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,950
composted but given these crops high

233
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:27,299
density and high competition for

234
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:31,040
resources it may be using less substrate

235
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:31,039
may be counterproductive to their growth

236
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:36,629
now as a result I looked at four

237
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,160
different substrate depths ranging from

238
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:41,360
one point eight two five two point eight

239
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:45,419
centimeters per cell or roughly 86 to

240
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,070
278 cubic centimeters per cell the

241
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:50,569
response is fresh weight to increasing

242
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:52,710
substrate depth was positively quadratic

243
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:54,300
what was really interesting was that

244
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,730
there was no statistical difference

245
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:59,879
between species or their response to

246
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:02,220
changes in substrate depth now this

247
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:05,250
happens to be very convenient because

248
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,990
obtaining a substrate depth at container

249
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:11,429
capacity at a more

250
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:13,889
at Adam at a capacity at four point

251
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:16,379
three centimeters also happens to be

252
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:17,490
roughly the same as if you fill the

253
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:19,409
container to container

254
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:21,060
fill the container to about height using

255
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:23,009
bad moisture content media and

256
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:30,899
subsequently water into container

257
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:33,088
capacity however this one line fits all

258
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:35,700
response was not reciprocated in dry

259
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:37,620
weight where the effects of substrate

260
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,290
depth was not only linear but also

261
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,750
varied by species with arugula having a

262
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:45,829
30% greater response to increases in

263
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:49,049
substrate depth than mizuna or mustard

264
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:51,060
now this was not uncommon though at the

265
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:53,729
lack of collinearity between fresh and

266
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:56,009
dry weight as you will see was also

267
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:58,920
observed in other treatments a trend

268
00:11:56,009 --> 00:12:00,059
that is shared with other a trend that

269
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,409
was shared with other literature

270
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:05,219
regarding the relationships between

271
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:07,319
fresh and dry weight it is work it is

272
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,750
worth however noting that might good for

273
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,670
sales of microgreens fresh weight is the

274
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,860
preferred you'll determine it so as a

275
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:17,189
result greater weight is placed on that

276
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:18,600
parameter now one of the important

277
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,149
observations that was noted in this

278
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,490
experiment was the tendency for either

279
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:25,828
the lowest or substrate or highest

280
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:27,659
substrate depths to exhibit either rapid

281
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:29,399
moisture loss as was the case with the 1

282
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:31,500
point 8 centimeter treatment or

283
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:32,879
excessive water holding capacity as was

284
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,570
the case with the 5 point 8 centimeter

285
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:39,149
treatment this means that growers need

286
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:42,300
to have a stronger grasp on their

287
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:43,889
irrigation scheduling or the if they

288
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:46,259
already utilize either of these two

289
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:53,189
treatment levels to avoid the potential

290
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:55,319
of extensive process now you know in

291
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:58,440
greenhouse operations it is an

292
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,170
undeniable fact that fertilizer cost of

293
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,529
fertilizer regardless of its source the

294
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:07,338
organic or inorganic is a required input

295
00:13:04,528 --> 00:13:11,639
for the successful growth of plants

296
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:13,680
however microgreens load short

297
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,629
production period does allow them to be

298
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:19,569
produced in the absence of supplemental

299
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:21,279
fertilizers unfortunately this

300
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:23,740
trait is often to the detriment of their

301
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,529
production as many growers interpret

302
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:29,019
this is not needing to fertilize even if

303
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:33,039
a fertilizer sources on hand in the same

304
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:35,409
greenhouse for other crops for this

305
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:37,500
experiment I wanted to look at the

306
00:13:35,409 --> 00:13:40,000
effects of fertilizer concentration

307
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:43,120
using a constant liquid feed of twenty

308
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,629
one two point two twenty one to point to

309
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:50,710
sixteen point six NPK at five nitrogen

310
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:53,470
fertilizer concentrations zero 50 100

311
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,060
150 and 200 milligrams nitrogen per

312
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,379
liter

313
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:58,329
now this experiment was designed to take

314
00:13:56,379 --> 00:14:00,189
advantage of the constant liquid feed

315
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:02,470
systems that are already in place in

316
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:06,360
most greenhouse operations and will be

317
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:06,360
utilized at each irrigation interval

318
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,230
results were nearly identical to that of

319
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:13,389
the only other publication on micro

320
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:15,340
green nutrition and very similar to that

321
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:18,340
of mature and comparable crops such as

322
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,500
lettuce we're fresh way increased in a

323
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,990
quadratic fashion as fertilizer

324
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:26,200
concentration increased from zero to 200

325
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:28,330
milligrams nitrogen per liter with

326
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,750
reduced gains in fresh weight above 100

327
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:33,700
to 150 milligrams nitrogen per liter now

328
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,399
this response also varied by species

329
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,910
with arugula where arugula had a more

330
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:43,649
strong stronger response to changes in

331
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:45,569
fertilizer concentration unfortunately

332
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:48,610
concentrates the moods in our mustard

333
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:50,620
unfortunately many operations only have

334
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,480
one or two proportioning fertilizer

335
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,490
proportioning units so it may be

336
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:59,170
necessary to standardize with a single

337
00:14:54,490 --> 00:15:01,330
fertilizer concentration now dry weight

338
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:03,909
also exhibited the same species

339
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:05,920
variation however under the influence of

340
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:09,839
a positive linear model instead of a

341
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:12,699
quadratic one you can see in the images

342
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,639
that the drastic difference is between

343
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:18,129
zero and two hundred milligram nitrogen

344
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:19,539
per nitrogen per liter treatment where

345
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:21,789
these zero milligram treatment has

346
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:23,949
substantially less gross than a 200

347
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:26,620
milligram treatment which in the case of

348
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:28,450
arugula produced an almost undesirable

349
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:31,060
proliferation of growth at the highest

350
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,890
treatment level which could intrude on

351
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:35,339
surrounding cells making harvest more

352
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:35,340
difficult

353
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,379
now depending on how we define protected

354
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:44,389
cultivation the large variety of

355
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:46,639
structures utilized to provide this

356
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:49,938
function vary considerably in their

357
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,409
insulating properties for small growers

358
00:15:49,938 --> 00:15:54,438
with seasonal more seasonal type

359
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:56,448
structures increased heating costs can

360
00:15:54,438 --> 00:16:00,679
influence them to change their heating

361
00:15:56,448 --> 00:16:02,479
point thresholds reducing them now which

362
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:04,929
can have a significant effect on crop

363
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:09,019
development rate amongst other factors

364
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:11,208
with microgreens brought timing is

365
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:13,100
crucial to sales as development rates

366
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:16,039
are rapidly changing during this

367
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,509
exponential growth phase with most

368
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:20,000
growers selling direct to the consumer

369
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:22,818
through farmers markets or restaurant

370
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,100
contracts consistency in quality and

371
00:16:22,818 --> 00:16:28,068
delivery times is fundamental to the

372
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:30,050
success of the operation with this in

373
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:33,349
mind I investigated four different

374
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:37,969
temperature treatments and the effects

375
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:41,839
of days to harvest of microgreens 14 16

376
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:44,569
20 and 22 degrees C word were chosen as

377
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,519
24 hour growing temperatures where

378
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:48,528
plants were started at germination and

379
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:52,480
grown through to harvest at each of the

380
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:55,250
levels what we found was it as

381
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,129
temperatures increased from 14 to 22

382
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,708
degrees C days to harvest decreased in a

383
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:03,500
linear fashion hastening production time

384
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:06,769
by seven days for arugula six days for

385
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,808
mizuna and eight days for mustard now

386
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:10,970
being able to produce a crop six to

387
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:13,939
eight days faster is huge if you're

388
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:15,980
supplying a customer additionally it

389
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:17,779
allows you to get in more crop cycles

390
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,140
per year which could mean greater

391
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:23,119
profits another aspect of temperature

392
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,509
control is that regardless of your

393
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:28,519
setpoint having a consistent temperature

394
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:31,788
allow us for greater control of crop

395
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:34,190
timing which permits a consistent which

396
00:17:31,788 --> 00:17:37,788
allows helps with producing a consistent

397
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:39,679
crop any day of the year now the image

398
00:17:37,788 --> 00:17:41,750
on the bottom left is very telling

399
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:45,980
because it shows crop development rates

400
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:47,298
for the 14 16 and 20 degree C treatments

401
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:52,489
when the 22 degree

402
00:17:47,298 --> 00:17:54,970
see treatment was ready for harvest now

403
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:57,169
even though this work I investigated

404
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:59,360
establishes responses for the various

405
00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:01,610
parameters explored in this research I

406
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:04,729
did not conduct a full factorial

407
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:06,979
experiment because of this it is unknown

408
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:09,440
whether interactions between parameters

409
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:12,558
could have a substantial influence on

410
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,200
the effects on their effects but

411
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:17,298
regardless of this fact these results

412
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,669
may possess value to growers who wish to

413
00:18:17,298 --> 00:18:23,148
incorporate these responses into their

414
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:25,669
production protocols for this purpose we

415
00:18:23,148 --> 00:18:28,008
can summarize results individually

416
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:30,440
optimized results but the expectation

417
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:34,608
that interactions would not drastically

418
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:37,460
change the responses based on based on

419
00:18:34,608 --> 00:18:40,038
my findings initial parameters may be to

420
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:41,769
sow seed at a rate of 2.75 seeds per

421
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:45,349
square centimeter of growing area

422
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:47,079
broadcasted over a peat light mix at a

423
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:49,548
height of four point three centimeters

424
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:52,689
growers could then fertilize at a rate

425
00:18:49,548 --> 00:18:54,858
of 150 milligrams of nitrogen and

426
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:58,609
subsequently grow the crop out in a

427
00:18:54,858 --> 00:19:03,829
greenhouse at a 24-hour temperature of

428
00:18:58,608 --> 00:19:06,589
22 degrees C now of course these values

429
00:19:03,829 --> 00:19:08,509
are not set in stone most growers do not

430
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:12,259
have the luxury of optimizing their

431
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:13,970
growing environment for these crops but

432
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:16,669
net but that is perfectly all right

433
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,989
because using the regression model we

434
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:20,359
are able to make predictions about

435
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:23,149
values that were not explicitly trialed

436
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:25,668
in this research so long as the growers

437
00:19:23,148 --> 00:19:27,048
obtainable values all within the range

438
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:28,940
of treatments explored in each

439
00:19:27,048 --> 00:19:37,480
experiment it can have a very good idea

440
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:37,480
of the results that they may obtain so

441
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:42,690
now that I established a small handful

442
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:45,100
of cultural practices that resulted in

443
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,809
marketable and consistent growth I

444
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:49,269
wanted to look at others and other

445
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:52,899
factors too that resulted in increased

446
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:55,539
growth rates now all of you sitting here

447
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,009
today are probably quite familiar with

448
00:19:55,539 --> 00:20:00,639
the type of climate we have here in

449
00:19:57,009 --> 00:20:02,619
Africa New York the days are the weather

450
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,410
is often gloomy and in the winter months

451
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:09,250
things are quite short resulting in less

452
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:10,150
total accumulated light per day now to

453
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,400
the human eye

454
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:16,030
uses this is more than enough light to

455
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:20,140
see but for plants these are very low

456
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:22,119
daily accumulations in fact most species

457
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,400
in this region during this period are

458
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:27,369
not actively photosynthesizing and are

459
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,040
in a state of dormancy but that is what

460
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:33,459
a greenhouse permits us the ability to

461
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:36,309
continue producing crops year-round but

462
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,930
therein lies the problem even though we

463
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:40,629
are able to protect these crops from the

464
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:42,940
environment the low levels of light

465
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:45,910
during this period are often a limiting

466
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:49,509
factor in plant growth because of this

467
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:52,450
some growers opt to utilize supplemental

468
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:53,859
lighting to increase their average daily

469
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:58,059
photosynthetically active radiation

470
00:20:53,859 --> 00:21:02,259
levels for example in the graph on this

471
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:04,950
page we have the average daily number of

472
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:07,390
moles per square meter on the y axis

473
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:10,480
moles of light per square meter on the y

474
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:12,850
axis and days of the year and Julian

475
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,269
days on the x axis plotted over the

476
00:21:12,849 --> 00:21:18,819
course of 13 years what you can see is

477
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:22,779
that although total daily accumulations

478
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:24,609
are higher during the summer the total

479
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:27,009
accumulations light during or higher

480
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:29,309
during the summer months the total

481
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:32,589
variability across the year is very high

482
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:34,659
so on a summer on a nice summer day we

483
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:37,089
can get as high as 65 moles per square

484
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:40,630
meter but we can also get as low as

485
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:42,899
around 5 moles now during the winter

486
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:46,300
these values are much lower as a whole

487
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:48,519
so on a nice day in winter we can only

488
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:50,889
get about 15 moles per square meter

489
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:53,920
but on a very cloudy day

490
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:54,850
get less than one bowl to put this into

491
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,100
perspective

492
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:59,859
a crop like lettuce produces maximum

493
00:21:57,099 --> 00:22:03,189
growth at around 17 moles per square

494
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:06,309
meter per day for microgreens the

495
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:08,769
tolerance to low light is very high but

496
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:11,619
they also respond positively to

497
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:14,410
increased levels of light to about 18

498
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:16,979
moles per square meter so the issue

499
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:20,290
arises that when you wish to produce

500
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,059
maximum growth on days when your natural

501
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:25,420
light is less than one eighteenth of its

502
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:29,019
neck its potential the vast majority of

503
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:30,610
your vast majority of your growth is

504
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:31,170
coming at the expense of electrical

505
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:35,259
energy

506
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:37,630
now no matter how you work this the use

507
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:40,269
of electricity the power electric lights

508
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:44,290
to feed growth is an expensive

509
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:47,170
investment so what we did was we looked

510
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:51,460
at take the total daily accumulated

511
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:53,740
light levels at four levels of 3 6 9 and

512
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:56,470
12 moles per square meter per day and

513
00:22:53,740 --> 00:23:00,069
under a full factorial experiment cross

514
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:03,880
those with 4 co2 concentrations of 400

515
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:07,059
600 800 and 1000 parts per million to

516
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:10,510
see if light and co2 had any impact on

517
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:12,669
yields morphology days to harvest and

518
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:17,410
secondary metabolite content of these

519
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:20,110
microgreens now the first response we

520
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:23,140
looked at was fresh wait as it turns out

521
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:25,089
the effects of increasing DLI from 3 to

522
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:28,870
12 moles per square meter per day with

523
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:30,699
species dependent where mizuna and

524
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:33,369
mustard increased in a linear fashion

525
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:40,680
while arugula increased in a quadratic

526
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:43,750
fashion the important note compared in

527
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:46,360
addition fresh wait for arugula was also

528
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:48,730
more responsive to changes in DOI

529
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:51,219
between 3 and 9 moles per square meter

530
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:52,930
per day compared to mizuna and mustard

531
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:56,049
which were not significantly different

532
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:58,390
from each other now the importance of

533
00:23:56,049 --> 00:24:01,869
co2 in plant growth cannot be

534
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:04,890
understated sequestering of carbon from

535
00:24:01,869 --> 00:24:04,889
atmospheric carbon dioxide

536
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:12,278
can significantly influence yields and

537
00:24:08,618 --> 00:24:13,718
in some cases act as a buffer against to

538
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:16,778
augment against lower daily

539
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:19,330
accumulations of light what is most

540
00:24:16,778 --> 00:24:22,088
important is that under the correct

541
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:25,208
conditions co2 can be a far more

542
00:24:22,088 --> 00:24:27,608
economical means of increasing yields in

543
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:31,570
compared as compared to electricity for

544
00:24:27,608 --> 00:24:33,878
supplemental lighting for microgreens he

545
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:37,298
effects the effects of increasing co2

546
00:24:33,878 --> 00:24:39,488
from 400 to 1,000 parts per million was

547
00:24:37,298 --> 00:24:42,158
linear for all three species with no

548
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:44,319
significant difference between them it

549
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,690
was also observed was that at lower

550
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:49,598
levels of light for example 6 moles

551
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:52,269
compared to 9 moles a higher C or an

552
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:55,178
elevated co2 concentration of 1000 parts

553
00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:57,578
per million resulted in equivalent or

554
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:59,859
greater growth than the luck the higher

555
00:24:57,578 --> 00:25:02,048
light treatment at an ambient co2

556
00:24:59,858 --> 00:25:08,468
concentration of 400 parts per million

557
00:25:02,048 --> 00:25:11,259
for dry weight the response of all three

558
00:25:08,469 --> 00:25:13,929
species was linear as DLI and co2

559
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:16,569
increased from 3 to 12 moles per square

560
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:19,719
meter per day and 400 to 1,000 parts per

561
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:22,509
million much like fresh weight but to a

562
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:25,419
lesser degree co2 at 1,000 parts per

563
00:25:22,509 --> 00:25:27,808
million could a cos could be utilized to

564
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:31,119
counteract reductions of three moles at

565
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:33,969
400 parts per million now the image in

566
00:25:31,118 --> 00:25:35,978
this slide shows arugula as two

567
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:38,769
different image angles for the top two

568
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:41,109
images were taken at 3 moles while the

569
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:43,778
bottom two were taken at 12 moles the

570
00:25:41,108 --> 00:25:50,769
co2 concentrations of 400 to 1000

571
00:25:43,778 --> 00:25:52,538
ordered left to right now while co2 has

572
00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:55,058
shown that it could have a significantly

573
00:25:52,538 --> 00:25:57,729
positive impact on both fresh and dry

574
00:25:55,058 --> 00:25:59,918
weights it did not appear to have an

575
00:25:57,729 --> 00:26:03,700
effect on days the harvest of either

576
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,709
mizuna arugula or mustard four days of

577
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:08,798
the harvest the only parameter that had

578
00:26:05,709 --> 00:26:11,019
a significant effect was daily like

579
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:13,960
integral which responded in a negative

580
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:16,328
quadratic fashion for Aruba for mizuna

581
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,410
and mustard in a negative linear fashion

582
00:26:16,328 --> 00:26:21,309
for arugula

583
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:24,460
as do I increase from 3 to 12 moles per

584
00:26:21,309 --> 00:26:27,609
square meter per day now this is really

585
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:29,710
quite interesting because it provides it

586
00:26:27,609 --> 00:26:32,949
adds a level of complexity where the

587
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:35,350
grower could then decide whether yields

588
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:38,170
increase yields or the rate of turnover

589
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:41,289
is more important in their operation for

590
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:43,000
example if a grower has a contract where

591
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:44,950
they are required to produce trays that

592
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,589
fall within a designated fresh wait

593
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:48,880
range then it may make more sense for

594
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:52,779
them to increase their daily light

595
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:55,330
integral to hasten production rather

596
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:59,289
than increasing co2 to simply increase

597
00:26:55,329 --> 00:27:01,210
growth this would allow the grower to

598
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:03,700
meet their designated fresh wait range

599
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:06,850
whilst while producing a crop more

600
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,170
quickly which could mean and get paid

601
00:27:06,849 --> 00:27:12,819
more based on a higher volume of

602
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:14,050
production now the last response I'm

603
00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:17,349
going to talk about with the production

604
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:19,059
of total phenols now if you novel

605
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:20,319
compounds have been overwhelmingly

606
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:22,529
praised for the health-promoting

607
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:27,099
benefits stay in part on the human body

608
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:30,039
when ingested this is because in plant

609
00:27:27,099 --> 00:27:32,230
derived food products in all it

610
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:34,569
compounds constitute the majority of

611
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:36,460
antioxidants which have been linked to

612
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:39,159
reductions in various chronic diseases

613
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:42,819
such as cancers and cardiovascular

614
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:44,740
diseases now the results that I obtained

615
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:46,629
were quite interesting because they

616
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,430
appear did it support this populist

617
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:49,840
ideas that microgreens are more

618
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:53,470
nutritious than their mature

619
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:55,419
counterparts for all three species total

620
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,460
phenolic content represented in

621
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,320
milligrams of Gallic acid equivalents

622
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:02,049
per 100 grams of fresh weight

623
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:05,319
tissue increased in a linear fashion as

624
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:08,169
DLI increased from 3 to 12 moles per

625
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:10,119
square meter per day in addition there

626
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:12,940
was a significant interaction between D

627
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:15,429
Li and Co to wear the effects of D Li

628
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:18,549
increase of co2 concentrations increase

629
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:20,500
from 400 to 1,000 parts per million but

630
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:24,299
co2 on its own did not have a

631
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,299
significant effect on total phenolics

632
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:33,908
among the three species arugula arugula

633
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:37,509
exhibited the greatest total phenolic

634
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:40,929
content but was the least responsive to

635
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:42,490
changes in DL I although my results

636
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:44,710
showed for example that arugula had

637
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:48,308
about the same total phenolic content as

638
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:50,130
its matured counterparts at 105

639
00:28:48,308 --> 00:28:52,869
milligrams

640
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:55,000
milligrams this was obtained at just 12

641
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:56,139
moles per square meter per day and one

642
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,548
thousand parts per million

643
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:02,380
in contrast mature arugula with roughly

644
00:29:00,548 --> 00:29:04,418
the same total phenolic content and

645
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:06,429
supporting literature was grown at a

646
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:08,380
deal I have over 20 moles per square

647
00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:11,798
meter per day at ambient co2

648
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:14,289
concentrations although this model does

649
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:17,019
not permit an extrapolation to values as

650
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:18,730
high as 20 moles other supporting

651
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:21,429
literature on the response of micro

652
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:25,778
green phenol content to changes in DL I

653
00:29:21,429 --> 00:29:29,259
have shown responses or increases as

654
00:29:25,778 --> 00:29:32,200
high as 30 moles while still seeing a

655
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:34,538
positive response the issue however is

656
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,880
the variability in the data or the

657
00:29:34,538 --> 00:29:38,558
variability in the literature we're

658
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,440
total phenolic content for the same

659
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:45,158
species vary widely by publication and

660
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:47,100
method of analysis because of this it is

661
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:50,169
hard to draw a definitive conclusion

662
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:52,839
about the benefits of microgreens over

663
00:29:50,169 --> 00:29:55,419
their mature counterparts but we can say

664
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:58,298
if the growers can expect their micro

665
00:29:55,419 --> 00:30:00,788
green arugula mizuna and mustard to have

666
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:03,398
greater total phenolic content if grown

667
00:30:00,788 --> 00:30:08,769
under a DLI of 12 moles in the paracin

668
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:11,259
2/3 one of the most interesting

669
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:13,148
conclusions that was made that came out

670
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:14,940
of this research with the very

671
00:30:13,148 --> 00:30:17,379
consistent tendency for there to be no

672
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,298
significant no statistically significant

673
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:23,140
difference between the responses of

674
00:30:19,298 --> 00:30:25,389
mizuna and mustard while both were

675
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:28,120
consistently and significantly different

676
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:30,009
from arugula this could be due to the

677
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:32,229
fact that mizuna and mustard although

678
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:34,288
different species are of the same genus

679
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:36,610
different from that of arugula

680
00:30:34,288 --> 00:30:38,349
at least within the scope of this

681
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:40,538
research it may be

682
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:42,668
possible to treat mizuna and mustard as

683
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:46,629
the same crop while separately

684
00:30:42,669 --> 00:30:49,240
optimizing parameters for Aruba now one

685
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:53,380
of the more recent trends in agriculture

686
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:55,179
is is the production of crops indoors

687
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,309
such as in vertical production

688
00:30:55,179 --> 00:31:00,429
greenhouses or warehouse type plant

689
00:30:57,308 --> 00:31:03,190
factories well I don't want to dive too

690
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:06,250
deep into this microgreens low light

691
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:09,610
requirements and significant significant

692
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:13,630
responses to be increases in co2 could

693
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:16,058
make it a potentially a potential crop

694
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:18,960
for indoor production environments such

695
00:31:16,058 --> 00:31:22,750
as in Seoul source lighting facilities

696
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:25,240
which in the case which is inferior to a

697
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:27,900
traditional greenhouse within the

698
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:31,599
continental US from an energy standpoint

699
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:34,630
now you could ask is this crop just a

700
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:37,990
fad and is it going to go away when the

701
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:42,070
market becomes saturated it's tough to

702
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:45,579
say but with increasing with the first

703
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:47,349
publication conducted in 2004 this crop

704
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:49,990
has only been increasing in popularity

705
00:31:47,349 --> 00:31:51,959
with new publications being added on

706
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:54,880
what seems like a bi-monthly basis

707
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:59,950
because of this I'm inclined to say that

708
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:02,470
they are here to stay with that I would

709
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:05,860
like to thank you for coming I really

710
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:09,880
appreciate you you know showed up for my

711
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:10,808
work and I would like to ask if any of

712
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:22,630
you have any questions at this time

713
00:32:10,808 --> 00:32:25,750
thank you very much yes my first

714
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:28,480
question is twofold what my first one is

715
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:31,779
I got really interesting at the phenolic

716
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,538
content what is greatest in roulette and

717
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:36,190
you mentioned that if you increase

718
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:38,919
temperature if you get them to grow

719
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:41,350
faster by almost seven days do you

720
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:45,370
expect at all a contract to decrease or

721
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:49,058
that decrease under what light treatment

722
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:51,659
so under a decrease if you if it grows

723
00:32:49,058 --> 00:32:54,389
faster like if you want

724
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:56,340
the temperature and Tory faster would

725
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:58,320
you expect there to be any different

726
00:32:56,339 --> 00:33:01,769
well the feel like content was a

727
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:04,740
response to a stress factor so as the

728
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:07,230
crop it gets more light and more photons

729
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:09,589
of light than it produces more of these

730
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:11,579
secondary metabolites as a response

731
00:33:09,589 --> 00:33:13,769
increasing temperatures and growing

732
00:33:11,579 --> 00:33:17,220
faster I would probably say it wouldn't

733
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:20,569
have an effect on the total amount of

734
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:23,430
phenol accumulation in the light and co2

735
00:33:20,569 --> 00:33:27,509
research those were grown at 24 degrees

736
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:29,880
C day/night temperatures so having a

737
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:31,920
colder temperature I would say it

738
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:42,720
probably wouldn't affect it but I didn't

739
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:44,960
test that so okay question oh so I know

740
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,509
you said that the literature is sort of

741
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,440
conclusive and it's hard to test the

742
00:33:48,509 --> 00:33:51,450
phenolic content

743
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,690
pitcher plants would have you taken the

744
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:55,890
mic like the arugula microwave and

745
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:59,580
allowed it to grow immature and then

746
00:33:55,890 --> 00:34:01,410
turn focusing on content nope so in

747
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:04,649
literature that's one thing that is

748
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:06,720
lacking so people have a lot of the work

749
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:09,510
that initially came out in terms of the

750
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,610
assessment of the total phenolic content

751
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:13,919
vitamin and carotenoid levels

752
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:16,829
what they did was people purchase these

753
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:19,019
micro greens from you know consumers and

754
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:22,619
then tested these levels against

755
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:25,289
purchased mature equivalent crops so on

756
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:27,599
that basis you don't have an idea of

757
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:31,679
what the total DLI levels temperatures

758
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,599
co2 humidity all those factors were

759
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,429
unknowns

760
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:37,199
nobody to my knowledge has actually

761
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:39,059
grown them side by side under the same

762
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:42,509
conditions under controlled conditions

763
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:44,039
and then measured those values that

764
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:53,149
would be the next work that could be

765
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:59,909
done treat it with the air temperature

766
00:34:53,148 --> 00:35:01,509
did you see any negative impacts on crop

767
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:05,889
quality over time

768
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:12,340
temperatures near expose to like any

769
00:35:05,889 --> 00:35:15,129
through the Kernighan sister know so so

770
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:17,800
which is eric is talking about is in

771
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:20,530
lettuce we say that seventeen moles was

772
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:23,200
kind of this target point for production

773
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:25,750
because if you go over that you start

774
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:27,699
resulting in tip burn which is related

775
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:30,099
to calcium and calcium uptake and

776
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:33,039
transpiration rates so there's ways to

777
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:34,839
combat that with movement of air around

778
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:37,119
the head of the lettuce but in

779
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:39,250
microgreens and even in my knowledge

780
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,170
when the crops are various small with

781
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,909
lettuce crops you don't see that tip

782
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:46,900
burn when you really promote those high

783
00:35:42,909 --> 00:35:49,539
levels of light so unfortunately what we

784
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:51,660
didn't go any higher than twelve and

785
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:53,590
when in most of the greenhouse

786
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:56,469
situations as i was showing you in

787
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:59,140
Ithaca the variability in light levels

788
00:35:56,469 --> 00:36:01,689
is so high that there weren't that many

789
00:35:59,139 --> 00:36:03,400
days where we're growing where the light

790
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:05,260
inside the greenhouse which is lower

791
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,410
than light that's outside anyways due to

792
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:11,680
losses that those were high enough to

793
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:14,699
impart any sort of different effects so

794
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:17,829
in short we didn't see any in terms of

795
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:19,989
reduced quality effects at the highest

796
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:23,500
temperature of twenty-two degrees C I

797
00:36:19,989 --> 00:36:25,959
did tend to see more disease development

798
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:30,039
at that temperature that could be more

799
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:31,358
due to just there being depending on

800
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:35,920
which greenhouse you're in there are

801
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:38,559
variations other crops but you know with

802
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,139
the chamber work that we did which was

803
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:44,170
at twenty twenty four degrees or twenty

804
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:47,618
three degrees C actually there was no we

805
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:49,690
had no disease development so but that

806
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:51,010
was a much a sterile and by are not

807
00:36:49,690 --> 00:37:00,250
terrible to clean our environment to

808
00:36:51,010 --> 00:37:03,550
start with it depends on which treatment

809
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:06,789
so because I should go back to this

810
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:07,810
actually so these this is an image and

811
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:09,759
this is actually what I talked about

812
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:12,940
when I reference the limitations and

813
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,220
experimental design for the hardware

814
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,769
standpoint we had the three species

815
00:37:15,219 --> 00:37:20,669
option there each chamber would have a

816
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:24,219
different air flow rate depending on co2

817
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:28,030
concentration so the purpose of the

818
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:32,309
algorithms that run with you know when

819
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:35,830
to start dosing that's dependent on the

820
00:37:32,309 --> 00:37:39,369
levels of co2 and inside these units

821
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:42,340
appear on this little math there's a fan

822
00:37:39,369 --> 00:37:45,640
here that distributes the air around

823
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:48,430
intends to has a variable fan rate that

824
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:52,239
moves more quickly when there's higher

825
00:37:48,429 --> 00:37:55,059
co2 levels going in so that is a factor

826
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:56,679
that's a you know level of variability

827
00:37:55,059 --> 00:38:05,679
that's in the data that's unaccounted

828
00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:07,598
for when you're talking about the

829
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:09,429
cultural practices you kind of end of it

830
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,590
saying that a lot of growers don't have

831
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:18,809
the luxury of making sure all of them

832
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:20,800
are standardized yep so if you have a

833
00:38:18,809 --> 00:38:23,049
starting out and trying to grow

834
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,880
microgreens looks like one of the

835
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:27,519
factors it would be like maybe you

836
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:31,390
should invest sometimes money and under

837
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:32,889
this standardized the most important one

838
00:38:31,389 --> 00:38:35,079
that I would say that they need to

839
00:38:32,889 --> 00:38:37,509
standardize is their temperature that

840
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:40,179
would be simply the most important from

841
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:43,180
a quality standpoint from reproduce

842
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:45,009
reproducibility standpoint which would

843
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:48,579
always go obviously back to the type of

844
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:51,310
structure they're getting whether it's a

845
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:53,799
single layer poly house they use more

846
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:55,900
for seasonal extension or if it's a

847
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,780
double layer poly with insulated air

848
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:01,599
barrier or if it does something a higher

849
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,099
quality single layer glass they need to

850
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,588
establish those temperature controls

851
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:07,750
before anything else the next most

852
00:39:05,588 --> 00:39:12,519
important I would say would be seed

853
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:15,000
density simply because when growers you

854
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:17,019
know you I didn't give exact recommended

855
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,929
specifications on the variability by

856
00:39:17,019 --> 00:39:21,780
companies but there are companies out

857
00:39:19,929 --> 00:39:23,980
there and I lift this in my thesis

858
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:26,500
Johnny C is probably the largest

859
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:28,679
supplier of these crops there are a lot

860
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:32,760
of other newcomers

861
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:35,848
I want to say it's Mountain mist company

862
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:38,670
but they recommend what they say is one

863
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:44,400
ounce of seed per 10 inch by 20 inch

864
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:46,559
tray and that it's just unreasonable to

865
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,829
utilize that much seed for that small of

866
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:51,450
an area so that is something that

867
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:53,250
growers need to be aware of is to not

868
00:39:51,449 --> 00:39:55,289
necessarily always follow those

869
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:56,670
recommendations that are given on the

870
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:58,619
back of the bag because I stated you

871
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:01,980
know there regardless of what you buy if

872
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:04,890
you buy beet seed which you can fit you

873
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:07,409
know five to seven different root seven

874
00:40:04,889 --> 00:40:09,420
arugula seeds within it that volume of a

875
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:15,719
beet seed they have the same exact

876
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:17,329
seeding rate so actually kind of

877
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:20,689
question over here first you're asking

878
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:24,269
yes my question so you mentioned that

879
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:26,608
through your graph that Google a-- the

880
00:40:24,269 --> 00:40:30,929
optimal fertilization concentration from

881
00:40:26,608 --> 00:40:33,808
200 milligrams the optimal so for from

882
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:38,098
the statistical model the optimal is 200

883
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:41,940
so we'll go back to that my question

884
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:43,680
could be made a recommendation right so

885
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,579
it seems like the optimal concentration

886
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:50,460
of 200 but your recommendation was use

887
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:53,548
150 milligrams yes so the reason for

888
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:56,460
that is this picture here and picture a

889
00:40:53,548 --> 00:40:59,639
this is arugula and so what happens is

890
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:01,199
these cells there's 24 of these cells in

891
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:04,318
an individual trade and you don't have

892
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:06,149
to grow it like this this is how I grew

893
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:08,909
it simply to have replicates per tray

894
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:10,798
some most growers just simply fill up a

895
00:41:08,909 --> 00:41:12,420
shallow tray with substrate to a certain

896
00:41:10,798 --> 00:41:14,280
height broadcast the seed over the

897
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:16,559
entire thing and then harvest it as a

898
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,660
whole but there's also a lot of

899
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:20,460
producers that grow it in these type of

900
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:23,759
situations where they have a tray with

901
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:26,280
24 cells inside that tray and then they

902
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,690
sell those individual cells individually

903
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,849
over the internet and they ship them out

904
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:32,130
they take them to farmers markets so

905
00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:34,349
what happens is when you promote that

906
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:37,108
much fresh wheat development and that

907
00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:39,059
much mass through fertilizer increases

908
00:41:37,108 --> 00:41:42,569
you start to get this to growth that

909
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:44,130
just becomes completely overwhelming and

910
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:46,800
what it does is that you can see there

911
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:48,900
it folds over and it's not an entirely

912
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,080
at lodging situation because the stems

913
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:54,300
are still intact but they fold over on

914
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,730
the other cells so then when you go in

915
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:59,010
to separate them and all this is done by

916
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:01,679
hands is all hand harvesting going with

917
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:03,930
scissors to separate those cells you all

918
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:06,509
sudden have intertwined stems and leaves

919
00:42:03,929 --> 00:42:08,159
and those leaves are especially at the

920
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:12,720
higher fertilizer concentrations are

921
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:15,929
very soft so yep and so you start to get

922
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:18,959
torn tissue and bruising of the tissue

923
00:42:15,929 --> 00:42:21,629
so when you for example if you harvest a

924
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,670
crop like this at 100 milligrams or 150

925
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:25,829
you don't have as much of that intrusion

926
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:28,200
cell to cell and as such you can

927
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:30,360
separate them much more easily so even

928
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:35,519
though you do get more fresh weight

929
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:37,650
growth and dry weight growth for arugula

930
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:40,440
at that 200 it's not worth that

931
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:42,960
trade-off of losing that particular that

932
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:46,829
amount and one of the interesting things

933
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,389
is is part of this reduction it may not

934
00:42:46,829 --> 00:42:51,029
have been completely quadratic but

935
00:42:48,389 --> 00:42:54,150
because there is that reduction in yield

936
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:56,310
by losing product through harvests it

937
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:59,010
could have certainly influenced that

938
00:42:56,309 --> 00:43:00,599
quadratic response but that's not you

939
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:07,350
can't really get away from that unless

940
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:10,589
you produce them themselves separated so

941
00:43:07,349 --> 00:43:13,650
from my personal consumer production

942
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:16,200
standpoint I like to just just the media

943
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:20,220
options but the way my house you suggest

944
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:24,989
that people mix ah and not understand

945
00:43:20,219 --> 00:43:28,319
that for for production productions

946
00:43:24,989 --> 00:43:30,750
systemizing production may keep it but

947
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:35,730
I've seen before has various mats and

948
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:37,829
sheets and fiber based products so do

949
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:40,079
something a little bit about yeah so I

950
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:42,269
move to this picture because this is two

951
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,819
good examples the top image is produced

952
00:43:42,269 --> 00:43:48,719
on a burlap sack what they did was they

953
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:52,230
floated that over an aquaponics pond so

954
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:54,089
they have that essentially on I can't

955
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:56,400
remember the exact mechanism they use to

956
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:58,108
float it but

957
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,740
that's how they did this they seated it

958
00:43:58,108 --> 00:44:03,568
on this burlap sack and this grower here

959
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:05,548
this was a standard you know I think

960
00:44:03,568 --> 00:44:10,469
this was a standard peat light type mix

961
00:44:05,548 --> 00:44:12,179
that they used and you know you can see

962
00:44:10,469 --> 00:44:14,489
and there's been a lot of research

963
00:44:12,179 --> 00:44:16,858
actually different producers looking at

964
00:44:14,489 --> 00:44:19,108
these maps some of the work that's been

965
00:44:16,858 --> 00:44:20,788
done in terms of just simply from a

966
00:44:19,108 --> 00:44:22,498
light you know when they look at

967
00:44:20,789 --> 00:44:25,380
different qualities or quantity of light

968
00:44:22,498 --> 00:44:27,449
they utilize these growing mats instead

969
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:31,170
of peat light mixes there are advantages

970
00:44:27,449 --> 00:44:35,159
and controllability between these

971
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:37,740
because the for the the LM what I use is

972
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:40,469
LM 111 which is a standard you know

973
00:44:37,739 --> 00:44:43,139
typical commercial pipe peat light mix

974
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:44,788
and that does have a starting charge in

975
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:46,828
it so we are aware of what the

976
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:50,130
nutritional content of that is to begin

977
00:44:46,829 --> 00:44:52,559
with versus these mats they come with no

978
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:54,240
no starting charge Muslim are pretty

979
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:57,869
inert they're you know cation exchange

980
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:59,969
capacity is often quite low so it allows

981
00:44:57,869 --> 00:45:01,650
a lot of that individual control if

982
00:44:59,969 --> 00:45:05,189
you're doing like a hydroponic type

983
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:09,269
float environment in terms of yield

984
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:12,150
variation it you know the difference in

985
00:45:09,268 --> 00:45:14,848
the literature depends some some people

986
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:17,759
have seen you know equivalent or greater

987
00:45:14,849 --> 00:45:22,289
growth with these mats and but they

988
00:45:17,759 --> 00:45:25,469
utilize a standard you know pete light

989
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:27,420
mix but they don't you know specify they

990
00:45:25,469 --> 00:45:30,659
don't say how what level they used or

991
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:33,088
the depth and the problem is is the

992
00:45:30,659 --> 00:45:34,440
fiber type Maps not this particularly

993
00:45:33,088 --> 00:45:38,130
but there's other fiber mats that are

994
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,778
wood based pulps that they compress into

995
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:42,690
a mat and you open it up you stick it in

996
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:45,358
the flat it hydrates itself and it rises

997
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:49,170
to about a centimeter tall at full

998
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:53,130
saturation water they yeah they have

999
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:55,499
we've done you know very minor trials

1000
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:59,640
with them not experiencing the best

1001
00:45:55,498 --> 00:46:01,528
results they tend to hold water for you

1002
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:04,469
know excessively long periods of time

1003
00:46:01,528 --> 00:46:06,960
and seedlings in general are very

1004
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:10,049
susceptible to damping off as these

1005
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:15,769
issues so that ended

1006
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:19,140
be an issue we also liked the ability to

1007
00:46:15,769 --> 00:46:21,719
utilize one substrate across just about

1008
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:23,670
all your different crops so it's very

1009
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:26,250
difficult you know if you are ordering

1010
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:27,720
you know materials in your grower you

1011
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:29,969
don't want to be ordering ten different

1012
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:32,039
substrates different types you want to

1013
00:46:29,969 --> 00:46:34,589
have a couple substrates from different

1014
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:36,980
suppliers a little bit of redundancy so

1015
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:40,710
you don't have one supplier goes under

1016
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:42,510
you're not out of luck but yeah it's

1017
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:44,940
it's an easy product to get a hold of

1018
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:46,980
many companies produce and versus those

1019
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:50,480
Maps it's only a small handful and

1020
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:55,260
they're also very expensive substrate

1021
00:46:50,480 --> 00:47:05,309
portray in this case I actually have the

1022
00:46:55,260 --> 00:47:07,260
full numbers here so the total cost per

1023
00:47:05,309 --> 00:47:10,610
square meter of production utilizing

1024
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:15,240
this system for the seed and substrate

1025
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:17,400
is four dollars for arugula five dollars

1026
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:20,789
and 41 cents from mizuna and six dollars

1027
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:25,110
and 47 cents for mustard and that varies

1028
00:47:20,789 --> 00:47:26,400
primarily based on the rate of what seed

1029
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:28,620
is going for at that time because that's

1030
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,360
quick a lot that's pretty variable in

1031
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:32,039
terms of when you check Johnny seed or

1032
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:34,650
other seed companies those prices vary

1033
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:36,960
but when you purchase one of those mats

1034
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:39,119
for example just one tray and you get

1035
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,679
six point six trays per square meter

1036
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:46,549
just one tray the substrate for those

1037
00:47:42,679 --> 00:47:49,889
different Maps is about a dollar sixty

1038
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:51,570
1.60 cents per and they you can't reuse

1039
00:47:49,889 --> 00:47:55,079
them once they're done you throw it away

1040
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:58,860
so there's versus it's about 40 cents or

1041
00:47:55,079 --> 00:48:04,049
so for the substrate portray so I never

1042
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:06,510
had to do this this has been a

1043
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:11,300
production of Cornell University on the

1044
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:11,300
web at Cornell edu
