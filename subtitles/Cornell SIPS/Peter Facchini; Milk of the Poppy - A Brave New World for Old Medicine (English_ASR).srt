1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,850
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:04,849
University

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:11,638
Thank You Gaurav for the introduction

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,980
and for the opportunity to come back to

5
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:17,339
Cornell I was here I guess about twelve

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:22,950
years ago and I had quite an experience

7
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:25,230
as some of you know I went to a frat

8
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:29,579
party I was here as an invited speaker

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:32,099
and we didn't go last night so I'm but

10
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:33,619
they're still tonight not going home

11
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:38,189
until tomorrow morning

12
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:40,349
and what else did I want to say yeah

13
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:43,469
just a couple of things so yeah if you

14
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,210
want to ask questions I think two good

15
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,810
questions maybe that I won't get into

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,820
right now but good questions to ask are

17
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,040
how did you get into this there's always

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:57,420
a story I don't look for trouble but

19
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,280
trouble finds me all the time how did

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,750
you get into this and then secondly you

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,140
know what's it like being an

22
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,290
entrepreneur I will say that I did get

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,450
into science to try to avoid

24
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:12,450
entrepreneurs and and business people

25
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,228
and and especially lawyers but it's not

26
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:18,629
really working out very well and I can

27
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:22,500
tell you all kinds of stories as to why

28
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:24,478
all right so let's say so this is this

29
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,569
actually could have been a picture from

30
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:30,599
our dinner last night kind of but it's

31
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:34,500
actually a painting of Friedrich sare

32
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:38,789
Turner who was a pharmacist's apprentice

33
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:42,090
and back in the early 1800s in 1804 1806

34
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,950
he was the first to isolate a natural

35
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,049
product from a plant and it was morphine

36
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,329
from from opium poppy I'm not sure

37
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,520
exactly what he's doing here it's kind

38
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,579
of a strange way of going drinking with

39
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,530
your buddies and he's definitely caused

40
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,200
some problems for them over here but

41
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,159
we'll get we'll get back to that in just

42
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,509
a moment I'm gonna start with

43
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,920
acknowledgments because I always leave

44
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:07,560
it to the end and then I run out of time

45
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,538
and and I don't feel like I give enough

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,949
credit to the people that are in the lab

47
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:17,339
presently and certainly those that have

48
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:18,869
been in my lab previously I think I

49
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,750
think it sounds like you met at

50
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,810
one of them recently so I'm gonna start

51
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:27,568
with the the company so we have this

52
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:30,090
startup Gaurav was was referring to is

53
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:32,339
called a pin Ron incorporated it's in

54
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,229
the process of expanding and and

55
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,900
hopefully bigger things are happening

56
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:39,359
some very high caliber scientists it's

57
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,730
great working with very senior people

58
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,319
because I just sort of say do this we

59
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:46,199
need to do this and then they go in and

60
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:49,548
they do it I still have a small academic

61
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:53,280
lab with a couple of postdocs in and two

62
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:56,579
to PhD students and then and then some

63
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,199
collaborators and get lots of funding or

64
00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:01,019
over the years lots of funding from

65
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:04,169
especially Canadian government federal

66
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:07,370
sources and more recently having the

67
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:10,378
company has provided a good means of

68
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:13,289
combining sort of industrial

69
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:16,768
applications and translation of research

70
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:19,199
with continued and continued academic

71
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:21,989
quests and and being able to support a

72
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:24,030
lot of those quests so I just wanted to

73
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:26,730
say a little bit more about about the

74
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:30,060
company I I do enjoy being part of you

75
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:33,030
know the entrepreneurial experience so

76
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,400
we started this company in in 2014 and

77
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,590
again you know I think I'd be happy to

78
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,889
share with you experiences as to why I

79
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,299
wasn't quite happy with the trends

80
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:44,129
translational capabilities at the

81
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,650
University of Calgary they mean well but

82
00:03:44,128 --> 00:03:49,108
they don't have the capital to to really

83
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,180
move a lot of these technologies from

84
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:55,049
the state that they're at to something

85
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:57,629
that's going to be of interest to to a

86
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:59,489
bigger multinational especially

87
00:03:57,628 --> 00:04:01,229
pharmaceutical companies out there so we

88
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:04,139
started decided to try to do it

89
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:06,780
ourselves and we currently have eight

90
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:09,030
full-time staff members and our business

91
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,609
model so far has not been so our

92
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:14,519
intention is not actually to produce

93
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:17,879
opiates in yeast fermentation but it's

94
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:20,340
to do this and that's to basically use

95
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:23,038
our knowledge of the system and find the

96
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:26,339
new parts understand the processes and

97
00:04:23,038 --> 00:04:29,819
then move those discoveries and

98
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:32,339
intellectual property to intermediate

99
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:33,099
and and larger partners that are able to

100
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:36,759
take it all

101
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:38,710
to Italy to to market so we we generate

102
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,930
a lot of IP a lot of patents and we

103
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:42,909
license those patents and one of our

104
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:46,060
biggest partners so far has been in

105
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:49,140
treks on which has found a few locations

106
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,879
across the u.s. so we collaborated with

107
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:55,750
one of their their units that's in San

108
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:58,689
Francisco all right so so I'll get get

109
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:01,959
to the star of the show which is opium

110
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:05,009
poppy so opium poppy is a ancient

111
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:08,909
medicinal plant it's being cultivated

112
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:12,039
domesticated by a number of

113
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:14,189
civilizations around the world for about

114
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,470
the last six or seven thousand years and

115
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:18,879
in spite of its age and how long that

116
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,860
we've been connected

117
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,230
we've been connected to it it's still

118
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,990
our only source for all of the compounds

119
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:28,330
that you see on this slide so morphine

120
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,639
and codeine are natural compounds in the

121
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:32,199
plant nos Kapena and papaverine are also

122
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,269
they also have pharmaceutical

123
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:38,409
applications as a cough suppressant

124
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:40,089
papaverine is a vasodilator and nos

125
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,310
caffeine is also being investigated for

126
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:44,319
potential anti-cancer properties it

127
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:47,350
hasn't made it past phase two clinical

128
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,319
trials yet but also very importantly are

129
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:52,510
these semi synthetic compounds oxycodone

130
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,980
hydrocodone and especially these days

131
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:59,289
you hear a lot about naloxone as an

132
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:03,550
antagonist so it's used it's very

133
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:05,680
effective at treating overdose so

134
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,569
there's you can go to pharmacies I don't

135
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,879
know what the situation is like in the

136
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:11,620
US but in in Canada you can go to a

137
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:14,350
pharmacy and they'll give you an A

138
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:17,949
Locke's own kit basically with surrett

139
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:21,610
in it so if somebody's overdosing from

140
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:24,189
fentanyl or whatever on on the you know

141
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:26,650
on the the subway you can have that and

142
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:28,839
and you can save their lives in in many

143
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:30,969
cases by having this available so these

144
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:33,729
compounds are semi synthetic the

145
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:35,110
backbone comes from the plant and I'll

146
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:40,240
tell you more about that shortly but

147
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:41,889
then they are modified through through

148
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,910
some chemical processes to get these

149
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:47,860
additional functional groups on there

150
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:51,070
all right so so again I like to start

151
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,960
with I like to connect with with these

152
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:55,540
plants in the sense of why they're

153
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,069
important to humanity and this is a

154
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:01,900
plant that we've had a long relationship

155
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:03,819
is in with as humans and you can see

156
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:05,909
that evidence in archaeological

157
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:08,860
discoveries especially all through

158
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,660
Europe and and the Middle East so these

159
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,879
are locations where there's been some

160
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,280
sort of opium poppy artifact that often

161
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:18,370
goes back to the Bronze Age you know so

162
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:21,309
it's so three four thousand years BC you

163
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:25,120
find these poppy capsules and in various

164
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:28,060
artifacts this cave of the bats here in

165
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,280
in Spain is one of the prime locations

166
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,199
where you find these these materials and

167
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:35,649
I was talking last night about how

168
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:40,629
interested I am one day when I'm you

169
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:42,609
know wealthy enough not now but to to

170
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:45,100
get my hands on some of this material

171
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,050
and and do some ancient DNA sequencing

172
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,780
and see what those see what those poppy

173
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,790
varieties were like and try to trace you

174
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:54,339
know how did this plant get around how

175
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:56,590
did how did people move it around and

176
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:58,989
connect that anthropologically with with

177
00:07:56,589 --> 00:08:03,639
the history with our history as you know

178
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:05,889
as as humans ancient empires are all

179
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:07,899
connected with with opium poppies so

180
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:10,029
there's a bunch of them listed here and

181
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:13,418
you can see it again in archaeological

182
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:16,989
artifacts so opium poppy on these Roman

183
00:08:13,418 --> 00:08:20,680
coins or Greek coins this is a accretion

184
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:23,800
poppy goddess you know and you often see

185
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,918
again on these reliefs the depictions of

186
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,290
opium poppy being associated with

187
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:31,269
ancient civilizations what's interesting

188
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:34,300
is that in Europe even though opium

189
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:37,329
poppy goes back many thousands of years

190
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:39,788
the knowledge of the plant and the

191
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:42,969
medicinal compounds in Europe at least

192
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:45,039
was lost from about the fall of the

193
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:47,740
Roman Empire until the Renaissance

194
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:50,069
so nobody nobody used it or had it

195
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:53,560
anymore in Europe it was brought back

196
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:56,290
knowledge was actually maintained in in

197
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:59,409
other parts of the world so in the Arab

198
00:08:56,289 --> 00:09:01,299
world or in in Persia

199
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:03,899
and brought back to Europe and was

200
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:07,568
brought back by this fellow over here

201
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:10,089
and his name is Paracelsus so Paracelsus

202
00:09:07,568 --> 00:09:13,299
was an interesting person a Renaissance

203
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:15,519
botanist Alchemist physician astrologer

204
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:18,219
and a cultist I'd like to put that on my

205
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,318
business card and you know an

206
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,870
interesting job description so he was

207
00:09:20,318 --> 00:09:25,599
traveling in Arabia and he brought back

208
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:28,750
a sword if it's on a magic card or

209
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,240
whatever you know it's important so you

210
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:34,480
know he brought back a sword and in the

211
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:37,568
in the hilt of the sword there was there

212
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,220
were these crystals that were that he

213
00:09:37,568 --> 00:09:41,828
called the stones of immortality so it

214
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:44,290
was opium citrus system citrus juice and

215
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:46,179
gold's basically mixed together in some

216
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:49,528
nuggets and you know from that point it

217
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:52,120
became again part of sort of European

218
00:09:49,528 --> 00:09:53,799
medical culture in during the

219
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,100
Renaissance and things really got

220
00:09:53,799 --> 00:10:00,008
interesting in the 1800s so so in the

221
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:03,040
1800s opium started to be used much more

222
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:05,470
extensively it's actually a very

223
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:09,938
dangerous time apparently to be a child

224
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:12,129
during during that but that part of time

225
00:10:09,938 --> 00:10:14,528
in history so you can see that from some

226
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:18,639
of these ads over here mrs. Winslow's

227
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:23,169
soothing syrup for children teething you

228
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:26,350
know cough killer it works like magic so

229
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:29,379
as someone that has had children I think

230
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:30,879
those of you that also do would probably

231
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:34,318
agree with me that it's unfortunate that

232
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:36,578
these products are no longer available

233
00:10:34,318 --> 00:10:38,409
because I can imagine they were they

234
00:10:36,578 --> 00:10:42,758
were quite effective at kind of keeping

235
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:44,769
kids quiet it was also you know opiates

236
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:47,829
were actually a very big part of the

237
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:49,990
American Civil War so there was an awful

238
00:10:47,828 --> 00:10:54,188
lot of addiction because all soldiers

239
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:56,829
were given as a syringe and an opium for

240
00:10:54,188 --> 00:11:00,219
their their bad of battlefield wounds

241
00:10:56,828 --> 00:11:01,299
and and again it's a-you know I to have

242
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,519
these kind of connections or

243
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:05,409
understanding of a plant that has such

244
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,289
an ancient origin and how it's connected

245
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:11,679
to so much of our history makes you know

246
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:13,039
the trials and tribulations of pipetting

247
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:14,989
in a lab along

248
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,480
more enjoyable when you know that you're

249
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,700
contributing to that to that history so

250
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,850
it continues to be a plant that is a

251
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:25,700
dual use technology so you can use it

252
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:27,440
for both good and and bad purposes but

253
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,200
most of our technologies are like that

254
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,980
right nuclear nuclear power nuclear

255
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:36,170
energy is a good example of that you can

256
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,870
generate electricity or you can do the

257
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:41,240
wrong things with with with that that

258
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:44,360
same technology so so here's the here's

259
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,460
the dark side of opium poppy so if you

260
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,310
forget everything else from this talk

261
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:51,050
you'll remember this and and that's what

262
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:54,049
happens when you take morphine that's

263
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:56,569
extracted from the plant and you mix it

264
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:58,459
together with an acetyl donor so you can

265
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:00,590
buy some acetic anhydride that is

266
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,420
actually quite difficult to buy because

267
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:04,670
you can do this with it you can make

268
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:07,039
morphine to acetate prettily pretty

269
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:09,379
easily and morphine diacetate of course

270
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,730
is heroin and then you can see the

271
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:13,070
difference all that's happening is that

272
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,860
the morphine is being died acetylide at

273
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:17,540
those two hydroxyl functions and it was

274
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,149
back in the early part of the 20th

275
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:22,519
century that that heroin was used

276
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:25,899
extensively as a cost suppressant so

277
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:28,819
there's some ads from some old some old

278
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:31,429
products the problem of cough has been

279
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:33,050
solved by by heroin and certainly it's

280
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:36,109
very effective just like codeine is

281
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:38,899
effective as a cough cough medicine it

282
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:41,029
was believed that this product heroin

283
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:43,549
was non addictive and certainly that

284
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:45,110
wasn't true so within you know some few

285
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:47,569
years of it being put on the market

286
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:49,940
there were half a million opium addict

287
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,760
or heroin addicts in the US and then in

288
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,830
the 1920s he was taken off the market as

289
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:57,830
a cough suppressant but of course it

290
00:12:54,830 --> 00:13:00,680
remains as as a problem in the world and

291
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:03,170
and this kind of demonstrates the the

292
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:06,469
problem the problem is you can make

293
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:08,629
money from from producing heroin so you

294
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,970
can you know you can grow opium poppy in

295
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:13,700
Afghanistan and then you can transport

296
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:16,279
the opium to other countries like Turkey

297
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,290
and add value to it with some degree of

298
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:20,990
processing and then by the time you get

299
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:23,750
it to to Europe on the streets as heroin

300
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:27,149
heroin you've added a lot of value to to

301
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:28,289
the product and just gives you some idea

302
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:31,350
you know where the problems are

303
00:13:28,289 --> 00:13:33,539
particularly bad um in in Europe in

304
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,970
Russia and other parts parts of the

305
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:38,578
world not not really so much in North

306
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:40,769
America in Canada it's Vancouver that

307
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:43,528
has the biggest problem with with

308
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:45,448
opiates and and heroin addiction and

309
00:13:43,528 --> 00:13:47,610
other other places what I hear is

310
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:50,458
Calgary is too cold so nobody wants to

311
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,199
kind of live on the streets in Calgary

312
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:56,338
that's probably a bad idea actually

313
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:57,688
in the winter so this is my map of what

314
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,540
I call the good guys and the bad guys

315
00:13:57,688 --> 00:14:02,309
sort of thing so so the good guys are in

316
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:04,799
green and and it's not really quite

317
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:07,708
accurate but the the problems in the

318
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,568
world are in red the biggest problem of

319
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:12,838
course is Afghanistan for illicit

320
00:14:09,568 --> 00:14:14,669
production of of opium poppy Mexico and

321
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,129
Colombia are counting now for maybe

322
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:19,378
about five percent of the total illicit

323
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:22,259
production the golden triangle over here

324
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:24,930
used to be more of a problem a lot less

325
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:27,028
so recently um but what's interesting is

326
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:29,128
all these countries in green that are

327
00:14:27,028 --> 00:14:31,379
actually illicit producers illicit

328
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:33,899
growers of opium poppy Australia is

329
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:37,409
number one maybe I'm being a little bit

330
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:39,629
unfair to the Australians by suggesting

331
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:41,188
that their entire continent is a haven

332
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:43,110
for growing opium poppy it's actually

333
00:14:41,188 --> 00:14:45,088
restricted just to the island of

334
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:47,730
Tasmania but they account for about 50%

335
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:50,309
of the global licit production right now

336
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,500
but also other countries India Turkey

337
00:14:50,308 --> 00:14:54,659
and even France and in particular in

338
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,850
Europe account for a substantial France

339
00:14:54,659 --> 00:15:00,058
easily ten percent of illicit production

340
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:02,550
and it's done in very modern ways okay

341
00:15:00,058 --> 00:15:05,490
so it's it's here's a poppy field in

342
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:10,049
Tasmania using modern farming equipment

343
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:11,759
the plants have - as required by the

344
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:14,568
United Nations they have to be allowed

345
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:17,159
to dry in the field and then the the

346
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:18,899
harvester comes along basically cuts

347
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:20,938
them off with about ten centimeters of

348
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:23,549
stem and then takes that material

349
00:15:20,938 --> 00:15:26,698
crushes it and extracts the the

350
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:28,679
pharmaceutical products of interest the

351
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:31,258
traditional way of collecting opium

352
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:34,289
poppy of course is to Lance the unripe

353
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:37,289
seed capsules and this latex will exude

354
00:15:34,289 --> 00:15:40,769
and the latex once it dries and oxidizes

355
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:43,259
becomes raw opium so the content

356
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:45,989
of morphine at this stages maybe 1% or

357
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:48,449
under 1% of the of the liquid but when

358
00:15:45,989 --> 00:15:51,089
it oxidizes and dries and because this

359
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:54,178
loaf of raw opium it will rise to about

360
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:56,519
15% of the of the weight all right so

361
00:15:54,178 --> 00:16:01,350
it's a lot easier to ship this material

362
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:03,149
illicitly around as opposed to all of

363
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:06,058
this biomass and that's the reason the

364
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:08,970
UN only allows India in fact to continue

365
00:16:06,058 --> 00:16:11,539
in an illicit manner to do it this way

366
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:14,579
because it's it's considered to be

367
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:16,738
historical or traditional so this guy

368
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:19,469
over here is interesting to me because

369
00:16:16,739 --> 00:16:23,399
he's he's doing his job and you can see

370
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:25,410
without the use of gloves so I'm sure

371
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:28,019
that his job satisfaction rating is

372
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:32,759
higher than mine ever will be that

373
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:34,259
doesn't say much on many days so so

374
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,938
again connecting to the scientific

375
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:38,159
history of everything you're going to

376
00:16:35,938 --> 00:16:39,659
hear today so I think you know I think

377
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,208
one of the things that I try to impress

378
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:44,458
on students is is that you know what we

379
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:47,178
know what's in the textbook or what what

380
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:50,338
you read in the literature and and we

381
00:16:47,178 --> 00:16:52,078
discuss as now the dogma in the field

382
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:54,389
somebody had to get us to that point

383
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:56,789
many people get us to that point and

384
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:59,879
it's a very long and slow process so

385
00:16:56,789 --> 00:17:02,219
this is a timeline of of morphine for

386
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:05,130
morphine 200 years more than 200 years

387
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:07,470
of scientific history from ser Turner

388
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:10,829
and his first isolation of morphine to

389
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:13,679
30 25 years later the isolation of

390
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:17,388
codeine by this this French chemist

391
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:20,399
heroin was first synthesized in 1874 the

392
00:17:17,388 --> 00:17:23,729
structure of morphine was not determined

393
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:26,369
until 1925 you know almost a hundred and

394
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:28,860
25 years later after the compound was

395
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:31,079
isolated the structure was identified

396
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:33,689
and it was it was identified by this

397
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:35,638
fellow here I'm Sir Robert Robertson who

398
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:39,210
was a Nobel Prize winner and also

399
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:41,490
knighted as is his this this fellow is

400
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:44,880
still alive Alan Battersby brought the

401
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:46,500
biochemistry forward they're both both

402
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,659
sirs

403
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,609
even though Canada is still part of the

404
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:53,920
Commonwealth I'm not allowed to become a

405
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:56,949
sir because I'm not a British subject

406
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:59,590
so I didn't put my picture over here I

407
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:04,990
just put a bit of the pathway maybe

408
00:17:59,589 --> 00:18:06,819
later so yeah lots of lots of lots of

409
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,440
interesting and and important

410
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:10,629
discoveries but a very long period of

411
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,490
time and this is the period of time that

412
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:15,880
we're operating in and about the last

413
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:19,930
quarter of a century okay so so I want

414
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:22,180
to show you now how a plant how opium

415
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,830
poppy the only plant that we kicked that

416
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:27,700
can really do it how it can make

417
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:29,379
morphine from tyrosine so this elegance

418
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,350
is really impressive how do you take a

419
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:35,380
simple amino acid two copies of it and

420
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:37,809
and make this molecule that chemists can

421
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:40,000
make but they really can't yet make it

422
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:43,029
at yields that are economically

423
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,250
competitive with using the plant as a

424
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:47,349
source of these compounds so let's let's

425
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:49,420
just start off then with tyrosine and

426
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:51,159
the way I like to show this I don't like

427
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:54,250
to show slides that have lots of

428
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:56,950
structures all over the place I actually

429
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:59,319
came up with this some years ago I was

430
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,539
stuck in the airport in Boston overnight

431
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:04,059
and I didn't know what to do they shut

432
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:06,159
everything down so I basically drew

433
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:08,889
structures what else does a biochemistry

434
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,900
on your board I think this is an

435
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:12,759
effective way of showing it so there's

436
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,700
tyrosine the first thing that happens is

437
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:18,000
it's decarboxylated and then it's three

438
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:21,880
hydroxylated so you end up with dopamine

439
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,819
it's important narrow transmitter in US

440
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,250
but it's also a precursor to morphine

441
00:19:24,819 --> 00:19:29,589
and opium poppy there's another molecule

442
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:32,740
of tyrosine and this time going down

443
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:35,529
this route over here you deaminate it

444
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,750
and then you decarboxylate it and you

445
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:40,269
end up with the second intermediate that

446
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,980
combines with tyrosine with dopamine to

447
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:44,079
make the first so called benzyl

448
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,789
isoquinoline alkaloid and this is four

449
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,069
hydroxy phenyl acetaldehyde

450
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:51,220
okay so there they are again dopamine

451
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:54,250
and four hydroxy phenyl acetaldehyde or

452
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:56,440
four HPA and you get a pictage Spangler

453
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:58,630
condensation reaction catalyzed by this

454
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,950
enzyme there Cochrane synthase and there

455
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,140
you go now you have a benzyl

456
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:04,059
isoquinoline alkaloid it's benzyl

457
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,100
isoquinoline because there's the benzyl

458
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:07,799
and there's the isoquinoline moiety and

459
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:10,889
that's it's as simple as that

460
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:14,009
it doesn't retain that structural form

461
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:16,320
the backbone structure changes and so

462
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:17,879
too does the decoration so any every

463
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,129
time you change the backbone structure

464
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,080
of one of these benzyl isochronal and

465
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,850
alkaloids you have a whole new molecule

466
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,939
that you can decorate with different

467
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:28,740
functionalities and change its the

468
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,549
pharmacological properties biological

469
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,559
properties and so on

470
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:34,649
of the molecule so let's start off with

471
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:37,859
this nor Cochran over here so it's it's

472
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:40,290
6o methylated and then n methylated

473
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:42,119
three prime hydroxyl Aidid and then four

474
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:44,549
prime ho methylated that's these

475
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:46,559
reactions over here and you end up with

476
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:48,750
this key intermediate called

477
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:51,809
s reticulating we were talking this

478
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,819
morning at breakfast about chirality so

479
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:56,460
it's an it's in the S it's the s

480
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:58,319
conformer of reticulan and what's

481
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,140
interesting is that that wasn't good

482
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:04,019
enough apparently for opium poppy it it

483
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:06,870
wouldn't it is unable to drive it

484
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:08,819
forward to morphine as the s conformer

485
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:11,309
it has to change to the our conformer

486
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:15,629
has to change his right hand to its left

487
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:18,929
hand something like maybe the left hand

488
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:19,800
or the right hand and and this is what

489
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,710
happens next

490
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:24,839
okay so so there's um there's s

491
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:28,279
reticulate and how do you how do you

492
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:31,559
change the chirality of a chiral Center

493
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:33,359
you can remove it by oxidizing it and

494
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:35,849
then you can put it back by reducing it

495
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,439
that's just the specificity of these of

496
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:40,230
these two enzymes which interestingly

497
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,420
have fused together into a single enzyme

498
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:45,120
that we call particularly an epimer ace

499
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:48,150
and it simply changes the handedness of

500
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,589
the intermediate so let's look at

501
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:51,330
reticulating that those are actually the

502
00:21:49,589 --> 00:21:53,609
same two compounds over there just

503
00:21:51,329 --> 00:21:55,409
changing the perspective of how we're

504
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:57,240
looking at it it's easier to look at it

505
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:59,880
this way because the next step in the

506
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,500
process is to change the structure the

507
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,540
backbone structure and that's done by

508
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,940
this enzyme here salutary teen synthase

509
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:08,759
there's salutary teen a carbon-carbon

510
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:11,279
coupling and you have now a four

511
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:15,990
membered ring and you can start to

512
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:18,869
decorate it again so it's it is reduced

513
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:21,299
to from the keto to the to the alcohol

514
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:23,699
and then the the

515
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:27,059
the hydroxyl group is Isetta lated and

516
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:29,940
then that allylic group falls off and

517
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:33,569
you end up with fee bein now you have

518
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:36,180
your Penta cyclic backbone and from

519
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:38,789
there you have now another somewhat

520
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:40,710
different backbone structure and you can

521
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:45,149
continue to change the functionalities

522
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:47,640
so it's six OD methylated reduced three

523
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:50,250
OD methylated and now you have morphine

524
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,990
but very elegant process every one of

525
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,599
those steps catalyzed by a different

526
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:57,000
enzyme and now you know every one of

527
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:59,789
those genes encoding those enzymes is

528
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,720
available to do something with to study

529
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:06,269
and so on okay so um what I want to talk

530
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,269
to you mostly about today pick these

531
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:10,889
topics because I think they're they're

532
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:13,019
kind of demonstrating or they're

533
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,580
representative of where a lot of

534
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:18,389
activity is in this space and that's

535
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:23,129
bioengineering in microbial systems so

536
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:25,650
so there's been a lot of interest let's

537
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:27,660
say some hype certainly as well of

538
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:31,380
moving those pathways out of the plant

539
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:33,900
into a microbial potentially fermentable

540
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:36,060
system fermentation system to displace

541
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:39,420
the plant as a source of these products

542
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:42,269
and interestingly the first question

543
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:44,430
that was asked was not can we do that

544
00:23:42,269 --> 00:23:48,599
instead the first question that I think

545
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:51,060
was asked in about 2015 was should we be

546
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:55,109
doing that is that is that something we

547
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:57,019
should be doing and you saw articles

548
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:59,639
appearing this was in nature I

549
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:01,109
questioned nature I questioned nature I

550
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,000
don't know if this is something that

551
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:06,389
would be referred to you know in the

552
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,160
u.s. these days is fake news but it's

553
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:10,980
it's interesting to kind of put that

554
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,840
spin on it right regulate home-brewed

555
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,319
opiates right you really want to start

556
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:18,449
didn't we go through all of this with

557
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:20,429
GMOs and plant transformation and so on

558
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:24,870
and now before the technology really

559
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:26,279
gets out of the door there's already you

560
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:28,169
know sort of a negative spin that's

561
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:29,549
that's put on it so I'm not going to

562
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,740
worry about that again it's something

563
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:33,569
that you know can be discussed is it

564
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,250
dangerous is the right thing to do I'm

565
00:24:33,569 --> 00:24:37,889
going to just talk about science

566
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:39,450
and and show you what some of the

567
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,650
problems are what some of the good

568
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,808
things actually about putting these

569
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:44,940
pathways together in a heterologous

570
00:24:42,808 --> 00:24:47,279
system is that you first of all learned

571
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,929
why it doesn't work very well and then

572
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,788
you have a new system that you can ask

573
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:54,000
new questions about and say what can we

574
00:24:50,788 --> 00:24:56,400
discover to try to learn more about just

575
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,259
academically what we don't know about

576
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,150
how these these pathways actually

577
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:02,220
function despite the fact that we have

578
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:04,919
all the quote-unquote genes that are

579
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,630
that are involved in the pathway so the

580
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:09,240
first place I'm going to start is from

581
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:11,820
the group of christina smokey at

582
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,370
Stanford and they published a paper in

583
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:16,529
science in 2015 where they assembled the

584
00:25:14,369 --> 00:25:20,849
the entire pathway and indeed they were

585
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:23,730
actually able to produce this the semi

586
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:26,189
synthetic hydrocodone de novo from a

587
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:28,710
cheap carbon source from sugar basically

588
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:32,340
it was a very substantial achievement

589
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:34,288
but the yields are telling you a story

590
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:35,548
it's telling telling us that we still

591
00:25:34,288 --> 00:25:38,038
don't know um

592
00:25:35,548 --> 00:25:39,779
certainly everything maybe maybe not as

593
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,298
much as we need to about how these

594
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:43,678
pathways function so what they got were

595
00:25:42,298 --> 00:25:46,740
these levels of thei Bane and

596
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,798
hydrocodone so so sub microgram per

597
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:52,980
liter of hydrocodone what do you need

598
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:55,558
for commercial feasibility to make this

599
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:58,200
fermentation process competitive with

600
00:25:55,558 --> 00:26:01,168
the plant with cultivating the plant you

601
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:04,319
need above five grams per liter so this

602
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:08,700
is more than 1 million times too low so

603
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:12,210
I'd like to show this diagram as a way

604
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:16,259
of reinforcing the the problem of scale

605
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:19,470
size does matter time so here's a cell

606
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:22,140
and here's a giant sequoia or a sperm

607
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:25,829
whale there's about a little less than

608
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:28,500
than 10 to the sixth difference in size

609
00:26:25,829 --> 00:26:31,439
so we have to find a way of increasing

610
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,929
the yield in these engineered yeast

611
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,808
systems by a million times

612
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:39,690
that's the substantial difference in in

613
00:26:36,808 --> 00:26:42,690
in amount for sure sighs all right so

614
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:46,529
the first story I'm going to tell is the

615
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:49,210
discovery of a new enzyme but that was

616
00:26:46,529 --> 00:26:52,119
maybe suspected but not really sure

617
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:54,159
and call it fee Bain synthase so this

618
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:56,589
was published just a few months ago

619
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,720
earlier this year there were a number of

620
00:26:56,589 --> 00:27:01,389
authors many of them came from in treks

621
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,419
on that we're partnered with um the

622
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:06,490
people in the company and my group that

623
00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:10,870
are particularly instrumental in making

624
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:12,940
the discovery are Shui and and Jill and

625
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:14,979
what we noted so where this kind of

626
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,778
started was that this is the pathway

627
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,659
that I showed you over here so there's

628
00:27:16,778 --> 00:27:22,240
salutary Dean reduced to salutary dnal

629
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:25,090
Isetta lated to seven Oh acetate and

630
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,370
then it was believed that the removal of

631
00:27:25,089 --> 00:27:29,918
that Oh acetate that allylic eliminate

632
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:33,908
in it elimination is spontaneous and

633
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:35,950
certainly it is but in treks on when we

634
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:38,260
were working with them kept referring to

635
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:40,360
carbon loss the amount of carbon that

636
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:42,099
was getting to this point was much more

637
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:44,979
than the amount of carbon that was going

638
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:47,859
past it carbon just doesn't disappear

639
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:50,200
where was it going so it was Joel that

640
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:52,869
was looking at this and we eventually

641
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,538
discovered that there was a byproduct or

642
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:57,609
set of byproducts that was being made

643
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:59,980
alright so this this acetyl transferase

644
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:02,288
so we talked about sealed transferases a

645
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:04,390
lot today so this acetyl transferase is

646
00:28:02,288 --> 00:28:07,509
not going to do what we want it to do

647
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:11,350
unless it has help and that and that's

648
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:13,329
because when this compound once that

649
00:28:11,349 --> 00:28:16,000
acetyl group is is added to that

650
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:18,189
hydroxyl there this allylic elimination

651
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,798
is going to happen spontaneously but the

652
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:23,288
main products by far are going to be

653
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:26,408
these guys over here and what happens is

654
00:28:23,288 --> 00:28:29,619
that water will come along and and

655
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:31,059
you'll have the oxidation of one of

656
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:33,548
these points over here so we're not

657
00:28:31,058 --> 00:28:35,288
exactly sure which one we think it's

658
00:28:33,548 --> 00:28:37,019
actually this one but it could

659
00:28:35,288 --> 00:28:41,019
potentially be these other ones as well

660
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:43,329
these byproducts don't accumulate in the

661
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:46,658
plant we don't see them in the plant so

662
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:48,490
we we surmised that this is not actually

663
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:49,990
a spontaneous reaction that there's

664
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:53,470
something that's preventing this from

665
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:56,288
happening and instead promoting the

666
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:59,019
allylic elimination whereby this

667
00:28:56,288 --> 00:29:01,569
hydroxyl rather than from water is

668
00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:02,569
attacking this carbon over here and you

669
00:29:01,569 --> 00:29:06,950
get Phoebe

670
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:10,428
all right so that that was a you know as

671
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:12,740
a deduction I guess continuing to look

672
00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:15,409
at systems and not accepting the

673
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:18,109
literature as the truth but simply as as

674
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:20,059
a guide it's certainly incomplete and in

675
00:29:18,109 --> 00:29:21,918
fact what we ended up finding was it is

676
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:23,359
an enzyme there's an enzyme that we

677
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,778
called thebaine synthesis and the way

678
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:28,219
that we found it was to take latex and

679
00:29:26,778 --> 00:29:31,460
we assumed that it was going to be in

680
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:32,028
the latex because as these last steps

681
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,190
over here

682
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:36,679
I haven't haven't told you that but

683
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:39,200
these last steps in the pathway

684
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:41,480
especially beyond thebaine to morphine

685
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,788
are all taking place in that latex

686
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,679
whereas other steps in the pathway the

687
00:29:43,788 --> 00:29:48,259
earlier steps are happening in adjacent

688
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,990
cell types we won't won't get into that

689
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:53,120
too much today but we decided to look in

690
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:56,778
the latex and when we took protein

691
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:59,209
extracts from latex and set up a coupled

692
00:29:56,778 --> 00:30:02,480
enzyme assay weari added Sally tea

693
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:05,360
either plus or minus latex protein and

694
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,389
looked for what we made if there was no

695
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:10,569
latex protein we primarily made what

696
00:30:08,388 --> 00:30:14,990
appears to be a collection of these

697
00:30:10,569 --> 00:30:18,138
mass-to-charge 330 we just call it a 330

698
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:20,179
by product we make mostly that but when

699
00:30:18,138 --> 00:30:22,278
we add in the latex protein we make

700
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:25,460
mostly c bang so we said there's an

701
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:28,700
enzyme in the latex that is catalyzing

702
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:31,069
that step it's not spontaneous so we set

703
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,569
about to purify it you go to the

704
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:34,939
literature what does the literature tell

705
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:37,908
us so the literature is telling us that

706
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:39,710
somebody's seen it before right it's

707
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:42,080
very hard to do something that you can

708
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:44,840
say I thought of this myself we we did

709
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:47,418
it was actually seen by Minard zenk and

710
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:51,230
reported a couple of times in the 90s

711
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:53,929
and in the mid mid 2000s and it was

712
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:56,599
saying look I we see something as well

713
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:59,240
they kind of got the byproduct wrong

714
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:02,740
they called it this as a neem

715
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:05,659
this thing over here we never see that

716
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:08,240
that part of it I think is is incorrect

717
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:10,789
but still the fact that there was

718
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,370
something in here that was coordinating

719
00:31:10,788 --> 00:31:16,190
the formation of the-- bein as opposed

720
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:22,128
to a byproduct was was seeing or

721
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:26,419
suspected previously so we said about

722
00:31:22,128 --> 00:31:31,398
two to purify from the latex and that

723
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:34,490
was done through a set of or through

724
00:31:31,398 --> 00:31:37,758
using some classic chromatography

725
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:40,419
protein chromatography steps you know so

726
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:43,759
it so it's ammonium sulfate

727
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:46,490
precipitation and then hydrophobic

728
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:51,528
interaction I in exchange and then this

729
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:53,870
violent final one over here was was gel

730
00:31:51,528 --> 00:31:55,250
filtration chromatography and the the

731
00:31:53,869 --> 00:31:57,469
great thing now about protein

732
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:59,569
purification is in the old days you had

733
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:02,360
to actually bring the protein to purity

734
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:04,428
before you could subject it to amino

735
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:06,678
acid sequencing but now you can take

736
00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:08,840
each one of these fractions and send it

737
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:10,700
for two hundred dollars for mass spec

738
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:12,230
analysis and you'll get back all your

739
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,298
proteins that are in that sample you

740
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,788
realize how impure everything really is

741
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:19,730
when when you look at things using mass

742
00:32:16,788 --> 00:32:23,778
spec so we were able with just those

743
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:26,409
three purification steps to reduce the

744
00:32:23,778 --> 00:32:29,538
candidate list to just five proteins and

745
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:31,220
those five proteins were then and and as

746
00:32:29,538 --> 00:32:33,470
you can see there they were all fairly

747
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:37,028
related they were a low molecular weight

748
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:40,669
so only about fifteen killer Dalton's

749
00:32:37,028 --> 00:32:42,798
fairly small and we expressed all of the

750
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:45,409
meaning coli and of the six that we

751
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:46,908
tested the first one here that annotated

752
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:49,100
as BET V one

753
00:32:46,909 --> 00:32:51,980
it stands for betcha love vulgaris so

754
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:54,168
it's a type of so-called peer ten

755
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:56,298
pathogenesis related protein that was

756
00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:59,419
first characterized in birch in white

757
00:32:56,298 --> 00:33:01,429
birch and this guy the heterologous

758
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:03,679
protein was doing the same thing that

759
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:06,169
the latex was it was preventing the

760
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,450
formation of the byproducts and instead

761
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:10,850
coordinating the formation of Theban the

762
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:12,788
other ones weren't doing that so there

763
00:33:10,849 --> 00:33:16,939
you go we had fiebing's synthase in

764
00:33:12,788 --> 00:33:18,259
parallel you might have seen some of you

765
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,629
might have seen that the opium poppy

766
00:33:18,259 --> 00:33:24,349
genome was reported from Ian Graham's

767
00:33:20,628 --> 00:33:27,230
group just recently in the last couple

768
00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:29,990
of months and we've done the genome

769
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:33,079
ourselves as well we have a paper that's

770
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:36,140
that's should be published hopefully

771
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:37,819
sometime early next year um on on our

772
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,009
version of the genome they're they're

773
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:42,168
pretty similar actually but one of the

774
00:33:40,009 --> 00:33:45,740
things that we detected in parallel

775
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:49,970
doing the biochemistry was that there's

776
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:53,200
there's a cluster of enzymes and if you

777
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:55,730
remember the biosynthesis the rebbe the

778
00:33:53,200 --> 00:34:01,038
reticulated him race and then the

779
00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:02,839
subsequent one two steps cell salutary

780
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:05,329
and reductase and salutary team acetyl

781
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:06,678
transferase are clustered in the opium

782
00:34:05,329 --> 00:34:08,358
poppy genome and you can see the

783
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:10,700
distance is they're not that far away

784
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:13,098
considering the genome is about 2.7

785
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:16,878
gigabase in size they're pretty close

786
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:18,980
and we also saw devein synthase there as

787
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:21,139
well we didn't know at the time that it

788
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:23,599
was but these things these two

789
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:26,450
approaches converged at almost the same

790
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:29,690
time and and gave us two parallel

791
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:31,789
streams of evidence for and and and

792
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:33,648
paths to discovery so i actually

793
00:34:31,789 --> 00:34:35,179
recommend both right if you're you're

794
00:34:33,648 --> 00:34:36,980
after things especially when you get

795
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:37,849
into the realm of I don't even know what

796
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:40,809
we're looking for

797
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:43,250
so what we try to try to take is a very

798
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:45,980
multi-faceted approach everything from

799
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:48,820
genomes to classic biochemistry and and

800
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,820
everything in between

801
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:56,628
okay alright so there's two genes for

802
00:34:54,108 --> 00:34:59,920
--they bein synthase that we see in the

803
00:34:56,628 --> 00:35:03,139
genome so bein synthase one and two

804
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:05,030
there's actually four proteins so one of

805
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:07,400
the genes the vein synthase one has a

806
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:10,400
secretion signal on it or a signal

807
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,680
peptide the other one doesn't we we

808
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,619
think that the first one is located

809
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:17,899
outside of the latex and the second one

810
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:20,059
the Thebans synthase 2 is soluble inside

811
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,829
the latex so I still don't know exactly

812
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:23,989
what's going on at the cellular level

813
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:26,329
but there's there's obviously a lot to

814
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:29,719
to investigate but then in addition to

815
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:32,539
that there is a cryptic start codon and

816
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:35,269
we have evidence both from transcript

817
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:38,088
size as well as by doing some additional

818
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:39,920
proteomics analysis that there is a

819
00:35:38,088 --> 00:35:43,519
truncated form that that seems to

820
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,820
predominate in the latex of both the

821
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:46,099
veins

822
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:47,750
one and two and those truncated forms

823
00:35:46,099 --> 00:35:52,360
and terminally truncated forms are

824
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:54,949
inactive still a lot to understand but

825
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,710
clearly I suspect that there's a role

826
00:35:54,949 --> 00:36:00,559
for all of these things another system

827
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:02,990
that we use extensively and has worked

828
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:05,420
out quite well with opium poppy is a

829
00:36:02,989 --> 00:36:07,250
functional genomics methods that is that

830
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:09,590
is based on post transcriptional gene

831
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:12,139
silencing so it's virus induced gene

832
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:15,079
silencing it's very easy to do so we

833
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:17,659
simply build a construct we infiltrate a

834
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:19,730
young seedling into the apical meristem

835
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:21,980
at about two weeks and by the time the

836
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:25,940
plants are 6 weeks old we harvest them

837
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:29,150
and and and test them and what you can

838
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:31,970
see here is that the knockdown of the

839
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:35,180
bane synthase transcript levels is

840
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:38,059
leading to a predicted decrease in

841
00:36:35,179 --> 00:36:41,329
Theban accumulation and an increase in

842
00:36:38,059 --> 00:36:43,969
salutary on all levels which is a an

843
00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:46,579
upstream shortly upstream precursor of

844
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:48,799
the-- bane synthase in the pathway

845
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:51,679
interestingly we don't see a change in

846
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,710
morphine levels so morphine as the end

847
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:57,169
end of these pathways seems to be like a

848
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:58,940
sink it's just things eventually drain

849
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:01,039
down there and when you're looking at a

850
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,690
suppression technique like this you

851
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:05,179
don't necessarily see a difference in

852
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:07,700
the accumulation of these major end

853
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:09,500
products but you can see supporting

854
00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:11,509
differences in the accumulation of

855
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:14,000
pathway intermediates that that give you

856
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:16,250
some physiological evidence that your

857
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,530
genes are correct they're actually

858
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:20,780
functioning in the plant the way that

859
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:22,730
that you see so this is this is what was

860
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,650
done there we silenced this we see

861
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:26,659
salutary and all going up and we see

862
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:28,970
the-- Bane going down and that that was

863
00:37:26,659 --> 00:37:31,429
I think a good piece of evidence in

864
00:37:28,969 --> 00:37:35,119
support of the role of the main synthase

865
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:37,579
in the pathway then in the context of

866
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:41,630
yeast engineering so how does this help

867
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:44,119
with the low titer of opiate production

868
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:47,240
in East so so what again this was done

869
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:49,369
in collaboration with and Trek's on so

870
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:51,619
putting the pathway together and and

871
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:53,659
either not having or adding pheeba in

872
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:56,269
synthase or the last one over here is

873
00:37:53,659 --> 00:37:57,618
having everything integrated in the

874
00:37:56,269 --> 00:37:59,929
genome of yeast

875
00:37:57,619 --> 00:38:02,480
but also adding extra copies of the--

876
00:37:59,929 --> 00:38:04,759
bane synthase transient transiently

877
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,068
expressed off of plasmid and you can see

878
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:09,199
that you get a substantial increase in

879
00:38:07,068 --> 00:38:11,748
the yield of the-- bane compared to a

880
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:13,548
strain that is lacking the the-- bane

881
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:15,828
synthase it's just in this first

882
00:38:13,548 --> 00:38:18,380
experiment it was about a twenty five

883
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:21,999
fold improvement so already we've gone

884
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:25,430
up you know an order of magnitude in in

885
00:38:21,998 --> 00:38:28,068
yield in a very much not optimized

886
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:29,899
system these are the these are the tools

887
00:38:28,068 --> 00:38:31,849
that are going to be needed to make

888
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:35,088
these technologies work and there's more

889
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:37,849
of these tools you're not you it's fine

890
00:38:35,088 --> 00:38:41,748
you can have it a synthetic biologists

891
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:43,759
like to use lego a lot as a as a an

892
00:38:41,748 --> 00:38:46,838
analog so you can have your bucket of

893
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:49,400
lego and you want to build you know the

894
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:52,068
Millennium Falcon if you don't have all

895
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,079
the parts you're not gonna maybe might

896
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:55,608
look kind of like it but it's not gonna

897
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,190
be what you would you want you need all

898
00:38:55,608 --> 00:38:59,960
the parts so our job is to continue to

899
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:02,838
look for the parts and I think we're

900
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:05,599
pretty good at at finding them alright

901
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:08,018
so I'm just wanted to say a little bit

902
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,190
about localization so again you can see

903
00:39:08,018 --> 00:39:12,758
proteomics analysis proteomics is

904
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:15,289
awesome I think these days it's really

905
00:39:12,759 --> 00:39:17,900
superior in a lot of ways to looking at

906
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:20,210
transcriptomes so if we take latex and

907
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:22,940
then we take the rest of the stem that

908
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:25,369
has been drained of all latex we can see

909
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:29,239
in our proteomics analysis that the

910
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:31,880
entire pathway up to Sal R is pretty

911
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:34,009
much exclusively localized in the sieve

912
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,480
elements of the phloem and then and then

913
00:39:34,009 --> 00:39:38,420
you have this transition zone between

914
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:41,088
Sal R and Thebe and at least the the--

915
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:43,009
Bains synthase to isoform so the Theban

916
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:45,768
synthase one is not at all in the latex

917
00:39:43,009 --> 00:39:47,719
with that secretion signal and Thebans

918
00:39:45,768 --> 00:39:49,578
synthase 2 is kind of split between both

919
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:52,129
and then by the time you get to the last

920
00:39:49,579 --> 00:39:54,559
steps from converting see Bane to

921
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:56,660
morphine you end up with everything more

922
00:39:54,559 --> 00:40:00,259
or less occurring in the in the latex

923
00:39:56,659 --> 00:40:01,338
where the alkaloids accumulate so we're

924
00:40:00,259 --> 00:40:03,980
discussing that a little bit this

925
00:40:01,338 --> 00:40:06,259
morning that there's probably a role for

926
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:08,449
that Apple plastic space the cell wall

927
00:40:06,259 --> 00:40:10,519
space between those two cell types that

928
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:11,149
is part of the metabolism it's not just

929
00:40:10,518 --> 00:40:13,669
it's just

930
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:16,280
not a ride from one cell type to another

931
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:18,110
there's certainly more happening there

932
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,530
as well and we're not quite quite there

933
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,300
yet

934
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:23,060
okay I want to give you one more example

935
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:25,340
one more story before I'm done today and

936
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:27,590
it's again showing you how you can use

937
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,990
this system this the synthetic biology

938
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:32,329
if you know you want to refer to it that

939
00:40:29,989 --> 00:40:36,019
way as a discovery platform it's not

940
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:38,299
just a an applied goal it it feeds back

941
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:41,690
on itself and it provides a new way of

942
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:43,700
looking at plant metabolism so here's

943
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:46,250
the problem again it's work that was

944
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:49,009
done in Christina's monkeys lab and

945
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:51,739
published in 2014 and basically they

946
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:52,640
were feeding a system working at the end

947
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:54,500
of that pathway

948
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:57,289
all right so they've got a system where

949
00:40:54,500 --> 00:41:00,650
they've got T bein sick so D methylase

950
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:03,170
codon own reductase and and Cody no

951
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:06,800
demuth least EPS that are able to

952
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:10,220
convert see Bane to morphine and what

953
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,170
they got they got morphine but they they

954
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:14,329
also got this thing called neo morphine

955
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:16,070
Neil morphine doesn't occur in the plant

956
00:41:14,329 --> 00:41:17,989
I'm gonna show you what the difference

957
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:20,360
is it's represented here but I'll show

958
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:22,909
you in just a sec what you don't want

959
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:24,620
Neil Murphy you want morphine so how do

960
00:41:22,909 --> 00:41:28,759
you solve that problem they weren't able

961
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:31,190
to solve the problem with at least with

962
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:33,200
the available parts so we started

963
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:35,960
looking at this enzyme co2 known

964
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,219
reductase so so here's here's the

965
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,470
difference this shows you pretty well

966
00:41:37,219 --> 00:41:43,009
the difference between neo morphine and

967
00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:45,199
morphine or neo pain and codeine okay

968
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:46,610
they're they're isomers of each other

969
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:48,649
and you can see that the only difference

970
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:51,140
between coding and neo pain is the

971
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:53,450
position of that double bond right it's

972
00:41:51,139 --> 00:41:55,489
here in neo pain not an improved drug

973
00:41:53,449 --> 00:41:57,679
it's it's over there in codeine the same

974
00:41:55,489 --> 00:42:00,019
thing with neo morphine it's it's over

975
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:02,449
here as opposed to here the plant

976
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:05,059
doesn't make these compounds maybe you

977
00:42:02,449 --> 00:42:07,609
can detect a tiny bit of neo pain never

978
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:09,650
can you detect a neo morphine in the

979
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:12,890
plant or it certainly we haven't alright

980
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:15,039
so you can get to morphine via two row

981
00:42:12,889 --> 00:42:17,539
or two routes you can either go through

982
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:19,489
six OD methylation first and then

983
00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:21,469
reduction and then three OD methylation

984
00:42:19,489 --> 00:42:24,799
or you can do three OD methylation first

985
00:42:21,469 --> 00:42:27,019
and then 600d methylation second

986
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:30,230
and you in either way you get to you get

987
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:32,079
to morphine this the the pink route or

988
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:34,610
orange route over here is the major one

989
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:37,130
so we you know we thought well this step

990
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:39,470
over here seems to be key is codon own

991
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:42,079
reductase and this is this is one of the

992
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:46,369
observations that that we found so if we

993
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:50,779
put coding into a tube and added co2

994
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:53,059
known reductase or core and nadp+ so

995
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:56,930
it's a redox reaction we could detect

996
00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:59,420
the formation of neo pain just by

997
00:42:56,929 --> 00:43:03,169
incubating it for a few hours but it's a

998
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:05,180
reversible reaction theoretically if you

999
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:07,490
you know if you added neo pain does it

1000
00:43:05,179 --> 00:43:09,799
go back and the answer is no it doesn't

1001
00:43:07,489 --> 00:43:11,809
go backwards it will go this way but it

1002
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:14,120
won't go backwards neo pain to neo

1003
00:43:11,809 --> 00:43:17,119
morphine or sorry neo piensan knee open

1004
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:20,029
own is is not a reaction that is

1005
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,670
supported by the enzyme so if li opener

1006
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:25,160
neo morphine is produced from knee open

1007
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:26,990
own or neo morphine all right so really

1008
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:29,059
producing that that double bond over

1009
00:43:26,989 --> 00:43:31,519
there to an alcohol these compounds

1010
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:33,500
become metabolically trapped the plant

1011
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:36,139
isn't doing it but if you build this

1012
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:40,610
pathway as it stands in yeast the yeast

1013
00:43:36,139 --> 00:43:42,199
do this and this equally how do you

1014
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:44,300
solve that problem so we thought well

1015
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:46,609
let's look at the part that we the parts

1016
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:48,590
we already have and and what seemed key

1017
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:51,470
in this process is this co Danone

1018
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:53,510
reductase enzyme that is an NADPH

1019
00:43:51,469 --> 00:43:58,489
dependent reversible oxido reductase

1020
00:43:53,510 --> 00:44:02,060
enzyme there's quite a few isoforms in

1021
00:43:58,489 --> 00:44:04,039
any any particular opium poppy plant and

1022
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:05,929
they're all very similar to one another

1023
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:08,059
so this is a good lesson that when you

1024
00:44:05,929 --> 00:44:10,819
look at enzymes and you see that amount

1025
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:12,440
of sequence identity you're probably

1026
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,710
going to say well they're the same pick

1027
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:17,929
one and and that can be dangerous

1028
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:20,389
because they're not actually the same ok

1029
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:22,519
so here's here's first indication that

1030
00:44:20,389 --> 00:44:25,429
they're not the same one of the isoforms

1031
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:27,679
that we call Corby which only has a few

1032
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:31,699
amino acid substitutions compared to

1033
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:33,139
these core 1.12 four isoforms is much

1034
00:44:31,699 --> 00:44:35,598
better when it

1035
00:44:33,139 --> 00:44:37,699
provided with codeine and nadp+ at

1036
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:41,059
producing neo pain then the other ones

1037
00:44:37,699 --> 00:44:43,368
are much better at doing it I very very

1038
00:44:41,059 --> 00:44:48,200
very much significantly a better a

1039
00:44:43,369 --> 00:44:50,778
better enzyme right so when we look at

1040
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:52,219
its substrate range core there they're

1041
00:44:50,778 --> 00:44:55,309
actually very similar in terms of

1042
00:44:52,219 --> 00:44:58,219
substrate range and you know so they

1043
00:44:55,309 --> 00:45:01,579
must be participating somehow in in this

1044
00:44:58,219 --> 00:45:03,980
reaction over here so we thought okay

1045
00:45:01,579 --> 00:45:06,829
well how is it what's gonna happen if we

1046
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:09,349
take core B as opposed to one of the

1047
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:14,028
other core isoforms and put it in East

1048
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:15,859
is is that our we are the engineers

1049
00:45:14,028 --> 00:45:18,409
simply not using the right

1050
00:45:15,858 --> 00:45:19,940
eisah form of this enzyme and certainly

1051
00:45:18,409 --> 00:45:21,710
there was a difference but the

1052
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:24,650
difference was a quantitative difference

1053
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:26,750
so here's core 1.3 that's not as good at

1054
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:29,269
producing neo P and you can see it's

1055
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:31,969
it's producing equally in a pathway

1056
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:34,909
where we feed the Bain we've mimicked

1057
00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:37,578
what the smokey lab did we put the main

1058
00:45:34,909 --> 00:45:40,219
six OD methylase core either 1.3 or

1059
00:45:37,579 --> 00:45:42,528
Corby and we looked for for neo pain

1060
00:45:40,219 --> 00:45:44,689
versus codeine or we added in the

1061
00:45:42,528 --> 00:45:46,849
codeine OD methylase and we looked as

1062
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:48,380
well for morphine and neo morphine and

1063
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:50,869
what you can see is just as they

1064
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:53,720
reported relatively equal levels of

1065
00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:55,430
either coding an EOP or morphine and neo

1066
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:57,259
morphine a lot lower levels because the

1067
00:45:55,429 --> 00:46:01,338
co diem doesn't really work so well

1068
00:45:57,259 --> 00:46:03,230
Corby is doing it much better you can

1069
00:46:01,338 --> 00:46:06,259
see the scale is about 10 times higher

1070
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:08,509
but it's preferring the formation of neo

1071
00:46:06,259 --> 00:46:08,869
pain there's something else going on

1072
00:46:08,509 --> 00:46:11,210
here

1073
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:14,150
it didn't seem to be the ISO form of

1074
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:16,548
core but we still follow this thought it

1075
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:19,670
was it was worthwhile taking a look at

1076
00:46:16,548 --> 00:46:22,219
every amino acid substitution in those

1077
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:24,528
isoforms and asking what do they do so

1078
00:46:22,219 --> 00:46:26,028
the paper the works being published in

1079
00:46:24,528 --> 00:46:28,699
plant journal and I'll just point out

1080
00:46:26,028 --> 00:46:30,889
that we identified four different

1081
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:33,768
residues I'm only going to point out one

1082
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:36,170
in particular it's that position 25 here

1083
00:46:33,768 --> 00:46:39,919
and it either exists as a valine or an

1084
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:43,519
alanine and that one we're with that one

1085
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:46,940
we're able to toggle between either the

1086
00:46:43,518 --> 00:46:50,358
superior conversion rate of

1087
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:56,389
or be or the inferior conversion rate of

1088
00:46:50,358 --> 00:46:58,809
in this case core 1.2 or 1.4 we're able

1089
00:46:56,389 --> 00:47:01,098
to toggle between the two of them and

1090
00:46:58,809 --> 00:47:03,679
we're also we also saw that the

1091
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:05,930
stability of the enzyme with a single

1092
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:08,509
amino acid substitution is dramatically

1093
00:47:05,929 --> 00:47:11,059
changed so corby

1094
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:14,450
is much more stable using this

1095
00:47:11,059 --> 00:47:16,578
fluorescence thermo shift assay it's

1096
00:47:14,449 --> 00:47:19,669
much more stable especially than core

1097
00:47:16,579 --> 00:47:23,650
1.2 1.2 was so unstable that we couldn't

1098
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:27,108
even get a measurement 1.3 is not not as

1099
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:29,059
thermostable as as as corby so you

1100
00:47:27,108 --> 00:47:31,250
simply increase the temperature and melt

1101
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:32,750
the protein and if it's more stable it's

1102
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:35,088
gonna melt at a higher temperature it's

1103
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:38,449
just the basis of that assay so

1104
00:47:35,088 --> 00:47:40,759
something in it in response to even a

1105
00:47:38,449 --> 00:47:42,559
single amino acid substitution is

1106
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:45,140
changing the stability of the protein

1107
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:48,529
and its catalytic conversion rate

1108
00:47:45,139 --> 00:47:51,618
efficiency so taking this into a

1109
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:53,750
structural realm we looked at a homology

1110
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:55,700
model to model this after Chacoan

1111
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:57,889
reductase modeled the enzyme after

1112
00:47:55,699 --> 00:48:00,739
Chalco and reductase and what the model

1113
00:47:57,889 --> 00:48:03,338
showed us was that this either valine or

1114
00:48:00,739 --> 00:48:07,009
alanine that one amino acid is

1115
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:11,559
interacting sterically with the the

1116
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:15,020
cofactor with nadp+ or NADPH so this

1117
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:17,358
supports the mutagenesis work gives us a

1118
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:20,750
lot of information about an enzyme in

1119
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:22,969
the pathway but it doesn't tell us why

1120
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:25,159
plants don't make neoprene or neo

1121
00:48:22,969 --> 00:48:28,009
morphine you know but you follow your

1122
00:48:25,159 --> 00:48:30,108
lines of inquiry we're collaborating

1123
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:33,410
with a structural biologist in Calgary

1124
00:48:30,108 --> 00:48:35,269
Kenny and they've determined the the

1125
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:37,399
structure based on the crystal of co2

1126
00:48:35,269 --> 00:48:40,130
known reductase it turns out it's dimer

1127
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:42,139
it was reported in the literature when

1128
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:46,250
it was first purified that it was a

1129
00:48:42,139 --> 00:48:47,960
monomer I didn't and and it's not the

1130
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:51,980
structure shows us that it's a homo

1131
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:53,869
dimer how does that change the way that

1132
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:56,568
we look at the function of this enzyme

1133
00:48:53,869 --> 00:48:58,730
not sure yet but certainly you know

1134
00:48:56,568 --> 00:49:00,829
dimerization is going to change a lot of

1135
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:02,748
the the enzymatic features of

1136
00:49:00,829 --> 00:49:06,259
of the protein so you know how does that

1137
00:49:02,748 --> 00:49:08,058
affect engineering strategies and so on

1138
00:49:06,259 --> 00:49:10,400
I mean more you know the easier things

1139
00:49:08,059 --> 00:49:13,039
are gonna be okay so I'm gonna go to my

1140
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:16,180
last slide and just show you that we do

1141
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:19,690
have a solution to this and here's the

1142
00:49:16,179 --> 00:49:24,469
here's some data in yeast when we add

1143
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:27,679
when we use our solution I keep it quiet

1144
00:49:24,469 --> 00:49:29,389
because the lawyers told me um should be

1145
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:31,639
shortly that it'll it'll be published

1146
00:49:29,389 --> 00:49:33,170
hopefully early next year and you can

1147
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:35,150
see that we can do the same thing that

1148
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:36,999
we did with the main synthase by

1149
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:42,130
understanding how things actually work

1150
00:49:36,998 --> 00:49:44,838
we can change in yeast the ratio of

1151
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:47,209
primarily neo pain and very little

1152
00:49:44,838 --> 00:49:51,018
codeine without our solution to

1153
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:54,018
primarily codeine and and virtually no

1154
00:49:51,018 --> 00:49:55,399
neo pain with it all right so we think

1155
00:49:54,018 --> 00:49:57,048
this is how the plant is doing it

1156
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,670
certainly it's a solution from an

1157
00:49:57,048 --> 00:50:00,559
engineering point of view and it's

1158
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:02,778
applicable not only to the formation of

1159
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,670
natural compounds but also to the

1160
00:50:02,778 --> 00:50:07,039
formation this is hydrocodone over here

1161
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:11,659
as well sorry that not sure where that

1162
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:15,249
guy came from but ok so you can read

1163
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:18,259
about this hopefully in about two months

1164
00:50:15,248 --> 00:50:20,588
and find out what the solution is but

1165
00:50:18,259 --> 00:50:23,719
this is the summary slide of of

1166
00:50:20,588 --> 00:50:27,380
basically how we approach our basic

1167
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:29,690
science and seamlessly more or less

1168
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:32,568
integrated with the translational work

1169
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:34,639
in the end the commercialization aspects

1170
00:50:32,568 --> 00:50:36,708
so we know there's lots of missing parts

1171
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:38,298
still in the plant you need the plant to

1172
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:40,038
find those missing parts if you're

1173
00:50:38,298 --> 00:50:42,440
working without plants and you're trying

1174
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:44,630
to engineer plant pathways I don't think

1175
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,670
you're going to get very far you can put

1176
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:48,949
things together you can assemble them

1177
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:50,778
you can use the assembly to do your

1178
00:50:48,949 --> 00:50:53,389
synthetic biology but then the synthetic

1179
00:50:50,778 --> 00:50:54,858
biology feeds back it tells us what's

1180
00:50:53,389 --> 00:50:57,199
not working tells us where the

1181
00:50:54,858 --> 00:50:59,268
bottlenecks are and we see many more and

1182
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:02,449
when we identify a bottleneck now we

1183
00:50:59,268 --> 00:51:05,028
have a system that we can use to find a

1184
00:51:02,449 --> 00:51:07,519
solution and so far we've we've I think

1185
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:11,358
done done quite well yields are going up

1186
00:51:07,518 --> 00:51:13,248
and and the trajectory looks looks good

1187
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:14,920
in terms of hopefully at some point

1188
00:51:13,248 --> 00:51:17,809
getting getting too

1189
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:19,309
commercially relevant yields not only

1190
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:23,179
for this system but you could replace

1191
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:24,739
this plant with anything you want the of

1192
00:51:23,179 --> 00:51:26,449
course the big one right now in Canada

1193
00:51:24,739 --> 00:51:29,750
is cannabis I don't even want to say the

1194
00:51:26,449 --> 00:51:31,159
word tired of hearing about it but but

1195
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:34,960
anyway that's I'm going to stop there

1196
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:36,980
and hopefully that was informative and

1197
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:51,980
I'd be happy to answer any questions

1198
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:54,170
this one already know so none of the

1199
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:57,590
pathway is extracellular the products

1200
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:59,750
have to be secreted to the medium they

1201
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:01,940
won't accumulate in the cell so there's

1202
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:04,610
going to be no storage capability within

1203
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:07,400
yeast the the enzymes should be

1204
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:09,440
localized to the compartments that you

1205
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:12,170
know any signaling information on the

1206
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:14,179
enzyme or lack thereof is is directing

1207
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:16,010
so if they're p450s they're

1208
00:52:14,179 --> 00:52:19,250
membrane-bound so they're going to be on

1209
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:21,680
the ER in the east if there are soluble

1210
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:24,289
in the plant then plant cells then

1211
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:26,119
they're going to be soluble in in in

1212
00:52:24,289 --> 00:52:29,000
East as well but ultimately the products

1213
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:38,989
need to be exported to the media there's

1214
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:47,119
nowhere to accumulate them piece pea

1215
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:52,129
protoplasm equipment space at one point

1216
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:55,099
to the east Qingdao so so that's that's

1217
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:57,289
another one of the problems that you can

1218
00:52:55,099 --> 00:53:00,799
imagine is is going to afflict any of

1219
00:52:57,289 --> 00:53:03,739
these engineered systems is that these

1220
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:06,950
these are kind of xenobiotic compounds

1221
00:53:03,739 --> 00:53:08,809
the East doesn't want them so pathway

1222
00:53:06,949 --> 00:53:10,579
intermediates are being kicked out as

1223
00:53:08,809 --> 00:53:12,739
well which you know if you're trying to

1224
00:53:10,579 --> 00:53:15,199
get to a specific end product you want

1225
00:53:12,739 --> 00:53:17,329
to keep those intermediates inside you

1226
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:19,460
know so are their metabolic channels to

1227
00:53:17,329 --> 00:53:22,039
these enzymes in the plant interact with

1228
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:24,619
one another are we missing helper

1229
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:26,449
proteins components that are helping to

1230
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:28,130
form those channels how does a plant

1231
00:53:26,449 --> 00:53:28,469
deal with many of these intermediates

1232
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:30,680
that are

1233
00:53:28,469 --> 00:53:33,409
very hydrophobic not very water soluble

1234
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:35,909
you know what to what extent are

1235
00:53:33,409 --> 00:53:38,338
lipophilic parts of a plant cell

1236
00:53:35,909 --> 00:53:42,328
involved in in biosynthesis these are

1237
00:53:38,338 --> 00:53:44,159
all these are all unknown questions but

1238
00:53:42,329 --> 00:53:47,280
questions that you know as I say are

1239
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:50,549
emerging as as important because there's

1240
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:53,250
a specific goal to to try to achieve and

1241
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:54,810
problems to solve so don't you know we

1242
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:56,940
actually don't know all that much more

1243
00:53:54,809 --> 00:53:58,980
than the model that I showed you this is

1244
00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:02,369
where these enzymes are found in two

1245
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:05,309
different cells in the plant and you

1246
00:54:02,369 --> 00:54:07,910
know somehow there's a handoff between

1247
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:10,440
those two cells of some intermediate

1248
00:54:07,909 --> 00:54:13,289
presumably I think the intermediate is

1249
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:15,539
the Isetta lated the 7o acetate of

1250
00:54:13,289 --> 00:54:17,789
salutary and all because an acetate

1251
00:54:15,539 --> 00:54:20,190
would be much more soluble and easy to

1252
00:54:17,789 --> 00:54:22,529
transport from one cell to another see

1253
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:24,780
Bane is highly insoluble it's very

1254
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:26,849
difficult to get it dissolved even to do

1255
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:28,920
an assay so I I'm not so sure that

1256
00:54:26,849 --> 00:54:32,460
that's a good candidate for trench

1257
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:35,579
translocation how do these questions fit

1258
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:38,599
into the efforts to try to do it all in

1259
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:42,240
a single compartment in a single cell

1260
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:45,119
we'll see don't don't don't know yet but

1261
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:47,328
it works but it's not just a question of

1262
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:51,180
having at work you have to have it work

1263
00:54:47,329 --> 00:54:53,180
well enough above a threshold to produce

1264
00:54:51,179 --> 00:54:56,519
levels that make it economically

1265
00:54:53,179 --> 00:54:59,549
competitive with simply throwing seeds

1266
00:54:56,519 --> 00:55:18,949
in the ground and growing plants still a

1267
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:23,099
lot of questions we don't conference

1268
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:30,719
said the morphine was in a frog so the

1269
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:42,030
question is we have morphine in me well

1270
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:44,848
us say so so there

1271
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:48,900
in the last bits of research that that

1272
00:55:44,849 --> 00:55:51,690
he was doing that's that was a major

1273
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:54,630
focus and it was demonstrating that in

1274
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:58,440
human tissue that you can detect small

1275
00:55:54,630 --> 00:56:00,119
quantities of morphine the pathway my

1276
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:03,269
understanding is that the proposed

1277
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:07,519
pathway in mammals and and probably

1278
00:56:03,269 --> 00:56:10,559
other animals is chemically similar but

1279
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:12,480
biochemically completely different so

1280
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,579
there's no you know you can't go to the

1281
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,340
human genome and find any of these plant

1282
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:18,750
genes I mean you might find certain

1283
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:21,059
things that are similar but they're not

1284
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:22,920
functionally the same and they don't

1285
00:56:21,059 --> 00:56:25,980
participate in the pathway so it's still

1286
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:27,720
kind of paradoxical and in the sense

1287
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:31,050
that there seems to be pretty good

1288
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:33,719
evidence that we make our own morphine

1289
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:36,150
and maybe that's why we have such a good

1290
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:38,608
opiate receptor or set of receptors but

1291
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:41,970
there's still not very good biochemical

1292
00:56:38,608 --> 00:57:03,539
support that in terms of how it's done

1293
00:56:41,969 --> 00:57:06,838
how it happens we thought about that for

1294
00:57:03,539 --> 00:57:09,088
sure I thought we had an idea I mean

1295
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:12,000
we're talking about this idea of where

1296
00:57:09,088 --> 00:57:13,190
two enzymes come from I mean if a pool

1297
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,800
of of

1298
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:18,838
of genes that can be recruited into

1299
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:21,720
these specialized pathways

1300
00:57:18,838 --> 00:57:25,679
that's certainly that's the case I mean

1301
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:27,719
we thought we had it solved a few years

1302
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:29,819
ago and it was actually some of the work

1303
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:32,368
that Scott Farrow did when he was in my

1304
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:34,170
lab and it was it was looking at the

1305
00:57:32,369 --> 00:57:34,858
fact that these enzymes the OD

1306
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:37,019
methylases

1307
00:57:34,858 --> 00:57:39,389
so the third to last and the last step

1308
00:57:37,019 --> 00:57:41,900
in morphing biosynthesis those OD methyl

1309
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:45,779
aces will actually OD methylate a wide

1310
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:47,849
collection of of benzyl isoquinoline

1311
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:50,070
alkaloids with very different structures

1312
00:57:47,849 --> 00:57:52,170
than morphine and codeine and and what

1313
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:54,510
we thought was oh that's the function

1314
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:55,220
that's being selected for and this is

1315
00:57:54,510 --> 00:58:00,050
Joe

1316
00:57:55,219 --> 00:58:02,358
this is a not a byproduct but a parallel

1317
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:04,760
thing that happens and it's it's

1318
00:58:02,358 --> 00:58:07,699
unimportant to the plant from a

1319
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:10,609
selection point of view so so Scott

1320
00:58:07,699 --> 00:58:13,579
actually took so we thought well if

1321
00:58:10,608 --> 00:58:16,759
that's the case then we should find OD

1322
00:58:13,579 --> 00:58:18,829
methylation activity for orthologs in

1323
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:21,590
plants that are related to opium poppy

1324
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:23,779
and he looked at dozens of them and and

1325
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:26,539
those those two OD methyl ethers are the

1326
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:28,550
only two that showed any activity with

1327
00:58:26,539 --> 00:58:30,769
these benzyl isoquinoline alkaloids so

1328
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:32,750
kind of threw that idea out the window

1329
00:58:30,769 --> 00:58:34,820
but I still kind of think that you know

1330
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:37,340
we're always looking at this from the

1331
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:39,080
point of view of morphine and look what

1332
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:42,200
it does look at its pharmacological

1333
00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:44,960
activity there must be a deliberate

1334
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:46,879
selection in the plant on the basis of

1335
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,949
that pharmacological property and that

1336
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,829
that can just be totally misleading us

1337
00:58:48,949 --> 00:58:54,169
it might be some other compounds where

1338
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:58,670
you know morphine is just a you know a

1339
00:58:54,170 --> 00:59:01,490
happy circumstance of of some other

1340
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:04,420
metabolism and and we're looking in the

1341
00:59:01,489 --> 00:59:07,789
wrong place for the evolutionary

1342
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:09,680
connection but there isn't a good answer

1343
00:59:07,789 --> 00:59:11,570
to that I mean why does why does one

1344
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:14,389
plant that's actually not true because

1345
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:15,890
and we don't actually I'd like to tell

1346
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:17,960
Health Canada this because I like to

1347
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:20,088
cause them fits about how terrible

1348
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:23,030
controlled substances regulations are

1349
00:59:20,088 --> 00:59:25,570
I'm sure it's the same in the US you

1350
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:28,040
know we we started looking at other

1351
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:30,500
related plants to opium poppy they're

1352
00:59:28,039 --> 00:59:32,539
not supposed to have morphine and about

1353
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:35,750
half of them do the levels are much

1354
00:59:32,539 --> 00:59:37,519
lower but you know my what I like to

1355
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:40,070
tell them is that you know a lot of

1356
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:42,679
plants are on the verge of being able to

1357
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:45,160
make morphine it doesn't you know how

1358
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:47,629
much to what extent do you need

1359
00:59:45,159 --> 00:59:50,118
substitutions in order to turn enzymes

1360
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:52,970
the key ones that are missing in other

1361
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:54,769
plants that don't make opiates into

1362
00:59:52,969 --> 00:59:57,319
enzymes that can actually participate in

1363
00:59:54,769 --> 00:59:59,690
that pathway probably not many not many

1364
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:01,338
substitutions so you know and when I

1365
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:03,139
look at it that way I think well this

1366
01:00:01,338 --> 01:00:04,759
could also just be that we're in the

1367
01:00:03,139 --> 01:00:08,420
right place at the right time and we've

1368
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:09,110
also been breeding this plant for 6,000

1369
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:12,260
years so

1370
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:13,789
you know we've changed a lot and that's

1371
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:17,090
actually something we see in the genome

1372
01:00:13,789 --> 01:00:20,079
the genome of opium poppy is a mess just

1373
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:24,289
like just like most domesticated plants

1374
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:26,719
there's extensive copy number variation

1375
01:00:24,289 --> 01:00:34,070
there's all kinds of deleted bits and

1376
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:35,839
you know I want to that's so

1377
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:39,500
you know if you can find a backer we

1378
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:41,450
need a we need a rich person that you

1379
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:43,550
know cuz that would be great I mean

1380
01:00:41,449 --> 01:00:45,679
that's my that's my dream one day is

1381
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:47,900
connect with anthropologists and have

1382
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:50,690
this big international team go out and

1383
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:52,550
find opium poppy material they that

1384
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:54,380
ancient material and just sequence it

1385
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:57,260
all put it against the reference genome

1386
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:59,630
and see if you can trace how this plant

1387
01:00:57,260 --> 01:01:02,510
kind of moved around throughout history

1388
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:05,809
I I think I think we could might even be

1389
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:08,690
a science paper in nature need to I need

1390
01:01:05,809 --> 01:01:12,380
to do the yeast thing first and get rich

1391
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:14,539
and then I'll do that I you know or or

1392
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:33,170
take up a collection if you all want to

1393
01:01:14,539 --> 01:01:36,739
pitch in this has been a production of

1394
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:39,670
Cornell University on the web at Cornell

1395
01:01:36,739 --> 01:01:39,669
