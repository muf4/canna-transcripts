1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:13,120
University thank you we thank you

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:17,080
everyone for joining me today to discuss

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:19,439
my research um and uh uh well I try to

5
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:22,839
be make it a little bit different uh

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:26,920
with the previous talk that I recently

7
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:29,399
gave uh at Cornell so um today we'll

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,560
focus a little bit more on applications

9
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:34,359
so at you can tell from the title

10
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:37,399
monitoring plant stress through water

11
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:39,960
use perspective using remote sensing and

12
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:39,960
cloud

13
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:45,799
computing and I think you know this is

14
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:49,600
really um nice day to give a seminar

15
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:54,319
talk is a Halloween and also a special

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,198
India F Festival day so um and for for

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,920
the Halloween we have like a check or

18
00:00:56,198 --> 00:01:02,079
treat it's the same for our environment

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,599
to do treat well otherwise you know it

20
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:10,840
can get spooky right so um as we all

21
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:13,559
know that the projected population in

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,680
2050 will be a large amount of

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:20,240
population so we also need increase our

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,400
food production to feed this increased

25
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:26,519
population and uh when we do that we

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,560
really need to assess how the current

27
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:32,118
agriculture model Works to help us

28
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,840
achieve achieve both the food security

29
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:39,040
and also the environmental goal so study

30
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,600
is indicated as the first figure here

31
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:46,118
that with the current agriculture model

32
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:50,839
you know we could somehow get less for

33
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:54,959
the food security goal but our impact on

34
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:58,079
environment could be large and this is

35
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:01,158
not what we want to see so to transition

36
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:04,319
this from the top scen scario to the

37
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:07,439
second scenario with that we achieve the

38
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,639
goal for both security food security and

39
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,719
also environmental goal I think we

40
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:17,000
really need to have innovation in

41
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:20,400
agriculture management to help us as you

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,519
can also tell that water is a large

43
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,719
component from the agriculture

44
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:30,480
impact and this impact could be further

45
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:33,120
compounded by the draw

46
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:36,079
and with the draw events it's getting so

47
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,280
hard to predict and also the draw start

48
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,480
to show up in areas that historically

49
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:47,039
don't experience drot so this is the US

50
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:49,518
jot monitor on the top for the conus and

51
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:52,519
on the second panel here is for the uh

52
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,599
New York State um as we can tell

53
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:58,519
although New York State we don't really

54
00:02:54,598 --> 00:03:01,518
have those very severe draw which is the

55
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:04,560
dark red color we do have draw and the

56
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:08,480
draw tends to happen more frequent and

57
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,959
if you zoom into a certain time period

58
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:14,079
and look at when the draw happens for

59
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,519
each of the year you can tell

60
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,200
that the the lines in this figure here

61
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,439
they are July for each year so this

62
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:25,199
shows that draw tends to happen during

63
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:31,318
the growing season and when the crop the

64
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:34,719
plants needs the water to grow so

65
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:37,399
for not just agriculture for natural

66
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:40,719
resource for natural environment water

67
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:44,640
just so critical uh because they could

68
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:48,680
eat too much water too less water both

69
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:52,359
extreme can be harmful for agriculture

70
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:56,200
and for our natural environment so with

71
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:59,120
like especially when we have draw plant

72
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:01,759
doesn't have enough access to the water

73
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,280
they start to be showing the stress

74
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:09,280
signal and this stress could um making a

75
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,840
lot of other effect to develop other

76
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,120
other than just a draw there will be a

77
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,840
disease The Pest and also this

78
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,519
eventually will impact the yield and

79
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:25,758
also for natural Forest it will impact

80
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,600
the forest e ecosystem serving functions

81
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,319
so for now people like with remote

82
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:36,520
sensing we can start to monitoring

83
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:40,759
General Trends um and with this this is

84
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:44,639
a USD USD Force service model that they

85
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:47,479
use ndvi to try to find the stress

86
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,600
signals because if you find the stress

87
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:52,159
signal then you can start to think about

88
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:57,000
how you want to treat the

89
00:04:52,160 --> 00:05:00,280
stresses but one question here is ndbi

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,839
is showing like basically how green your

91
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:07,279
land surface is but when the plant is

92
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:11,198
under stress it doesn't necessary to

93
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:14,799
change Cotter or to stretch their leaves

94
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:18,520
as the first response to the stress um

95
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,800
so here we are really eager to look for

96
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:25,198
an earlier signal that can tell us the

97
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:30,160
stress before the leaf turns to yellow

98
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:33,720
or before the leaves start to drop so

99
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:37,680
eval transpiration this is a process

100
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,240
that um the water goes the water go

101
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,360
through the plant and return back to the

102
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:47,240
atmosphere and it uses the same path as

103
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:51,600
a stomata we is a similar pass as the

104
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:55,160
carbon assimilation so what we've think

105
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:59,080
before the we' change color we will see

106
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:02,319
a signal of water use change and which

107
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:05,038
could be earlier signal for stress

108
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:08,720
detection so talk a little bit more

109
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:11,879
about uo transporation is actually two

110
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,400
term together one is evaporation another

111
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:17,719
one is transporation so for evaporation

112
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:20,120
as you can tell is the water returns

113
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,120
back to the atmosphere from different

114
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:26,319
surfaces while the transpiration is the

115
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:30,280
more biological part of the water use

116
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:34,000
which is go through which is the B water

117
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:36,879
that P extract from the soil then return

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,439
that back to the atmosphere so combining

119
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:43,279
these two we call the we call these

120
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:46,680
processes together as U transporation

121
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:49,478
and this is the second largest component

122
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,079
in the hydrological cycle of course the

123
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:54,560
first one is the

124
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:57,959
precipitation um and when we talk about

125
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,959
uo transporation actually historically

126
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:05,680
this is a parameter is hard to measure

127
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:08,758
and it's hard to model um especially if

128
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:12,759
you consider the difference between

129
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:15,240
potential ET and actual ET so a lot of

130
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:18,840
previous studies we use potential ET we

131
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:23,038
use weight per pressure deficit um

132
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:26,959
that's uh because it was just easier to

133
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:29,519
to to calculate from the meterological

134
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:33,000
parameters however there's key differ

135
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:37,159
difference between this two um

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,279
terminology so the potential ET is the

137
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,560
ideal condition and how much water can

138
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:46,839
be returned back to the atmosphere so as

139
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,759
you can tell if we it's it's sunny if

140
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:53,279
it's windy and if it's dry you would

141
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:57,038
expect a higher potential ET because the

142
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:58,198
atmosphere just needs a lot of water so

143
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:02,158
this is the

144
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:06,598
demand which is mostly for the potential

145
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:09,399
ET part but whether we can provide that

146
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:12,079
much water to return back to Atmosphere

147
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:15,519
so that's the limitation combining both

148
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:19,639
the demand and the limitation together

149
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:21,799
is the actual eapo transporation so for

150
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:24,439
the the limitation part we need to

151
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,759
consider whether we have enough water in

152
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:30,519
the soil to support this and whether the

153
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,158
vegetation is health and the stomata is

154
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:36,360
all open ready to do the

155
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:40,599
transporation and also how rough the

156
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:44,399
surface is the soil surface and also the

157
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:48,200
canopy surface all these can impact

158
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:52,320
actual uo transpiration which is the AET

159
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:56,120
so today I will talk about the AET and I

160
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,480
will go through the methods that we um

161
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:02,839
we improved developed improved and also

162
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:06,600
so the product that we developed and

163
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:08,120
also applications so first we'll talk

164
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,839
about the

165
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,799
algorithm for the actual uo

166
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:15,920
transporation of course there are you

167
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:20,000
know now with machine learning there are

168
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:23,759
a lot of methods there are uh this um

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,799
process based model and it can be also

170
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:29,439
machine learning data driven model and

171
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:33,039
here what I'm going to talk about is

172
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,519
energy balance model so why is energy

173
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,879
balance think about you know like in

174
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,440
physics there are actually a lot of

175
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:43,078
assumptions is the balance Mass

176
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,200
conservation you know energy

177
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:50,679
conservation so um the energy balance

178
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:54,000
method is we assume the net radiation we

179
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:58,120
get like the energy we get on the

180
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,958
Earth's surface it will be petitioned to

181
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,959
three energy

182
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:08,759
components one is how much energy is

183
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:12,239
stored in the soil and another part is

184
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:15,360
how much energy is used to change the

185
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,759
air temperature like when you feel is

186
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,919
hot outside it's cold outside that's a

187
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:26,799
sensible heat and then the rest of that

188
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:31,838
is latent heat which is the energy used

189
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:35,199
to transfer the water from the soil or

190
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,760
water surface back to a waer condition

191
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,200
so which is the part of the energy that

192
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:43,000
is used for eaper

193
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:46,120
transporation so in a lot of this energy

194
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,120
balance models we actually calculate

195
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:52,360
this latent heat which is the L term

196
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,919
there uh as a residual of this system

197
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:59,959
because um it's just so hard to directly

198
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:03,799
estimate it um so here I'm showing you

199
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:06,838
one of these energy balance model which

200
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:10,479
is called Alexi dis Alex model and this

201
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:14,560
is the model that that have been um work

202
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:19,039
on since my postal and it was developed

203
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:22,000
by my postal weather and for this model

204
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:24,559
it actually has two components one

205
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,799
component is on the course resolution

206
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:30,518
which is a Lexi model the reason we have

207
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:34,000
this is because

208
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:36,720
to have this energy closure we need to

209
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,440
have a system that you can consider the

210
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,800
closure right so to consider this system

211
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:47,279
we need the atmospheric boundary layer

212
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:50,199
condition so that's the hard part to get

213
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:53,000
so that we rely on the geostationary

214
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:56,200
data which is the weather forast

215
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,720
satellite in the space because it's it's

216
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:02,160
course resolution but it's very frequent

217
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,720
so from that we can grab the information

218
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:07,838
of the atmospheric boundary layer

219
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:11,360
development information then we can have

220
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:15,240
a closed system to consider the energy

221
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:19,480
balance so for the course resolution

222
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:22,399
part one key input is land surface

223
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:26,039
temperature so this goes to the cooling

224
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,799
effect of Ule transporation um is I

225
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:31,198
always like to to use this example as

226
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:35,719
you know in the hot summer days when you

227
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:38,719
sweat actually your skin is cooler and

228
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,240
this is the same for vegetation

229
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,160
transpiration if you have water

230
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,959
transferred back to Atmosphere it uses

231
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:51,078
the energy so it has the cooling effect

232
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:53,638
your Leaf surface will be cooler so

233
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:56,078
that's why land surface temperature is a

234
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,278
very important parameter that we use in

235
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:01,198
the model other than that we also need

236
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:04,039
to know the condition of land surface

237
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:06,838
which we use vegetation index so we know

238
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:09,639
where the the vegetation is and where we

239
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:13,440
know the bare soil is so that we can

240
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:16,959
estimate e and t because e is from

241
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:20,560
different surfaces and T is from the

242
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:23,000
fence so that's the course resolution

243
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:26,958
and for the final spal resolution we

244
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,879
call it a disaggregation of Alexi so

245
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:34,439
which is this Alexi so for for dxi we

246
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:36,879
borrow this air T air estimation for the

247
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:41,680
boundary condition that we estimated

248
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:44,240
from Alexi and use that in the dis Alexi

249
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,679
but change the land surface and

250
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,320
vegetation index uh land surface

251
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:52,719
temperature and vation indexing input to

252
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,959
a finer special resolution satellite

253
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:59,360
data which now we use lens set eost

254
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:02,799
stress and we so these are different

255
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:06,000
satellites in the space so now you can

256
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:09,319
see this is really uh hierarchical

257
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,320
structure that involves satellite data

258
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:16,000
from different spatial resolution and

259
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:19,720
for satellite data normally if it's

260
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,440
different uh spatial resolution it's

261
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,639
different in temporal resolution the

262
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:28,639
temporal resolution meaning is how often

263
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:32,879
it comes back to the same place we also

264
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:36,159
call this as revisiting timee so

265
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:38,919
combining all these different satellites

266
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:42,679
together uh we can estimate eapo

267
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:45,559
transporation at different spatial and

268
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:48,479
temporal resolution normally closer

269
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:51,399
spatial resolution has more frequent

270
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,079
revisiting and finer spatial resolution

271
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:57,600
has a longer revisiting

272
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:59,638
time so as you can tell that for a a lot

273
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,278
of agriculture

274
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:06,720
applications what we need is high in

275
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:09,639
both in both spatial resolution and in

276
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,320
both in temporal resolution so that's

277
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:17,639
why we came up with a data Fusion method

278
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:19,800
then we can combine the advantages of

279
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:24,720
high frequency from course resolution

280
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:28,519
data and the uh High special resolution

281
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,560
uh observations from those satellite

282
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:34,639
that they don't have a very frequent

283
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:38,599
revisit time so combining all this we

284
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,480
want to get a daily field scale uo

285
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,680
Transportation

286
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,399
estimation so I will give a little bit

287
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:51,159
more about this data Fusion like

288
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:54,519
multisource data um system because I

289
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:57,639
want to guess a little bit new in new

290
00:15:54,519 --> 00:16:01,198
things in my slides that I didn't talk

291
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:05,839
in my interview uh talk and also another

292
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:07,278
talks so this is a different sources of

293
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,560
land surface

294
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:12,919
temperature as we identified that land

295
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:16,399
surface temperature is really important

296
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:18,399
input for our energy balance model so

297
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,198
these are the satellite that we are

298
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,159
currently using which the first is G

299
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:27,039
stationary one is the go data the

300
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:30,719
weather satellite for the uh United

301
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:34,679
States modes and we is polar orbit polar

302
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:38,199
orbit means they that go through um uh

303
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:42,599
the the polar part so that's the modus

304
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:46,679
and we the spal resolution is 500 meter

305
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:51,000
but is daily risi and lset lanet has

306
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:53,439
been a really um golden observations for

307
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,039
us working on field scale because it

308
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:00,519
provides 30 m uh spal resolution and all

309
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:03,838
but the revision time is relatively

310
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:06,519
longer because it's 16 days but now we

311
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:09,318
have two lens set in the space lens at 8

312
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:11,359
and lens and nine so combining these two

313
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:15,438
together we can get the revisiting time

314
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:18,359
to eight days and then the ISS orbit is

315
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:21,439
the ecost stress sensor ecost stress is

316
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:24,318
a thermal only sensor so it only

317
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:28,038
measures um the land surface temperature

318
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:29,839
is on the International Space Station um

319
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:31,798
it because it is on the International

320
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:35,279
Space Station so it goes to a very

321
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:36,839
different orbit the revisiting time is

322
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:40,279
about 4

323
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:44,399
days and also considering like in the

324
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:46,639
future we also have multiple uh sensors

325
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,440
that is planned in the future for

326
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:54,240
example the Trish from European um and L

327
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:57,120
next which will be launched in 2030

328
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,839
which uh is will be launched by NASA and

329
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:02,839
hosted by USGS

330
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:06,439
so why we need all these data together

331
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:10,399
this is a simple uh like identification

332
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:13,640
of uh these different

333
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,919
data their frequency and this area

334
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,360
actually is for California California is

335
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:21,640
already clear during green season um and

336
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:24,359
you would see a more added value

337
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,559
actually for a cloudy area so for the

338
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:29,558
first one is lens set eight and nine

339
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:33,639
which is the key input currently for a

340
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:37,079
lot of operational product of V then

341
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:39,720
Sentinel 2 is the European satellite

342
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:41,399
which doesn't have thermal observation

343
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,240
so it doesn't measure land surface

344
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,280
temperature but we can get vegetation

345
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,640
index from Sentinel and eost stress is

346
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:51,000
thermal only it's just a measure lens of

347
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,400
temperature so combine these all

348
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,480
together we can see a lot of more

349
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:59,480
samples that we can get over a growing

350
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,240
season which can help us to better

351
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,000
estimate eapa transpiration because if

352
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,279
you don't have satellite observations

353
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,960
you can only do is interpolate between

354
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:12,918
the two days that you have observation

355
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,159
uh which is not ideal the ideal

356
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:18,679
condition is we can get observation for

357
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:21,880
um each day but there will be a long

358
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:25,080
long way to go um and also comparing

359
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:28,840
with the lanet and Eco stress this is

360
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:32,038
how many clear images that we can use

361
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:36,119
for a year this is in

362
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:38,839
2022 um with darker color is more images

363
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:42,079
over that area so you can see lens set

364
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:45,000
really have limited images and combining

365
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:47,599
with Eco stress they're a lot more so

366
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
the difference is we use eal the the

367
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:54,240
number of Eco stress minus the number of

368
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,279
lens set so we can get the number how

369
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:00,079
many more images we can get so the

370
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:02,798
question is okay so we have all these

371
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:05,079
satellite observations and there will be

372
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:08,079
more in the future whether you can

373
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:12,399
directly use them together

374
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:16,798
um actually not because they are so

375
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:19,880
different they the key differ is the

376
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:23,359
spatial resolution is different so as

377
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:26,400
you can tell that lens at 8 eal stress

378
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:29,879
and wears this is the relatively the

379
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:34,080
image from the sensor and it get course

380
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:37,039
and course so what we want is field

381
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:41,079
scale and if you look at the we sta you

382
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:44,279
don't really tell the field anymore so

383
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:47,720
what we need to to do is we need to

384
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:51,440
first to unify the land surface

385
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,679
temperature from different sensors and

386
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,320
here we use the data mining sharpener

387
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,200
which is a machine learning based method

388
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:03,038
for the land surface temperature

389
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,480
uh which we can sharpen the course

390
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:08,480
resolution of land surface temperature

391
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:11,599
to a field scale then we can put this as

392
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,360
input into our model to estimate field

393
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:16,119
scale U

394
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:20,278
transporation okay so now with all these

395
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:24,079
you know stellite method uh energy

396
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:27,240
balance what we actually want to get is

397
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:29,839
a 30 m daay evap transpiration

398
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,599
estimation so that we can use it for

399
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:34,879
different applications so now we are

400
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:37,439
going to start with some applications

401
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,480
because uh this talk will focus on the

402
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:44,880
plant stress detect I will use our vard

403
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:48,240
work at California as example to

404
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:51,200
demonstrate how we detect PL stress

405
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,798
using U Transportation data so this is

406
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,558
the gack project which is a

407
00:21:53,798 --> 00:22:02,720
collaboration between NASA G gallo and

408
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:05,879
USDA so the Project Lead um is Bill

409
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:09,798
custas and uh and also Mara Anderson who

410
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:12,240
my co viser um so this is a project that

411
00:22:09,798 --> 00:22:16,240
we have been working on for many years

412
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:20,278
actually um and these are the sites that

413
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:23,519
we selected they are EG Gallow vard and

414
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:27,079
for each of the sit we have observation

415
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:30,200
capabilities the instrument flux to

416
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:32,839
final Camp all this observations built

417
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,840
in this

418
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:40,400
sides and we evaluate our modeled U

419
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,320
transporation for each of the site by

420
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,720
comparing with the flex Tower

421
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:48,000
observations so here uh it can give us

422
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,319
confidence how we can further use the

423
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,880
model of the U transporation so you can

424
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:57,639
tell that the the Dots here observations

425
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:01,679
and the red line is our simulated daily

426
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:05,278
30 m field scale ET which performs very

427
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:08,640
well and other than just look at how it

428
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:11,880
works for these flux Tower we can also

429
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:15,919
look at the spatial pattern so this is

430
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:19,840
the ET the cumulative ET for the spard

431
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:22,960
area and start from the uh the the start

432
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:24,879
of the green season and all the way to

433
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,240
the peak of the green season so you can

434
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,919
tell how these different field they

435
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:34,200
start start to use a different amount of

436
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:37,200
irrigation over the year and also um

437
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:40,919
these are the the vineyard and there

438
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:46,200
also like the natural uh trees over

439
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:48,600
there uh so it's very uh useful for The

440
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,640
Growers that they can look at this

441
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:55,240
spatial map to understand how the

442
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:57,600
different water is used then how this

443
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,519
water use can be transferred to a stress

444
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:02,639
signal

445
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:06,000
so we actually using a very simple

446
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:09,600
anomaly method so the anomaly normally

447
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,679
Compares with a baseline right so if you

448
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:15,119
have a long-term observation you know

449
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:18,720
the Baseline and for each of the they

450
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:21,479
the data comes you can compare that ET

451
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,839
value with the Baseline and that can

452
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:27,720
give you a signal of stress but here we

453
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:28,918
are not actually directly compare the ET

454
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,120
value because

455
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:36,960
it changes a lot it's not just impacted

456
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:39,479
by the plant itself a lot of actually is

457
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:43,120
impacted by the weather right today and

458
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:45,798
tomorrow the plant won't change much but

459
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:48,479
you probably see the ET change a lot if

460
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:51,119
today is sunny and tomorrow is cloudy U

461
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,200
so we normalize the eapa transformation

462
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:57,879
use the reference ET to remove this

463
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:01,399
day-by-day difference of um the the uh

464
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:05,919
weather condition then we use this ratio

465
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:10,319
to calculate the F anomaly so this is

466
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:12,080
the index that we use to capture the

467
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:16,319
stress

468
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:20,000
um so this is the one example of one of

469
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:23,038
the venard is the on the top is this F

470
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,759
value um the red line is our model the

471
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:29,278
black dots are the

472
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:33,519
observations we can use these data to

473
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:36,798
look at these abnormal values and when

474
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:39,720
you compare this abnormal values with

475
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:43,000
the uh the far the the vineard

476
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,759
management you will see all these

477
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,640
differences comparing with the normal

478
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:51,000
condition uh sometimes it's due to the

479
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,000
drought as you can tell the California

480
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,919
drought sometimes is due to the

481
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,720
management for example this is a time

482
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:07,840
period reared that the graph and the

483
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:11,480
trimed so this is we use this um anomaly

484
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:14,079
index to help us identify what's

485
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:17,960
different comparing with the

486
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:20,839
Baseline so with this we can look at you

487
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:24,200
know the spatial pattern of water used

488
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:27,678
for different years among different

489
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:31,240
monsters and then when we use this value

490
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:35,840
to minus as the Baseline we can clearly

491
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:39,240
tell which part is not performing as

492
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:41,678
supposed to be so this is different as

493
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,919
of what Baseline tell use that the red

494
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:47,640
color means it's lower than the Baseline

495
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:50,679
which gave you a signal of either you

496
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:54,000
know the plant needs water because they

497
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:57,278
are using less amount of water or there

498
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,880
is also a signal that there might be

499
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:03,519
some kind of dis disase or pest for

500
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:07,720
those field that impacted the plant

501
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:10,599
water use then throwers can use this map

502
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:14,240
to look at to the field to look at the

503
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:18,439
field for further management so GPX is a

504
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:24,079
large project I'm a part of it um and

505
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:28,320
what is very excited is actually just uh

506
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:32,038
this Tuesday and Wednesday um the a few

507
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:35,439
leaders of the grx project visited us

508
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:38,798
and kitty gold from hotic culture um and

509
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,679
me we've together hosted them at Geneva

510
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:45,359
campus so as you can tell Bill kustas

511
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:48,919
Martha Anderson Joe alfy um are here to

512
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:52,158
visit our Geneva venard site and this is

513
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:56,200
also part of my new research that I want

514
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:58,840
to bring the G par experience to our uh

515
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:02,000
New York Vineyard grower

516
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:04,398
and to see under different climate

517
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,960
conditions with different uh uh

518
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:10,759
varieties of groups how much we learned

519
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:14,319
from gacks can help the growers in New

520
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:16,919
York so uh stay tuned hopefully next

521
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:19,678
time I will have some results for this

522
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:24,038
and we are planning a flux Tower over

523
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:27,000
one of Kitt's field site so she has the

524
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:30,278
disease measurement um and I will have

525
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,759
the water and carbon flux measurement uh

526
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:34,640
collectively I think we will have a lot

527
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:38,200
of interesting

528
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:42,200
findings okay so uh other than the the

529
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:45,798
the crops actually we also I also did a

530
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:48,120
lot of work for natural Forest um but

531
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:51,720
because of time I'm not going to to talk

532
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:54,798
about this in detail but we did use this

533
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:57,440
water use information to help us to

534
00:28:54,798 --> 00:29:00,000
understand Plantation management the

535
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,278
thinning harest these are all the

536
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,440
signals that you can find from water use

537
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:07,880
and these are all published papers if

538
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:11,880
you're interested you can look at them

539
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:15,080
and look at Missouri Forest draw impact

540
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:19,360
um and also how the forest compositions

541
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:23,038
management impact different water use

542
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:26,199
and also the uh restoration of uh

543
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:28,879
different kinds in the Southeast area

544
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:31,519
which is a large conservation effort in

545
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:35,559
sou East and now and also Wildfire

546
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:39,079
impact over the uh west of us so these

547
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:41,480
are the The Works that we have published

548
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:44,119
so now you can tell that you know we

549
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:47,079
spend a lot of time to explore how we

550
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:49,839
can use this data and when people start

551
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:54,199
to adapt to this method there's new

552
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:58,678
issue is how we can provide people the

553
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:01,679
data because this is very compal

554
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:04,919
um resource

555
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:08,919
intensive so for a local server we

556
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:11,120
cannot estimate large aere so that's why

557
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:13,519
the ear a few earlier studies you can

558
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:17,000
tell they are just limited with small

559
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:20,120
aere because just we cannot run it for a

560
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,319
large area so how we can provide this

561
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:26,319
Regional data to people are interested

562
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:29,158
so this is another key project that I

563
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:32,960
also have been worked on for multiple

564
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:35,960
years and I'm super excited to see how

565
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,679
this project turned to so this is open

566
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:42,079
ET project it started with a a lot of

567
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,120
collaboration efforts from different

568
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:46,599
government agencies and

569
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:51,038
universities and actually at that

570
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:56,359
time we started to think how we can

571
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:58,960
provide this data to the end users not

572
00:30:56,359 --> 00:31:02,359
just in the scientific community

573
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,120
so what we did is we bring we brought

574
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:09,240
our model into the cloud which is the

575
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:13,158
Google engine so we use we we integrated

576
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:16,399
six different ET models into engine then

577
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:18,960
we can directly do all the estimations

578
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:21,599
in the cloud nothing need to be done

579
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,440
locally everything is in the cloud and

580
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:28,158
the results are saved in the cloud and

581
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:32,480
to e to make the the accessible of the

582
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:34,760
the data we also developed a website

583
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,639
which is this

584
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:41,240
open.org um and you can look at the

585
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:43,798
water use from different fields and we

586
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:47,359
also developed the API that people can

587
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:50,158
directly download images and time series

588
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:53,000
do a little bit more Advanced Data

589
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:57,919
extraction so the six models that we

590
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:02,720
have is these wellestablished six models

591
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:08,360
and Alexa dxi was one of them um and we

592
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:11,079
also have a another emble value because

593
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:14,158
a lot of times users they don't need six

594
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:17,519
values especially when these six values

595
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:21,039
are all different so they want one value

596
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:24,120
which is emble so we also like studied a

597
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:27,119
lot how to get to this emble value and

598
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:30,119
we went through careful evaluation and

599
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:32,839
the evaluation results turned out that

600
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:35,638
Ensemble actually performs the best

601
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:38,959
which is also what we want to see um and

602
00:32:35,638 --> 00:32:42,038
we also have published

603
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,159
another uh evaluation paper that was

604
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:49,119
published earlier this year um on nature

605
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:54,159
water which is also the C page and uh

606
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:56,798
from this study we evaluated our open

607
00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:00,440
product comparing with different flx

608
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:02,480
Towers all all across the conus so um

609
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,720
the that paper have very detailed

610
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,599
information about the performance of

611
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,399
different models and the performance

612
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:15,839
models at different locations um so now

613
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:19,000
we have the ET data we are still uh like

614
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:22,038
work very hard to expand this to the

615
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,919
east um so now I think it we have a

616
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:28,919
little bit more but uh didn't get to the

617
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:31,759
New York state yet and and this is where

618
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:34,679
the multisource data could be very

619
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:38,240
helpful for the next stage because we

620
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:40,559
all know the EAS us is cloudier than the

621
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,079
Western us and we will need more

622
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:47,480
satellites to work on this and this is

623
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:50,960
the if you get to the open website you

624
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:53,720
can zoom into the website we already

625
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,759
have build field boundary there you can

626
00:33:53,720 --> 00:34:00,038
look at the water use for each of the

627
00:33:56,759 --> 00:34:05,319
field um and currently we have data from

628
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:07,879
2016 to present I think and also we have

629
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:10,480
this API there you can use it to

630
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:13,760
download data if you're interested to

631
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,960
explore in a certain area we are also

632
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,760
building this Farms Tool uh to use this

633
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,918
Farms tool farmers can bring their own

634
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:27,200
boundary shape file into the platform so

635
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:32,279
that they can get routinely report of

636
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:35,678
their Fields water use um so I I do see

637
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:39,679
there's limited of time um and but I

638
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:43,280
also want to show you that with the open

639
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:46,159
we are not limited to small areas we can

640
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:49,359
do Regional studies but still keep this

641
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,878
fine spatial resolution um this is a

642
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:54,119
study that my PhD student she is

643
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:56,759
currently working on look at Lower

644
00:34:54,119 --> 00:35:00,039
Mississippi Alou PL agriculture

645
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:03,160
activities and how these activities

646
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:06,519
impact the water use so this is the

647
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:10,078
study area and along the Miss River you

648
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:13,838
can see it's a highly cultivated area

649
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:16,640
and we did we use the open data to

650
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:20,920
analyze the like for these different

651
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:23,960
crop types soybean is a green color corn

652
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:27,760
coton and rice uh how these different

653
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:31,480
crops use different amount of water um

654
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:35,960
and here we can get a very typical uh

655
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:39,358
plant water use curve so this is aage

656
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:42,358
from out cor years which agrees a lot

657
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:45,679
with what we uh observed in the field

658
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:49,480
that the yellow Lin corn it shows a

659
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:53,559
higher water use during the first stage

660
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:56,559
of the the green stage and the coton

661
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:59,920
doesn't need that much water so this is

662
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:03,279
what we get statistically from the open

663
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:06,000
data um and we can also look at how

664
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,319
these we can look at the water

665
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,039
accounting for this

666
00:36:08,318 --> 00:36:13,199
region the same as you know you

667
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:15,880
understand your bank account we also

668
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:19,519
want to understand the water account how

669
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:22,800
much water we use at different locations

670
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:25,440
and how much water is extracted from

671
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:29,560
groundwater the groundwater information

672
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:32,559
is this scue bar that uh shows all

673
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:35,318
negative value the negative value is

674
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:39,159
like is always withdraw so that's also

675
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:42,880
explains why this area we see a

676
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:46,480
consistent groundwater depletion and for

677
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,440
these draw years we do see a higher uh

678
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:52,400
groundw withdraw uh to maintain the

679
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,519
agriculture activity over this area and

680
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,280
again we can also look at the spatial

681
00:36:54,519 --> 00:37:00,119
pattern for like different area they

682
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,640
tend to use different amount of water

683
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:05,358
over a green season so this is the same

684
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:09,519
area starts from May all the way to

685
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:12,759
August on the top is leaf area index and

686
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:15,960
the the second panel is the U

687
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:18,520
transporation which is the water use um

688
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,800
so I will try to go quick because this

689
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:24,519
will be something I'll will further work

690
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:27,318
on is very high resolution ET because 30

691
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:30,838
m sometimes can be limited for specialty

692
00:37:27,318 --> 00:37:34,719
C alter um like the specialty crops this

693
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:38,239
is the vard um the from KT is

694
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:41,519
field that we do need uh like finer

695
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:44,838
spatial resolution details and part of

696
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:48,599
my group's work is using UAV data so we

697
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:51,559
fly drones to collect images then we can

698
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:54,480
really get very detailed information on

699
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:57,559
the ground this is the two site fully

700
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:01,400
irrigated and deficit site and you can

701
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:04,480
see how these are input be different and

702
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:07,200
this is our U transporation estimation

703
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,000
the first one uh you can also tell how

704
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:12,358
different the uo transportation use for

705
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,719
the fully irrigated deficit they are

706
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:18,598
next to each other but they are very

707
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:22,399
different so this is a 3 meter uh evapo

708
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:25,240
Transportation data and this is 30 meter

709
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,960
so now you can tell how why we want to

710
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:30,838
go a little bit further is this should

711
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,760
be fine for corn Bel You Know Field

712
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:36,119
crops but for a lot of the specialty

713
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,720
crops we do need a finer special

714
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:42,519
resolution my group is also working on a

715
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:46,239
deep learning method to help us directly

716
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:50,400
sharpen the open ET 30 meter data using

717
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:54,719
Planet observations to get 3 meter ET

718
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:58,559
for the uh like the the specialty crop

719
00:38:54,719 --> 00:39:01,279
management and we now like lot of

720
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:03,880
interest from different field they want

721
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,240
to look at like either the water use or

722
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:10,280
like plant response or in know water

723
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:14,439
accounting uh you can see there are new

724
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:17,599
ET data every day like you can see new

725
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:22,039
Publications every day using ET or try

726
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:26,240
to produce ET so with a lot of these new

727
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:28,358
effort how we can have a standard to

728
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:31,039
evaluate these

729
00:39:28,358 --> 00:39:33,759
uh new data right like if I change just

730
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:37,239
change a model appli to a area can I

731
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:40,760
claim it as a new model or whether uh my

732
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:44,078
evaluation method is a standard method

733
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:47,079
there is no standard now so what I'm

734
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:50,359
currently doing is I'm leading a group

735
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:53,880
of scientists uh internationally from

736
00:39:50,358 --> 00:39:56,519
different country Australia China Europe

737
00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:00,119
um that we are trying to understand

738
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:03,960
what's the current stat um status of the

739
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:07,800
silite based uo Transportation product

740
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:10,679
and uh through this agu talk we will

741
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,760
further uh establish a working group

742
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:15,719
that will work together to get a

743
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:20,040
protocol that to help the entire remote

744
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:24,519
sensing Community to get a standard for

745
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:26,920
the ET data evaluation so with this I'm

746
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:29,039
going to conclude my talk so it's

747
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:32,440
basically the take-home message is we

748
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:35,279
spend a lot of effort to make this as a

749
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:39,000
product open to the public especially

750
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:41,680
open to the users and then I like this

751
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,079
data can be used for a lot of

752
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:47,519
applications water accounting plan

753
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:50,440
stress detection on Farm U

754
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:53,639
management and we are still working on a

755
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:56,280
lot more of this uh exciting

756
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:58,279
applications and I also want to thank my

757
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:02,519
founding agency

758
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,519
uh for all these work thank you so

759
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:12,039
much we have time

760
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:14,279
for I yeah johanes we do have time for

761
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:16,559
questions thank you so much very

762
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:20,839
impressive I'm really excited about this

763
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:24,119
um I a question about data ownership you

764
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:27,639
mentioned aspiration is and evidence for

765
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:29,599
it that it's open accessible but who the

766
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:33,519
data you're working with Google Earth

767
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:35,760
Google probably know uses the data for

768
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:37,039
all kinds of things and maybe claims

769
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,000
some ownership so what are the

770
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:41,279
conversations about that not that I

771
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,199
trust actually governments any better

772
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:47,880
especially with past potentially coming

773
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:50,559
upon us next week but um no who who can

774
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,400
be trusted with these very important

775
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:55,519
public goods and how do you and your

776
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,880
colleagues are talking about ownership

777
00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:00,159
of these data for the future

778
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,519
oh thank you so much for this important

779
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:06,679
question the question is about ownership

780
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:10,079
of the uh I would say open ET data so um

781
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:14,000
we do have a lot of discussion um and uh

782
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:17,440
what we actually have now is we uh

783
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:21,599
trying to define a better um

784
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:24,159
intelligence property um certificate for

785
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:26,800
this data so there is like a more

786
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:30,759
computer science field there are a bunch

787
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:33,359
of the is IP certificate we can use and

788
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:36,680
later we choose one of them there's a

789
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:38,960
number I cannot recall it uh so there

790
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:42,639
there we choose one of that so that data

791
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:45,599
is open and people can uh grab it modify

792
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:49,239
it which I don't know whether we want to

793
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:54,000
see that um but for further uh actually

794
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:56,838
the open group we formed a nonprofit uh

795
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:01,599
organization um I think two two years

796
00:42:56,838 --> 00:43:04,799
ago so we are um having a a nonprofit

797
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:09,039
organization that we have board member

798
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:13,920
uh we also are uh we have the capability

799
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:17,318
to respond to uh allocate the founding

800
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:20,200
between different uh science teams and

801
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:22,358
how the Google engine is involved I

802
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:25,719
don't think they really claim the

803
00:43:22,358 --> 00:43:29,078
ownership but uh I do see the the tricky

804
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:32,480
part because among our like a in group

805
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:35,079
discussion we discussed a lot about when

806
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:39,760
Google's engine is going to start to

807
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:41,119
charge us and how much it will charge us

808
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:45,040
and this

809
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:48,760
is Hospital yeah and all the discussion

810
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:48,759
about open AI is is very

811
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:59,839
similar yes yeah but um well so far

812
00:43:56,199 --> 00:44:03,719
Google engine has been supportive but uh

813
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:04,799
we had some discussions about that yeah

814
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:08,159
thank

815
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,160
you other

816
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:12,800
questions question so it seems like most

817
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:16,159
of the applications have been focused on

818
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,880
sort of water stress in the crops yeah

819
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:20,399
and in Upstate New York we often might

820
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,079
have the other problem where we have too

821
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:28,039
much water I'm specifically think about

822
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:30,559
soil and nitrous oxide loss and I wonder

823
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:32,838
if this tool could be useful for making

824
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:35,240
like field level predictions as to sort

825
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:37,239
of timing a fertilizer application or

826
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:40,118
spatial distribution of fertilizer to

827
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:42,879
try to minimize into to find wet spots

828
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:46,079
and then avoid those wet spots or wet t

829
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:49,400
yes for sure I think this will be a very

830
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:51,318
uh interesting application and actually

831
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:54,240
uh like through the last two days

832
00:44:51,318 --> 00:44:57,199
workshop with gack team we were thinking

833
00:44:54,239 --> 00:45:00,759
about because for the vineard here you

834
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:04,358
know not just like field crops wyard um

835
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:08,119
Apple alard they all have this uh like

836
00:45:04,358 --> 00:45:10,920
more water issue um so uh we were

837
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:15,480
thinking about to explore the data to

838
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:19,000
see whether the higher ET could be

839
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:22,199
related to some of these uh like what

840
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:26,079
you talked about um the the unarm

841
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:28,399
management and could be link with the

842
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:32,400
past and dis

843
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:35,440
Yep this will be I I think something new

844
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,639
to to the ET Community to

845
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,639
explore thank

846
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:44,519
you this has been a production of

847
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:47,519
Cornell University on the web at

848
