1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,360
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:14,558
University again my name is Loreno

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:18,278
caponiti I'm a farmer in uh in central

4
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:21,480
Italy this is part of the landscape that

5
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:25,879
I can look at from my place which is not

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,880
a bad landscape at all but is

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:34,079
um but is uh somewhat

8
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:37,719
challenging uh in a barious of in a in a

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,120
in in a number of ways uh again we are

10
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:41,399
based in a little town that is called

11
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:44,599
tuscania which is about 50 miles north

12
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,719
from Rome uh tuscania is not in Tuscan

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,198
today but used to be about the same

14
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,840
thing about 2800 years ago then some

15
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:55,640
type of accident happened but anyway

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,440
again this is uh this is where we are

17
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,558
this is lake brano lake P Lake bolena

18
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:04,198
this is all a volcanic bridge and we're

19
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:09,959
just at the edge of it just where the

20
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:16,039
volcanic soils end into onto the penic

21
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:19,559
uh um uh Clays below we have 125 Acres

22
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,920
of total surface uh very different

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,560
topography though again you can see here

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:30,799
all all of this it is all Cliffs where

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:33,000
the lava come to an end so our so oil is

26
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,920
very different from the top part of the

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,799
farm to the bottom part of the farm

28
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,439
which is good of course because

29
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,520
diversity is always good but it's also

30
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,438
challenging in a sense because you know

31
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,200
sometimes you want to deal with just

32
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,639
what you know and the more you have and

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,960
the more you have to know but uh but

34
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,840
that's good this is the other side of

35
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:54,199
the landscape that we have again this is

36
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,520
looking out of the ridge where the main

37
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,240
house is this is the valley we have a

38
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,840
little river stream of water that is per

39
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,679
but we don't pump any water out of it

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,439
because it's so overexploited we are

41
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:12,599
trying to be sustainable if we can but

42
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:15,639
again this is to show how our topography

43
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:17,919
sometimes is very uh peculiar we have

44
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:21,639
all this type of cliffs that are very

45
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:23,958
vertical and you can see the Tua rock

46
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:27,279
that is a volcanic rock the volcanic uh

47
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:30,360
type of formation that is very light and

48
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,039
very porous and is ring a lot of water

49
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,360
but it ends abruptly with these Cliffs

50
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:38,840
and all these Cliffs have been worked

51
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,519
out in the pasing Centuries by mankind

52
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,680
to the point that we had this single

53
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:44,920
Standing Rock that that that this is all

54
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,719
that remains of a cliff that was there

55
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:51,799
that was completely hollowed out either

56
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:54,239
to carve out materials for building or

57
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:58,000
for any other kind of purposes that we

58
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:01,039
can think of like this is again on the

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,039
farm sorry about this

60
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:09,039
this is a little sort of a open ear cave

61
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:12,199
this is manmade this was C by the atrans

62
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:15,120
that is a pre- Roman civilization that

63
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:19,759
was using our grounds let's say like

64
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:22,799
that uh some 20 28 to 27 to 2600 years

65
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:25,199
ago basically this was carved out in

66
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:28,239
order to let a road go by the atasan

67
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:31,359
were very peculiar in in and very good

68
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:35,039
at modifying the graphy especially for

69
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,920
having roads go by and this is the oh

70
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,919
thank you

71
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:43,959
the um the the track of an ancient road

72
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,680
that was part of a system of road that

73
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:49,519
later became one of the first road to

74
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,159
ever be paved by the Romans now it's not

75
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,079
that everybody in this world has

76
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:58,039
something like that in on his farm you

77
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:59,680
know and uh and um yeah I know it sounds

78
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:03,039
sexy but it's not that easy sometimes

79
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,040
when you have to deal with it you

80
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:11,079
know one one of the tombs these are

81
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,120
Graves dug by the same people the sth

82
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:15,400
and the 6th Century BC was kind of the

83
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,399
peak of the truscan civilization in in

84
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:22,478
our in our region and they used to dig

85
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:25,478
all these uh underground cavities to use

86
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:27,959
as Graves that they wanted to look like

87
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:30,120
houses and they were decorated as houses

88
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:31,719
and um and this is the main Legacy that

89
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,319
we have of them because their actual

90
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,680
houses were built in mud and and and um

91
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:40,439
and wood so we have very little left of

92
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,360
it while we have this nice underground

93
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:45,719
cavity this is all on the farm this is a

94
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:49,840
colum bium this was this used to be uh a

95
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:52,039
deposit of sary ears so they were buing

96
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:55,560
the people or they were incinerating

97
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:57,879
them but it's kind of funny you look at

98
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,160
all these Peak marks you know you can

99
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:02,519
still see today

100
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,639
what the people have been working on and

101
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,399
this is that's the same part but but you

102
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,199
can you can have those Peak marks that

103
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:13,239
go for miles all all around and um this

104
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,800
is a part of the archaeology map of the

105
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,840
farm this is the northern part of the

106
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,000
farm we saw this is the Little Road

107
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,599
Track that I show you we have another

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,600
one that is bigger one this is the one

109
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,520
that was actually paved we have here the

110
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,199
paving stones that are still on site and

111
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,079
each of these dots is meaning something

112
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:35,360
each of this dot is one ruin that has

113
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:37,399
been there you know for a few thousands

114
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,520
of years again the most of most of the

115
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:43,679
tombs were uh installed by 7 6th Century

116
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:47,758
BC but then in the middle age all of

117
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,918
those were used as houses so has been uh

118
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:55,879
a continuous flow history basically that

119
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:55,879
I feel on me while farming this piece of

120
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:00,519
land and this is one of the most

121
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,639
according to me most interesting

122
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:05,159
features that we have so up there is one

123
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,519
little tomb but down here this is the

124
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,120
entrance to a water

125
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:11,439
tunnel that was again dug by the same

126
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,439
people about the same time of course

127
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:17,519
it's hard to exactly tell when but we

128
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,079
can say for sure that is pre Roman we

129
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,439
can we can probably date it to the same

130
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:25,719
time frame you

131
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:29,079
know I will say 8th Century BC though

132
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,919
it's uh it's more a matter of picturing

133
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:32,918
a Time time frame between the 11th and

134
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:36,159
the 7th Century BC that's when the

135
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:37,799
atrasan civilization converted a wild

136
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,759
set of marshes and woods that was

137
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,199
Central Italy into one of the most

138
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:46,280
sophisticated agricultural system of all

139
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:48,478
times their farming system was I mean

140
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:51,478
it's a lot closer to what was you know

141
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,800
maybe 100 years ago than what it is what

142
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:55,758
we're doing now is to what we were doing

143
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,560
100 years ago and this is something that

144
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,240
uh has struck me but a long story short

145
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,360
these are water tunnel that are cut

146
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,038
directly into the bedro I had luck a few

147
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,080
years ago to be participating in with a

148
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:10,360
group of experts that were studying the

149
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,399
same type of devices in different 12

150
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,840
different countries across the

151
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,120
Mediterranean in the Middle East so it

152
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,918
was very interesting for me to start

153
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,199
from something that I have out on the

154
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:23,359
farm and be able to compare with what

155
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,400
people have and what people are doing in

156
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,800
other parts of the world a long story

157
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:31,519
short these are underground cavities

158
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:34,120
that are man-made that creating um a

159
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,959
cavity so is a depression into into the

160
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,120
bedro they car directly into into the

161
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:41,239
bedr mainly around the world are used

162
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,680
for water collection especially in AR

163
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:48,918
countries in um in um in uh in our

164
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,400
geology is they serve a

165
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:53,799
multi-purpose uh surfaces is water

166
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:56,318
collection but is also uh land

167
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,560
reclaiming from on top diversion of

168
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:02,080
water from the streams and they use the

169
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,800
the trust can they used it to modify a

170
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:10,279
lot the uh the orography of the of the

171
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:12,439
of the of the terrain this is a plan

172
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:14,359
section of an ideal canut which is

173
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:16,158
basically the same type of devices we're

174
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,319
talking about a

175
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:20,478
subhorizontal tunnel underground tunnel

176
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,598
that is duck directly into the Bedrock

177
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:25,519
with walls that are unlined and let the

178
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:27,959
water seep in or out of the tunnel into

179
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,959
the into the into the Bedrock and then a

180
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:35,199
number of shafts that connecting the

181
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:36,799
tunnel to the um to the to the surface I

182
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,399
think this is quite the whole thing is

183
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,679
quite interesting this

184
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,278
is this is a passive system of course so

185
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,359
water is collected from the underground

186
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:48,799
into the tunnel and it automatically

187
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,200
flows naturally flows onto the surface

188
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:53,679
so there is water coming up to the

189
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,040
surface available for human activity

190
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:58,439
that wouldn't be there whether it not

191
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:01,240
for the people who had dug this type of

192
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,760
devices even more interesting is the

193
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,839
fact and I was in the beginning you know

194
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,759
was I was kind of uh giving it for

195
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,160
granted when we bought the farm 20 years

196
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:12,720
ago the guy we bought the farm from he

197
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:14,360
took me there and say you know if you

198
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,680
don't periodically go in there and do

199
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,959
some maintenance this thing will clog up

200
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:20,278
and water wouldn't come out of it

201
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:23,399
anymore I said okay you know one more

202
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:26,519
task to do but then if you think of

203
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,360
it if you think of it is not banal that

204
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:31,399
water is coming out of something that

205
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,200
was carved almost 3,000 years ago that

206
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:35,120
is

207
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,879
sustainable and by going into and doing

208
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,200
some repair work I'm the last one who

209
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:43,838
joined the club that is a club who

210
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:46,079
started 2,800 years ago so that's again

211
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,560
that's not banal and and why is the

212
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:49,719
water coming out of it because this is

213
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:52,119
sustainable water collect collecting

214
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,000
it's sustainable because it's passive so

215
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,919
it will never be over exploiting the

216
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,799
resource is sustainable because there

217
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:01,838
are a multiple M multiplicity of factors

218
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:03,879
that are coming in action in order to

219
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,560
make this water available that is water

220
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:08,480
condensation water collection from the

221
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:10,399
Bedrock and all that kind of stuff uh

222
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,440
again a cross-section of a canat you can

223
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,919
see that there is exchange of water

224
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,560
between the underground and and the and

225
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:20,519
the inside of the tunnel that goes both

226
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,078
way so sometimes the water is draining

227
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,720
into or sometimes the water is draining

228
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:26,479
out of it and replenishing the water

229
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,920
table and this is particularly important

230
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,320
in our geology when we have multiplicity

231
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:34,159
of strata that are you know superimposed

232
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,278
to one another because our volcanic

233
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:39,519
activity went on uh for a number of

234
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:43,240
about a million years and but this is

235
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,799
also quite important for contrasting the

236
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,600
effect of climate change in our climate

237
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:50,399
climate change is concentrating

238
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,720
waterfall more and more into Peaks and

239
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,958
alternating with droughts and our soil

240
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,519
is very porous our Bedrock is able to

241
00:10:54,958 --> 00:11:00,638
retain about onethird of our rainfall so

242
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,720
we can weend the trust can actually use

243
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,799
that in order to infiltrate title flow

244
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:10,560
into the underground then will be able

245
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:14,639
to be used again in the past um in um in

246
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,638
a future and late at later

247
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:22,159
times this is the this is the map of the

248
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,600
tunnel that we have we it's actually

249
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,159
getting the exit of it is aligned with

250
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,440
the church actually is the church to be

251
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,480
aligned with the exit of the tunnel

252
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,200
since the tunnel was there firstc

253
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,879
there's a meaning of the church is that

254
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,120
again these type of devices are water

255
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:37,439
producing so you walk into the tunnel

256
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,078
all the length of the tunnel you don't

257
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,519
see a spring you don't see the water

258
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:42,638
coming in but you see the water coming

259
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:48,240
out which is pretty magic that's why it

260
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:50,919
has always been um associated with um a

261
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,079
metaphysical uh thing well I did a study

262
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:55,759
there are a number of those around our

263
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:59,399
area this is uh this is the one this is

264
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,078
the farm this is the natural con consy

265
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,679
of

266
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:05,559
tuscania um again very different geology

267
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,799
this is the study that we did around the

268
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:10,119
tunnel in order to understand and

269
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:12,559
actually determine that the water tunnel

270
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,399
is not hitting the water table so that

271
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:18,159
water is sustainable even because it's

272
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:20,320
not part of a common I mean is a it's a

273
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:22,519
resource that is shared that is very

274
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,920
limited in in regard to the community

275
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:27,000
who is using it and is related to a very

276
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:29,559
limited part portion of land that's why

277
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,360
the water tunnel the the water that is

278
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:33,559
coming out of the water tunnel is is

279
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,000
unpolluted while we got plenty of

280
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:38,399
nitrates in this one okay because this

281
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,320
this is a much vaster resource H you

282
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,919
know but but the vaster the resource and

283
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,519
the vaster the community who is using it

284
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,639
and the more likely there will be

285
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,839
tensions you know so this is not the

286
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:50,480
case for a water tunnel and and again

287
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,839
I'm happy to do maintenance this is a

288
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,560
friend of mine actually from New York

289
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,040
City who is helping me out

290
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:59,719
sometime and it's good to know that the

291
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:02,319
club who started with the at trasan 2500

292
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,839
years ago can unlist people that are

293
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:09,360
willing to be part of it and so we are

294
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:12,320
still having water today and also this

295
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:16,079
is this is not on the farm this is Lake

296
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:20,120
vco but is just to remind how the atrans

297
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:23,120
were able in managing the the territory

298
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,078
this lake has a an artificial Emery

299
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,159
which is underground which is a tunnel

300
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:29,879
which is giving water to the city of

301
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:31,480
ronon that was cut basically to lower

302
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:33,320
the level of the lake so that all this

303
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,000
northern part of the crater could be put

304
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,760
in into cultivation the the atrasan did

305
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,480
this in a number of different cases and

306
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:43,439
it's kind of extraordinary

307
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,159
to think of what they did in terms of

308
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,639
again creating called arable land and

309
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:51,759
cultivat land and also this is not the

310
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:53,680
legacy of the at truskin maybe not

311
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:57,839
everybody knows

312
00:13:53,679 --> 00:14:01,359
but it's them who started to select out

313
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,320
of a Cardon an AR choke so this is in my

314
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,039
garden and I'm happy to have in my

315
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,639
garden something that is going that is

316
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,799
keeping going that is is still a legacy

317
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:11,079
of that land not because of the

318
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:13,198
Topography of the land but because of

319
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:15,919
the people who used to live there at the

320
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:18,799
same time these are some of my o

321
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:21,319
trees these are some of the younger guys

322
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,359
and um these are out of my of my place

323
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,040
and this is also a legacy of the atrans

324
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,079
because it's still the atrans that by

325
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:31,519
converting you know all that in to an

326
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:34,000
agricultural system they started the

327
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:37,320
cultivation of ol Tree in in in central

328
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,559
Italy and this is a very important uh

329
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,839
concept for me especially speaking with

330
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:45,119
olive tree you might wonder why you know

331
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,600
is the Olive Tree that is quoted 76 time

332
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,879
in the Old Testament alone and it's not

333
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,920
a plum and you might you might wonder

334
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:54,278
why it's two branches of AIT tree that

335
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:57,240
is into the logo of the United Nation

336
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:59,519
and it's not just you know a palm well

337
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,240
the reason is that

338
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,720
a tree is of all cultivated plants is

339
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,440
the one that has the longest lifespan it

340
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,800
can stay there and produce for a

341
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:12,040
thousand years and when you're planting

342
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:14,319
something like this the first time you

343
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:16,240
want to be well settled you don't want

344
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,240
to be a nomadic Gathering anymore you

345
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,399
want to be settled in a society that is

346
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,560
giving you the power to defend your work

347
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,278
if push come to shop which means that

348
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:27,879
you planting something that is going to

349
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:30,000
stay there you want to be identified in

350
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:32,720
society so family names and private

351
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,759
names concept like property private

352
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,079
property of land uh a structured Society

353
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:41,318
with somebody to refer to if you're in

354
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:43,519
trouble uh structure society means that

355
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:45,599
of course the that Community is able to

356
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,959
farm in a way that is creating a surplus

357
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,639
or it wouldn't be possible to have a

358
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,758
structur society but the structur

359
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,759
society is also implying differentiated

360
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:57,120
architecture and so we end up with the

361
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:59,318
city but also writing these are all

362
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,078
features of what we call the urban

363
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:02,759
revolution of the atrasan between the

364
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:07,039
11th and the 7th

365
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:09,360
Century BC they introduced all of these

366
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,439
elements including the Olive Tree and

367
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,440
including the water tunnel these are all

368
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,399
part of a of a big picture in which is

369
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,360
impossible to determine the relation

370
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:19,919
between cause and effect but it's

371
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,039
amazing to see how they were able to put

372
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:26,360
all this in action and how are we still

373
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:29,318
dealing with uh with the legacy of this

374
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,720
again all tree lives so long if you look

375
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:33,159
at this twig this is another uh

376
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,399
peculiarity of the Olive Tree the olive

377
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:38,318
tree has buds even in grownup parts of

378
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:40,440
the plant and is the only plant that can

379
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:42,559
survive being chopped off the ground and

380
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,759
transplanted even when it's big but this

381
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:47,679
also has a different meaning because if

382
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,959
you let it go in its so I I said it in

383
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,559
its Soul anol tree is a shrub because it

384
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:55,758
will just not have one main trunk but it

385
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:58,559
will have a multiple uh shootings which

386
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:01,079
means in turn that the trunk there is is

387
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:04,798
a man-made thing thanks to 200 years of

388
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:06,759
clipping of this clipping so this also

389
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,918
is a good metaphor for a you know a

390
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:11,480
legacy and and and an alliance between

391
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:13,959
man and uh and nature and this is

392
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,759
another part of why the Olive Tree is so

393
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:17,798
looked upon you know it's kind of a

394
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:21,160
symbol of all the western civilization

395
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:23,318
if we if we want to you know the Greeks

396
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,000
and the atrans they started to divide

397
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:26,558
people between civilized or barbarians

398
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,240
whether they were cultivating or not the

399
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:34,678
ol tree and the and the grap Vine

400
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,679
sorry about this uh and

401
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:39,759
yet this is not the only these are not

402
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:43,759
the only legacies that we are dealing

403
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:46,240
with while farming in Italy you know

404
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:49,038
this is all yellow but it wasn't so in

405
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,599
the past this is all green but it's not

406
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:53,919
necessarily going to be green in the

407
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:57,399
future you know it's uh kind of

408
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,120
striking this is three

409
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,400
charts

410
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:04,319
sorry three maps on the it's called

411
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,600
aridity index I don't know if my

412
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:09,759
translation is good enough but anyway is

413
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:13,279
the combination of the amount of water

414
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:14,879
and the state of soils that we have okay

415
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:18,158
and this is

416
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,799
1950 and this is 60 to the ' 90s and

417
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:25,960
this is 71 to

418
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:28,639
2000 now my farm is exactly here exactly

419
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,880
on that line between that yellow and the

420
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,000
green and that line wasn't there 40

421
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,159
years

422
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,480
ago

423
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:43,799
sorry okay but anyway

424
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:47,079
um so what can we do about all this

425
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:49,720
um uh okay what can we do about this

426
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:52,000
this is how we are managing the farm

427
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,079
today of course all the different colors

428
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,359
are have a meaning but uh basically

429
00:18:55,079 --> 00:19:01,199
houses olive trees these are the blue is

430
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:04,479
where the animals are or where you know

431
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,480
those pads that are mainly for Animals

432
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,000
our animals are horses and cows

433
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,480
basically and then we have a few pigs uh

434
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:17,519
the green is the uh vegetable gardens or

435
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:19,798
future Orchards uh the red is arble the

436
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,319
yellow is those land that can only be

437
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:24,480
pastured even because they're Woods or

438
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:27,480
you know pasture and all that kind of of

439
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,599
stuff so we are trying to our concept is

440
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:34,279
as an ecological concept we want to add

441
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:37,000
as many uh items into elements into our

442
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:39,279
into our ecosystem so instead of doing a

443
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,519
monoculture of course we are we're going

444
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:46,639
to oh okay I'm sorry about that um add

445
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:49,359
more uh uh elements to it of course you

446
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,000
can this is easy to read for everybody

447
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,798
uh but this is kind of an outline of all

448
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,440
the stuff that is going on in the farm

449
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:57,879
is basically we're working basically on

450
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,919
four different levels one is farming

451
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,799
proper one is tourism one is education

452
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:05,960
and one is nonprofit and I believe that

453
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:08,480
the sustainability of the whole Farm

454
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,880
will come from the interaction of these

455
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,960
four different levels among themselves

456
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,640
hopefully one day but so what have we

457
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,798
done so far dealing with all these

458
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,799
legacies um

459
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,720
well it came

460
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:30,678
easy I was lucky enough that it came

461
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,360
easy for me to start with dealing with

462
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:35,559
the olive trees I didn't have a clue

463
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,119
what an olive tree was when I started I

464
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:39,158
didn't have a clue of how to prun it I

465
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:41,399
didn't have the clue on how to harvest

466
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:43,760
it and yet these guys were still giving

467
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,519
me one of the best product in the world

468
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:48,240
I was happy I was lucky enough to start

469
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:52,279
traveling in this part of the world and

470
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:56,519
meeting with some top- knot chefs and

471
00:20:52,279 --> 00:21:00,240
they are the one who I owe the fact that

472
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:01,679
I recognize how the value of this thing

473
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,159
again in the beginning you know you're

474
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,200
in Italy and everybody in Italy has an

475
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:07,200
olive tree you know you're a farmer and

476
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,120
everybody is farming Olive Tree so you

477
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,679
think well it's a l tree you know and

478
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:15,239
then you start traveling in New York

479
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,798
City and you got your product

480
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,720
acknowledged and you find out that

481
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:22,798
simply by harvesting something that is

482
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,440
on your farm and pressing you're doing

483
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,200
something that is unique is not the best

484
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,679
in the world in terms that they might be

485
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,278
potentially

486
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:34,038
other product that are just as good but

487
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:37,599
different it's it's amazing you know I

488
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:41,519
just have to go get it you know and uh

489
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:45,399
and I think we've gone a I I I've gone a

490
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:47,480
bit far I mean it took me 15 years to

491
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,519
understand how to p a tree but I'm

492
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:53,038
finally finding the way to put those

493
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:55,359
back into into action we found out we

494
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:58,240
put in Action a few things like of

495
00:21:55,359 --> 00:22:00,798
course all of our Groves have grass we

496
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,880
are mulching the clipping right on side

497
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:05,200
instead of burning like everybody else

498
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,600
is doing around us honestly I don't

499
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,440
understand why they keep burning because

500
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:11,319
it takes a lot of more energy and a lot

501
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,640
more you know time and is all carbon

502
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:16,519
going to feed the greenhouse effect

503
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,520
instead of of feeding the of feeding the

504
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:21,000
um of feeding the Earth basically the

505
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:23,359
ground I'm proud to say that we have

506
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,038
orchids in this or CH because we never

507
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:32,038
till you know and um um and then again

508
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:35,558
we Harvest we prune and we uh sell I'm

509
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:37,558
happy to say that I was able to reach

510
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:39,918
again a few chefs in New City they're

511
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:42,519
buying from me uh a couple of the

512
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,278
biggest most famous restaurant in this

513
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:48,038
part of the world which of course is

514
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:49,480
helping me out if not directly done

515
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:51,558
under the economic point of view which

516
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,558
of course helps it helped me out because

517
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:55,519
I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't

518
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:58,720
for that you know it helped me out in

519
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:01,079
building you know something around that

520
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,400
uh this picture is also to to remind

521
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:06,599
that this might also the whole thing

522
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,159
might be a risk climate is changing and

523
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:09,639
the climate change is going to affect

524
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,120
the production of our

525
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,799
trees particularly in two ways I mean

526
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:18,839
milder climate through the winter might

527
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:21,158
inhibit uh blossoms and especially

528
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:24,399
there's a the olive tree has very

529
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:26,640
peculiar water needs that are basically

530
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,919
coordinated so far with how the season

531
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,000
goes in terms of r we have two peaks in

532
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:33,000
the spring one in the spring one in the

533
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,200
fall and this long drought in the summer

534
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,720
that's something that the olive trees

535
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,159
like as long as they have rains in the

536
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,000
fall or they have rains in that

537
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:43,559
particular moment in the in the in the

538
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,839
spring if that shifts then the whole

539
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:48,879
thing might be might be affected this is

540
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:52,199
particular particularly true with olive

541
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,760
oil that is a peculiar substance I like

542
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,200
to be a producer of olive oil because

543
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,599
it's the only uh substance it's the only

544
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,960
food that comes to the table after being

545
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,959
processed that is still alive there's no

546
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,200
heat no fermentation involved in the

547
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,120
making it's just a squeezing which means

548
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,360
that the enzyme that are into the olive

549
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:09,798
when the olive is on the tree they don't

550
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:12,599
get killed during the processing which

551
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:14,639
is a blast because it's like I mean

552
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:16,719
figure that you're growing tomatoes you

553
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,559
would wish that all of your customer

554
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,360
could eat the tomato right out of the

555
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:22,519
vine in the middle of the Garden in

556
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:25,558
August that's what I do with my olive

557
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:28,359
oil I can do that even in New York 5,000

558
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:31,119
miles away or 6 months later because

559
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:32,558
this keeps being fresh because again I

560
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:34,000
don't need to process it I don't need to

561
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:36,319
pasturize because there's no bacteria

562
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,640
that can grow in it but the the the

563
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:42,079
other side is that anything that is into

564
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,559
the oil is not there because of me but

565
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:45,759
it's there because of my plants and my

566
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:47,839
ter if my terror is changing because the

567
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:51,278
climate is Shifting I might not be able

568
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:55,398
to um to do that anymore uh just another

569
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:58,440
picture just briefly go through um olive

570
00:24:55,398 --> 00:25:00,158
oil making this is the

571
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,840
some of the olives getting into the into

572
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,720
the olive meal the picture is taken at

573
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,918
night because again it's all a matter of

574
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,000
enzyme so we want to inhibit certain

575
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,440
enzyme to start working and that's we

576
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,079
why we Harvest during the day and we

577
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,159
press at night and um and all that um I

578
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:17,678
have other things to say so I'm going

579
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:19,679
through and then maybe at at the Q&amp;A if

580
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,798
anybody has more question about it I

581
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:25,278
would be happy to uh to come to come

582
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:28,200
back at it but again this is to say that

583
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:30,200
one of the this is how we deal with one

584
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,640
of the legacies that we're dealing with

585
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,640
on on our farm I'm I'm really happy I'm

586
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,320
grateful to be dealing with something

587
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,759
that made me famous in New City and I

588
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:43,519
just found it there I just had to you

589
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:47,038
know pick it up put in in action in a

590
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:50,278
way that would be sustainable uh for for

591
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:52,480
me and uh and I have a a great product

592
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:55,558
that is taking me you know all around

593
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,558
the world

594
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,200
um

595
00:25:58,278 --> 00:26:01,919
how

596
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:06,480
else did we deal with these legacies how

597
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:09,960
else is did those legacies uh Inspire

598
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:14,159
what we're doing today on the farm well

599
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:15,960
definitely the water tunnel was a great

600
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,799
inspiration again in the beginning I

601
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,079
didn't care about it you know it's just

602
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:23,000
a water tunnel you go in and they silt

603
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:26,158
it but then you start realizing that hey

604
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,359
you know this is not banal so I started

605
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:32,240
to try to understand how is it possible

606
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:34,398
that something that was done 3,000 years

607
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,880
ago is still giving us water today and

608
00:26:34,398 --> 00:26:38,000
again there are a few keys to the

609
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,440
sustainability of it and again one key

610
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,398
is the passive function so it's led by

611
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:47,200
gravity another key to the function of

612
00:26:43,398 --> 00:26:49,398
it is that it it it allows for water

613
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,480
exchanges all the way through the length

614
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:54,119
of the tunnel and the reason why you see

615
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,519
water coming out of it and you don't see

616
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:58,599
the water coming into it it's because

617
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:00,278
the water that is collected there is

618
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:02,678
basically there because of what we call

619
00:27:00,278 --> 00:27:04,640
Hidden rains we call Hidden rains

620
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:07,798
because you don't see it but it's just

621
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,000
basically a condensation of micro

622
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:12,839
quantities micro droplets of water that

623
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,759
could get condensed or could gather you

624
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:19,678
know a micro droplet per every square

625
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:21,679
inch multiply per T of meters or

626
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,320
hundreds of meter of length of a tunnel

627
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,519
end up in something tangible so

628
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:30,038
basically these two concept you know

629
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:33,319
water d by gravity and the combination

630
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:36,319
of very small quantities multiplied by

631
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:39,960
very large numbers that are at the base

632
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:42,599
of uh of the function of the of the

633
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:46,519
water tunnel and based on these two

634
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:48,839
principles I was able to

635
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:52,200
reconsider all of the water management

636
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:55,079
system on the farm so now we have a

637
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:58,640
little pump that is operated by the sun

638
00:27:55,079 --> 00:28:01,359
and a number of containers that are

639
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,200
you know this pole that are put on

640
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:07,199
different places and different height of

641
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,679
uh on the hill flag the concept is that

642
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,360
the PV is operating a pump that is the

643
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,320
only pump that can go straight into a PV

644
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:18,079
system because it's a non- rotative it's

645
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:20,879
a piston pump that is hooked up directly

646
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,839
to the PV system and is starting to pump

647
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,640
as soon as the sun is out and it will go

648
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:27,519
on until the sun is not there anymore so

649
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,360
this goes on and on and on but of of

650
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:32,798
course the quantity per minute is small

651
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:35,759
but the minutes are a lot of them so we

652
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:38,798
can lift a lot of water every day as

653
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:43,038
long as we have somewhere to story but

654
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:45,079
the somewhere to story again this is I

655
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:48,200
this might all sounds banal it wasn't

656
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:49,879
banal to me to put it in action the the

657
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,880
concept of storing water is a concept

658
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,159
that implies where do I store it and

659
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,559
what do I need it for so we ended up

660
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:59,919
having five different containers right

661
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:01,839
now that are get filled each is filled

662
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,759
every day and each is filled by the

663
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:05,599
Overflow of the previous one and if

664
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:06,798
you're feeding each tank with the

665
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:08,839
Overflow of the previous one it means

666
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:10,879
that you want to know in advance where

667
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:13,359
your water where you want your water to

668
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,278
be and what are your needs so the first

669
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:18,398
tag is for portable use the second is

670
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:19,759
for drinking for the water for the

671
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:21,959
drinking water for the horses and the

672
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:24,038
animals and then we have three that are

673
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,319
feeding our Gardens that are at

674
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:28,359
different heights uh this is one of my

675
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:30,278
collaborator checking on the quality of

676
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:33,079
water I'm sorry but I didn't have any

677
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:35,119
other picture of the of the of the tank

678
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:37,599
and then there are three tanks that are

679
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:40,119
feeding through our garden and then we

680
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:41,918
are just it's not that we want to be

681
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:44,678
something that is stuck in the past

682
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,519
we're using modern technology but I like

683
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:50,120
the fact that this technology this way

684
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:52,519
of using modern technology was inspired

685
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:55,199
by the past because it's somewhat

686
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:58,038
holistic again the one choice of

687
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,759
changing the pump has brought me to have

688
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:02,359
to invent where to put the containers

689
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:05,000
and the way the containers are

690
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:07,798
distributed along the hill flank and all

691
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,038
that um and so I'm proud to say that now

692
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:12,158
we're running on zero emission in terms

693
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:15,000
of water management for the gardens and

694
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,000
and all the animals on the

695
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:22,278
farm

696
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:24,918
lastly how did we deal with these uh

697
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:27,960
with the Legacy again we want to share

698
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:29,240
so we combine with the local count

699
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,159
government who is running the

700
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:35,120
Conservancy we the only Farm who was

701
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,039
able to actually build a trail and is

702
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:39,719
open to the public anybody can come and

703
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:42,720
see our farm 5 days a week between 10:

704
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:46,480
a.m. and 1 hour before the sunset this

705
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,960
is just open because we feel that a tomb

706
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,679
doesn't belong to us it belongs to

707
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,079
mankind you know we don't want to be

708
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,320
closed we want to be open and the same

709
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,119
time this is bringing people to the farm

710
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,359
which is good because we want the people

711
00:30:56,119 --> 00:31:00,319
to be there because you you know so this

712
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:03,038
is just briefly something that we had to

713
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:06,558
build for uh for the trail this is a

714
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:10,919
staircase that is parting partly held by

715
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:13,200
trees we had this U uh these are the way

716
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:14,720
we since part of it is on bedrock and

717
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,159
parties on the trees we had to invent

718
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,679
this system of letting the tree swing

719
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:22,519
this was a nightmare to design but it

720
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:25,240
was so much fun to build so I'm proud to

721
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:28,558
say that it's there now and uh it's free

722
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:30,240
of access uh also so this is a piece of

723
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,200
A Shard of pot that was found on the

724
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,038
farm this is actually a dolum which is a

725
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:39,759
big base that the Roman used to store

726
00:31:36,038 --> 00:31:42,000
wine or oil so there's there's a legacy

727
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,960
in there another way of leg of dealing

728
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,759
with that is we're hosting we are

729
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,759
actually holding uh archaeological

730
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:51,759
excavation every year so we're cleaning

731
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:54,558
up with the help of a community of

732
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:56,798
people including the government we are

733
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,638
cleaning up a piece of you know these

734
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:00,960
are this is some of the this is kind of

735
00:31:58,638 --> 00:32:03,119
amazing this is one of the beds you can

736
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,960
see the pillow and the bed leg it's kind

737
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:10,719
of cool and um and we're hosting uh

738
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:13,880
seminar and events on the farm and um

739
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:17,159
and and so that's all the part that was

740
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:19,360
inspired by the by the legacies but of

741
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:21,960
course you know where's the food coming

742
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:24,879
from you know these are all nice ideas

743
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,399
but these guys need to eat these guys

744
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,360
need to eat and these guys need to eat

745
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:31,558
as well you know so there's there's more

746
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:34,359
than that the farm

747
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:37,398
um I told you in terms of agricultural

748
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:39,519
production we have uh about 10 acres of

749
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:41,278
olive trees we have about 30 horses on

750
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:44,319
the farm we have eight cows we have a

751
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:47,960
few pigs for us we have about couple of

752
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:49,798
Acres of gardens we're looking into uh

753
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,360
being more and more self-sufficient as

754
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:55,200
much as we can even because there's no

755
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:57,038
point in wanting to output on the market

756
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,720
some of your production if simply the

757
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:01,599
Market is not able to pay for it you

758
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,960
know uh in order for you to make uh to

759
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:06,918
make uh to make money enough to make a

760
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:09,720
living but anyway this is just very uh

761
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:12,480
you will know I mean grass grass can be

762
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,399
Graz grazing can be considered an

763
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,000
intercropping but grass is also

764
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:22,038
protecting soil from soil erosion is you

765
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:24,599
know uh holding uh moist and water so uh

766
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:26,158
of course the cows and the horses are

767
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:28,240
grazing in two completely different

768
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,760
system because one is a polygastric one

769
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,599
is a monogastric so one like the Tall

770
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:36,119
Grass one like the Short Grass one like

771
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:39,079
the uh grasses and the other one likes

772
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:42,079
legumes and and each of the two are able

773
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:43,918
to uh interrupt the cycle of the

774
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:45,558
intestinal parasite of the other so they

775
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,600
can they can actually help each other

776
00:33:45,558 --> 00:33:50,879
out um this is also to show how big our

777
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:53,959
trees are right now these are guys that

778
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,440
were planted in early 50s uh they're

779
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:59,919
still fairly young in terms of a trees

780
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:02,960
and still a tree like this can provide a

781
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:06,799
solid 250 to maybe 300 lbs of Olives

782
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,679
every year which is not bad um also

783
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:10,679
where's the food here's some zucchinis

784
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:15,358
zucchinis with a view they grow happy

785
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:18,039
you know and uh this is uh the layout of

786
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:20,398
the garden and what will be the Grove

787
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:23,279
this is not actually there yet but but

788
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:25,319
the garden is uh organized in 20

789
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,000
different fields we actually have a

790
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:31,079
10year rotation which might sound a bit

791
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,199
too complicated but it's okay because we

792
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:37,159
have arti chokes and alpha alpha in it

793
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:40,000
that are staying you know for a total of

794
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:42,519
almost 5 years so half of half of our of

795
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,519
our soil we don't really have to look

796
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:49,320
after um what are we doing okay we have

797
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:52,119
we're going the other way so we got ARS

798
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,240
for two and a half year we chop the

799
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:57,480
aroke off what we're doing is actually

800
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:59,679
we take these plants off after they

801
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,880
finish producing most part of the people

802
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:03,519
they will leave it until October in

803
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,400
order for them to spring back so that

804
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:07,000
they can take clones out of it what

805
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,920
we're doing we're just taking the whole

806
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,760
plant off and Transplant it you know and

807
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,039
then let it come and then we transplant

808
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,160
it in the next field so we actually are

809
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:19,920
able to use this field in the summer for

810
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:23,639
brasas uh or winter squash whatever is

811
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,680
still still available there and um also

812
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:27,480
what we're doing then we we got we got

813
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:29,199
of course the reason why we have 10

814
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,838
rotation is because the bulk of our

815
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:34,639
summer crops is night shades so we have

816
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:36,239
two twice the size for night shades than

817
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:38,879
for the other families and that's why we

818
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:42,118
have a 10e rotation so that they come

819
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,480
basically back uh every every five and

820
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:47,280
what we're doing for especially for

821
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,679
tomatoes it works really well because

822
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,680
these are coming out of the alpha alpha

823
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:53,519
they don't need but for tomatoes what

824
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:56,318
we're doing we are planting the hairy

825
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:58,759
vetch ahead of time and then we just cut

826
00:35:56,318 --> 00:36:00,719
it and use it as a mulch so we are

827
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,599
transplanting on S instead of

828
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:05,159
transplanting on till land this is kind

829
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:07,880
of important in our climate because this

830
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:10,480
uh allows us to anticipate the tilling

831
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,800
before the rainy season instead of after

832
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,199
which is good because that is saving us

833
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,440
a lot of water uh then we're doing

834
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:19,919
lettuce then we're doing zucchini and

835
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,318
cucumber and melons and then we got the

836
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,200
alpha alpha so basically we

837
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:27,559
have uh a few fields that are in alpha

838
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:28,879
alpha a few fields that are in AR chok

839
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:31,880
the are these are perennial this is of

840
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,000
course a luminos but we got luminos in

841
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,960
here also we're what we're doing we're

842
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,480
planting uh Subterranean Clover

843
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:43,199
underneath the the the arok and this is

844
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,719
supposed to act as a perennial at the

845
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:48,439
same time I didn't get there yet but the

846
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:51,919
plan is to build a movable chicken cop

847
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:54,200
and graze the the chickens onto the

848
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:58,559
Clover and onto the alpha alpha so that

849
00:36:54,199 --> 00:37:01,039
that will even boost even more my uh my

850
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:03,920
nitrogen uh again I'm going through

851
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:06,679
quickly but then after if you want to I

852
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,880
can I can come come back to to it this

853
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:14,598
is part of our uh another thing is that

854
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:17,800
we have where is it um like here we got

855
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:20,200
Clover this is not Clover actually is is

856
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,000
um Ry grass or something like that

857
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:25,759
because we're coming but anyway we got

858
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,318
one species two species three species in

859
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,240
in in a year sometimes even more you

860
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:32,159
know in the same field which is not bad

861
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:35,479
and this is part of the concept

862
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:40,000
alternating you know permanent crops

863
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:44,199
with uh with uh with crops that

864
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,838
are temporary we're getting into

865
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:47,799
starting our own seedlings this is

866
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:51,039
something that I'm fairly new at but

867
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:54,839
we're starting to save our own seeds of

868
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:56,400
course though I mean this is bit hazy is

869
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:57,960
is the picture it's not the climate but

870
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,240
you you know these fennels are looking

871
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:04,039
pretty happy to me in any case um

872
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:05,799
radicul that are getting in uh cabbages

873
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:08,639
we got

874
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:12,079
this this is kind of a funny story we

875
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:14,118
had way too many cauliflower this year

876
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:17,560
not because we planted too many but

877
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:20,318
because each of them was 15b we couldn't

878
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:22,960
eat it you know it's I call it a

879
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:25,199
Catholic Catholic Family you know Garden

880
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,559
you have to have 12 kids to go through

881
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:29,879
the whole thing but anyway so this is

882
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:31,679
some of the garlic we of course do rows

883
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:35,280
we alternate the garlic and the carrots

884
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:36,639
and so there is some part of this uh oh

885
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,480
this is this is

886
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:43,759
the young tomatoes in a mulch and um I

887
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,880
think these are the same guys but bigger

888
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,599
so what we're doing again here you see

889
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,039
the the clear soil but this is soft this

890
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:53,079
is not tilt so it can go through the

891
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:55,639
summer quite easily you know and this

892
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:57,839
continous struggle I have two employees

893
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:59,838
and one of them is the guy and he said

894
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:01,639
every time there's something complain

895
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:04,400
say Hey you know this is not the way of

896
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:06,879
doing it and I said okay I don't care I

897
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,760
do it this way in any case and then he

898
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,680
said hey you know there's no grass at

899
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:14,119
all in this garden thank you yes wonder

900
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:15,759
why these are some of the some of the

901
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:18,400
Arctic chokes again we Cho the whole

902
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,359
thing off we try we pot it basically so

903
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,200
that we can concentrate the water we

904
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:24,880
water is very limiting factor in our

905
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:27,399
climate so we want to make the most of

906
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,119
it and at the same time this is clearing

907
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,639
the field so we can we can put uh you

908
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:35,039
know the cabbages in earlier so it makes

909
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:37,480
sense to me to have a bit more work uh

910
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:39,318
and these are the AR finally going uh

911
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,679
going in you can see the Clover was

912
00:39:39,318 --> 00:39:44,159
planted about one month one month before

913
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:47,159
one two months before and uh just

914
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:49,838
following the the season and these guys

915
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:51,519
are pretty healthy today I'm I'm happy

916
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:53,960
about it this is one of the secret

917
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:56,039
weapons that we use for the

918
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,599
garden some of you might be familiar

919
00:39:56,039 --> 00:40:00,800
with it this this is a a sper this is

920
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:02,760
the picture that I took of it the day I

921
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,119
bought it I bought it I bought this from

922
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,280
a neighbor who didn't know what it was

923
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:09,200
he used to have it in his yard he was

924
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,839
going to throw it away I bought it by

925
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:14,358
the pound and I was very lucky and I was

926
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:16,119
very happy this is the way it works it's

927
00:40:14,358 --> 00:40:18,838
very it's kind of very heavy piece of

928
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:21,280
equipment it dates back to 1971 and it's

929
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:23,279
still working so that's sustainable also

930
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,240
and and above all it's I was kind of

931
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,599
amazed this a picture that I took when I

932
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:33,000
bought it I mean with one strike it goes

933
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:34,440
from this to this which is wow I mean

934
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,400
they all discarded because you have to

935
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,318
go so slow but yeah I could go slow if

936
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,720
that's the result especially the way it

937
00:40:39,318 --> 00:40:45,039
chops everything which is kind of big

938
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:46,318
chunks you know it's um it's it's really

939
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:50,199
good and of course this is the other

940
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:52,838
secret weapon you know uh even here

941
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:55,318
there's a lot of work but it pays off

942
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:57,599
you know so this is manure and okay we

943
00:40:55,318 --> 00:41:00,318
we till it under and and we yes we do

944
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:03,519
till but also you might want to consider

945
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:05,440
that with this we can just back and just

946
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:07,880
plow a little strip so that might be

947
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,280
minimum tilling also you know minimum

948
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,960
tilling might be also to just

949
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,119
concentrate the tilling to where you

950
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:17,318
need and when you need it um we're

951
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:20,440
running out of time so

952
00:41:17,318 --> 00:41:23,920
outcome uh I was

953
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:26,079
asked several times if I think that

954
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,880
organic being an organic farmer will be

955
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,000
more diff more difficult than being a

956
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,000
conventional

957
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,199
farmer and I say no I think it's a lot

958
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,800
easier it just depends how you measure

959
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:40,000
your outcome if your outcome is only

960
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,280
making money then maybe being a

961
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
conventional farmer will be easier but

962
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:47,960
if you measure your outcome in a in a

963
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,039
different way then you might be in

964
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,960
trouble if you're a conventional farmer

965
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:57,400
I measure my outcome

966
00:41:52,960 --> 00:42:00,720
by trying to understand how much can I

967
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,760
be of help to other people we are having

968
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:04,799
woofers and interns and people that are

969
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:08,680
coming to help from all over the world

970
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:11,039
and we made a precise choice in terms of

971
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:13,358
Entrepreneurship in organizing our

972
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:16,719
system on the farm that is a system that

973
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:20,838
requires a lot of hand labor and we had

974
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:22,598
to come up with the opening ourselves to

975
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:24,960
you know to new people that want to come

976
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:26,240
and help but at the same time these

977
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,400
people that are coming and help they

978
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:30,118
coming from all over the world and they

979
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,440
stay with us and they share and we can

980
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:34,400
you know live together and be happy

981
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:38,000
together and be you know having the

982
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:40,880
feeling that we're working jointly on

983
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,920
something that is a common goal no

984
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,720
matter where we are from and no matter

985
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:50,079
what our life is is to be you know not

986
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:52,159
everybody is working all the time but we

987
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:55,559
are definitely sharing knowledge we are

988
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:58,279
sharing food you know we are learning

989
00:42:55,559 --> 00:43:01,480
from each other and that's a good

990
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,640
outcome you know especially because this

991
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,159
doesn't clash with the fact that I'm

992
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:07,358
making money I'm not making that much

993
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:09,960
money but I can stay in business and at

994
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:11,960
the same time there's more than money

995
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:14,358
also I want to you know this is a

996
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,599
picture of old ladies back in the old

997
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:20,558
days harvesting olives and I like

998
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,680
working the way I do not just

999
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:25,720
because not just because I don't just

1000
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:28,519
want to remember about this but I want

1001
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:32,639
to produce it if possible in a modern

1002
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:34,920
key we are building a community and

1003
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:37,480
that's part of our of of the part of I

1004
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,800
like this is the picture of a calendar

1005
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,719
that we're putting on sale here in the

1006
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,800
United States as a fundraiser to sponsor

1007
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:45,959
scholarships for students to come and

1008
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:48,760
work on the farm we are willing to build

1009
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,800
up a community of an ongoing community

1010
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,520
of students on the farm with people from

1011
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,960
different backgrounds we're shooting

1012
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:55,920
right now to for three people at the

1013
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,519
time one out of farming school one out

1014
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,440
of culinary school one out of

1015
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:01,759
herbalistic and natural paath because I

1016
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,200
believe that knowledge is holistic I

1017
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,079
believe that it would be a great

1018
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,719
experience for somebody just out of

1019
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:09,519
school to stay six months or one year in

1020
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:12,199
a different country working on something

1021
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:13,599
that is specific and yet being exposed

1022
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:15,879
to somebody that has a similar

1023
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,480
background that is you know limiters to

1024
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:20,480
what he or she is doing I I I would love

1025
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:24,440
to do so to to do something like that

1026
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,199
but also I'm practical you know and

1027
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,000
being practical I acknowledge that the

1028
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:30,519
always so much that I don't know about

1029
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,920
the farm you know and that I should know

1030
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:35,519
so I think that the most valuable tool

1031
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,280
for my farm will be something that will

1032
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:39,719
always be spending nights on books in

1033
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,359
order to know more about it because you

1034
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:43,838
know yeah I know some about it but

1035
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:45,639
there's still a lot more so this is

1036
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:48,599
again one page of the calendar the

1037
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:51,039
concept is that we have chefs for each

1038
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:52,800
page each page is one one picture that

1039
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:55,960
is telling you something about the olive

1040
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,599
oil production but also is one Chef's

1041
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,920
telling you what to do with it and this

1042
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,800
is why I call this a community building

1043
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,318
because these are all shed in the United

1044
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,920
States that are buying from us that are

1045
00:45:03,318 --> 00:45:07,719
willing to support us in something that

1046
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,119
is actually supporting American students

1047
00:45:07,719 --> 00:45:11,919
to come over to the farm it's a cycle

1048
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:13,960
you know that's the part I like and

1049
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:17,039
that's the part I like because

1050
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:19,400
basically we're all United we're all one

1051
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:23,159
thing you know we're all fractals into a

1052
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:25,519
larger picture most of us don't are able

1053
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:28,960
are not able to see the larger picture

1054
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:30,838
and only focusing on on what they're

1055
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,318
doing but I'm sorry that's not the way

1056
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:35,719
to go you know we're all connected you

1057
00:45:33,318 --> 00:45:40,599
know and we want

1058
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:42,159
to remind us that men was able to

1059
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:45,079
participate in

1060
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:48,480
the you know both in the miracle of

1061
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:50,480
turning the yellow into green which we

1062
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,599
are still able to do we a lot better in

1063
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,960
turning the green into into into into

1064
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:57,039
yellow and that's that's something that

1065
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,240
we want to be very care careful of but

1066
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:01,599
no matter what this is all connected

1067
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:03,279
okay so this is not an outcome this is a

1068
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,559
little plan like this that I took out of

1069
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,640
my garden the roots are coming all the

1070
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:11,599
way like this which I take it as a good

1071
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:16,039
sign that my soil is doing well I

1072
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:20,480
mean organic matter is 2.69 now it's

1073
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:24,880
okay hey it was 140 5 years before so

1074
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:27,280
that's good okay I like that I like this

1075
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,400
I like this guy to be there this is Farm

1076
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,280
crew taking a breath but at the same

1077
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,838
time this is more than Farm crew because

1078
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:37,559
it's these guys that are going to hold

1079
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:39,358
on for this line everything goes through

1080
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:41,160
the you know organic matter and the

1081
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:43,440
fertility of soil that is able to retain

1082
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:45,039
water basically you know and at the same

1083
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,480
time we don't want to we want to

1084
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:51,199
remember what good ass at Mankind we

1085
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,838
were able to do in the past and the bad

1086
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:56,199
this is a picture I took in the arlc in

1087
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:58,400
usbekistan in Central Asia this is the

1088
00:46:56,199 --> 00:47:00,759
biggest man-made disaster in terms of

1089
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,079
water management it was just

1090
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:05,920
unbelievable to be there and again we

1091
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:08,839
want to remember all that has been going

1092
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,519
through in the passing years and every

1093
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:13,519
time I look at those trees and that's

1094
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:15,318
why I call it a challenge to be a farmer

1095
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:17,480
in Italy because every time I look at

1096
00:47:15,318 --> 00:47:19,880
those trees I can't but picture the

1097
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:21,639
3,000 years of history that made it

1098
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:24,800
possible for those trees to be there

1099
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:27,598
today and I start wondering what are we

1100
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:30,160
doing today for somebody that will be

1101
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,440
here in 3,000 years from now now you

1102
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:33,480
don't want to answer that question

1103
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,960
because honestly we're just the

1104
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:39,000
whole thing up so basically I'm just

1105
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,519
every time I look at this landscape I'm

1106
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,039
just wondering am I doing the right

1107
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:47,000
thing every time I'm desting the water

1108
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:49,639
tunnel are we doing the right thing I

1109
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,559
yes I am I'm pretty sure that I'm doing

1110
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:54,159
the right thing in calling over people

1111
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:56,079
from the world all over the world and

1112
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:58,639
share what I'm doing and share what I

1113
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,480
have in order to find out what the most

1114
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:04,879
best possible outcome will be how to

1115
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:08,318
measure it uh monuments we can't eat the

1116
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:11,440
all trees we can eat and also his way of

1117
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:14,358
remembering the way mankind has been

1118
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:17,079
able to be respectful to this planet and

1119
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:19,838
this is B the this is in town the golden

1120
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:23,160
ballet everybody's looking for gold the

1121
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:25,279
goal is tomatoes the gold is producing

1122
00:48:23,159 --> 00:48:27,799
something that is able to feed us and

1123
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:31,480
again can't but take the water tunnel as

1124
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:33,920
a metaphor for oh I'm going reverse for

1125
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,400
you know what good men has done and

1126
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,400
hopefully we'll be able to reproduce

1127
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,400
this in the future thank

1128
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,960
you okay so we have time for some

1129
00:48:50,119 --> 00:48:54,358
questions that is a fire alarm but it's

1130
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:57,679
not in this building okay yeah I was

1131
00:48:54,358 --> 00:48:59,960
wondering what that was going

1132
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:02,519
okay okay

1133
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:05,400
yeah I take it you do not have to

1134
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:05,400
irrigate

1135
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:12,400
the yes we don't we don't we don't

1136
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:14,760
irrigate and we might do so if climate

1137
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,400
change but even so we wouldn't do it in

1138
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,680
the summer because in the summer the

1139
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,240
tree needs to have at least a solid

1140
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:23,318
month to two months of drought in order

1141
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:26,838
to create the uh antioxidants so

1142
00:49:23,318 --> 00:49:28,838
irrigation will will affect the quality

1143
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:31,039
if it's if it's done in the wrong in the

1144
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:33,960
wrong period of time it would yes there

1145
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:35,719
are stories of of farmers that spend

1146
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,798
huge amount of money in order to create

1147
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:39,318
irrigation line for the olive trees and

1148
00:49:37,798 --> 00:49:41,239
that water is just water so when you

1149
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:44,199
squeeze the oil the water goes down the

1150
00:49:41,239 --> 00:49:46,558
drain and actually does bad because the

1151
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:48,838
antioxidant are water soluble more than

1152
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,798
they are lipo soluble so all of the

1153
00:49:48,838 --> 00:49:53,279
antioxidant will go with the water so

1154
00:49:50,798 --> 00:49:55,679
you want to be careful in irrigate olive

1155
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,839
trees they need water in the in the the

1156
00:49:55,679 --> 00:50:00,118
spring they will need water in the fall

1157
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:03,279
but they will not need water in the in

1158
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:05,480
the in the summer so you can use it once

1159
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:08,319
you plant your trees because you want to

1160
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,760
boost the growth in the first years but

1161
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:12,679
once you get into production you want to

1162
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:15,680
be you want to be careful with

1163
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:15,679
that

1164
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:29,920
yeah

1165
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:33,480
uh no for the for the for the most part

1166
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:35,400
our Orchard the a long story short the

1167
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,280
the bulk of our trees were planted in

1168
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:40,119
early 50s and they were planted in

1169
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,440
combination with Vine with Great Vines

1170
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:44,318
so our trees are very much space spaced

1171
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,358
apart so there's a lot because the the

1172
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:51,440
great one was ripped off the ground back

1173
00:50:46,358 --> 00:50:53,679
in the 70s for a subsidies that pay

1174
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,679
Farmers not to be Farmers anymore or

1175
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:58,519
something like that and so we we have a

1176
00:50:55,679 --> 00:51:01,039
lot of space so all of our Gardens are

1177
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:03,199
embedded into into the part of the olive

1178
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:06,000
Groves and some of our fields are as

1179
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:08,318
well but this is very a very common

1180
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,280
concept I mean there's a text in the

1181
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:14,199
1600s in Italy that already talks about

1182
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,960
intercropping you know trees with with

1183
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:17,399
other type of cropping so I don't I

1184
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,760
don't think I don't think there's

1185
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:24,358
anything wrong with it except for the

1186
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:28,119
fact that for example this is

1187
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:31,119
um this doesn't let us do mechanical

1188
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:32,920
harvesting of the trees because we can't

1189
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:36,920
access the tractor you know into the

1190
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:39,119
gardens you know so we have to go with

1191
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:41,880
handmade Harvest which of course

1192
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:44,920
requires a lot of work there are a few

1193
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:47,318
tools and you know that can help with

1194
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:50,119
that but still is a lot of a lot of work

1195
00:51:47,318 --> 00:51:51,960
and you need a lot of Labor to do so and

1196
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:55,039
that's basically one of the main problem

1197
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:56,480
with the bulk of the growes today

1198
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:59,480
especially esally in Italy that they

1199
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:01,519
were planted and and and laid out maybe

1200
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:04,240
even only 50 years ago like in this case

1201
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:06,798
which is nothing but they were laid out

1202
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:09,239
and and designed in a moment in which

1203
00:52:06,798 --> 00:52:11,759
nobody would think about harvested

1204
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:14,399
harvesting mechanically so we're not

1205
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:17,720
sustainable in on the market because our

1206
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,798
cost of production in Italy is € a liter

1207
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:22,000
a liter is a quarter of a gallon if you

1208
00:52:19,798 --> 00:52:24,559
go in Spain which is still Europe that

1209
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,559
drops to three if you go to Tunisia that

1210
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,920
drops to I don't know what because of

1211
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,798
cost of Labor and that's why a lot of

1212
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:34,119
people are ripping off ending up ripping

1213
00:52:30,798 --> 00:52:35,519
off uh their growth and this is kind of

1214
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:38,240
a you

1215
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:40,798
know a disaster because they're reaping

1216
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:42,759
all of those grow that are more prone to

1217
00:52:40,798 --> 00:52:45,000
be ripped off are the one that are

1218
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,760
actually strongholds against climate

1219
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,719
change Olive Tree is a very peculiar

1220
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,920
Tree in fact it can it can grow in a

1221
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:52,558
pile of rocks and you can grow and bear

1222
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:55,318
fruit with less than 400 millimeters of

1223
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:57,720
rain per year so has been used by

1224
00:52:55,318 --> 00:53:01,079
mankind as a conquering plant in order

1225
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:04,439
to you know switch from that yellow into

1226
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:06,000
green that was a key factor the ol tree

1227
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,200
and now we've gotten to the to the other

1228
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,480
to the other end which people are

1229
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:11,759
ripping those plants off only because

1230
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:13,119
they cannot make a living sounds like

1231
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,880
to me I mean we call this

1232
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,440
progress but honestly I don't know you

1233
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:20,039
know

1234
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:24,119
so I don't know if there are any more

1235
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:27,798
questions or if lunch is calling no yeah

1236
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:27,798
what was your are

1237
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:35,240
and old you planting also no I didn't I

1238
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:38,358
didn't have I didn't PL any any more

1239
00:53:35,239 --> 00:53:40,798
trees my again the bulk of my trees are

1240
00:53:38,358 --> 00:53:43,039
of a variety is called Canino which is a

1241
00:53:40,798 --> 00:53:44,880
local variety that takes the name from

1242
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:48,440
the next town over so it's kind of a

1243
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:51,358
hairloom local variety that was used

1244
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:54,240
forever and it's very Hardy you know and

1245
00:53:51,358 --> 00:53:56,279
it resists very it fits very well that

1246
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:59,199
uh environment and and those were the

1247
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:01,599
one that were planted in the early 50s

1248
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:04,679
then when in the 70s they took the vines

1249
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:06,440
off there are two parts of the farm in

1250
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:08,358
which the ground is so shallow that you

1251
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:10,880
wouldn't be able to do anything else and

1252
00:54:08,358 --> 00:54:13,480
so they planted more planting there they

1253
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,400
you know in in between and those are two

1254
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:17,838
different varieties froo and leino which

1255
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:20,160
are very productive and very common but

1256
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:23,078
both of them are very early in the

1257
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:24,399
season so being early in our climate

1258
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:27,039
means that they're very prone to the

1259
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:30,599
attack of a par side that is

1260
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:32,199
the uh the olive fly so it's kind of

1261
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:34,880
likely that we wouldn't be able to

1262
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:36,838
harvest much on those trees today but I

1263
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,160
don't plan to I don't I don't plan to

1264
00:54:36,838 --> 00:54:40,440
add more trees right now I don't plan I

1265
00:54:39,159 --> 00:54:42,358
don't know if I will ever do in the

1266
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:45,159
future because there are so many

1267
00:54:42,358 --> 00:54:47,239
different or Orchard around us that are

1268
00:54:45,159 --> 00:54:49,118
kind of neglected because people don't

1269
00:54:47,239 --> 00:54:51,598
know how to make a living with it

1270
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:54,480
anymore because the a long story short

1271
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:56,440
is olive trees has always been planted

1272
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,318
in small batches in order only to

1273
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,358
support the family you know so there are

1274
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:04,880
a number of places around me that have

1275
00:55:00,358 --> 00:55:06,480
maybe 10 trees 20 trees 30 that are

1276
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:09,760
never big enough in order to make a

1277
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:12,280
living today they used to represent you

1278
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:15,520
know wealth back in the old days but

1279
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:18,000
nowadays it's just lost so I don't know

1280
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:20,039
if you in the picture where all these

1281
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,760
the farm with all the different colors

1282
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:24,199
the colors were kind of getting out of

1283
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,880
the farm limits because we're starting

1284
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:30,519
to team in with neighbors you know

1285
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:33,318
because we are lucky to be you know able

1286
00:55:30,519 --> 00:55:36,318
to sell our crop and so I better team in

1287
00:55:33,318 --> 00:55:38,519
more Farmers or team in more trees

1288
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:41,159
instead of planting more on my on my own

1289
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:43,079
grounds you know I don't I don't think

1290
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:45,719
it will make sense to start new growth

1291
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:51,000
when we have old ones that are dying

1292
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:51,000
yeah have you had success your success

1293
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:01,358
that

1294
00:55:56,679 --> 00:56:05,838
uh no not yet my success is not that big

1295
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:07,159
yet okay and um no uh there are a lot of

1296
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:10,759
people that are looking at what I'm

1297
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:15,318
doing with great interest for sure and

1298
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:19,079
um because I'm I'm able

1299
00:56:15,318 --> 00:56:21,759
to sell my product ahead of time almost

1300
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:25,400
every year we sell out we sell out with

1301
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:29,200
a price that is almost twice as as much

1302
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:30,838
as the common market price for the same

1303
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:32,598
or equivalent product of course I'm

1304
00:56:30,838 --> 00:56:34,960
trying to do my best in order for my

1305
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:36,760
product to stand up of course but you

1306
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:40,599
know it's not said that other people

1307
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:42,680
couldn't do the same you know my um and

1308
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:45,079
we're doing this by cutting the cost of

1309
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:47,960
production in terms of money because

1310
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:50,079
we're using volunteer workers so it's

1311
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:51,798
not that we're not paying them of course

1312
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:53,480
we're paying in a different currency

1313
00:56:51,798 --> 00:56:55,318
that's part of how we stay in business

1314
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:57,480
is because we are working in this two

1315
00:56:55,318 --> 00:57:00,318
two different currencies one is cash and

1316
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:02,358
one is giving away what we have which is

1317
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:04,440
meat which is good food which is

1318
00:57:02,358 --> 00:57:06,279
landscape which is being in Italy which

1319
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:08,000
is our knowledge which is you know

1320
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,839
sharing what we have and what we know

1321
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,798
which is something that we're very rich

1322
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:15,239
of now has this come to the point where

1323
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:18,838
other Farmers around me are willing to

1324
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:21,439
team in with me just for that not yet

1325
00:57:18,838 --> 00:57:24,078
part of it is also a generational

1326
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,599
problem you know I'm 40 I just turned 40

1327
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:30,000
a few days ago

1328
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:34,519
and uh I I'm I'm being on on that farm

1329
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,838
managing that farm 15 years I'm a new in

1330
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:39,159
a country you know that is kind of

1331
00:57:36,838 --> 00:57:43,159
conservative Farmers that have been

1332
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:44,558
there for 700 generation you know and oh

1333
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:46,519
you know this is the way to do it

1334
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:48,440
because my father used to do it and my

1335
00:57:46,519 --> 00:57:50,639
grandfather used to do it and what do

1336
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:53,119
you know I don't know okay you keep

1337
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:55,159
going and I keep going my way and then

1338
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:57,160
you get you know again how do you

1339
00:57:55,159 --> 00:57:59,719
measure your outcome you know I'm not

1340
00:57:57,159 --> 00:58:02,279
unhappy of what I'm doing but I can't

1341
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:04,078
just be forcing other people to do it

1342
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:06,720
because it's a matter of philosophy

1343
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:09,039
basically you know hopefully one day

1344
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:12,598
maybe my business My Success will be so

1345
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:15,520
big that my economic success will

1346
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:19,160
overpower the differences in philosophy

1347
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:21,038
but you know that's not my main

1348
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:23,199
occupation right now my main occupation

1349
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:25,520
is trying to stay in business and and

1350
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:28,000
and and run a farm not just being a

1351
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:31,199
sociologist for now but maybe for the

1352
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:34,358
future I don't know yeah a question

1353
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:36,639
about your water Tel yeah um so I guess

1354
00:58:34,358 --> 00:58:39,038
one one of the infrastructure projects

1355
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:40,679
back from the of August was the aqueduct

1356
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:42,599
you had a photo of one of the aqueduct

1357
00:58:40,679 --> 00:58:46,118
no say that again you had a photo of one

1358
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:48,400
of the aqueducts right Aqueduct so I

1359
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:51,358
guess the question is um is there any

1360
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,599
evidence at least on your farm whether

1361
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:56,199
these water tunnels might have been

1362
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:59,119
feeding some of the aqueducts there uh

1363
00:58:56,199 --> 00:59:01,118
there is plenty of evidence not on my

1364
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:03,200
farm but there is plenty of evidence

1365
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:06,358
that the water tunnels that I'm talking

1366
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:08,519
about of at trasan origin are at the

1367
00:59:06,358 --> 00:59:11,199
base of the Roman

1368
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:14,880
aqueducts okay it's exactly the same

1369
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:17,000
concept is the same uh technology all of

1370
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:21,440
what we know about the Roman and that we

1371
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:24,798
know of as Roman hydraulic technology is

1372
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:28,318
actually has been invented by the atrans

1373
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:31,239
and it was pockets of uh intelligencia

1374
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:33,358
of the trasan people into the Roman

1375
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:36,279
society that was still managing those

1376
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:38,519
the only invention in term important

1377
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:41,079
invention in terms of hydraulic

1378
00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:44,759
technology into the Roman time is the

1379
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:47,519
reverse siphon that came much later so

1380
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:51,319
uh the principle exactly the same is

1381
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:53,838
also this um underground is also this

1382
00:59:51,318 --> 00:59:55,838
horizontal structure linear structure

1383
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:58,639
that got bigger and bigger and the only

1384
00:59:55,838 --> 01:00:00,759
thing that the Romans actually did is

1385
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:04,798
couple those with the ark with the

1386
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:07,920
building of the Ark the arch and um and

1387
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:10,038
so and the other difference is is

1388
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:12,358
basically a difference in the society so

1389
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:15,039
all the tunnels into the at trasan

1390
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:18,078
Society were feeding small communities

1391
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:20,400
because it was a society that was very

1392
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:22,920
spread out while the Roman power of

1393
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:25,920
course was Central Power that was able

1394
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:28,960
and had the need to let out and and had

1395
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:31,440
build these huge works that of course

1396
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,960
went on as long as the cental power was

1397
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:36,280
able to defend and then maintain it and

1398
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:39,079
then of course they collapse after that

1399
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:40,880
but there's absolutely a continuity

1400
01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:42,680
between in in in the two in the two

1401
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:45,119
technologies the main difference in

1402
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:49,838
terms of water is that the water tunnels

1403
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:53,039
are um the water the walls are unlined

1404
01:00:49,838 --> 01:00:54,880
so the water can seep you know through

1405
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:57,200
the walls and so there is water

1406
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:59,920
exchanges between the inside of the

1407
01:00:57,199 --> 01:01:02,358
tunnel and the underground versus an

1408
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:05,280
aqueduct that is only made to transport

1409
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:08,159
water so we'll have the walls lined with

1410
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:12,400
waterproof plaster that will retain

1411
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:12,399
water but it's exactly exactly the same

1412
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:26,079
thing this has been a production of

1413
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:29,079
Cornell University on the web at

1414
