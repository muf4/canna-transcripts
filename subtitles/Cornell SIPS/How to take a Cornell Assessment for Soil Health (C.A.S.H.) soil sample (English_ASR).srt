1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,769
Cornell's comprehensive assessment of

2
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:07,619
soil health goes beyond just testing

3
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:09,539
soil nutrient levels but like any soil

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,609
testing the information it provides

5
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:14,369
depends on how well you sample the soil

6
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:15,570
as well as asking the right questions

7
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:17,250
before sampling

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,710
although the Cornell soil health lab

9
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,948
accepts samples year-round the best time

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,210
to take soil samples is in the spring

11
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:27,300
you should take your samples when the

12
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,199
soil is workable and neither too wet nor

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,289
too dry

14
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,300
a good rule of thumb is if the field can

15
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,359
be plowed it is probably a good time to

16
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:38,399
sample how you sample will depend on

17
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:40,558
what questions are trying to answer if

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,539
you're trying to assess soil health for

19
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,030
an entire field or management unit with

20
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:46,859
similar soils in management history walk

21
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,500
through the entire field making a path

22
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:53,488
that looks like a big W taking sub

23
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,649
samples at five to ten spots avoid areas

24
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:58,649
that are not representative of your

25
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,660
entire sampling area or if you're trying

26
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,789
to identify soil constraints for trouble

27
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:04,618
spots in the field make your path just

28
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,140
through the identified weak part of the

29
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:09,989
field sample this problem area as a

30
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,329
separate labelled sample it is also

31
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:14,640
useful to take a sample from outside of

32
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:18,650
your management area to help quantify

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,650
the effects of your management

34
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,250
so I've identified that this spot is a

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:35,050
good representation of our field so the

36
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:37,950
first step is to remove the debris you

37
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:48,429
don't need to dig that deep of a hole

38
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:53,560
you're looking for about 8 inches the

39
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:56,020
soil is basically perfect for taking a

40
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,978
soil sample it might be slightly on the

41
00:01:56,019 --> 00:02:01,780
wet side but in the spring you got to

42
00:01:59,978 --> 00:02:06,310
kind of take it when you have a chance

43
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:10,060
and this is our chance so I'm removing

44
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:13,629
the soil I set it to the side so that I

45
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:17,050
can put it back in the hole so we don't

46
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:26,409
have any holes the tractor might have

47
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:28,420
problems with all right so I've got

48
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:31,719
about an 8 inch hole and now I'm going

49
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:35,559
to take what we call a slice of bread

50
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:39,759
from the edge of the hole we're looking

51
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:44,189
for about 2 inches thick by about the

52
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,189
shovel wide and 6 inches deep

53
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,879
all right we pull it up

54
00:02:50,688 --> 00:02:58,878
it's about perfectly six inches deep but

55
00:02:53,878 --> 00:03:03,318
now we're looking for the soil to be

56
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:08,039
consider or we want to have consistent

57
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:11,608
amounts of soil from the top layer down

58
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:24,358
to the six inch mark so I'm removing any

59
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:27,180
extra soil from the side we're looking

60
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:28,739
for that nice even layer a little

61
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,040
thicker at the bottom it's gonna even it

62
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,039
out a bit

63
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:37,848
looks pretty good it's about six inches

64
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:44,789
and then it goes in the bucket it's a

65
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:48,650
sample one and then from there we can

66
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:48,650
move on and take the other samples

67
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:55,579
you will want to take a pen at trauma

68
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:59,360
two reading at each spot that you're

69
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:01,700
sampling across the W shaped pattern so

70
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,700
you're going to be looking at the zero

71
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:06,019
to six inch mark and also zero to 18 and

72
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:08,750
you're going to be watching the inter

73
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:11,810
gauge on the penetrator and making a

74
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:14,810
mental note of what the highest psi you

75
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:16,790
reaches so first we're going to go down

76
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,560
to the 6 inch there's this mark down

77
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:23,420
here that shows us the six inch and the

78
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,490
18th is a little bit higher so I'm not

79
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:28,189
feeling too much compaction I'm keeping

80
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:30,639
an eye on the six inch mark that hit

81
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:32,750
about 150 psi

82
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:37,039
make a mental note of that and then you

83
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:38,980
continue to the 18 inch mark I start to

84
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,620
feel more compaction

85
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:44,900
I'm surpassing 300 psi there's the plow

86
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:47,449
pan and you got to push a little bit

87
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:51,379
farther to get to that 18 that hit about

88
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:53,990
400 psi I've made a mental note of how

89
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:56,089
much compaction I recorded with the pen

90
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,250
at Ramat er and I'm going to go ahead

91
00:04:56,089 --> 00:05:02,089
and take the back of the submission form

92
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:08,060
in this case this is location 1 so 0 to

93
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:09,349
6 was 150 and 6 to 18 was 400 alright

94
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:14,509
and then we're ready to move to our next

95
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:16,250
location now that I've taken 10 sub

96
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:19,849
samples across the field in a w-shaped

97
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,980
pattern I will mix the sample extremely

98
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:24,830
well at the same time I'm pulling any

99
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:27,170
plant matter out to make sure that we

100
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:29,750
have an accurate sample to send to the

101
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:32,270
lab now I have this well mixed soil

102
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:34,750
there's no clods everything is broken up

103
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:37,789
really well the soil is a really nice

104
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:40,240
consistency for sampling see how the

105
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:43,460
aggregates just sort of crumble apart

106
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,910
showing we have good structure probably

107
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:49,099
good microbial activity and then I go

108
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:52,189
ahead and I take my labeled ziplock bag

109
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:54,470
I have my submission form right here

110
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:56,779
which I use I've already filled out the

111
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,330
front of this I mean I know I'm in field

112
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:02,229
II

113
00:05:58,329 --> 00:06:05,409
and I go ahead and start taking samples

114
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:08,800
out of this so the way that we typically

115
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:12,070
do it and our research plots kind of

116
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,310
like take a handful don't really worry

117
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:18,209
about sort of spilling some toss them

118
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:22,360
out of there I'm avoiding any debris and

119
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:25,120
I'm looking for about six cups because

120
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,580
I'm taking this for the extended package

121
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,620
if I was taking it for the basic package

122
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:35,859
that requires three cups that's about

123
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:39,420
three cups and then if I'm going for the

124
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:43,270
standard I'm looking for about four cups

125
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:44,819
it's about what that looks like maybe a

126
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:47,319
little more

127
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:49,120
that'd probably be nice first standard

128
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:50,860
but in this case we're doing the

129
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,360
extended so we're looking for six cups

130
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:58,000
of soil all right that's a little more

131
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,180
than six cups right there so we're

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,860
looking for looks great

133
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:07,840
go ahead close your bag and you're ready

134
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,180
to move on to your next field after

135
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:13,599
you've collected all of your sub samples

136
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,759
mix them well put them into a bag you're

137
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:19,180
going to go ahead and just make a note

138
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:22,240
of your GPS coordinates you should use

139
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:25,240
whatever program works best for you and

140
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,490
you don't need to record each section

141
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,069
each one of your sub samples if you want

142
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:33,329
to that's great of course but generally

143
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:33,329
I would just record the field

144
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:43,379
send your soil samples via the United

145
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:45,759
States Post Office rapid shipping and

146
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:48,189
remember to include a submission form

147
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,180
with a blue ice pack in a labeled

148
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:52,300
ziplock bag

149
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,790
note an ice pack is only necessary in

150
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,040
the hot months and is not needed if the

151
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:59,770
weather is cool and you use rapid
