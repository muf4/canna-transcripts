1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,770
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,769
University

3
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:11,940
yeah so what I'd like to do this

4
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:15,449
afternoon is go through the topics as

5
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:17,519
listed first knowing that's a fairly

6
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:20,368
broad audience I want to bring you up to

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:23,368
date on what about the cut flower

8
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:25,289
industry as it exists here in North

9
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:29,129
America South America perhaps a little

10
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:33,140
in Europe and then narrow down to the

11
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:36,030
North American and the state situation

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:39,570
to get a perhaps a little better

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:44,520
understanding what the industry consists

14
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:47,250
of and then the the area of support for

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,300
that industry is fairly unique so I

16
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,969
wanted to present you some information

17
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:56,069
on that both on the extension side as

18
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,170
well as the research side but on the

19
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,450
research side I'm going to mostly be

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,039
talking about the fun I'm having with

21
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,859
cut flowers or have had for the last

22
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,719
dozen years or so that's not to say

23
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:09,328
there isn't research going on elsewhere

24
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:14,939
but I'm just kind of selfish in that

25
00:01:09,328 --> 00:01:18,239
regard so when I lecture I like to have

26
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:20,340
an open mic so everyone can participate

27
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,349
if there are things that aren't clear or

28
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,079
if you'd like to add something

29
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:31,978
feel free to pipe up I'd be glad to hear

30
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:35,329
from you the states doesn't produce much

31
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:38,640
in the way of cut flowers we rely on

32
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:41,548
primarily South America for the cut

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,090
flowers that we buy because we want to

34
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:48,360
buy them year-round to have Valentine's

35
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:51,060
Day without roses would be unheard of to

36
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:53,579
produce roses at that time of year here

37
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,549
is prohibitively expensive and probably

38
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:59,000
consumers wouldn't stand for it but we

39
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:02,759
have a very lively process of

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,430
importation of especially roses but also

41
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,739
chrysanthemums carnations and

42
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:11,039
alstroemeria from South America

43
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:14,539
especially Colombia where they can grow

44
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:17,268
year-round the labor is cheap the

45
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:19,519
transportation costs are minimal and so

46
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:22,039
as a result of that our domestic

47
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:26,359
production of those four commodities is

48
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:28,759
is really very small so we do produce

49
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:30,849
cut flowers here and some of them are

50
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:33,949
listed in the lower part of the table

51
00:02:30,848 --> 00:02:37,969
and increasing percentages as you go

52
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:40,429
down of gladiola irises lilies tulips

53
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:42,769
are about half-and-half coming from

54
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,769
other places and even those tulips that

55
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:47,469
we do grow here the bulbs are not being

56
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:51,859
produced here they're coming from

57
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:53,870
Holland primarily Chile sometimes so

58
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:56,359
it's not really a wholly domestic

59
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:59,900
industry I guess I shouldn't wander

60
00:02:56,359 --> 00:03:03,709
around too much that I could slide so

61
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:06,188
that the South America Kahn aspect is

62
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:09,199
Highland valleys near the equator

63
00:03:06,188 --> 00:03:12,979
temperature the same year-round no photo

64
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:15,378
period problems and so they grow them

65
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:18,289
undercover as you can see for the mums

66
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:19,878
here and these structures here that

67
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:22,668
looks like there might be carnations

68
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:25,009
underneath so some of the high tunnels

69
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:28,219
that they have there are very extensive

70
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:30,739
some are modern and some are more

71
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:32,389
traditional protection from rain is

72
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:34,699
primarily what they want them for

73
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:39,069
because the temperature regulation is

74
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:43,699
not necessary so that's how a bulk of

75
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:47,810
flowers are produced that end up in our

76
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:50,120
market the point about those flowers yes

77
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:53,030
some of them I identified and the USDA

78
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,009
keeps track of how many stems are being

79
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,639
produced and what the value is and so on

80
00:03:55,009 --> 00:04:01,698
but a lot of others like sunflowers for

81
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:04,430
instance which are a real big deal they

82
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:09,549
aren't keeping track of those dahlias is

83
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:09,549
another one which is not accounted for

84
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:18,478
you need to ask the USDA I think they

85
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:21,989
lump them under others and so it it's an

86
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:24,959
incomplete record but the quantities in

87
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:29,279
comparison to roses are sufficiently low

88
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:31,349
that they there are too many different

89
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,959
species I think is what what's happening

90
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,870
there so there are snapdragons

91
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:40,019
delphiniums lisianthus which we'll be

92
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:42,259
talking about to some extent suffice to

93
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:45,269
say that there are a bunch of different

94
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:47,330
flowers each with their cultural

95
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:51,599
practice requirements post harvest

96
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:53,788
characteristics laws life etc etc so it

97
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,669
gets to be a fairly complicated subject

98
00:04:53,788 --> 00:05:00,899
and one that doesn't lend itself readily

99
00:04:56,668 --> 00:05:04,529
to extension so large-scale production

100
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:07,259
in the u.s. of cut flowers is primarily

101
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:09,388
on the west coast because of their more

102
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:13,279
favorable climatic conditions and we

103
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:17,970
have here this is Washington Oregon

104
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:21,119
toward the coast cool somewhat cloudy

105
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:24,120
mornings then the Sun comes out the rest

106
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,819
of the day is fine a very regular

107
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,550
climate which allows a lot of different

108
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:33,329
species to be grown hydrangea here calla

109
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:38,579
lilies in this particular part of the

110
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:41,939
picture some other examples a greenhouse

111
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:47,240
production of gerberas in the

112
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:50,610
Watsonville area of Central California

113
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:53,220
large-scale mostly under glass

114
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:56,310
tulip production in this case in a

115
00:05:53,220 --> 00:06:00,349
factory type of situation in Virginia

116
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:04,110
and again like I mentioned this is

117
00:06:00,348 --> 00:06:06,149
production using bulbs from Holland for

118
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,889
some parts of the year and in other

119
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:09,899
parts of the year when Holland can't

120
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:13,168
supply they're getting them from Chile

121
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:15,259
and they're able to keep producing in

122
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:20,439
some cases hydroponically in some cases

123
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:22,449
it's just in mix for 10 out of 12 months

124
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:25,870
this time of year it's too hot in the

125
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:28,120
greenhouse so they do a poor job of it

126
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:30,939
but the rest of the time and if you go

127
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,500
down to Wegmans or other stores these

128
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:35,829
would be the tulips you'll be getting

129
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,660
okay it doesn't say so but this is a big

130
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:40,949
big outfit and there are one or two

131
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:44,890
others that do a similar sort of

132
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:46,990
production in other parts of California

133
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:51,180
are growing Hypericum over there on the

134
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:53,920
right looks like stocking the right and

135
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,750
scabiosa so lots of different flowers

136
00:06:53,920 --> 00:07:02,770
large scale but mostly going to a

137
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:06,819
wholesale kind of marketing system when

138
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:09,839
we come closer here to the Northeast and

139
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:13,120
New York State more specifically and

140
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:15,810
there are some large scale producers and

141
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,030
they tend to go into the wholesale

142
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:22,930
primarily we have in fact the picture on

143
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:27,009
the upper right is one of the large

144
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:29,379
scale peony farms that existing just

145
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:31,659
north of the Experiment Station in

146
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:34,899
Geneva and there's a second peony grower

147
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:38,020
in that same vicinity this particular

148
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:41,319
one has a farm in Geneva as a farm in

149
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:44,139
Pennsylvania and a couple of farms in

150
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:46,930
Maryland and he starts harvesting in

151
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:49,029
Maryland and then works his way up so

152
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:53,949
that the relatively narrow harvesting

153
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:57,819
period for peony is extended over that

154
00:07:53,949 --> 00:08:00,219
that four times harvest season these are

155
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:03,779
some pictures from Long Island dahlias

156
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:06,520
and clearly again larger scale

157
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:12,459
production close to the place where

158
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:15,459
those flowers would be in demand by far

159
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:18,819
the largest number of producers are in

160
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:21,009
fact small scale not only here but

161
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:22,959
scattered over the United States and

162
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:25,120
again it says implications as far as

163
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,159
extension is concerned because you're

164
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,680
not talking to three or four big people

165
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,550
you're talking to folks that are doing

166
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,450
it part-time

167
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:35,960
small-scale

168
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:40,460
a number of different species in fact if

169
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:43,730
you look up the book or count the number

170
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:45,440
of species listed in what we would

171
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:48,680
consider the Bible of cattle our

172
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,740
production that Armitage and mouse women

173
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:55,849
put together you come up with 83 species

174
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:58,639
and there are more besides that but so

175
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:01,370
there are a number of of annuals

176
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:04,730
perennials woody species geo fights

177
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:07,460
meaning bulbs and then nearly using in

178
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:10,850
many cases flowers but could be foliage

179
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:12,200
could be the fruit sticks and these

180
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:16,610
sorts of things you can look at these

181
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:19,970
later in the talk to see what specific

182
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:23,769
ones we're talking about they're mostly

183
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:26,379
locally marketed it avoids too big for

184
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:30,500
roses carnations mums alstroemeria

185
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:33,889
because they can't compete and then but

186
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:36,500
the emphasis is freshly produced hasn't

187
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:40,069
been shipped will last longer in the

188
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:43,129
bath and that's the advantage that the

189
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:46,040
local producers have and some just

190
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:48,289
pictures of those small-scale farms a

191
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:53,329
couple of them from within Tompkins

192
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:55,159
County here lots of flowers and any of

193
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:59,440
you who have gone to the iske farmers

194
00:09:55,159 --> 00:10:04,339
market know that there are two very good

195
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:07,970
producers of of cut flowers that market

196
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:11,360
there so farmers markets are a favorite

197
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:14,269
place to sell the flowers that they

198
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,539
produce you find them in supermarkets as

199
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:19,879
well weddings and events actually the

200
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:22,549
wedding trade has become quite important

201
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:26,149
for the local producers if they're able

202
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:29,509
to deal with the wives are sorry the the

203
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:32,959
mother-in-law's that are very fussy

204
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:36,649
about what color and size etc flowers

205
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:38,780
they want the growers that can manage

206
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:41,779
that at the same time they're producing

207
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:43,980
their their crop they can succeed very

208
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:46,259
well and the prices are very good

209
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:49,350
and and that's I think in the recent

210
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:52,049
years has been a shift from going to the

211
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:54,269
florist to get the flowers to going to

212
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:56,069
the producers themselves and specifying

213
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:59,100
I'm going to get married in three months

214
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:02,040
I need this color and so on and so forth

215
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:05,190
and can be a little cheaper but not an

216
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:07,529
awful lot but that's become a quite

217
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:10,530
important one there is some roadside

218
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:13,139
trade as is shown here from a picture on

219
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:16,429
Long Island but that's relatively minor

220
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:20,250
and then bouquet subscriptions so that

221
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:22,620
restaurants say gets a bouquet or ten

222
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,779
bouquets to put on the tables in that

223
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,840
restaurant once a week or something like

224
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,839
that

225
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:36,149
oftentimes a regular CSA

226
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:38,969
community-supported agriculture farm

227
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:41,610
that allows people to pick or get a

228
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:43,529
share of the product if they go to the

229
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,169
farm themselves there are often are

230
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:49,230
picking gardens where they can cut

231
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:51,870
sinuous sunflowers glad your lights and

232
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:59,190
things like that yeah so in some cases

233
00:11:51,870 --> 00:12:02,460
yeah yeah that's a good point okay so as

234
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:06,780
I've hinted all along the information

235
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:09,120
for on cut flowers is difficult because

236
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:11,909
there are so many species and because

237
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:17,009
there are so many producers and they're

238
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:19,259
relatively few organizations that can

239
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:22,259
cater to that so Cornell Cooperative

240
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:24,509
Extension is what we go to for

241
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:26,970
information if you ask them for

242
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:30,870
information on cut flowers you don't

243
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:34,200
find very much and I think what has

244
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:37,740
happened is that they have seeded the

245
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:40,379
field to this organization here the

246
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,750
associate association of specialty cut

247
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:44,309
flower growers which is a national

248
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:48,299
affective even international

249
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:51,729
organization based in ohio run by an

250
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:55,479
executive director and

251
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:59,079
one or two staff was founded about 25

252
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:02,550
years ago and they have a number of

253
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:05,620
services that cater very well to these

254
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:08,740
diverse people that are growing a number

255
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:12,399
of different crops they publish a

256
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:15,129
quarterly magazine on some folks in this

257
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,769
room please and Bill myself etc have

258
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:19,509
written articles about some of the

259
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:24,549
research that's going on in cut flower

260
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:27,939
work as part of that they have regional

261
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:31,719
meetings and annual meetings depending

262
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:34,449
on the earth dotted all over the u.s. in

263
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,970
Canada as well so those can be quite

264
00:13:34,448 --> 00:13:41,019
important but what's even more important

265
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:43,778
is a listserv and that's really the

266
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:48,028
Extension Service that provides

267
00:13:43,778 --> 00:13:51,669
information and it's essentially growers

268
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:53,860
helping other growers because there are

269
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:56,649
so many different species you type in

270
00:13:53,860 --> 00:14:00,720
there and say I need some information on

271
00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:03,100
distil is the antis variety within a day

272
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,860
someone else said oh yeah I tried that

273
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:08,170
one stinks so that's the end of that

274
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:11,379
right or there could be long discussions

275
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:15,639
about some topic about bed shapers or

276
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:18,549
ways of planting seedlings etc etc and

277
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:19,959
it's amazing there are some of the older

278
00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:22,299
members who are part of this

279
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:24,189
organization who have been very

280
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:27,609
participatory and have provided

281
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:29,709
tremendous help to new people no it's

282
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:33,159
not for free the organization although

283
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:35,948
is non-profit it does require about $200

284
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:40,509
a year for people to to belong to that

285
00:14:35,948 --> 00:14:42,448
but if you as a grower find some

286
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:46,600
information that helps you market your

287
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:49,629
flowers more effectively that $200 is

288
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:52,899
paid back in that one message that that

289
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:55,838
you got so it has succeeded very well

290
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:58,649
and and is thriving as I'll show you in

291
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:03,610
a minute then they also run a

292
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:05,019
coordinated coordinated variety trial

293
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:09,330
and growers who would like to

294
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:12,250
participate are sent six packets of

295
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:14,650
Xenia varieties new varieties that the

296
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,429
seed companies want to try and test out

297
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:17,799
in the field

298
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:19,719
and at the end of the year these growers

299
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:21,849
then have to write and say yeah this one

300
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,670
went fine and this Deming was this and

301
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:26,830
the diameter was that and it lasted

302
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:29,259
quite a while and I liked it but this

303
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:31,750
other one I wouldn't grow again and then

304
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:35,049
the quarterly magazine the January issue

305
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:37,149
has all these reports in summarized and

306
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:39,579
it's a very valuable piece of

307
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:43,750
information then they have a small

308
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:46,710
Research Foundation which gathers money

309
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:50,200
to give out as research grants so that

310
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:54,009
institutions like Cornell could do small

311
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:55,870
trials that help to explore particular

312
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:59,679
things then there's quite a bit of

313
00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:02,470
post-harvest work going on at North

314
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:04,839
Carolina State University John Dole runs

315
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,910
a yearly program of testing all the new

316
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,710
varieties to see how long they last in

317
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:11,610
the Vosges with different editions and

318
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:13,780
so on so this is a very valuable

319
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:17,470
organization that if you are at all

320
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:23,709
interested in in cut flowers this is the

321
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:27,519
place to go and with the current

322
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:29,769
popularity of going local and doing it

323
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,100
yourself you can see the membership

324
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:37,720
numbers going up from around 500 or so

325
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:40,300
in 2008 and you know 2015 and it's

326
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,970
climbing so the organization has become

327
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:45,549
very popular and it's been a key to the

328
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,230
growth of that industry and they have

329
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:51,429
perhaps some interesting challenges

330
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:53,980
ahead on what should be done in the

331
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:59,899
future to keep up with the demand for

332
00:16:53,980 --> 00:17:03,740
information okay so research

333
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:06,099
there's post-harvest research is one of

334
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:10,308
the most important things in John dole

335
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:15,109
at NC State as I just mentioned is the

336
00:17:10,308 --> 00:17:18,019
foremost scientist studying this this

337
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:20,448
area trying to see how long can we keep

338
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:22,160
flowers alive of particular varieties

339
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:24,589
should we be putting them in water

340
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:28,250
should we putting them in some kind of

341
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:31,099
flower solution etc etc but that's his

342
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:33,890
field and I've had much more fun with

343
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:36,469
doing other things not very complicated

344
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:43,460
things and I want to tell you a bit

345
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:46,750
about that research one that we're just

346
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:51,319
concluding now for the second year is a

347
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:54,558
chance observation that snapdragons are

348
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:57,859
fairly Hardy and even in our winters

349
00:17:54,558 --> 00:18:00,410
here we can have a situation where they

350
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:02,509
kind of struggle back in the second year

351
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:06,320
after you've grown them in in the first

352
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:09,920
year and so we had a variety trial in

353
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:13,899
the in our high tunnel does everyone

354
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:16,279
understand high tunnel what I mean is

355
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,710
essentially a greenhouse that doesn't

356
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:23,058
have heat and where we're producing the

357
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:25,880
crop in the ground not in containers so

358
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:27,589
they're up to them and we keep it

359
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,179
covered during the winter so there is

360
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:32,689
some protection going on in that

361
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:35,679
situation so these are experiments that

362
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:40,480
we have been doing in the high tunnel

363
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,480
situation and in this case also

364
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:46,940
comparing with growth in the field and

365
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:52,039
so we did a series of planting dates

366
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:56,450
trying to see how can we produce this

367
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:59,389
crop and because we can extend a season

368
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:03,740
earlier with a tunnel we were able to

369
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:07,040
sow the seed on in mid-february and we

370
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:10,220
were harvesting by the 31st of May with

371
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:13,178
the field planting we came in a couple

372
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:16,749
of weeks later or a week later

373
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:20,288
then a second tunnel planting came in

374
00:19:16,749 --> 00:19:22,329
about mid-september the yields in the

375
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:25,929
first three were quite good the last one

376
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:28,298
didn't really have enough time so we

377
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:31,538
followed up on this work a couple of

378
00:19:28,298 --> 00:19:33,819
years ago we had a variety trial in the

379
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:36,730
high tunnel where we were looking at

380
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:40,628
just performance of the varieties and

381
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:42,519
then at the end of that fall season the

382
00:19:40,628 --> 00:19:45,128
plants looked so good I thought well

383
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:47,558
let's just see if they can survive over

384
00:19:45,128 --> 00:19:49,928
the winter and lo and behold some of

385
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:52,418
them did quite well and came back and we

386
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:54,129
harvested the second crop so you can see

387
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:58,528
the yields here and this is yield per

388
00:19:54,128 --> 00:20:01,808
unit area for the first one Chantilly

389
00:19:58,528 --> 00:20:04,720
the yield went down a little bit the

390
00:20:01,808 --> 00:20:06,730
next one did fine in the fall but then

391
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,858
it was mostly winter killed there wasn't

392
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:10,569
anything left nothing came back so the

393
00:20:08,858 --> 00:20:13,689
yield was essentially fallen that said

394
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:16,028
so this was a problem of winter damage

395
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:17,919
now we didn't do anything extra we

396
00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:21,970
didn't put any extra protection on these

397
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,980
they were just surviving or not as the

398
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:26,230
case may be and you can look down the

399
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:29,980
rest of the list and see that some did

400
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:32,829
fine and some of them this Potomac

401
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,269
lavender in fact gave higher yields in

402
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:36,970
the spring than it did in the fall

403
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:39,909
before but it showed that yes you can

404
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:42,700
overwinter this crop and that might be

405
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:45,700
something that a grower in our region

406
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:49,179
would do so we followed up on that this

407
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:52,179
past year with a more regular experiment

408
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:56,259
where we again sowed the seed in the

409
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:59,470
fall and our sorry in the summer for the

410
00:20:56,259 --> 00:21:02,230
fall harvest and then kept the plants

411
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:06,759
over until the spring but protected them

412
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:09,269
in different ways and that result showed

413
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:12,298
first of all that again we could see

414
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:14,798
varietal differences in winter survival

415
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:16,839
but we also could make quite a bit of

416
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:18,690
difference in winter survival by keeping

417
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:21,368
a low tunnel over the plants themselves

418
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:23,710
so we harvested the fall crop there

419
00:21:21,368 --> 00:21:24,250
wasn't much left above ground but then

420
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,910
put

421
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:29,920
low tunnel over over that and then in

422
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:32,680
the spring as it started coming up we

423
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:36,550
kept the tunnel in place until they

424
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:39,400
started to to shoot up and lo and behold

425
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:42,549
with that low tunnel protection we got

426
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,769
quite a nice yield in the spring so a

427
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:49,539
combination of having the right variety

428
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:52,809
and protection actually gets you around

429
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:55,420
40 stems per square foot which on a 9 by

430
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:58,299
9 inch spacing is not too shabby I think

431
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:00,009
in fact we stopped harvesting this

432
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:01,450
experiment we got sick of it and we had

433
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:03,549
so many other things that we were doing

434
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:10,480
in the spring that they kept on growing

435
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:15,539
and right and we could have gotten more

436
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,539
stems off this thing but decided to stop

437
00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:26,680
it's really hard to define annual I

438
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:28,389
think in this situation it's you know it

439
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,590
depends what kind of Windows you have I

440
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:34,150
think in a zone 7 probably a perennial

441
00:22:31,589 --> 00:22:39,399
unless it's taken out by some disease or

442
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:45,280
something like that yeah ok so next

443
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:47,530
topic so that essentially that work

444
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:50,379
points to the fact that we can in fact

445
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:55,440
use that structure the high unheated

446
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:57,960
greenhouse as a way of perhaps having

447
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:03,100
perennials that wouldn't make it outside

448
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:05,470
do so with the help of that structure

449
00:23:03,099 --> 00:23:09,730
and maybe something more than that and

450
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:13,420
so we've had a bit of experimentation

451
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:15,940
with you comas the pineapple lily bill

452
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:18,519
was Miller and his students have done

453
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:21,330
much more in that regard but we've

454
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:24,099
successfully overwintered this switch

455
00:23:21,329 --> 00:23:27,639
outside well bill can do it but I

456
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:30,619
haven't been able to keep you coma

457
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:34,700
slowly alive over the

458
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:37,269
over the winter but that's one that

459
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:40,700
certainly can be experimented with

460
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:44,599
agapanthus is a is a beautiful flower

461
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:46,430
and I'd love to get some research going

462
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:52,730
on that but I'm running out of time to

463
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:56,120
do it so I'm passing the torch and then

464
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:58,910
the other one alstroemeria dr. mark

465
00:23:56,119 --> 00:24:00,769
bridge and the director of the Long

466
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:02,929
Island Station is an alstroemeria

467
00:24:00,769 --> 00:24:05,900
breeder and he has developed some

468
00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:09,620
varieties of alstroemeria that will do

469
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:11,720
quite fine in the field but in the

470
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:15,019
tunnel environment where the stamens get

471
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:18,259
longer we might be able to really

472
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:25,190
revolutionize that crop and use it here

473
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:28,190
instead of importing it from Colombia so

474
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:30,039
there's work to be done I think it might

475
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:33,590
be quite interesting

476
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:37,039
another simple problem at simple

477
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:39,019
technique is sort of generally I'd like

478
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,389
to see as many stems as possible per

479
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:44,210
unit area harvested for these cut

480
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:47,150
flowers and so what I'd like to be able

481
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:50,000
to do is manipulate the plants to become

482
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:51,740
more productive and in many cases fine

483
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,308
you can just plant them closer together

484
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,990
and they all produce more stems but

485
00:24:54,308 --> 00:24:58,308
plants are expensive and are there other

486
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:02,058
ways we can do this

487
00:24:58,308 --> 00:25:03,950
well horticulturists and gardeners have

488
00:25:02,058 --> 00:25:05,599
known for centuries that if you pinch

489
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:07,970
out the top of the plant

490
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:12,049
when it's still in its vegetative stage

491
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:14,600
you force branches from from the base so

492
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:17,029
here we've been doing this with several

493
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:19,819
species but here's sunflower it's

494
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:21,829
producing about six leaves out comes the

495
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:26,269
growing point and what you end up with

496
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:30,259
then is one two three branches where the

497
00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:33,889
growing point was before and these can

498
00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:35,679
get quite tall and suddenly you have a

499
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:39,410
yield three times of what you had before

500
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:41,240
it's not too bad so we've done a fair

501
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:43,140
amount of work in this especially with

502
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,250
sunflowers but also with other species

503
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,250
and I wanted to show you some of that

504
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:52,230
flowers when you do that instead of

505
00:25:50,069 --> 00:25:56,279
having one stem per unit area you have

506
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:58,589
three so they have to somehow manage in

507
00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:01,289
that smaller amount of space per stem

508
00:25:58,589 --> 00:26:03,289
and so what happens is the stems are

509
00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:06,539
thinner and the flowers are smaller

510
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:09,450
here's a comparison this is the control

511
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:12,869
which has not been pinched here it is

512
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:15,600
after pinching so they're smaller well

513
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:19,039
there's a market for those and you do

514
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:22,409
get quite a nice increase in yield

515
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:24,869
there's a comparison you can see the

516
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:27,240
back of that picture the ones that

517
00:26:24,869 --> 00:26:29,039
haven't been pinched these have so

518
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:33,180
there's delayed a little bit in

519
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:36,119
flowering five six seven days but the

520
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:38,190
yield is increased and if you look at a

521
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:42,779
typical experiment this one from

522
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:45,960
nineteen or sorry 2007 where stem

523
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:49,589
numbers are increased the days to flower

524
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:52,410
are delayed a little bit the stem length

525
00:26:49,589 --> 00:26:55,230
is reduced for individual stem but 60

526
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:57,180
centimeters for a stem if you had a

527
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:59,279
meter long you're gonna put that in the

528
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:02,130
vas @b area up here so you really only

529
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:05,339
need fifty or sixty centimeters so it's

530
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:07,290
not a big deal and the flower diameter

531
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:08,759
as I showed in the previous picture is

532
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:11,789
also reduced

533
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:15,869
so that's feasible and it's something

534
00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:20,369
that can be easily done but as I

535
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:23,099
mentioned you do sacrifice flower flower

536
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:25,559
size and that can become a constraint if

537
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:27,929
you overdo it so we've been doing

538
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:31,950
experiments along this line for some

539
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:34,410
time and using different spacings six by

540
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:36,960
six inches nine by nine inches twelve by

541
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:39,090
twelve inches and as you see as you

542
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,630
crowd the plants closer and you pinch

543
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:45,569
them you see the flowers get pretty

544
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:47,460
small and you get to a point where yeah

545
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:51,019
I don't like that it's too small and

546
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:53,509
there are abnormalities that come in

547
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:56,150
miss shapen these sorts of things so the

548
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:58,069
market determines then what you can get

549
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:02,030
away with and what you can still sell

550
00:27:58,069 --> 00:28:05,869
and if you express it in terms of stem

551
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:09,379
yield per unit area the more you squeeze

552
00:28:05,869 --> 00:28:12,079
over to the right the more you curve

553
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:14,990
this thing down and if the market says

554
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:20,629
well this minimum size that I will

555
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:22,700
accept is around 1.5 inches then you

556
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:25,160
better not go any higher than 6,000

557
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:27,170
stems 4,000 square feet so it's that

558
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,660
kind of relationship within this of

559
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:33,830
course you will have differences between

560
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:36,830
varieties so the pro cut amber glow that

561
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:38,990
inverted triangle is one that has a

562
00:28:36,829 --> 00:28:42,289
larger flower to start with so you

563
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:46,609
squeeze it it also reduces in size but

564
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:48,710
that line is above the line of the other

565
00:28:46,609 --> 00:28:50,659
two varieties that have smaller flowers

566
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:55,308
so this relationship is something that

567
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:59,300
can be quite useful and might might be a

568
00:28:55,308 --> 00:29:03,160
good guide okay so we're into pinching

569
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:06,889
let's pinch something else lisianthus

570
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:09,140
beautiful flower looks like a rose lasts

571
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:11,059
a long time in the bars you'll in the

572
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:13,160
bars back in the corner over there when

573
00:29:11,058 --> 00:29:16,849
you have some more snacks you'll be able

574
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:19,940
to take a closer look now this plant

575
00:29:16,849 --> 00:29:22,879
produces several stems per plant

576
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:25,580
unlike the sunflower you're already

577
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,610
starting with several and if you pinch

578
00:29:25,579 --> 00:29:30,889
it early it will produce branches but

579
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:33,589
your increase in yield is going to be

580
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:37,670
less than what you'd expect then you'd

581
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:41,000
get with a single stem sunflower but you

582
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:44,390
still again by manipulating that the

583
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:48,429
spacing the amount of area per plant you

584
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:52,460
can again increase productivity fairly

585
00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:55,040
fair amount again these are experiments

586
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:58,850
that we're doing again this year this is

587
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:02,750
last year with using two spacing six by

588
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:05,178
six and nine by nine pinching or not

589
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:07,788
our stem lengths interestingly enough at

590
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:10,250
least at the closest spacing actually

591
00:30:07,788 --> 00:30:12,650
increases and what's happening here is

592
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:14,150
that the stems are closer together so

593
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:16,690
they're stretching for the light and

594
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:21,519
they're they're actually getting longer

595
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:24,860
but look at the yield per square foot 15

596
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:27,259
against 11 or the way we are had been

597
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:31,250
growing it before we're only getting

598
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:33,798
maybe nine or so and the flowering dates

599
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:36,619
are delayed a little bit by pinching but

600
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:39,558
not all that much so a combination of

601
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:42,139
close spacing and pinching is actually

602
00:30:39,558 --> 00:30:46,519
giving us quite a nice increase in yield

603
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:49,580
and here are some pictures of that

604
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:51,619
unfortunately this is a six by six this

605
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:56,000
is a nine by nine that hasn't been

606
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:58,699
pinched in the same variety six by six

607
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,429
nine by nine with pinching you see this

608
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,929
stretching out this is cheating a little

609
00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:07,190
bit this whole thing should be shifted

610
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:09,440
up so it isn't showing isn't giving the

611
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:11,679
whole truth but you'll have to trust me

612
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,679
on that

613
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:24,798
okay second last topic sunflowers may or

614
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:29,210
may not react to day length depends on

615
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:31,700
the variety and it in many cases if

616
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:36,350
you're just producing sunflowers during

617
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:39,250
the summer it doesn't really matter and

618
00:31:36,349 --> 00:31:41,629
the sensitivity to this day length is

619
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:44,900
happening in the first three weeks after

620
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:47,150
emergence after that the flower has

621
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,769
either already formed or will be

622
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:56,150
somewhat delayed depending on the

623
00:31:48,769 --> 00:32:00,200
reaction so we found in screening that

624
00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:02,720
some are what we would call facultative

625
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,130
short day pants that means that even if

626
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,400
the day length is long they will

627
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:10,070
eventually come to flower or they are

628
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,590
day neutral and then we found a few that

629
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:14,629
are actually contrary they do it the

630
00:32:12,589 --> 00:32:15,319
other way they're delayed by short days

631
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:21,130
but

632
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:24,349
by long days so we've worked with a a

633
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:26,300
screening test which allows us to grow

634
00:32:24,349 --> 00:32:28,849
the plants in the greenhouse under

635
00:32:26,299 --> 00:32:30,680
controlled day lengths conditions for

636
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:33,349
the first three weeks and then we

637
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:36,470
transplant them to the field and then

638
00:32:33,349 --> 00:32:39,319
measure what happens and the result you

639
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:42,799
can see here with some varieties it's

640
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:46,519
quite drastic in fact if you have one

641
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:49,369
that's sensitive and give it short days

642
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:53,269
it stays small it flowers three weeks

643
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:55,039
earlier and then the one that's growing

644
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:58,579
under long day and some other

645
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:00,139
characteristics change as well if you

646
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:02,509
look at it closely and one of the

647
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:05,690
varieties that is most sensitive is

648
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:08,269
actually this industry standard here in

649
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:11,269
upstate New York a variety called Sun

650
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:14,389
rich orange under short day conditions

651
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:18,740
it develops these ugly little Cypress

652
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:20,630
it's like super flowering whereas under

653
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,019
long day conditions it behaves itself

654
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:25,990
and looks just like you'd expect a

655
00:33:23,019 --> 00:33:30,019
variety there's a close-up of the

656
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:33,950
budding over there on the right so it's

657
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:37,490
important to know whether a variety is

658
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:41,210
going to react that way or not and here

659
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:42,920
are some other characteristics then if

660
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:44,930
you take the short they sensitive

661
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:50,360
variety and this a test that we did in

662
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:53,000
in 2014 of newer varieties under short

663
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:55,490
day conditions at Florida in 50 days

664
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,549
took almost 70 days under long day

665
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:01,279
conditions right so the plants were were

666
00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:03,799
speeded up quite a lot and as a result

667
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:07,420
plants were small and the flora diameter

668
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:09,710
was small as well for the day neutrals

669
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:13,010
not much difference between the two

670
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:16,970
treatments and the long day is reversed

671
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:20,180
to some extent flowers delayed under

672
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:24,949
short day conditions not so much under

673
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:26,389
long day etc etc so it can make quite a

674
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:29,069
bit of difference and it will make

675
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:31,319
difference for people who are using

676
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:34,400
to grow an early crop of sunflowers

677
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:37,470
because they're putting them in when

678
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:40,470
march/april when the day length is is

679
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:43,079
still short and so they're triggered and

680
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:44,969
you get early flowering that's great but

681
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:48,420
plants are like this and the plants are

682
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:50,399
ugly so you can't market it so it's

683
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:54,420
important to know or if you're growing

684
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:56,930
in Florida or South Carolina or

685
00:34:54,420 --> 00:35:01,610
someplace then again you want to know

686
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:07,829
whether the plants are sensitive or not

687
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:09,530
last topic rudbeckia don't have an

688
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:12,150
example we aren't growing them this year

689
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:16,410
but very showy flowers I'll show you

690
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:22,889
some pictures little later on and we're

691
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:24,359
finding this is back 2005 that the later

692
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:26,069
you go in the season you plant them in

693
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:29,280
the spring they have very nice stems

694
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:30,840
they're no beautiful and so on but they

695
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,570
keep flowering all summer long which is

696
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:36,480
nice but the stem length gets shorter

697
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:37,890
and shorter and shorter wait a minute

698
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,289
what's going on here doesn't need

699
00:35:37,889 --> 00:35:42,480
fertilizer or what's going on and then

700
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:44,340
we decided to look in the literature and

701
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,670
found out that it is an obligate

702
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:51,000
long-day plant but the way it reacts to

703
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:53,909
the day length requirement is not that

704
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,769
it stops flowering it sort of gradually

705
00:35:53,909 --> 00:35:58,589
gets shortened it's as if the stem

706
00:35:55,769 --> 00:36:02,639
length is dictated by the day length

707
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:04,740
under which the flower is developing so

708
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,809
we did some experiments with shading

709
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:08,729
trying to lengthen the stems and this

710
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:10,019
kind of thing didn't really make any

711
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,880
difference and you just have these

712
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:16,440
parallel lines all going down into the

713
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:23,550
basement so what to do how can we keep

714
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:26,039
stands long so we decided to innovate we

715
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:27,990
had to do it economically so have to

716
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:29,849
come up with instruments that can do

717
00:36:27,989 --> 00:36:32,399
this for us without having to pay NYSEG

718
00:36:29,849 --> 00:36:36,299
all sorts of fees because I mean if you

719
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,880
turn a flower field into a used car park

720
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,250
you do have electric bills that you

721
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,800
might

722
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:46,630
be able to really justify for a crop

723
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:50,560
like like rudbeckia here and so one

724
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:53,289
thing that we used is a light that

725
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:55,299
shines down on the plant and it has a

726
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:57,400
solar cell above its like things that

727
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,920
you see on sidewalks and things like

728
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,360
that to say hey that works pretty good

729
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,730
except that the amount of light that it

730
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:06,099
rose is relatively small and is focused

731
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:07,719
in the plants over here didn't get the

732
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:09,969
signal so they're still as short as

733
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:14,919
anything and in order to do the whole

734
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:16,929
bed you'd spend a fortune on it so that

735
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:19,659
didn't work then we got even more

736
00:37:16,929 --> 00:37:22,000
innovative decided oh the way we can do

737
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:25,529
this is use Christmas lights right and

738
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,019
so again solar-powered you can get these

739
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:31,120
from Amazon no sweat and so they're

740
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:33,759
there you see the black string there and

741
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:37,630
you see the light shining down and you

742
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:40,480
see the plant saying me it's not enough

743
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:44,200
light it's really so so innovation

744
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,389
didn't work in this case and so we

745
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:48,669
decided we needed to really do a little

746
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:51,460
science in this and figure out well how

747
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:53,260
much light does it actually need in

748
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:58,559
order to trigger the photoperiod

749
00:37:53,260 --> 00:38:02,680
response well we have this very nice

750
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:04,840
green house set up at Gutterman that we

751
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:07,809
were using for the photoperiod reaction

752
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:11,200
of sunflowers that i mentioned before so

753
00:38:07,809 --> 00:38:13,059
we we can put curtains over the top and

754
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:15,039
just say okay the day lengths is when

755
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:19,210
the curtains close there's no more light

756
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:21,550
and so we use that and close the

757
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:25,990
curtains at 12 hours see the curtain

758
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:30,610
goes this way but then at the end we put

759
00:38:25,989 --> 00:38:35,829
in these lights that kept the day length

760
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:38,380
at 16 hours so the long day and when you

761
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:40,869
do that and you only put lights at one

762
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:43,480
end then only the plants that are

763
00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:46,539
actually sensing the light will flower

764
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:50,019
or have some kind of stem length and the

765
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:52,599
others own and so very nice

766
00:38:50,019 --> 00:38:54,400
once close to the light are flowering

767
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:56,409
and looking very happy and these guys

768
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,559
down here are producing spinach but who

769
00:38:56,409 --> 00:39:03,368
wants the Rebecca yes finish and and

770
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:08,139
from that then we can get an a a test of

771
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:11,650
how much light you really need and the

772
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:14,170
height of the flowers related to the day

773
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:17,079
length extension the intensity of light

774
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:19,960
of the day length extension shows that

775
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:23,110
it's about three micro moles per square

776
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:26,139
meter that's needed and so it does

777
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:28,860
really require the light equivalent to

778
00:39:26,139 --> 00:39:31,210
what you'd have in a used car lot so

779
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:35,010
sorry we aren't going to be able to do

780
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:37,449
that so what to do instead well I think

781
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:40,830
what we have to go back to is the

782
00:39:37,449 --> 00:39:43,449
germplasm of rudbeckia and try to find

783
00:39:40,829 --> 00:39:45,190
varieties of rudbeckia that are a

784
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:47,019
neutral like some of the sunflower

785
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:49,780
varieties that we're working with before

786
00:39:47,019 --> 00:39:52,000
no I'm not a reader and I run out of

787
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:54,910
time but if somebody looks looking for a

788
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,639
thesis project come and talk to me we'll

789
00:39:54,909 --> 00:40:00,129
be happy to put you to work

790
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:02,170
so but if you take a variety like Indian

791
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:05,369
summer which is a very popular variety

792
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:09,720
under 12 hours no flowers under 16 hours

793
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:14,350
is doing what it should ok

794
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:17,289
so time for me to finish and so I'd like

795
00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:19,539
to conclude its first of all to

796
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:22,750
summarize that in the cut flower

797
00:40:19,539 --> 00:40:24,369
industry local cut flower industry in

798
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:28,510
the northeastern United States in this

799
00:40:24,369 --> 00:40:33,510
in the state's general is increasingly

800
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:36,100
producing products that people want and

801
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:38,109
producing income for those people that

802
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:40,089
are growing the flowers and it's an

803
00:40:38,108 --> 00:40:43,869
important one which i think really does

804
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:46,869
require quite a bit of back stopping as

805
00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:48,400
they help themselves as well and the

806
00:40:46,869 --> 00:40:50,170
association of specially cut flower

807
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,769
growers is that organization that's

808
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:56,650
helping them quite a lot supplying them

809
00:40:53,769 --> 00:40:58,210
with research is something that I've had

810
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:00,440
the privilege to do and have enjoyed

811
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:03,068
very much and that is

812
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:06,380
gotten into some extension work as well

813
00:41:03,068 --> 00:41:09,679
now I should have spent about half an

814
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:12,140
hour thanking people some of you in the

815
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:15,980
room many of you in the room and many

816
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:18,920
others in the department now section and

817
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:24,670
others who have been instrumental in

818
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:27,769
helping me work in this field and and

819
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:29,210
getting the job done the two that I want

820
00:41:27,769 --> 00:41:32,838
to mention that are sitting in the front

821
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:36,079
here are Priscilla and Emily who have

822
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:37,639
put in long hours this year somehow and

823
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,289
after all the years of research I

824
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:41,779
haven't still haven't been able to

825
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:44,300
figure out how to grow only a few crops

826
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:46,099
I always say old man this looks good let

827
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:51,349
me put in a variety trial of that and

828
00:41:46,099 --> 00:41:54,829
and they have been the suffering beasts

829
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:56,750
of burden that and have in fact spent

830
00:41:54,829 --> 00:41:58,460
time to get them all harvested and

831
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:00,858
measure then things like that so I do
