5
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:12,660
about interviews you have interviews

6
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,059
this afternoon

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,039
they are mock interviews but we're gonna

8
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,839
give you tips on how to actually do this

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,320
when you get into this grad school

10
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:24,390
application I'm the entire process but

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,060

the front of the room so I'm Natalie as

13
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:31,079
I said I'm an ecology and evolutionary

14
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,329
biology and all these nice folks are

15
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:37,109
going to introduce themselves also do

16
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:39,030
you wanna hi I'm Jenna me and I'm a

17
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:42,869
first year PhD student in soil and crop

18
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:46,620
sciences hi I'm Cass and I'm a second

19
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:48,538
year PhD student entomology I'm Jenny

20
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:51,030
I'm also a second year PhD student in

21
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,280
ecology and evolutionary biology I'm

22
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,179
Eugene I'm a second year PhD in so crop

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,399
science I'm Lizzy and I'm a third year

24
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:00,229
PhD student in ecology and evolutionary

25
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,609
biology

26
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:04,170
hi everyone probably introduce myself

27
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,200
several times all the time but I'm John

28
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,269
and I'm a third year in entomology thank

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,829
you all so all of these people are going

30
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,688
to be helping today we're gonna do some

31
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:14,399
practice of what it actually looks like

32
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:17,548
to interview and we're gonna hear about

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,590
what a real interview when you get to

34
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,659
grad school looks like so as a reminder

35
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,090
we've talked about the fact that you're

36
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,830
having interviews later today don't

37
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,859
stress too much about them their

38
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:30,478
practice you're not expected to know all

39
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,578
the information about the people that

40
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:36,030
you're interviewing with we're not

41
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:39,239
judging you in any way it's practice but

42
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,000
today we're going to talk about what can

43
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:45,539
help you in the next interviews that

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,188
you'll go to so as I said we're going

45
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,259
over a couple different things we're

46
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:50,819
explaining what actually happens in a

47
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,859
grad school interview how is it

48
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,658
different from other job interviews that

49
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:56,759
you might know of because it is it's a

50
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,060
very different thing than a job

51
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,549
interview will give you a tool from what

52
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,990
what you might use when you sit down at

53
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,780
the beginning of that interview and

54
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:09,810
you're like oh god what am I gonna do

55
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,090
what do I say how do I start we'll give

56
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,900
you one tool that you can use to start

57
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,759
and then we'll go over some

58
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,620
questions that you might want to ask in

59
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,389
interviews that's a big component of it

60
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,269
where people want you to ask questions

61
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:24,219
they want to get to know you they want

62
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:28,569
to make sure that you know what you need

63
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:31,060
to know for that program so you've heard

64
00:02:28,568 --> 00:02:33,009
this many times already but we're here

65
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,688
as a resource we want you to ask

66
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:37,269
questions there's going to be time for

67
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:40,150
small group discussions today in this

68
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:43,269
workshop where you can ask anything you

69
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,280
want to know about interviewing maybe

70
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:46,780
other questions for the other workshops

71
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,759
because you'll get so much more

72
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:56,049
information okay so the cute picture I

73
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:58,269
thought basically we talked about an

74
00:02:56,049 --> 00:03:00,969
interview often they're like 30 minutes

75
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:02,829
you get in there and you're like what am

76
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:04,959
I going to talk about now and you start

77
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:06,879
with introducing yourself that we're

78
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,908
calling an elevator pitch it's just a

79
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,649
quick sort of summary who are you what

80
00:03:09,908 --> 00:03:14,169
do you do what are you excited about

81
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,629
then you're gonna go with this like

82
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:18,628
feedback back and forth you're gonna ask

83
00:03:16,628 --> 00:03:21,848
questions they're gonna ask questions

84
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:28,120
what are those questions you'll find out

85
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:29,698
a little bit so when you're in that fat

86
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,310
discussion that interview where you're

87
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:35,290
assessing the program the school you're

88
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,039
also hearing out whether you're a good

89
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:39,128
match

90
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:41,138
with that person the big point of grad

91
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:43,268
school is you want to be happy you want

92
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:44,919
to make sure that you get along with a

93
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:47,469
person that you would work with and

94
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:49,540
that's the interview is the time where

95
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:52,419
you're face to face you can really

96
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:54,578
figure out do our personalities match do

97
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:57,609
I like this person could I work with

98
00:03:54,579 --> 00:04:00,459
them so ask the questions that you need

99
00:03:57,609 --> 00:04:02,979
to know to answer that and you also want

100
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:05,408
to know obviously about the science is

101
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:08,949
that research topic that you're

102
00:04:05,408 --> 00:04:11,948
interested in really engaging and active

103
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:14,979
in that school in that program and in

104
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:17,769
that lab I know I'm going quickly

105
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:21,370
through this I'm a little excited some

106
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:24,028
of you might be excited also but we will

107
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,028
get into this

108
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,199
so I'm gonna turn it over to Toonami

109
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:34,540
who's going to talk about what faculty

110
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:37,599
expects so again I just thought I'd go

111
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,250
over really quickly the expectations

112
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,960
that faculty have from interviews which

113
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,730
is kind of this golden black box

114
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,949
question that I think we don't really

115
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,720
answer to at least I don't know the

116
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:48,789
answers to when I was in Japan for grad

117
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,440
school so we did the best thing that we

118
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,810
could think of and we went directly to

119
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:55,300
the faculty themselves and we sent out a

120
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:59,410
survey with these questions what do you

121
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,730
expect to be lab what do you expect them

122
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,550
to have done when they want to be in

123
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:05,230
your department what kind of skills or

124
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,550
personality traits you expect them to

125
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:13,330
display during interviews so

126
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:15,040
interestingly most faculty do not expect

127
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:16,930
you to have published papers in that

128
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,890
field or to have done any amount of

129
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:23,410
extensive research work what they do

130
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:26,168
expect and this is for faculty whose

131
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,390
labs your plank here they do expect you

132
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:30,250
to have read the research website and be

133
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:31,779
generally familiar with the area in

134
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,060
which they work and let's keep in mind

135
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:36,369
that this is for when you're actually

136
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,470
interviewing in grad school not for the

137
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,478
mock interviews that you will be having

138
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,580
later today afternoon so there's no need

139
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:43,899
to go over a faculty website we will be

140
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:44,529
in tripping woods today that's

141
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:48,728
unnecessary

142
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:51,519
but in the future that's a good tip so

143
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:54,129
this changes a little bit when we ask

144
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,289
them okay so what about someone who's

145
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:57,639
applying to be in your department but

146
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,120
who doesn't necessarily want to working

147
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,829
in that

148
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,459
how do your expectations change in that

149
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:05,589
case and so it's still consistent people

150
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:07,539
do expect that you've looked over their

151
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:09,279
website but you kind of know what's

152
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,780
going on in the field that you know the

153
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,299
latest kind of happenings in the field

154
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:15,009
but again nobody expects you have read

155
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:19,810
their papers nobody expects you to have

156
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:22,269
worked in that field but very important

157
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,160
again ask questions ask as many

158
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:25,899
questions as you can think of as as many

159
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,210
questions as you'd like people expect

160
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:30,459
you to be curious people expect you to

161
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:32,228
be interested in what their labs are

162
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:34,719
doing the programs are doing their

163
00:06:32,228 --> 00:06:37,449
department is doing so that's key even

164
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,940
if you don't necessarily even if you're

165
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:39,229
not

166
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,810
really interested in that person's work

167
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:47,900
ask questions use that opportunity to

168
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:50,990
gain more knowledge so this is what

169
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:52,789
faculty had to say about what they

170
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,610
expect students interviewing with them

171
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:57,530
to be like so what skills can you

172
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:00,680
cultivate or what qualities can you

173
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:03,529
practice so that you can kind of deliver

174
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:07,519
on these expectations so from the same

175
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:09,500
survey these are kind of the broad areas

176
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,149
and the person gauges here are basically

177
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,500
the number of faculty who said they

178
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:14,870
would expect to see their students

179
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,240
display these qualities so what was

180
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:20,030
exciting to me here was that qualities

181
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,250
like intelligence excitement ability to

182
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:24,469
talk about your research interests these

183
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,899
were more important than things like

184
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:29,180
your GPA your grades and your chest

185
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:31,549
scores which I personally think is very

186
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,319
promising because as a graduate student

187
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,579
qualities like hard work and

188
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,920
perseverance and this comes out a little

189
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:39,800
bit the qualities like hard work and

190
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,210
perseverance I think are way more

191
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,100
important than there's academic

192
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:44,629
stereotype of someone who's sitting in

193
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,960
their ivory tower and becomes a movies

194
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:50,240
brilliant here's what's also interesting

195
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:52,219
is that a lot of faculty mentioned

196
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,980
contribution to diversity and creating

197
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,870
an inclusive environment as important

198
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,910
factors in hiring students and

199
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:02,569
interviewing students so that being said

200
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:04,040
a word of caution faculty may not always

201
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:07,069
understand the place you're coming from

202
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:09,500
and there could be instances in grad

203
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:11,540
school interviews where you may be asked

204
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,949
inappropriate questions or incorrect

205
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,960
assumptions may be made about you

206
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:16,579
there's a host of different ways to deal

207
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,199
with this and we could maybe talk about

208
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,459
this a little bit more during the

209
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,110
debriefing or the question answer

210
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:22,969
session but if you do have those

211
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:25,160
questions or concerns again feel free to

212
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:27,290
reach out we've all been there we've all

213
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,780
heard those questions and we're happy to

214
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:35,360
talk to you about our strategies those

215
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:37,639
situations so we emphasized the

216
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,759
importance of asking questions of being

217
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:43,009
curious so what we did and you should

218
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:45,950
see these in the handouts and knowledge

219
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:48,139
is passed on we've kind of compiled a

220
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:50,540
bunch of different questions that we

221
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:51,679
think are really useful when it comes to

222
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:53,509
introduce they

223
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:56,179
you should feel free to ask faculty

224
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:57,620
about say if you find yourself stressing

225
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:58,819
out you're panicking you can't really

226
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,009
think of anything off the top of your

227
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,589
head there's a list of questions ready

228
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:05,539
for you and to make it kind of easier to

229
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:07,899
process we broke them down into three

230
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:10,849
big areas questions about the program

231
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:11,958
questions about resources that are

232
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,060
available to you as a graduate student

233
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:16,819
and then questions about your social

234
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:18,799
life because this is an often overlooked

235
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,120
aspect of grad school because you're

236
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,799
gonna be spending two years or five

237
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,690
years or six years in this place and you

238
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:26,719
need to survive you need to have a

239
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:28,010
social network so you will find more

240
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,290
information on this in the handouts

241
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:31,819
really but very quickly so in terms of

242
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:34,399
the program you can definitely ask

243
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,680
faculty about their opinions about the

244
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,450
program how do we think it's changed

245
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:41,149
since they joined the program where do

246
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:42,410
you think it's heading you know what are

247
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:45,200
the strengths one of the weaknesses of

248
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:46,490
the program resources talk about

249
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,950
professional development opportunities

250
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,629
the students go to conferences the

251
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,879
students get trained on presentation

252
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:54,889
skills on grant writing skills how

253
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,269
active our students and leadership and

254
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:57,769
governance all of these are important

255
00:09:56,269 --> 00:10:00,139
questions

256
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:03,139
how does funding work in the department

257
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:04,669
because different universities different

258
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:07,519
programs are very different funding

259
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:09,559
situations some people some departments

260
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,569
might expect you to teach for a certain

261
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:13,338
number of semesters or years some might

262
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,959
not so it's important to ask those

263
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:16,640
questions to know where your funding is

264
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,559
coming from and I think we're often

265
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:21,080
hesitant as graduate students because we

266
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,789
feel like we don't have that position of

267
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,770
power to ask these questions but it's

268
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:27,860
really important to do that same thing

269
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:29,419
about how long the students take to get

270
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,539
there each two year to get their masters

271
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:34,669
in this department and is that timeline

272
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:39,199
something you are personally comfortable

273
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:42,049
with social life I would say read the

274
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,610
room in terms of faculty interviews some

275
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:46,219
of these questions may be appropriate to

276
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,360
answering interviews some may not maybe

277
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,190
needs to be more appropriate during

278
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,379
social events or when you're talking to

279
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,430
graduate students but you can definitely

280
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:56,838
ask about the Graduate Student

281
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:59,059
Association how active is it how much

282
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:01,160
will you get to know about your cohort

283
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:03,889
about the people you are in this program

284
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:05,360
with what about lab meetings what the

285
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:06,949
lab atmosphere like what's

286
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,180
that must feel like what slap culture

287
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:12,440
like cost of living in that place how so

288
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:13,429
we like to be asked about funding

289
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,170
situation already

290
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:16,519
how far will they'll strike and take you

291
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:17,929
are you gonna be able to afford trend

292
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:19,959
are you going to be able to eat out once

293
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:22,370
number all of these are great questions

294
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:24,619
please don't hesitate to ask them and if

295
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:26,690
you have any other questions that you're

296
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,570
not sure if they're appropriate or not

297
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:31,820
once again talk to us we can figure it

298
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:33,560
out I'm gonna hand it back to Natalie so

299
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:40,910
we can get started on the elevator

300
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:43,819
pitches when you walk into the room this

301
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:45,860
might be the question you get it's not a

302
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,610
question it's just tell me about

303
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,039
yourself

304
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:53,209
and you might be like oh god like what

305
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:55,399
do I do with that and because all of us

306
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:56,750
feel that literally everyone standing in

307
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:59,870
front of the room has been in that

308
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:01,700
position we're gonna model what it might

309
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:04,190
look like for you we're actually going

310
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,129
to wait on passing out the tool until

311
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:09,709
after we model in the interest of time

312
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:12,559
but we're gonna turn it over to these

313
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:18,289
fine people just show you some examples

314
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:21,078
of what it might look like we've already

315
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:23,480
said this this is going to be okay you

316
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:24,799
can do it for me the hardest thing

317
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,139
you've been standing in front of this

318
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:30,019
room is relaxing enough not to just like

319
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:32,269
bounce all over the place so you're

320
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:34,220
gonna be fine you probably already know

321
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:38,570
that I need to tell myself that

322
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,399
sometimes maybe you do too so we're

323
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:42,680
gonna go over this in just a minute and

324
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,110
you'll get more information after we

325
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:47,088
practice but basically in an elevator

326
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:50,089
pitch like this you want to talk about

327
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:52,040
what you're doing now the present what

328
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:55,070
you've done that led you to that point

329
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:57,379
the past and what you want to do the

330
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:59,570
future you're going to get all of this

331
00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:01,789
in a handout with more information about

332
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,970
what might fit into each of these

333
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:06,860
categories but it's important here you

334
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:08,930
notice like you're a person with a whole

335
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,699
history and really what they want to

336
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:15,919
know in that interview is what's your

337
00:13:10,698 --> 00:13:18,379
history what do you want to do so your

338
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,029
future should connect to the experiences

339
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:21,220
that you

340
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:22,059
are doing right now and that you've done

341
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,310
previously

342
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:26,799
Anitra talked a lot about research

343
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:31,239
experiences and things that will help

344
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:33,189
you to sort of bolster your own past to

345
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,500
prepare you for grad school so this is

346
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:40,570
where you actually share it one-on-one

347
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:43,419
in person okay we're gonna come back to

348
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:45,820
that in a second first though I'm gonna

349
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:47,740
ask these people wonderful people to

350
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:50,470
model what an interview might look like

351
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:53,590
you Dean who introduced himself is going

352
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:59,050
to play the role of a professor watch

353
00:13:53,590 --> 00:14:01,509
you think it'll be fun and then three of

354
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:03,879
these folks are gonna show you different

355
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:07,330
elevator pitches so I'm gonna call on

356
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:09,159
John first on Eugene and John are gonna

357
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:12,040
tell you give you this really really

358
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:12,429
quick elevator pitch it's gonna be one

359
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:14,740
minute

360
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:29,829
I'm gonna cut them off that's going to

361
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:31,810
be fun for everyone so okay so my name

362
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:34,600
is John and I'm like a student at

363
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:37,000
Cornell I'm like really like really

364
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,000
passionate about insects I'm doing my

365
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,120
major yeah my major in entomology and

366
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,769
it's it's great I like get to see bugs

367
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,149
and like I work with fruit flies and

368
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:47,620
they're like really cool cuz you know a

369
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:49,360
lot of like really cool genetic stuff

370
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,039
with them and but like what I'm really

371
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,600
actually interested in are their

372
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:54,610
microbes I think their microbes are

373
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,409
fascinating microbes do so many cool

374
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:58,750
things and insects like they're way way

375
00:14:56,409 --> 00:15:00,519
cooler things that like I mean I just ah

376
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,120
you know they're these ants they're

377
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:05,319
amazing

378
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,870
like they farm I was wait what okay so

379
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,570
these ants they're amazing they farm

380
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:11,889
this fungus and a called leaf cutter

381
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,480
ants they're really cool I don't do any

382
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:15,939
research on them but like I took a class

383
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:19,289
and I learned a lot about them I'm like

384
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,290
sometimes I feel like I'm an expert

385
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:36,049
[Music]

386
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:46,300
hi hi I'm Cassie oh you know what sorry

387
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,740
I was actually out doing field work

388
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:50,399
yesterday I'm covered in paint

389
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,930
I'm so sorry um I'm working on

390
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,350
collecting bees right now in this like

391
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:59,769
weird way or using Feebles it's like

392
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:03,490
anyway um hi I'm Cass and I'm really

393
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:05,019
excited about bees and networks so I'm

394
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:10,450
really interested both in like the

395
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:13,000
theoretical side sweep oh yeah I'm so

396
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:14,740
sorry so I'm I did my masters in a

397
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:24,419
forestry school and I was in Connecticut

398
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:28,180
and then before that I was a lot of work

399
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:33,429
nutrient cycling I don't think so no

400
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:51,458
where is she based oh okay cool I would

401
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:54,278
love to meet her that would be hi I'm

402
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:56,139
Jenny Julie let's meet you um and so I'm

403
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:57,549
really interested in birds and I've

404
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:59,379
loved them since I was about 10 years

405
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:01,289
old that I became interested in them

406
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:04,179
enemy ecology and evolutionary biology

407
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:05,289
perspective when I was I'm starting as

408
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:07,829
an undergraduate at the University of

409
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:09,699
Chicago so there I worked on

410
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:12,159
understanding the distribution of

411
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:15,100
non-native parrots in the US and doing

412
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,839
that species distribution modeling to

413
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:19,509
understand what environmental factors

414
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:21,039
influence distribution um so I really

415
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:23,980
loved that work and I loved thinking

416
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,109
about birds in a wide geographic

417
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,519
distribution manner um but one aspect

418
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:32,349
that was kind of missing for me there

419
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:34,480
was understanding how their movement so

420
00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:36,908
for my PhD work I'm really interested in

421
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,730
focusing on movement and social ecology

422
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:42,100
of birds I'm also really interested in

423
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:45,278
migration I think it's the coolest thing

424
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:47,829
and so I'd love to focus on how birds

425
00:17:45,278 --> 00:17:50,609
make decisions about movement and route

426
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:53,168
as they're migrating I'm currently I'm

427
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:54,459
doing a gap years I've been learning all

428
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:55,090
of these different techniques and

429
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,610
ornithology

430
00:17:55,089 --> 00:18:00,369
banding as well as different molecular

431
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:02,500
techniques so I'm really excited to

432
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:04,678
apply some of those techniques to my PhD

433
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:31,798
as well to continue doing some modeling

434
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:34,379
sounds like that's pretty apparent yeah

435
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:37,720
what else

436
00:18:34,378 --> 00:18:41,918
so preparation varied what did you think

437
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:43,929
was good yet cool so yeah knowing what

438
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,769
the context of that research is what

439
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:49,570
does it matter

440
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:52,599
yeah yes organizing in a logical way

441
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:55,689
that's hard to do on your feet but yeah

442
00:18:52,599 --> 00:19:04,599
it matters any other things like

443
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:06,278
specifics of this yeah cool yeah so when

444
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:07,928
you're talking it's not just you're

445
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:10,599
talking to anybody you're talking

446
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:13,028
specifically to someone that you want to

447
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:14,168
work with or for and then you really

448
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:17,019
want to make sure you're telling them

449
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:19,470
why you're so excited about working with

450
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:24,128
them or why you're a good fit great

451
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:26,019
other things that people noticed was

452
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:31,569
there anything that you're like I think

453
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:34,058
I might do that maybe okay so I do this

454
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:36,759
obviously like you can tell I'm like a

455
00:19:34,058 --> 00:19:38,769
little crazy sometimes and so I walk in

456
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:40,960
and I'm like oh god Birds they're so

457
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:44,740
cool I'm just like really excited about

458
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,759
that and people are like yeah okay great

459
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,990
the reality is that a lot of us end up

460
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,179
interviewing for grad school because

461
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,099
we're passionate because you are

462
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:56,919
enthusiastic so you notice when Jenny

463
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:59,798
talked about her research she still was

464
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:02,499
like migration so cool it's just the

465
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:04,658
coolest and that's great you want to be

466
00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:08,288
authentic to who you are so not all of

467
00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:12,429
us are like crazy bouncy balls some of

468
00:20:08,288 --> 00:20:14,888
us like personality very so that's why

469
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:17,740
I'm weird and I'm up at this front of

470
00:20:14,888 --> 00:20:19,959
the room get really excited not all of

471
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,909
us are that way you don't have to be any

472
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,970
particular way when you're interviewing

473
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:28,659
people are not judging you based on how

474
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:30,249
you perform as a person or something

475
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:34,240
like that they are looking for who you

476
00:20:30,249 --> 00:20:36,999
are in reality so whatever that is do it

477
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,440
you know your self best and you know how

478
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:40,509
you want to interact with other people

479
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,919
and how you want to build that

480
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:43,899
relationship because that's what you're

481
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:47,309
doing is you're figuring out if you're a

482
00:20:43,898 --> 00:20:49,959
good match with these people okay

483
00:20:47,308 --> 00:20:52,388
there's more to talk about we're going

484
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,639
to debrief in small groups but to give

485
00:20:52,388 --> 00:20:56,138
you all sort of some tools as we talked

486
00:20:54,638 --> 00:20:56,729
about for doing your own elevator

487
00:20:56,138 --> 00:20:59,408
pitches

488
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:03,278
gennadi has handed out this present past

489
00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:06,278
future formula it's a formula it's

490
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:08,259
simplistic but it helps you to sort of

491
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:10,839
think about what you might include in

492
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:13,389
that introduction in the interview so

493
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:17,079
we're gonna give you five ish minutes

494
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:20,319
and as you look at this sheet you see on

495
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:22,960
the front side of it the front side of

496
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:26,918
it has a lot of questions that might

497
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,649
relate to your present your past and on

498
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:33,538
the back side there's a blank this is a

499
00:21:29,648 --> 00:21:35,888
gimmicky thing but to help you prep for

500
00:21:33,538 --> 00:21:37,720
your elevator pitch for grad school

501
00:21:35,888 --> 00:21:40,959
we're gonna give you a few minutes to

502
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:43,569
jot down some experiences that fit in to

503
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,759
present past and future and what

504
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:47,740
narrative might tie all of those

505
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,329
together the reason you're doing this

506
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:53,579
now is that you're going to practice

507
00:21:49,329 --> 00:21:57,158
these pitches rapid-fire not stressful

508
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:58,899
hope probably stressful hopefully not

509
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:01,420
too

510
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,519
they're taking just a few minutes this

511
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:06,940
is for your use nobody's looking at it

512
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:08,650
right something if you want to but start

513
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,509
thinking about what your pitch might be

514
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,670
and then we're gonna actually do them

515
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:16,589
you're gonna pair off and we'll do them

516
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:16,590
in a second okay

517
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:24,630
face something that you thought was

518
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:26,369
really helpful so here in this debrief

519
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:31,260
work something that you're still

520
00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:35,250
concerned about and so let's start this

521
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:41,910
table one of you can use the mic elect

522
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:44,900
someone yeah no I thought I would

523
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,900
amplify that yeah

524
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,569
the takeaway I had one of the takeaways

525
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:53,909
I mean there's several was that you have

526
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:55,169
to remember that you may be really

527
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,900
passionate about stuff that you're

528
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:59,250
you're also like being interviewed

529
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,320
alongside two other people were also

530
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:03,690
very passionate about steps so you have

531
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:06,089
to think how do i express it in a way

532
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:24,630
that puts me you know makes me stand out

533
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:26,609
from the pack can be scary but finding

534
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,870
that thing that's like that you care

535
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:29,339
most about one of the tables we were

536
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:32,879
talking about the thing that gets you

537
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:36,750
like really going where you're like yes

538
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,880
this is what I feel comfortable I'm good

539
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,769
and motivated doing that's what you

540
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,650
should talk about so yeah we're

541
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:45,569
passionate about many things I'm going

542
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:54,000
to go to your table this is the table we

543
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:56,789
talked about yeah so just kinda going

544
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,859
off of what she said um a big concern of

545
00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:02,159
mine when I was giving my little speech

546
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:04,409
or spiel or whatever it is was trying to

547
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:07,080
tie in you know things that you're

548
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:09,480
passionate about outside of science is

549
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:10,799
outside of research and what may be and

550
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,990
how that may have drawn you into

551
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,579
research and kind of you know pushing

552
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:16,650
you in that direction so it's just good

553
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:18,480
to know that they're looking at you this

554
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:21,180
is a conversation this isn't you know

555
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,860
Justin what is what can you bring to

556
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:25,259
this job you know what can you bring as

557
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:26,759
a human being and what kind of aspects

558
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:28,980
to science you know or what kind of

559
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:31,109
aspects of yourself can you bring sort

560
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,410
of diversify our science knowing this

561
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:33,409
left

562
00:24:39,329 --> 00:24:43,960
so I think two of the big takeaways here

563
00:24:41,878 --> 00:24:46,028
one was we were talking a little bit

564
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,278
about if you're sort of like jumping

565
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:50,169
from like one system to another like

566
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:51,429
somebody here was a doing more cancer

567
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:54,129
research and I wants to talk about plant

568
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:56,980
metabolites as long as you can explain

569
00:24:54,128 --> 00:24:58,148
like why and how it's related like

570
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,589
myself personally I was an engineering

571
00:24:58,148 --> 00:25:01,118
undergrad did environmental science now

572
00:24:59,589 --> 00:25:03,939
I'm an agriculture but it's all like

573
00:25:01,118 --> 00:25:05,589
sustainability related so having sort of

574
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,850
like a narrative that makes sense to

575
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:08,859
like explain why you're interested in

576
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:10,569
this stuff how you've gotten where you

577
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:12,638
are everybody's got different paths so

578
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:14,138
that's important one question that I

579
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:15,548
told the group about that I always ask

580
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,748
at the end of an interview and they

581
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:19,418
thought it was all good and wanted me to

582
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:20,558
share with everybody is I always end it

583
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:22,450
by saying now that you've had a chance

584
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:23,980
to talk to me look at my materials and

585
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:27,999
everything did you have any hesitation

586
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:29,769
to hiring me and how can I sorta like

587
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:32,048
clarify things or explain things to you

588
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:53,769
so that I can like clear that up

589
00:25:32,048 --> 00:25:55,240
and I think it'll be helpful we talked

590
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:56,798
about a lot of different things but I

591
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,808
think two main things that stood out

592
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:00,429
where one was what you just said that

593
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:02,499
people come with a diversity of

594
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:04,690
experiences and research backgrounds and

595
00:26:02,499 --> 00:26:06,669
how do you kind of tie all of those

596
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:08,558
things into one single narrative and

597
00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:10,749
should you even do that so how you kind

598
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:13,808
of visualize your story that way and the

599
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:16,298
second thing we talked about was you

600
00:26:13,808 --> 00:26:18,128
know in terms of future plans how

601
00:26:16,298 --> 00:26:19,690
specific should you get should you tie

602
00:26:18,128 --> 00:26:21,878
yourself down to one particular career

603
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:23,169
or what the professor would feel like

604
00:26:21,878 --> 00:26:26,439
you're not a good fit for the lab

605
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:29,700
because you specific so up in the air

606
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,700
great questions

607
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:41,019
so like going through this I can just

608
00:26:38,619 --> 00:26:42,549
kind of see that graduate school

609
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:45,490
interview is kind of really different

610
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:48,099
from my co-working interview it's very

611
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:50,529
structured differently so just trying to

612
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:52,029
get like a feel for a middle ground of

613
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:53,349
how much do you say how do you stay

614
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:56,829
focused and what you're going to say

615
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:59,289
without going or being too broad and

616
00:26:56,829 --> 00:27:01,509
rambling so kind of getting to the point

617
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:10,180
but also making sure that your point was

618
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:11,769
me I think for me personally it's like

619
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,660
sometimes I feel like I went to sleep

620
00:27:11,769 --> 00:27:15,549
one day and then woke up where I am so

621
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:17,200
having to like be able being able to

622
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:18,819
backtrack and figure out how I actually

623
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,799
got here because especially because I

624
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:22,389
haven't been like invested in the

625
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,950
sciences my whole life I actually was

626
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:26,050
more of like an arts and like an English

627
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:28,059
person so trying to figure out my story

628
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:29,950
and like the reasons for why I end up

629
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:32,889
where I am and being able to explain

630
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:34,630
that to somebody else very quickly is a

631
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:36,130
bit of an undertaking and I definitely

632
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:45,010
think I need to I need to think about

633
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:47,290
that going forward we talked about a

634
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:48,579
couple strategies as far as keeping calm

635
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:52,690
keeping your composure during the

636
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:55,059
interview one of them was looking at

637
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:56,980
sign language - you know they're they

638
00:27:55,059 --> 00:27:58,659
look calm so you should be calm another

639
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,430
one was you know having some mnemonic

640
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,930
device or some method of figuring out

641
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:04,120
what you're going to talk about what

642
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,529
points you want ahead and the basically

643
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:13,629
the main point was as long as you keep

644
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:15,160
cool and don't freak out you'll be I so

645
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:17,470
even if you do freak out

646
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:20,019
I have freaked out in most interviews

647
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:23,049
I've done whether it was like through

648
00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:26,559
insane excitement or just like horrible

649
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:28,690
nerves so it's okay they know that

650
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,940
you're interviewing and they know like

651
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:33,009
you're talking to somebody who did this

652
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:35,890
actual interview at some point in their

653
00:28:33,009 --> 00:28:38,500
past they may or may not remember

654
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:40,570
exactly what it was like but they did it

655
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,579
and you know that they want to know

656
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:45,069
about you you're there because they

657
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:47,349
wanted to talk to you so if you can for

658
00:28:45,069 --> 00:28:49,329
me I always remind myself I'm like I'm

659
00:28:47,349 --> 00:28:51,099
sitting in this seat because they

660
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:54,009
me but they wanted to know things about

661
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:57,548
me I can do this it's going to be okay

662
00:28:54,009 --> 00:29:01,179
and that self-talk does matter for some

663
00:28:57,548 --> 00:29:04,028
more than others yeah this is the time

664
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:06,309
for you to tell someone else what you're

665
00:29:04,028 --> 00:29:09,398
most excited about and you get to ask

666
00:29:06,308 --> 00:29:12,730
questions so I know some of you talked

667
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:15,638

669
00:29:15,638 --> 00:29:19,209

670
00:29:17,499 --> 00:29:21,009
