1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:11,120
University over the last 20 years or so

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,839
I've been obviously doing a lot of work

4
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:16,278
on Photo receptors and the phototropins

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,359
and I got kind of sidetracked and uh

6
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:19,480
that's what I'm going to talk about

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,160
today because we discovered that there

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,518
were some interesting things going on in

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,719
guard cells that for us at least were

10
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:31,118
quite unexpected perhaps not to others

11
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:33,920
and so um we'll just

12
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:36,039
continue um we're going to be talking

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,520
about stomal

14
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:42,960
function but I thought I'd give a little

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:48,000
bit of early history um for example of

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,198
way back in uh 1836 uh Charles doony at

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,238
Cambridge

18
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:52,558
University did a very interesting

19
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:55,159
experiment and I'll show you his

20
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,718
experimental setup in just just a minute

21
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:58,479
but he showed that blue light was much

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,800
better than red light in inducing plants

23
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:04,280
to lose water and to my knowledge this

24
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:07,519
is the first actual observation of a

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,320
specific effect of blue light on guards

26
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:12,959
on stomal function although obviously he

27
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,519
didn't know anything about that at the

28
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,599
time

29
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:21,078
um then in

30
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:23,438
1898 um Francis Darwin invented a little

31
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:25,359
device called a parameter and first

32
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,199
demonstrated that light increased the

33
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,879
rate at which you could pull air through

34
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,040
a leaf again uh indicative of some

35
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,920
change in the physical properties of the

36
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,000
leaf that allowed

37
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,439
more gas movement

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,438
across um it was long

39
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:47,359
assumed however despite this experiment

40
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:50,519
by Dominy showing blue light to be so

41
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:52,078
effective it was assumed that stomal

42
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:54,000
opening was strictly responding to

43
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:57,199
photosynthesis and after all we have

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,078
chloroplast in guard cells so why not

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,560
and it was only

46
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,000
much much much later that agava showed

47
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,439
that blue light alone doesn't have much

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,318
of an effect in increasing transpiration

49
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:10,959
but against a red light background the

50
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:15,000
effect is spectacular and you got a huge

51
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:17,878
increase in transpiration and then uh

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,400
Zyer and field refined the measurements

53
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:21,719
and demonstrated that it was highly

54
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,480
specific for blue light and as we know

55
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:28,439
now it's a response mediated by the the

56
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:30,399
phototropins well here was uh daan's

57
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,120
very ingenious experiment

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,760
he used various colored glass and he

59
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:39,000
used also some uh solutions that were

60
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:41,000
colored and simply measured he would put

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,800
concentrated sulfuric acid which is of

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,158
course hydroscopic takes up water and

63
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,599
he'd weigh it and then he would put it

64
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:50,359
under a Bel jar and uh turn the light on

65
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:53,158
and when he turned when he turned blue

66
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,800
light on he got a much bigger increase

67
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:58,479
in the weight of the sulfuric acid over

68
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,599
time than if he turned the red light on

69
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,238
incidentally he also also noticed

70
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:04,479
something else and that was that red

71
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,959
light was far more effective than than

72
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:09,000
blue in inducing what he described as

73
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,080
the secretion of green matter into the

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,239
leaves which of course was that he was

75
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,519
seeing for the first time the

76
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,599
development of of chlorophyll

77
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,719
transformation of prot chloride to

78
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:21,199
chlorophyllide and then all of the

79
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:24,158
phytochrome responses that follow that

80
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:26,359
to get mature chloroplasts so this was

81
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,679
just a nice piece of work that got

82
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,360
totally

83
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,280
lost um so this is again the first

84
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,599
report of a blue light response guard

85
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,120
cell function then here is dorwin

86
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:40,000
Francis Dorn's

87
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,280
parameter um you take a leaf and then

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,479
you seal a little suction cup there and

89
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,479
hook just hook it up to a

90
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:50,438
uh Durette like this and then you

91
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,238
measure the rate at which the liquid

92
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:57,239
drops and of course if you turn the

93
00:03:52,239 --> 00:04:00,560
light on then uh the stom open the guard

94
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,280
cells separate and the rate at which it

95
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,680
drops increases and then you turn the

96
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,479
light off and it goes back down again a

97
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,040
a very elegant very simple demonstration

98
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:11,679
again which has been pretty much

99
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:16,839
lost

100
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:20,918
um more recently uh we identified

101
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:23,159
phototropins and uh one of them f one

102
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:26,198
eventually derell it all with the first

103
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:30,800
to identified the second phototropin and

104
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:34,120
then can it all in uh shimazaki lab in

105
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,439
Japan demonstrated that both fot one and

106
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,639
fot 2 mediate light activated snow metal

107
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:43,319
opening so now we've come to the point

108
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:45,439
where we can actually identify the photo

109
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,639
receptors involved in the light response

110
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:53,680
first described by Charles

111
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:56,439
doony well um in the last three decades

112
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,959
or so we've learned a tremendous amount

113
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:00,519
of about Stow metal development um a

114
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:04,239
number of different people working on

115
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:06,000
this and uh the genes that are

116
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,280
responsible the transcription factors

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,639
involved we've also another totally

118
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:14,239
unrelated in many ways we've learned a

119
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,960
tremendous about the ion pumps and

120
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,120
channels that are involved in sowal

121
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:19,519
opening and

122
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,160
closing uh we' learned now about the

123
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,399
specific role of abic acid and closing

124
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,439
but there's not a whole lot of work uh

125
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,478
that's been done on the role a possible

126
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:30,399
role of the cytoskeleton in stomal

127
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,639
function but particularly not

128
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,879
microtubules there been there are some

129
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,720
very nice studies from Young so Le in

130
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:40,519
Korea on on actin changes with stomal

131
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,639
opening and closing and other papers

132
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:45,839
since then but not

133
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,439
particularly so let me let me now

134
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:51,519
digress slightly because we got

135
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:54,519
interested in stom in uh quite

136
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,719
indirectly um things happen to

137
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:58,159
phototropin when you turn the light on

138
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,240
and of course one of the first things to

139
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,520
happen is that you get extensive

140
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,199
phosphorilation um second thing we now

141
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:09,159
know that you get can get binding of a

142
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:13,199
1433 protein to a particular seran in

143
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:17,240
fot 2 highly specific um we know that

144
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,598
you can get mon idation um here uh

145
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,439
probably other places too according to

146
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:28,319
Lum and this is all work that was done

147
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:31,160
by a longterm post. s in the lab um so

148
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,598
here's phototropin structure you have uh

149
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:37,160
a serin 3 and in kinas a classic Ser

150
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:39,879
three serin 3 and inise and then you

151
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,520
have two domains of about 100 amino

152
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:45,120
acids which B A flaven which is the

153
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:45,879
chromophor and both phototropins have

154
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,120
this

155
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:51,680
structure um when you turn the light on

156
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,639
saturation these are all the different

157
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,199
uh amino acids that are

158
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,680
phosphorilated um the ones in blue were

159
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:59,879
discovered by the Japanese group the

160
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,598
ones in Black were discovered by John

161
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,160
group and the ones in red were ones each

162
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:06,839
time you do this you pick up different

163
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,520
ones we've just done another um Mass

164
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:11,159
Spec experiment and we picked up three

165
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,959
more that haven't been reported so I

166
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,800
think the number of phosphor relations

167
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:20,159
that occurs with light saturation

168
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:22,400
probably is not yet completely

169
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,160
identified okay well one of the things

170
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:28,598
that Don Chung did was yeast to hybrid

171
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:33,400
and he found that f 2 was associating

172
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:38,240
with the A1 subunit of uh PP of a

173
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:41,439
protein phosphatase pp2a and both um by

174
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,120
East to Harbor and by pull down so then

175
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:48,719
the question is well um is that

176
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:51,158
phosphotase going to play a role in uh

177
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,960
actually could show that it was the love

178
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:56,519
domain that was apparently where the

179
00:07:53,959 --> 00:08:00,120
binding was occurring and not the kise

180
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:03,038
domain um so we hypothesized the blue

181
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,000
light would induce

182
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:09,279
phosphorilation and with a wild type

183
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,240
enzyme um then you could inactivate and

184
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,559
so that this was a way to deactivate the

185
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,360
system after after

186
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,879
photoactivation however we hypothesized

187
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,800
that if you had an impaired phosphotase

188
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,960
then you should actually at steady state

189
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,400
increase the amount of the active um

190
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,839
phosphorated

191
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:32,478
phot2 and it was clear that phosphor was

192
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:35,439
required for for normal function and if

193
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,959
that's the case then we might expect uh

194
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,560
first phototropism might be more

195
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:45,759
sensitive um and stomal aperature at

196
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:47,719
steady state might be in fact wider and

197
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:52,000
so when we looked at phototropism sure

198
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,519
enough if we got got rid of fot two I'm

199
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,320
sorry got rid of phot one so that we

200
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,440
were just looking at f 2

201
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:01,120
behavior um in the absence of the in the

202
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,680
impaired activity of the phosphatase not

203
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,120
only did we get a more rapid phototropic

204
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:10,519
response but we actually got more

205
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:15,278
curvature um more curvature over time

206
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:18,679
so the um that indicated we then looked

207
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:22,200
at guard cells here they are um closed I

208
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:23,399
won't show you the um quantitation but

209
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,160
here's what it looks like when they're

210
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,799
normally open but in the absence of in

211
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,919
the absence of functioning phosphatase

212
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,199
with the mutant phospatase note that the

213
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:37,599
guard cells are far wider open than they

214
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,959
are in the wild type so in both cases it

215
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,399
appears that the phosphatase is

216
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:45,958
downregulating the functional

217
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:47,600
molecule well it was interesting the

218
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:50,759
interaction between photot with

219
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,600
phototropin 2 affects phototropism in

220
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:56,639
storm aperature but no other pH to

221
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,959
mediated response that we tested uh they

222
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,439
were all absolutely the same with or

223
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:07,359
without that mutation in the phosphotase

224
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:09,440
and furthermore pp2a this same mutant

225
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,720
had no impact whatsoever when what we

226
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,120
looked at was phototropin one function

227
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,278
instead of phototropin 2

228
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,839
function well so our second brush with

229
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,320
guard cells that was our first our

230
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:25,279
second brush with guard cells had to do

231
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:28,480
with another of dong Chung's discoveries

232
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:31,639
from yeast to hybrid and that is that uh

233
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,480
there's a 14 three the Lambda isopor

234
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:38,720
interacts with photoactive phototropin 2

235
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:42,000
at a particular Serene at that uh seran

236
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:45,920
747 and again uh yeast to hybrid and

237
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,759
pull down uh um verifi that there was a

238
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,479
real

239
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:53,078
interaction and here you can see in this

240
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:56,039
case that the interaction is now

241
00:10:53,078 --> 00:11:00,399
Downstream it's with the kyes domain

242
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:04,719
instead of with the uh the Upstream l

243
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,759
domains and here we found that snow

244
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,160
metal opening was in fact severely

245
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:12,319
impaired couple of experiments here it's

246
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:15,399
impaired except that when we can

247
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,200
complement put that put

248
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:22,039
the

249
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:24,639
um 14 wild type 1433 molecule back in

250
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:27,399
and we can restore nor normal stomal

251
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,720
function and in this case it was even

252
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:32,480
more highly specific in that this is the

253
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,399
only phenomenon the only phototropin

254
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:39,240
mediated phenomenon that we could find

255
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:42,399
that was impaired in the 1433 mutant

256
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:45,440
highly specific to just that one um

257
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:48,440
phosphorilation and

258
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,440
Association

259
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:57,799
um well in 2007 Bill eisinger joined the

260
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,759
lab he was a longtime uh professor at

261
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:02,479
Santa claro University where he didn't

262
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,919
it's an undergraduate institution and I

263
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,800
was lucky enough that he wanted to

264
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,319
continue doing research so he joined the

265
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:11,039
lab and he was interested in guard cells

266
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,560
and guard cells were affected by

267
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:17,278
photoactivating phototropin so uh our

268
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:19,879
interests were pretty much in common so

269
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,000
also I had a colleague Dave arhart who

270
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:25,039
had plenty of AR rabid officers that

271
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
were carrying gfp tubulin so we decided

272
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,439
it would be fun to look at the behavior

273
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,958
of the microtubules in guard cells as

274
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,880
they closed or opened and thanks to Dave

275
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:38,719
we have very very good confocal

276
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:40,198
microscopy so this was the initiation of

277
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,320
this

278
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:46,639
project and as you as I mentioned

279
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:49,480
there's this very large literature on

280
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,720
osmotic regulation of stom lature people

281
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,320
like Mike blat Sally asman Jordan Scher

282
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,360
and a number of others but only a

283
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,959
limited amount of information about the

284
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:04,278
possible role of the SOS skeleton

285
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:07,239
so as you know uh schemes like this have

286
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:11,159
been developing

287
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,320
and I find them understandable barely a

288
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:15,639
bit

289
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,519
confusing so here's what bill first saw

290
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:20,879
uh these are guard cells now expressing

291
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:24,000
gfp tubulin and you see that the tubulin

292
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:26,639
is in hoops around the perimeter of the

293
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,360
guard cells and now this is with a guard

294
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,519
cell wide open if we treat with abs

295
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,919
which induces closure um a couple of

296
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,799
things happen first you see there are

297
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:38,519
lots and lots of these microtubules and

298
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,198
it turns out the brighter ones are

299
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:43,759
probably bundles I'll come back to that

300
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:45,359
in a minute but over time the number of

301
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,958
those bundles that you can actually

302
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,320
resolve decreases gradually here's 30

303
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:54,119
minutes 40 minutes and also there's been

304
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:58,160
a loss in total florescence and this is

305
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:02,560
interesting because the monomer of the

306
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:06,360
of tubulin is just as fluorescent gfp as

307
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:08,919
is the polymer so there's a net loss of

308
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,560
tubulin and a rather significant loss of

309
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:15,319
tubulin over

310
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:18,719
time and then if you uh correlate stomal

311
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,120
aperture with the storm metal aperture

312
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,800
with the number of these things that you

313
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,799
can count um you see that there's a

314
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:28,399
pretty good relationship there pretty

315
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:31,439
clean relationship and uh when they

316
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,440
close the number of of aperture the

317
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,320
aperture closes and the time course for

318
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,680
the loss in uh structures that you can

319
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,278
resolve or goes down

320
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:45,278
simultaneously and then you can take

321
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:47,759
take these plants when they're closed

322
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:49,958
put put them from the light to the dark

323
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,278
they close the number of elements that

324
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:54,958
you can count goes down put them back in

325
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:57,559
the light they open and simultaneously

326
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:59,399
up on the number of those bundles that

327
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:02,159
you can see

328
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,440
so why the decline well maybe less

329
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:07,120
growing ends of the microtubules that's

330
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,600
one thing could happen maybe you have

331
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,759
the same number of growing ends but

332
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,600
they're growing more slowly this could

333
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,560
account for some of the loss you could

334
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,600
have more rapid degradation at the minus

335
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,758
ends or some combination of those

336
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,079
processes so let's take a look at the

337
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:26,519
growing ends and let's hope that this

338
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:28,838
works

339
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,879
um so we're going to be able to look at

340
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:33,160
the growing Ends by looking at a

341
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:36,439
different label and this is n binding

342
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:40,360
one gfp this is an a protein that's

343
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,360
found at the growing ends of

344
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:46,680
microtubules and let's

345
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:46,679
hope

346
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:59,399
oops Yeah so you see now this this is

347
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,039
just watching in time lapse and these

348
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,879
are the growing ends of those

349
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:05,278
microtubules and having this you can do

350
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:08,240
two things first in the first place you

351
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:09,399
can count the number of them and seconds

352
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,120
you can measure the rate at which

353
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,318
they're

354
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,000
moving and uh so we did that and this

355
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:18,639
would tell us maybe more

356
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,440
specifically they moving away from the

357
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,399
pardon are they all moving away from the

358
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,199
they're well they're moving in a

359
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,879
circular fashion it's difficult to tell

360
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:28,318
whether they're going under or over we

361
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:32,159
think that there are some going in both

362
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:35,879
directions but um that haven't really

363
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:39,399
studied that in any great detail but

364
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:42,240
here if we now look at the number of as

365
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:44,958
the as the guard cells close following a

366
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,120
uh ABA treatment Deuces closing very

367
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:49,078
nicely but it doesn't change the number

368
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,919
of comets these little comets that you

369
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:55,239
see flying around so the number of

370
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,799
growing ends doesn't change um just

371
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,839
showing the pavement cells along with

372
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:03,799
the guard cells um

373
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:06,000
and then if we look at the velocity um

374
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:07,480
closed versus open there's no difference

375
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,480
either they're going just as fast and

376
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,360
there are just as many of them so we're

377
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,838
left with the conclusion that they're

378
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:16,879
actually um undergoing differential

379
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:20,159
degradation at their minus

380
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,679
ends okay so the question of the

381
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,240
question then

382
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:28,559
becomes

383
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,919
well um do microt tubules play a major

384
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,720
role in noow Middle opening and closing

385
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:36,080
they're appearing when they open they're

386
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,880
disappearing when when they close um so

387
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:40,038
do they play a function roll or is this

388
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,760
just simply something passive that

389
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:46,119
happens as a consequence of opening and

390
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:50,759
closing and there are ways of testing

391
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:53,759
that um we can there are two drugs

392
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:55,400
aralin that we can use or I think kosine

393
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:58,200
does that too but arisol and

394
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,320
destabilizes microtubules and taxo

395
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,720
stabilizes them so we can try these

396
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,798
drugs and see what effect they have on

397
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,400
opening and

398
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:09,519
closing and in this experiment um we're

399
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,120
starting with them initially in the dark

400
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:13,759
we're putting putting the leaves into

401
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:15,759
the light and either visha or rabid

402
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,960
opsis you can see that the guard cells

403
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:21,798
open um on the other hand if we have

404
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:25,279
treated with a risin uh

405
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:27,639
the these structures don't reform as you

406
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:30,759
can see this this is just sort of messy

407
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,679
inside the cell and they don't open on

408
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:36,359
the other hand if we treat with taxol

409
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:39,200
they do open uh and they open relatively

410
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:41,798
normally uh if we now do the reverse

411
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,480
experiment going from light to dark

412
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:46,759
normally they would close in the dark

413
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,079
with a risin of course they do close and

414
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:53,038
you get the this same sort of mess but

415
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:55,319
in taxil they're stuck open so we

416
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,798
conclude therefore

417
00:18:55,319 --> 00:19:00,439
that the microtuble changes that we

418
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:02,079
observe on stom opening and closing

419
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,120
these changes are required for normal

420
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:07,399
stomal

421
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:10,319
function one of the uh one of the

422
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,480
questions you might ask as well we've

423
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,158
transformed these plants and put

424
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,558
different stuff into the guard cells

425
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:21,520
than was there naturally so just maybe

426
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:23,798
uh We've interfered with um interfered

427
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:28,720
with transpiration so this is just a

428
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:31,879
classic o um water loss experiment uh

429
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,640
done with colleagues in the ecological

430
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,679
physiology group at carnegi and no

431
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,320
matter wild typ or any of these

432
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,120
transformance they're all behaving

433
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:41,639
perfectly normally so we don't need to

434
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:45,038
worry about

435
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,159
that well then Bill decided to try to

436
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:49,279
get a little more quantitative some of

437
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:52,240
the early pictures look like that you

438
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:55,038
could then draw a line and scan across

439
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,720
and get a little profile of

440
00:19:55,038 --> 00:20:00,200
fluorescence um here's from the lower

441
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:04,400
cell and here from the top cell and then

442
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:07,120
you could do some exper some experiments

443
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,440
such as this where when you went into

444
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:11,959
ABA with open guard cells you notice

445
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,240
that the high peaks gradually decline in

446
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:18,079
fact they're virtually all gone after

447
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,319
whatever that is um 40 minutes whereas

448
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:20,480
in the pavement cells there's no

449
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:23,918
particular

450
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,839
change he then got more sophisticated or

451
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,320
I should say the equipment got more

452
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:31,558
sophisticated and now we have a better

453
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:34,639
uh better image and now you can take

454
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:36,279
this and rotate it um so that you're now

455
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,679
looking at the ends of the

456
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:42,918
microtubules of and the fluoresence from

457
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:45,159
the gfp and then you can uh draw a line

458
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:47,360
here and do a scan and You' got

459
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:49,120
something that looks like this and if

460
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,319
you sort of squinted this you could

461
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:54,000
convince yourself that there are some

462
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:55,599
Peaks that are down in here some Peaks

463
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,240
that are around in here and some Peaks

464
00:20:55,599 --> 00:21:00,759
that are here so maybe this isn't going

465
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,480
to be a uniform series from from small

466
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:07,599
to large maybe they'll be uh uh discrete

467
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,759
steps now but for this particular one uh

468
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,798
you don't see that very well but every

469
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:15,079
once in a while we've got something that

470
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:19,200
looked like this and uh where the one

471
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:21,439
clearly was having a single a series of

472
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,960
increments and we interpret this as an

473
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,720
increase in in bundling as the uh the

474
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,960
total number doesn't decline all that

475
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:34,360
much when they close going down to here

476
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:36,798
going down to here um but the number of

477
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:41,399
high peaks drops down and it drops down

478
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:44,240
stepwise so we we uh interpret that as a

479
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,200
decrease in bundling we're going from

480
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,319
Singles here to doubles to triples to

481
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,798
quadruples and so forth and this

482
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,519
accounts for the difference in the

483
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:55,158
brightness of the fluorescence that you

484
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,158
see in those various

485
00:21:55,519 --> 00:22:00,200
structures well

486
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,319
now Vin as I mentioned doesn't lose its

487
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,159
fluoresence as the monomer so what are

488
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:08,200
the possibilities it could be that loss

489
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:10,679
of fluoresence is like is likely

490
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,400
proteolysis if that's the case then if

491
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:16,519
we treat with something that'll inhibit

492
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:19,360
proteolysis just maybe we can block the

493
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:22,879
uh block stomal closing and inhibit the

494
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:27,038
fluorescence loss

495
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:29,240
likewise cop cop one is an E3 logas and

496
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:31,599
the cop one m

497
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:35,079
c one is involved in all kinds of things

498
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:37,599
going on in Plants but it was known that

499
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:40,278
uh c one mutation prevented stomal

500
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:43,480
closing so it might also prevent the

501
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:46,880
fluoresence loss um so here are a couple

502
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,880
of experiments that we could

503
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:52,759
do

504
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:55,599
um so we're

505
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:59,839
um first thing is if we inhibit

506
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:02,918
proteolysis with mg132 you can see that

507
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:06,480
uh the I don't have my glasses on but I

508
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:09,320
assume that that's uh yeah that's the

509
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,960
snow metal aperture uh they do indeed

510
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:15,158
they do not

511
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:18,640
close and if you uh look at fluorescence

512
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:20,679
the mg132 also very much impairs the

513
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,679
fluorescence laws that's essentially

514
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:23,840
reflects photo bleaching that occurs

515
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:25,919
under any

516
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:29,599
circumstances and again you can see that

517
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:32,799
in DMSO uh we go into AB a we lose the

518
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:36,000
structures whereas if we have mg 132

519
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:38,400
present um these guard cells don't

520
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,359
change particularly in the appearance of

521
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,679
the

522
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:47,839
microtubules

523
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:50,038
um okay um it turns out that uh a lot

524
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:52,000
more than just prote is involved in

525
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:54,440
closing because you can inhibit

526
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,278
transcription or translation um here's

527
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:00,159
another proteas inhibitor besides

528
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:02,440
mg132 and and again if you inhibit

529
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,278
transcription or translation you prevent

530
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:11,400
the closing reaction and they remain

531
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:11,400
open in ABA uh 40 after a 40 minute

532
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:17,038
treatment so there's a lot going on that

533
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,919
at least I hadn't we hadn't

534
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:24,480
expected and the other thing is what

535
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:27,000
about cop one well cop one uh as I

536
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,558
mentioned doesn't close incidentally if

537
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,759
you look at uh c one guard cells notice

538
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:40,639
that they're more nearly circular than

539
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:42,079
uh the um wild type y cells um and note

540
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,120
that in cop

541
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:47,678
one ABA you can Hammer them you can't

542
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:51,038
get them to close so they they are

543
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:53,759
essentially stuck open and uh not only

544
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:57,359
are they stuck open but the microtubules

545
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,919
are not uh Changed by the ABA treatment

546
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,519
so I guess that's consistent with what

547
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:01,520
we've seen

548
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:09,639
before yeah this shows the that's the

549
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,440
stom

550
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:17,720
aperature unchanged in C one and there

551
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:21,159
is the uh this is the fluoresence in cop

552
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,919
one with the controls here no different

553
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:25,799
that's just the bleaching whereas in the

554
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:30,159
uh in

555
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:33,158
the wild type cbone protein you see the

556
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,480
fluorescence loss again plus ABA over

557
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:37,720
the same time

558
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:42,640
course

559
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:45,038
well if we disrupt um c 1 six guard cell

560
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:49,399
microtubules of the rising can can we

561
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:52,079
get them to close and so we tried that

562
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:54,359
experiment and sure enough if we treat

563
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,879
them with arisal and they do indeed

564
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:58,839
close

565
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:02,320
um and now this is I've now qu dist

566
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:06,038
worked by rogin Canna who joined the lab

567
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:07,639
about 3 years ago on on fulltime and

568
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:09,919
then a part-time basis and is still

569
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,000
working with us on it and you notice

570
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:16,038
that if you treat now with ar Risin um

571
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,480
the cop one guard cells not not only do

572
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:21,558
they lose their microtubules but they

573
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,679
also close but now of course that could

574
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:28,319
be simply uh we may just maybe we just

575
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:30,759
killed the cells and with the inhibitor

576
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:35,038
so what happens if we try to wash it

577
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:36,558
out oh here's just a uh quantitation the

578
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:40,720
one to look at

579
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:43,398
is this one darker light with ar risal

580
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,839
in uh in cop

581
00:26:43,398 --> 00:26:47,398
one uh they

582
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:49,720
close

583
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:51,798
there

584
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:55,480
um

585
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:58,519
so again did we just kill the cells or

586
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:01,360
in fact uh

587
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:06,200
can we recover them so if we do a wash

588
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:09,000
out um the the microtubules structures

589
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,480
reappear and they open back up again so

590
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,558
we haven't just killed the cells and

591
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,120
again it's it's fairly good evidence

592
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:19,558
that these microt tual changes are

593
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:22,000
indeed essential for opening and closing

594
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:22,000
of guard

595
00:27:22,038 --> 00:27:29,558
cells okay now the question then becomes

596
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:32,000
does the cop one mut in any way affect

597
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:33,519
electrophysiology of the guard cells

598
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,679
because after all they do have to get

599
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:40,359
driven by osmotic changes

600
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:43,440
uh potassium has to move in for opening

601
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:46,278
uh has uh and all these other things

602
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,720
have to go on and for this we started a

603
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:53,679
collaboration with Julian scher's Lab at

604
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:56,240
UCSD and Jan jnan Lee uh was a postto

605
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:00,120
there who did these

606
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,120
experiments and here is the

607
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:04,959
thing I showed you at the very start and

608
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,799
there are two two important channels

609
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,880
that are worth mentioning there's this

610
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:13,319
potassium Channel which is essential for

611
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:16,000
opening and then there's a slow anion

612
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:18,359
Channel whoops yeah there's a slow an

613
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,359
Channel which is right here which is

614
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:23,558
required for closing um actually this is

615
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:25,719
a very much oversimplified diagram I

616
00:28:23,558 --> 00:28:27,038
have another more recent one but it's AB

617
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,360
for me it was just absolutely

618
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:33,640
overwhelming so I chose chose the simple

619
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:35,558
one so required for closing required for

620
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,840
opening so let's take a look at the

621
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:41,038
behavior of those two channels and so

622
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:43,278
here's what happened when uh he looked

623
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:45,640
uh Jan looked at the potassium

624
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:48,240
Channel um cat

625
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:52,278
one in Wild type this is the behavior

626
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:55,640
that you get uh it's the usual uh

627
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:59,000
experiment voltage Uh current

628
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:01,200
plot and you notice that in C one it's

629
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,558
absolutely normal there's no impact

630
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:09,240
whatsoever on in C one on the potassium

631
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:12,918
Channel but to our surprise when we look

632
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:16,960
then at the slack one the slow anion

633
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:20,840
Channel um it was completely dead uh in

634
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:23,038
cop 1 in fact Its Behavior in the cop 1

635
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:26,519
mutant was about the same as what you'd

636
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:30,038
expect in a black one mutant um it was

637
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:30,038
essentially nonfunction

638
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:36,798
well that raises the question what's the

639
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:41,558
interaction between slap one and all

640
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:43,398
these microt tual studies in cop one and

641
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:45,759
what is the in fact what is the role of

642
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:49,278
these changes in in stomal

643
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:51,679
function um structural do they provide

644
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:53,798
some sort of structural contribution it

645
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:58,080
seems unlikely they're not all that

646
00:29:53,798 --> 00:30:00,319
strong uh to be able to have a role in

647
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:03,000
changing the shape of the

648
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:04,879
cell um maybe they're transporting

649
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,240
vessicles to and from the plasma

650
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:12,120
membrane remember that these cells are

651
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,359
expanding out like in in our experience

652
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:17,759
in in C one for example where there

653
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:20,038
seems to be no closure the pair of guard

654
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:22,759
cells is formed something it's almost

655
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:25,558
circular but a circular pore whereas in

656
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:28,480
Wild type the arrangement is a bit more

657
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:30,200
elliptical and the POR is smaller

658
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,798
so it's as if there's a balance between

659
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,480
opening processes and closing processes

660
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:38,879
that gives you some sort of interim uh

661
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,640
intermediate state of opening and when

662
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,919
in the presence of cop 1 we kill the

663
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,440
closing process then we're only sealing

664
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:48,399
the consequence of the opening processes

665
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,440
and they are at their they're at their

666
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:54,199
most distended and in fact they're in a

667
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:58,200
in almost circular confirmation as a

668
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,200
result um

669
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:06,159
so um when you expand these cells we can

670
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:10,558
argue about this later on we're chatting

671
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:13,880
about the shape and so forth uh it looks

672
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:17,599
it appears that there's a an increase in

673
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:21,320
the outer surface the size the area of

674
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:22,839
the guard cells and this means that one

675
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:25,480
of two things either if you're going to

676
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:28,839
increase the surface

677
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:32,679
area at all either you have to make it

678
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:35,720
thinner or you have to add material and

679
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:39,519
so it could it be that the role of these

680
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:42,880
microtubules is to transport vesicles

681
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:45,159
containing proteins and more membrane

682
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,200
material for fusion with the plasma

683
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:52,039
membrane uh transport two on opening and

684
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,798
remove uh on

685
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:58,200
closing well one of the ways to look at

686
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:59,599
that then would be to look at what are

687
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,080
is the relationship between these

688
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:04,959
changes and slack one if we could get a

689
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:09,000
slack one uh fluorescent label we could

690
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:11,919
follow it so we started to do that and

691
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,440
these are the our most recent

692
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:17,840
experiments uh this is slack one

693
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:20,558
gfp and uh it's in the cop One Cop one

694
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:23,678
mutant so that these guys are wide open

695
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:26,278
and uh you can see here that the slack

696
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,559
one as you would expect of a channel is

697
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:31,240
pretty much localized to the to the

698
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:36,278
periphery of the cells

699
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:38,079
um and uh not much in the interior also

700
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:41,038
if you now look at and again these are

701
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:43,319
very preliminary pictures you see that

702
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:47,200
the arrangement um in the first place

703
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:48,918
it's near the Meridian of the cells uh

704
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,399
and it's more there than it is on the

705
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:53,000
upper and lower surfaces the surface

706
00:32:51,398 --> 00:32:56,439
towards the air and the surface towards

707
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,839
the interior of the leaf but also it's

708
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,038
showing some kind of structure

709
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:03,759
um the question is when they're open

710
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:06,440
like this does that structure coincide

711
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:08,558
in any way with the microtubules um

712
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,919
because that would at least be a lead

713
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:14,038
that things that the microtubules could

714
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:15,880
be involved in moving stuff around well

715
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:19,638
what does it look like when they're

716
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:22,240
closed um what it looks like if we now

717
00:33:19,638 --> 00:33:23,759
this is in the cop one for mutant but if

718
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,638
we now treat it with ar risal and to

719
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:29,038
close it remember we could close it then

720
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:31,959
we could treat it with washing out and

721
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:34,558
get it opened again um I think that's

722
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,759
shown in the next SL slide does the

723
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:39,158
distribution change with snowmetal

724
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:41,960
opening and closing and we're using C

725
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:44,039
one as our test system and you can see

726
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,240
the change is really rather dramatic

727
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:49,240
when they're

728
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:51,960
open the um slack one gfp is mostly

729
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:54,159
peripheral at the plasma membrane

730
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:57,360
whereas when they're closed it now is

731
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:59,360
very much internalized internalized in

732
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:02,038
what appear to be vesicles of some sort

733
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:05,759
the nature of which at the moment uh we

734
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:10,159
simply uh don't know um as I said this

735
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:12,719
these are all very recent well so what

736
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:17,119
the the next step now and one which

737
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:20,878
we're just starting is to get plants

738
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:23,838
that are expressing both a fluorescent

739
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:26,878
slack one and a fluorescent um

740
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:29,679
fluorescent tubulin but since what we

741
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:32,759
had was in both cases gfp that wasn't

742
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:36,838
going to work so we've had to work now

743
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:38,520
with different uh labels we finally have

744
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:41,119
just gotten some plants that are

745
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:45,039
expressing M ter tubulin which is a red

746
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,879
fluorescer and uh slack 1 gfp which is

747
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,039
the green

748
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:52,199
fuesser

749
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:53,918
and here's um here's last week's picture

750
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:57,078
uh this is the m cherry tubulin and the

751
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:58,679
slack one these are almost closed and

752
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:00,680
the picture here of course is just sort

753
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:02,879
of a mess but it's the very first

754
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:05,799
picture demonstrating that we do in fact

755
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:09,160
have the have double labeled uh um

756
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,119
fluorescent labeled um plants and we're

757
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:13,039
going to be able to take a look and do

758
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,519
time course studies and watch and see

759
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:18,279
whether indeed the microtubules are

760
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:20,559
involved in moving moving vesicles

761
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,880
around containing slack one and who

762
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:26,639
knows what else that's our operating our

763
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:29,480
working hypothesis at this point and uh

764
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:32,719
with that I'll have to

765
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:34,760
say there's clearly a lot more to do so

766
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:39,118
I'm looking forward to a lot of neat

767
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:43,160
pictures in the next six months um so

768
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:46,358
with that uh our I mentioned tongun who

769
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:48,719
did that earlier work looking at post

770
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:51,960
translational modification of

771
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:55,279
phototropin on photo exitation bill

772
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:58,519
eisinger who did the initial work on uh

773
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,319
the initial work on micr tubules and

774
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:02,358
then rajish all of this more recent

775
00:36:00,318 --> 00:36:04,559
stuff our collaboration with Julian

776
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:07,838
schroer with thanks special thanks to

777
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:09,920
junin for making the um

778
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:13,039
electrophysiological

779
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,200
measurements and we're halfway up the

780
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:18,639
mountain but we still have 600 meters to

781
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:22,559
get to there from here and that's a

782
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:24,480
different mountain by the way um and we

783
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:25,960
have a lot more to do and people are

784
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,440
going to be busy I hope we're going to

785
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:31,880
be busy for a good longer and support

786
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,079
came from both carnegi and from the

787
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,358
National Science

788
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:36,350
Foundation and thank you very much for

789
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:43,799
your

790
00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:45,799
[Applause]

791
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:50,560
attention

792
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:55,079
esac um fluoresence or channel in the

793
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:57,799
aninal plasma membrane only and not it's

794
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:00,440
it's largely in the an yeah we have have

795
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:03,560
other pictures of that alone and there's

796
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,318
a sort of a band band of it around uh

797
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:06,078
the

798
00:37:04,318 --> 00:37:09,960
antiel

799
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:12,240
it subid yeah I'm I'm guessing we're

800
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,280
guessing that it's in fact in contact

801
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:17,639
with it's where it's in contact with the

802
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:19,800
surrounding epidermal cells and those

803
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:22,759
comets may be

804
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,880
bringing yeah the Comets could be could

805
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,359
be bringing stuff up that to deliver I

806
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,039
think we're in a position that with not

807
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:33,759
with my skills but with with David aarts

808
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:35,039
and Rines we might be able to to probe

809
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,440
that and find out whether that's really

810
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:41,519
what's going on yeah yeah the question

811
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,760
is whether the the hypothesized vesicles

812
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,519
that are going back and forth could have

813
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,040
some impact on the physical properties

814
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:52,159
of the cell wall i

815
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:55,039
i in you know just my gut feeling is

816
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:58,519
no I don't mean to reject it out of hand

817
00:37:55,039 --> 00:38:02,400
but I think it's unlikely because the

818
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:04,679
the microtubules start out as being uh

819
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,200
as the guard cells develop of course

820
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:11,039
they're the microtubes are what

821
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:13,279
determine where the microfibrils are

822
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:15,960
and that this function that we're

823
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,280
hypothesizing is is a later one and it's

824
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,480
a

825
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,359
function for a mature cell you do know

826
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,880
that

827
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:27,639
calcium

828
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:31,119
can the elastic modul

829
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:33,400
and it's a reversible process there are

830
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,760
ways of testing that now there are ways

831
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:39,240
of testing the elastic module of a cell

832
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,760
wo and I've seen papers on that but uh

833
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:43,799
so it's something we thought about but

834
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,800
haven't haven't done it would be very

835
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:49,480
interesting to test just that notion I

836
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,039
think the techniques are out there

837
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,039
whether we have the skill to use them

838
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:58,358
properly or not per much to be seen got

839
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:58,358
to get NSF money for that

840
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:03,639
have you looked at the effect of blue

841
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:06,920
light on the microtubules in

842
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:12,559
theone because I think David SE blue

843
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:15,079
light affecting micr stability in cells

844
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:17,239
hyper that's right he gets he gets a A

845
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:20,160
really elegant reorientation of the of

846
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:22,358
the microtubules in the hypoc which is

847
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:25,960
clearly related to the change in the

848
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:29,838
growth pattern um well we what we see

849
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:32,679
specifically is that in Blue Light the

850
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:35,679
microtubules increase in uh number and

851
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:38,719
very much increase in bundling uh and

852
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:40,799
that's that's a blue light response not

853
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:43,039
other other photo receptors will

854
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,599
modulate that response but without

855
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:48,639
without the phototropins um you don't

856
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,680
get any light sensitivity at all for

857
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:53,879
stomal

858
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:55,519
opening see the takes about 40 minutes

859
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,358
so there's plenty of time for a lot else

860
00:39:55,519 --> 00:40:01,239
to happen and I've may have said

861
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:04,159
something misleading when I said

862
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:07,159
the cop one is involved in the

863
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:08,480
degradation of the microtubules because

864
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:10,279
it could be involved in the degradation

865
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,480
of something else that then

866
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:14,040
plays you know it could be much more

867
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,920
complicated than

868
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:18,960
that no purely cor correlation and that

869
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,318
is that the fluorescence decline

870
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,920
parallels the uh parallels the time

871
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:27,119
course for closing and and rather

872
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:30,280
closely but I mean these are happening

873
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:33,480
in on a time scale of of many many

874
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:36,359
minutes so the time resolution simply

875
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,400
isn't good enough to say more than the

876
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:39,639
at this point it looks as if they're

877
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,119
closely

878
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:44,039
correlated better time resolution might

879
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:46,519
show that that's not necessarily the

880
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:48,920
case but that's a good

881
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:51,880
question and it caught me up because I

882
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:54,880
tend to be much too confident when I

883
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:58,400
talk about copon and proteolysis and

884
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:01,240
microtubules does not have to be uh

885
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,720
that the primary event could be

886
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:06,399
indirect ask one question so have you

887
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:08,519
shown polination of the of the

888
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,200
microtubules and and what what triggers

889
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:13,800
the polination what's the signal

890
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:16,719
transction pathway that triggers the

891
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:18,960
polynation I don't know about that for

892
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:22,039
uh for the microtubules I know that

893
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,318
there are these uquid Nation studies in

894
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:27,318
uh a phototropin itself but no I can't I

895
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:30,639
can't address that that's a prerequisite

896
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:32,039
for degradation by the prod yeah yeah

897
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:33,559
but we haven't looked at we simply

898
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:37,920
haven't looked at

899
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:41,400
that trival but the Peaks you had with

900
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:45,000
sort of half length and mic yeah what

901
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,000
were the width of those

902
00:41:50,760 --> 00:42:00,040
Peaks well well what's what's the length

903
00:41:54,079 --> 00:42:03,039
of the Guard cell uh I maybe 200 mic 200

904
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:07,519
microns so they could be those they

905
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:10,920
could be 100 the uh width of the cell a

906
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:13,000
micron or so but know they vary a

907
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,200
lot the bundles are going to be bigger

908
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,760
than that the singles in our earlier

909
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,759
experiments the resolution wasn't good

910
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,599
enough to see singles and that's why we

911
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:22,400
thought we were actually uh losing the

912
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:24,359
number of a large number of the

913
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,280
structures we're actually only losing a

914
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:28,799
small number but it just we going from

915
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,319
multiples to the singles thank you very

916
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,318
much for a
