1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,649 --> 00:00:05,279
University

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:12,679
so what I'm going to talk to you about

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:16,100
today is kind of title doesn't say much

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:20,599
I suppose and this research grew out of

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:23,480
my PhD work and it was kind of a chance

7
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:26,359
discovery and to give you an idea of how

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,679
I ended up working on this and why why

9
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,778
we ended up going down this I'm going to

10
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,759
give a little bit of background so my

11
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:34,969
PhD was on natural genetic variation in

12
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:36,500
photosynthesis and basically the

13
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:38,119
rationale behind it was to look at what

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,070
variation is there to see if we can find

15
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:41,899
we were doing G wasps and a couple of

16
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,789
other things genes relevant for this

17
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:45,768
variation which potentially could be

18
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:48,620
used for improving crops and the likes

19
00:00:45,768 --> 00:00:49,820
and in order to do that we had to come

20
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:52,608
up with a way of phenotyping

21
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,829
photosynthesis which is not so easy it's

22
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:56,179
kind of an elusive phenotype so we

23
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:58,820
developed this system which could

24
00:00:56,179 --> 00:01:01,249
measure 1440 plants in less than an hour

25
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,420
for photosynthetic efficiency and it

26
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:04,579
could also measure a couple of other

27
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,049
things so as well as photosynthesis

28
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:07,849
which we measured using chlorophyll

29
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:12,079
fluorescence which gives us these kind

30
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:13,939
of images here we also measure growth

31
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,109
rate which for arabidopsis is pretty

32
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:17,299
easy because it's got this flat

33
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:19,069
architecture so you can just get an idea

34
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:21,409
of plant size by measuring projected

35
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:23,599
leaf area and from this we got other

36
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:27,409
information such as lief movement and

37
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:29,569
that's because as you can see here more

38
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:31,129
or less with the pointer these leaves

39
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:32,689
the plants are getting bigger and

40
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:33,890
smaller and that's not because they're

41
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:35,030
actually getting bigger and smaller it's

42
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,349
because their leaves are going up and

43
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,349
down so you get a lot of other

44
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:42,890
information from these plots and also we

45
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:44,149
had a spectral filters we were able to

46
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,709
measure its specific wavelengths of

47
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:49,190
light which gave us an idea of different

48
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:50,989
pigment content in the leaves and to

49
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:52,840
sign in chlorophyll things like that but

50
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:55,429
today I'm going to focus on

51
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,960
photosynthesis and not on what was the

52
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,690
primary research but one of the

53
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,489
spin-offs of this so I measured this

54
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:03,200
population of plants a rabid officers

55
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:06,909
collected from all over the world so we

56
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:11,030
had 700 accessions genotyped with

57
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:12,289
214,000 snips and took quite some time

58
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,210
even to measure that number because we

59
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:17,030
did a lot of replicates and to get good

60
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,620
robust data and this was the phenotypic

61
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,000
distribution that came out of it and as

62
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,280
you can see here we have this nice no

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,139
normal distribution here of all the

64
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,810
individuals so here on the x axis we

65
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:28,039
have photosynthetic efficiency and on

66
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,379
the y axis with the number of

67
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:31,909
individuals in each bin and but we have

68
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:33,680
these guys down here which were really

69
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:38,060
different from everybody else and it

70
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,920
turned out that these plants were all of

71
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,840
one particular genotype which had

72
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,149
considerably reduced photosynthesis I

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,650
was pretty excited when I first came

74
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,300
across this because I thought oh this is

75
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,400
really cool we found something new and

76
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,719
then when I looked into it I discovered

77
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,489
somebody had already published on this

78
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,930
except it had a different accession name

79
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:56,480
so we didn't know it was in our

80
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,849
collection and what it was was a

81
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:01,479
genotype which was herbicide-resistant

82
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:04,120
it was resistant to triazine herbicides

83
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:08,649
this plant had been collected in the

84
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:11,480
1980s in a railway track in England and

85
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,430
basically it been in stock center since

86
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:15,919
then one of the concerts what this

87
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:18,950
herbicide does is it targets at the

88
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:21,129
photosystem 2 unit of photosynthesis so

89
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:25,310
it hits this protein here it is a

90
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:27,019
photosystem protein d1 and what happens

91
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,330
normally with this d1 protein is that

92
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:30,860
plus the Queen all binds here and gets

93
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,780
its the primary electron acceptor which

94
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,900
moves electrons down into a linear

95
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,640
electron transport pathway and what's

96
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,989
important for binding is this Syrian

97
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:41,539
here you see there's a hydrogen bonding

98
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:43,280
site and atrazine gets in there as well

99
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:45,379
these or any of these triazines and

100
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,180
blocks this pocket so that the electron

101
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:48,829
transport fo can no longer work the

102
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,500
plant has an energy crisis and it dies

103
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:53,360
so the herbicides very effective but the

104
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,280
mutation which has evolved actually in

105
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,950
72 different species so it's a great

106
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,870
example of convergent evolution results

107
00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:02,328
in this Syrian being substituted with a

108
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,280
glycine the atrazine no longer bonds

109
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:06,890
efficiently and the plant becomes

110
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,569
resistant to this herbicide but a

111
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:10,339
consequence of course is that the

112
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:12,530
plastic we know also doesn't bond as

113
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,629
well so the photosynthetic efficiency is

114
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:18,238
greatly lowered so that was that

115
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:25,029
basically we had this plant which was

116
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:26,349
herbicide resistant and basically you

117
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:28,209
know they've already been described so

118
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,580
that was fine but one of the problems

119
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:33,969
was and I think I actually took this

120
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:36,459
slide out which was silly it had a big

121
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,680
reduction in growth rate efficiency as

122
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:40,000
well which basically I come up with a

123
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,980
way of swapping the chloroplasts around

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,930
so what we have here is we have the

125
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,280
normal wild-type which has this reduced

126
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,209
photosynthetic efficiency of sixteen

127
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,139
percent but we then gave it a wild-type

128
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:59,259
chloroplast and we get this increased

129
00:04:50,139 --> 00:05:00,610
growth rate of 87 sorry oh it's so it's

130
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:03,310
a coral so it's for the system to

131
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,920
efficiency and it's a good proxy for

132
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,829
carbon dioxide assimilation rate it's

133
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,990
not exactly the same but it's similar so

134
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:12,430
it goes up two units of the maximum

135
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,650
possible efficiency for dark-adapted

136
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:17,410
leaves its point 83 so it goes from zero

137
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:21,849
2.83 it cannot go any higher than that

138
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:23,830
and usually plants under steady state

139
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,439
conditions so adapted to light growth

140
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:28,689
they're operating around between point

141
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:32,019
six and point seven and these guys are

142
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:33,819
down in most cases around depending on

143
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:36,099
the light intensity around point for

144
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:37,389
point five so they've got a considerable

145
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,890
drop this was at very low light levels

146
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:40,839
this was at one hundred micromoles of

147
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:42,579
light so the actual efficiency in

148
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:44,589
photosynthesis drop is only sixteen

149
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:47,289
percent but it has a big impact on

150
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:48,879
growth rates because the plants are when

151
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,340
they have this reduced chloroplast

152
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,379
efficiency effectively working at

153
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:55,869
probably their light compensation point

154
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:57,879
so the point of which the energy input

155
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,009
is only just about enough to keep the

156
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:03,699
plant going so it's growth rate is it's

157
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:08,110
very much so compromised is that did

158
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:09,879
that answer your question okay so the

159
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,710
problem with this was that I wanted to

160
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:13,659
use this data for genome-wide

161
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:16,120
Association mapping and genome-wide

162
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:19,120
Association mapping works fine when your

163
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:22,269
blow sire on the nuclear genome so I had

164
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,639
these 214,000 snips or located on the

165
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:26,109
nuclear genome however this mutation is

166
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,449
in the PSP a protein which is

167
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:31,400
chloroplast encoded and when I included

168
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:34,699
this genotype in my

169
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:36,829
she was approached it completely messed

170
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:38,449
up the results so I got lots of false

171
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:40,668
positives so this is what was keeping

172
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:42,770
this genotype in my mind because and I

173
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:44,899
did some other research to overcome this

174
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:46,609
issue but it was always there was kind

175
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:47,839
of a thing that was bugging me and i

176
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,979
discovered this at the beginning of my

177
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,779
PhD found that had already been

178
00:06:48,978 --> 00:06:53,089
published on but it was still fresh in

179
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:56,239
my mind and i happened to be in norwich

180
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:57,649
here in England giving a talk and Ely is

181
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,660
nearby and this was the wrong time of

182
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:01,129
the year this is August this is not the

183
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,220
time of the year that you go collecting

184
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:05,629
a rabid opsys but I you know how to

185
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,490
spare a couple of hours I grabbed the

186
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:10,250
train i went down to ely railway station

187
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,509
now most people had thought people that

188
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,629
originally published this knew it was

189
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:16,639
collected 1988 it was collected but the

190
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:19,459
herbicides triazines were banned or

191
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,019
discontinued in europe in 1992 everybody

192
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:22,698
assumed this thing had died out and I

193
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:24,740
was kind of curious the see whether

194
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:26,240
indeed it had died out and if it was

195
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,918
still there what was the frequency and

196
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,990
it would be a nice example I thought of

197
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,299
studying photosynthesis in the field

198
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,069
here we have a mutant which occurred in

199
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,509
nature with a reduced photosynthetic

200
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:37,550
efficiency how does it interact with

201
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:39,288
plants would hire photosynthesis because

202
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,598
there's a lot of debate in world

203
00:07:39,288 --> 00:07:43,848
photosynthesis whether it actually is

204
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:46,159
limiting for plants or is it something

205
00:07:43,848 --> 00:07:47,629
that the wild plants really need at a

206
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,939
high level and we thought we could

207
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:52,129
answer a lot of interesting questions so

208
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:54,649
I went there to ely railway station I

209
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:56,389
looked around and it was the wrong time

210
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:58,519
of year but I found these little

211
00:07:56,389 --> 00:08:01,129
skeletons of dead plants with a couple

212
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:03,978
of seeds still stuck on and I was pretty

213
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:06,348
excited about this and I brought them

214
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:07,728
back to the lab and this is a picture of

215
00:08:06,348 --> 00:08:09,199
the railway station here we have the

216
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:11,209
station near the railway tracks and this

217
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,728
is going into the city and I found

218
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:15,109
plants here in the car park and I tested

219
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:16,519
them to see if they were resistant and

220
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,800
like I said most people had thought that

221
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:20,959
it probably would have died out and they

222
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,520
were all resistant I was like oh this is

223
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,319
pretty cool this is interesting it's

224
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:26,930
still there let's go back now the

225
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,509
assumption at this point was that it had

226
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:32,028
originated in Ely railway station and

227
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,588
that because that's where it was first

228
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:35,240
collected in the 80s and there was no

229
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:37,310
reason to think otherwise so we had

230
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,049
these grand ideas of doing transects

231
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:40,449
away from the railway station seeing how

232
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:42,500
far it's spread and what was the

233
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,490
interaction between resistant and

234
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,259
non-resistant genotypes now that the

235
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,490
selective advantage was removed the

236
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:50,309
herbicide was no longer in the

237
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:52,440
environment and how much of a cost is

238
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:56,278
this reduced photosynthesis in nature

239
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,870
and when I went back then in May 2013

240
00:08:56,278 --> 00:08:59,338
because I basically convinced my

241
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,810
supervisors that this was something we

242
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:03,570
had to do so they were willing to pay

243
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:05,159
for that this is the revered else is

244
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:08,550
growing in the railway ballast here and

245
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:10,110
here was just some sampling we went back

246
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,519
again to Ely so here's the railway

247
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,740
station which I showed you a picture of

248
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,169
before and we started sampling all over

249
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,759
to town or we tried to we couldn't find

250
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:19,860
any rubber topsis outside the railway

251
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,330
station well we found a couple but we

252
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,610
were like walking around this town for

253
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:26,070
two days looking at every corner and we

254
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,570
really couldn't find anything really I

255
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,640
was really disappointed I was like well

256
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,080
where is all the arabidopsis and then we

257
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,449
did a little bit of research into the

258
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,278
history of Ely and it turns out Ely is

259
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:38,730
actually a clay island which was

260
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:40,169
surrounded by fan or bog arabidopsis

261
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,550
doesn't really like clay and it

262
00:09:40,169 --> 00:09:42,958
certainly doesn't grow on bog and these

263
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:46,439
fans had already been drained in the

264
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,939
past hundred years so it was not prime

265
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,290
Arab adoptions territory and you'll

266
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,180
notice down here so this is the railway

267
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:53,490
track coming down we had one plant

268
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:54,809
collected also along the railway track

269
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,789
just a bit further awakes we walk down

270
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:59,429
this road and that plant was also

271
00:09:56,789 --> 00:10:01,230
resistant so then we started thinking so

272
00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:04,319
any Arab adopts this is probably not

273
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,670
native to Ely it probably came in on the

274
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,110
railway tracks and railway tracks are

275
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:08,879
good or avid offices habitat they've got

276
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,339
sand they've got rock and they're

277
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,230
relatively free of competition so we

278
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:14,670
thought didn't originate here and it

279
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,528
must have come from somewhere else so

280
00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:18,000
let's sample along the railway tracks

281
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:20,129
and see if we can track out where it

282
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,980
came from so we went back a month later

283
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:26,120
and I did I basically just took lots of

284
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:29,129
trains all over this part of England and

285
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,649
we I sampled all these railway stations

286
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:33,240
which I regretted that in the end I

287
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:34,528
should have rented a car said read

288
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,730
trains don't go out very often and

289
00:10:34,528 --> 00:10:39,740
sometimes you spent two or three hours

290
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:42,389
and some dumped somewhere no way out and

291
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,860
which happened this place can it I hope

292
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:47,189
nobody's from kennett of stuck there for

293
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,629
ages anyway so went around collecting I

294
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,390
found the rubber tops is pretty much in

295
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:53,850
all the railway stations almost and then

296
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:56,789
all of these places there were resistant

297
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,850
genotypes so this resistance had spread

298
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,838
quite far we know

299
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,670
they actually how far it's spread

300
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,199
because we didn't go beyond like it

301
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:03,458
hasn't stopped so we've got really

302
00:11:02,198 --> 00:11:05,469
interested in this and thought well this

303
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:07,568
must have spread all over the place and

304
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,069
we're not going to be able to track it

305
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:10,838
down because we don't know which

306
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:12,458
direction to go in there's not enough

307
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:14,470
information from this where it came from

308
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:16,629
so we thought well let's have a look at

309
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,879
what's available in the genotype data

310
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:20,679
bases and see what's related to this

311
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,110
resistant individual that we have

312
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:25,599
genetic markers for we had 214,000

313
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,930
markers and there was this reg map panel

314
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,839
available of 1307 plans all of which had

315
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:33,489
been genotyped with these 214,000

316
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,100
markers so we did basically a

317
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:38,289
relatedness essay and we have this one

318
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,690
genotype which was much more closely

319
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:42,698
related than anything else to this

320
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,949
resistant individual so we thought okay

321
00:11:42,698 --> 00:11:47,139
that's a good starting point where is

322
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:50,469
this genotype from and this genotype is

323
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:52,839
from here ledbury and basically near the

324
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,850
Welch border in England but Ely is here

325
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:56,709
so they're quite far away so we told

326
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,930
maybe maybe it really has spread very

327
00:11:56,708 --> 00:12:00,789
far and then we told well what else can

328
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:02,828
we do what other information can we use

329
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:04,899
to get an idea of where it is originated

330
00:12:02,828 --> 00:12:06,909
from and we thought well there's another

331
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:08,980
genotype data set it's got a lot more

332
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:10,899
plants almost 6,000 but it's got a lot

333
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,360
less markers but still we might be able

334
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:16,149
to get some information from this so we

335
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,980
basically plotted the possible origins

336
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:20,649
all these yellow dots aware genotypes

337
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,870
were collected from and this color so

338
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:25,539
dark means less likely to be from there

339
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:27,970
and white means more likely so we had

340
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:30,039
this hope that we would get a nice idea

341
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,500
of these purple lines by the way the

342
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:34,299
railway tracks where it came from as you

343
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,828
can see it's not very obvious this is

344
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:37,120
not very informative there's a few

345
00:12:35,828 --> 00:12:38,888
locations where we're pretty sure it's

346
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,500
not from better than that it could be

347
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:42,879
from anywhere here even it looks like

348
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,309
could be from northern France which I

349
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:48,149
don't believe so this didn't work as

350
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:51,789
well as one would hope one would hope

351
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:53,470
but in this set of six thousand lines

352
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:56,438
there were four that were identical for

353
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:58,750
all 149 markers to the Ely genotype and

354
00:12:56,438 --> 00:13:00,129
when I check them and I genotype them

355
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,629
pretty mutation every single one of them

356
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:04,208
was resistant so they were the same

357
00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:05,889
plant from the same mutation event so

358
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:07,808
this was pretty interesting and where

359
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:09,669
they were from is even further away it

360
00:13:07,808 --> 00:13:10,389
was down in Cornwall this is about 400

361
00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:12,579
kilometers

362
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:15,730
crow flies between these two locations

363
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,680
so we thought well we want to

364
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,840
investigate that is this a little bit

365
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,489
more see how far it's really spread so

366
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,440
we'll do a sampling strategy around this

367
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,090
area of southwest England because we had

368
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,580
these two data points pointing us in

369
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:29,680
this direction so we went back again

370
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,820
with a lot more sampling wrong railway

371
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,309
tracks here we haven't actually a

372
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,210
herbicide not try as eens of course they

373
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:36,369
don't spray them anymore probably

374
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:37,720
glyphosate or something arab adopts us

375
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:40,870
along the railway tracks and we went to

376
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:44,430
ledbury as well and we're bit

377
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:46,690
disappointed so in total including the

378
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:49,659
sampling in the East of England we had

379
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:52,810
573 plants collected and in total we got

380
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:55,209
52 resistant plants but in the southwest

381
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:57,250
apart from the place where they had

382
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:59,980
originally been collected from are these

383
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:02,350
sick for individuals in this panel of

384
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,759
6000 we didn't find it back there so it

385
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,500
may have gone extinct although that

386
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,909
railway station was being renovated at

387
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,639
the time so the place was completely

388
00:14:06,909 --> 00:14:11,620
destroyed and we didn't find much in the

389
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:13,419
way of arabidopsis in the actual station

390
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,750
but I did find it out here and were

391
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:18,219
chester independently so we do not have

392
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,620
it has spread quite considerable

393
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,509
distances again all these brownish lines

394
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,399
are railway tracks and this is the

395
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:26,200
original area that we sampled and you

396
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,449
can see there's quite a lot of plants

397
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,710
from there one thing that was

398
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,240
interesting about it was that it was

399
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,220
completely associated with railway

400
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,539
tracks so when we sampled we sampled on

401
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,580
railway tracks and we always went away

402
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:38,889
into the town and tried to get non

403
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,420
railway track samples and never did we

404
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:43,179
find the resistance away from the

405
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:44,649
railways so it was 100% association with

406
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:46,870
the railways so this was something that

407
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:49,659
evolved on our new railway track and

408
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,370
then spread all around the place so the

409
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:52,990
next question was well was this a single

410
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,129
event so we have these 52 plants

411
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:57,159
collected from different parts of

412
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:58,450
England was it one mutation event or

413
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:00,219
didn't involve multiple times because

414
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:02,379
bear in mind this mutation has evolved

415
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,730
and seventy two separate occasions in

416
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:05,620
different species so it's something that

417
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:08,860
seems to evolve relatively regularly in

418
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,240
response to try an application and we

419
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,710
just did a simple we didn't use a lot of

420
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,649
markers I don't think we needed them we

421
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:17,530
had 32 snips spread across the genome

422
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:19,299
and we genotyped all of the 500 plans to

423
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:20,829
get an idea and every single resistant

424
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:23,109
individual was down here so they were

425
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:24,070
all completely identical for all 32

426
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,690
snips

427
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,850
so for medias was pretty convincing that

428
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:31,780
it was one mutation event which then

429
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:33,190
spread and this is where the hitchhiking

430
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:34,899
comes in because then we started

431
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:40,360
thinking about this and what does this

432
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:41,679
actually mean and I'm going to explain

433
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,300
genetically choking just as a refresher

434
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:44,859
for those of you are not familiar with

435
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:47,319
it and this is genetically choking in

436
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,389
the nucleus so here we have basically a

437
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,370
piece of DNA and each of these lines

438
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:54,399
represents different individuals in a

439
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:57,220
population the colorful blocks represent

440
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,409
snips or polymorphisms with reference to

441
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,540
one another if one of these individuals

442
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:03,579
gets a mutation which is beneficial in

443
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:04,899
some way and then it starts rising in

444
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,570
frequency you get what's known as a

445
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:10,059
selective sweep and this would be the

446
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:11,770
post selective sweet population so you

447
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:13,299
see that obviously this is much more

448
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:15,009
common because it adds a benefit but the

449
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:17,949
interesting thing to pay attention to is

450
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:20,080
that these polymorphisms which provide

451
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:22,000
no direct fitness advantage have also

452
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,820
rises in frequency and this is because

453
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,590
of this physical linkage to the selected

454
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,270
locus they're literally linked

455
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:31,480
physically on the DNA and this is

456
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:33,009
classical genetics week but it does

457
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,710
depend on physical linkage in the

458
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:36,970
classical understanding of it and that

459
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,290
all occurs in nucleus because you've got

460
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,870
these big chromosomes you've got

461
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:42,039
recombination there however our mutation

462
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,990
is on the chloroplasts which is

463
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:46,179
obviously not physically linked to any

464
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,980
low sigh in the nucleus yet we had

465
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:50,739
complete fixation of these nuclear

466
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:53,080
genomes so these nuclear genomes had

467
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:55,600
arisen to this frequency purely on the

468
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,310
back of this chloroplast mutation so

469
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,120
they're basically as I said hitched a

470
00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:02,889
ride on this chloroplast so as I said

471
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,819
genetic linkage is something which is

472
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:08,619
generally assumed to occur in only when

473
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:11,529
things are physically linked and it's

474
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:13,029
restricted by recombination it's a very

475
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:14,980
important phenomenon and it's recently

476
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:17,379
been shown to resolve lewins paradox

477
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,269
which is this basically according to

478
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,290
neutral theory in evolution there should

479
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:23,680
be a linear relationship between

480
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:25,420
population size and genetic diversity

481
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,789
but that is not the case the larger the

482
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,350
population the lower the genetic

483
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:32,019
diversity is compared to what one would

484
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:33,250
expect and this has been recently I mean

485
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:34,960
it's been often considered that

486
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,460
selection is the cause of this selection

487
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,870
will operate more efficiently in large

488
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,190
populations and we

489
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:41,169
of this physical linkage when you get

490
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,150
selection you get a region around it

491
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:44,529
which is reduced in diversity so

492
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,240
basically what you're happening it's

493
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:47,769
called genetic draft this when

494
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,539
hitchhiking occurs across the whole

495
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:52,150
genome the phenomena is genetic draft

496
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:53,950
you're dragging the diversity down this

497
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:55,780
does happen in larger populations so

498
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:58,299
it's a very important phenomena but it's

499
00:17:55,779 --> 00:18:00,190
always assumed exclusively to occur

500
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:02,379
within the nucleus there's no literature

501
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:04,000
considering how selection on organelles

502
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,440
could affect nuclear diversity and

503
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,599
that's because there's no physical

504
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,000
linkage so I think people don't really

505
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,589
think about it here we're showing that

506
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,750
there has been very strong selection on

507
00:18:11,589 --> 00:18:15,639
an organelle which has resulted in a

508
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,859
complete change in the diversity of

509
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,870
nuclear genomes in these populations of

510
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:21,699
arabidopsis now this is probably because

511
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:23,049
the rabid opsys is highly inbreeding so

512
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,269
you don't have a physical linkage but

513
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:27,250
you have a statistical linkage and how

514
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:28,960
important the level of inbreeding is

515
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,308
compared to the intensity of selection

516
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,700
is something that we don't know but

517
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:35,470
we're thinking about so basically what

518
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,940
i'm showing is something very simple but

519
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,319
what's interesting about it is that it

520
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,670
hasn't been observed before and it

521
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:41,649
hasn't really been considered in the

522
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:43,990
literature how does selection on

523
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:46,179
organelles indirectly affect nuclear

524
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,500
genetic diversity and this I think it's

525
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:48,910
particularly interesting because it's

526
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,890
becoming more and more obvious that

527
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:53,380
there is indeed a lot of selection on

528
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:56,670
organelles so if you look at southern

529
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:59,620
hemisphere beech trees not the focus the

530
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:01,570
basically the diversity of the

531
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:03,189
organelles doesn't match up with the

532
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:05,289
diversity of the nuclear genomes the

533
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:07,600
diversity organelles shows a latitudinal

534
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:09,039
gradient some organelles are better

535
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,019
adapted to different temperatures and

536
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,839
these move actually between species the

537
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:15,069
nuclear genetic diversity don't match so

538
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:17,139
you've got strong selection on these

539
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:20,319
organelles for adaptation to these

540
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,940
different climatic zones and if you have

541
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,889
such kind of selection you potentially

542
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,900
as we show here can have linkage these

543
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:28,030
processes could cause distortions in

544
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:31,059
nuclear gene frequencies which is

545
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:32,529
basically what I'm getting the question

546
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:33,819
is does it require inbreeding or any

547
00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:35,519
level of inbreeding and this will

548
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:38,439
require modeling to go forward with this

549
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,509
so in summary the main point I'm getting

550
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,210
at is that selection on organelles can

551
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:44,379
affect nuclear genetic diversity and so

552
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:46,630
a lot of people that I've tried to

553
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,280
explain is to found it a bit confusing

554
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:50,410
and wanted me to illustrate it better so

555
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:51,139
I thought about it quite long and hard

556
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,180
as hell

557
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,009
show this and it sort of sophisticated

558
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:57,740
and clear way and I came up with

559
00:19:55,009 --> 00:20:00,049
basically this figure which I think

560
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:03,769
aptly shows how the organelles can

561
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:06,980
distort nuclear gene frequencies and

562
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:08,119
that is basically what i wanted to show

563
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:12,589
to you today I've gone through it a

564
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:14,029
little bit fast I see but there are some

565
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:17,209
remaining questions things that need to

566
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:19,910
be addressed of course so how common is

567
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:21,610
this and I think this is a particularly

568
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:24,830
interesting question we were very lucky

569
00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:26,240
so we stumbled upon this which is what I

570
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:28,309
was trying to get out the way I told the

571
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,680
story we were not looking for this we

572
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:32,500
were I was interested in photosynthesis

573
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:36,289
and then we came across this phenomena

574
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:38,809
we knew the Selective agent we knew the

575
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:40,579
locus which was providing resistance we

576
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:42,289
had all this prior information then we

577
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:43,879
had this nice system of railway tracks

578
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:45,529
and we had the region where the

579
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,480
Selective agent was applied and where it

580
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:49,460
wasn't so it's very clear that selection

581
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,620
was occurring on the chloroplast there

582
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,269
is no doubt about that and then we were

583
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:55,759
able to see that the nuclear genome at

584
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:57,529
hitchhiked along but when you actually

585
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,359
know that the chloroplast is on the

586
00:20:57,529 --> 00:21:01,849
selection the Selective agent and the

587
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,409
site of selection is pretty rare so if

588
00:21:01,849 --> 00:21:05,629
you don't have the prior knowledge we

589
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:07,430
have how would you be able to find these

590
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,260
phenomena which i think is an

591
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:11,330
interesting question because almost all

592
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:13,839
of the population genetic studies

593
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:16,279
looking at the effect of these kind of

594
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,899
selective sweeps is exclusively looking

595
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:20,119
at diversity in the nuclear genome and

596
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,950
they pretty much ignore what's going on

597
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:25,009
in the organelles even though they can

598
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:26,509
be on the selection a lot so basically

599
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:28,160
how do we detect it and what are the

600
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:30,349
evolutionary consequences of this does

601
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,450
it distort nuclear genetic diversity as

602
00:21:30,349 --> 00:21:34,399
much as we now realize genetic draft

603
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,620
operating within the nucleus can distort

604
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,509
nuclear genetic diversity how big an

605
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:39,739
impact canopy because like i said it's

606
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:41,119
becoming more and more clear that there

607
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,490
is a lot of selection operating on

608
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,619
organelles and if the selection is also

609
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:47,569
distorting nuclear gene frequencies what

610
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:51,409
kind of consequences could this have for

611
00:21:47,569 --> 00:21:53,089
evolution like i said it can lead to a

612
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,980
lawsuit and another thing is the inter

613
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:56,449
genome conflicts so these organelles

614
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,730
have to communicate with the nucleus

615
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:00,890
it's a very tight relationship to

616
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:02,839
regulate all of this so if you've got 1g

617
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:06,320
organelle increasing

618
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:08,359
but lien frequency due to selection then

619
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:11,240
the associated nuclear genomes if any of

620
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:14,929
them are less well adapted to this and

621
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:17,990
you can have also distortions there so

622
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:19,759
that's basically it I've gone faster

623
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:22,460
than I expected I probably skipped

624
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:25,250
something I didn't do this alone of

625
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,620
course I've got this was stuffed like I

626
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:29,410
said that grew out of my PhD research so

627
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:33,639
my two supervisors mark and Jeremy

628
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:38,240
promoter Martin karnath who basically

629
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:40,370
made sure that I graduated and then help

630
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,440
in the lab from Frank and from bus these

631
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:44,419
two guys helped me out with like just

632
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,920
basic stuff in the lab helping along and

633
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,269
then a lot of the analysis i did with a

634
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,300
guy called the austin hey garden which

635
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:51,950
was very very helpful and you know with

636
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:53,149
that I thank you for your attention and

637
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:57,640
I hope that maybe you have some

638
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:57,640
questions or comments really did that

639
00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:07,808
little bit more of the molecular making

640
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:07,808
this how the environment

641
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:22,819
well so does in brief is like trains

642
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:24,199
that sprayed herbicide so that's been

643
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,788
that's the environmental pressure at

644
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:27,979
these special friends that they designed

645
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:31,669
and driving on railway tracks spraying

646
00:23:27,979 --> 00:23:33,769
website keep them clear so this is the

647
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:36,739
Selective pressure effectively and then

648
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:39,469
you it not Sarah Fossett this is you get

649
00:23:36,739 --> 00:23:42,528
a simple amino acid substitution which

650
00:23:39,469 --> 00:23:44,479
provides resistance and then this plant

651
00:23:42,528 --> 00:23:46,578
is occurring on a railway track which as

652
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:48,109
these trains moving non well with

653
00:23:46,578 --> 00:23:50,328
herbicide spraying trains moving up and

654
00:23:48,108 --> 00:23:51,678
down it nay has been quite a lot of

655
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:54,408
evidence to show they produced these

656
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,239
wind effects which distributes scenes

657
00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:58,339
people different stuff in their shoes so

658
00:23:56,239 --> 00:24:00,078
there's lots of wait for it dispersal on

659
00:23:58,338 --> 00:24:02,239
railway tracks and liberal way stations

660
00:24:00,078 --> 00:24:03,618
so I think that's how it actually spread

661
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:06,619
so I think it's a nice example of

662
00:24:03,618 --> 00:24:09,078
congruence between human induced

663
00:24:06,618 --> 00:24:11,628
chemical changes and human created

664
00:24:09,078 --> 00:24:14,898
infrastructure providing avenues for

665
00:24:11,628 --> 00:24:17,568
changes in genética populations that was

666
00:24:14,898 --> 00:24:19,689
clear but that was in the molecular and

667
00:24:17,568 --> 00:24:24,839
cellular

668
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:24,840
as fresh air

669
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:31,629
the neck driving the collection so under

670
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:34,920
other examples and mammals or

671
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,920
and the essential

672
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:39,240
there is evidence there's plenty of

673
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,680
evidence of selection occurring them

674
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,829
organelles but this is the first time

675
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,570
anybody's ever in this way of telling

676
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:47,099
the story anybody's ever considered that

677
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:48,809
the selection on the organelle can

678
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:50,730
distort new routine frequencies through

679
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:53,250
this effectively itchy certain

680
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:56,700
statistical think it's not a physical or

681
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:58,980
biological connection is just by chance

682
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,779
is it's a stochastic effect it's

683
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,279
organelle the protein is nucular genetic

684
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:08,160
background generate an egg background

685
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:11,639
got a free ride and the I'm answering

686
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:13,350
yes you're happy for ya so because there

687
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,000
is evidence of organelles being

688
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:16,259
important for lots of things in plants

689
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,880
they're important for water use

690
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:20,339
efficiency so it's been really nice

691
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:24,660
studies done using a reciprocal

692
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:26,789
transplants of some flowers which have

693
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:28,890
they been progressive basically they

694
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:30,809
made a super cool real population so

695
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:32,130
reciprocal savory any populations and

696
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:34,500
they've been able to show it at the

697
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,370
cytoplasmic background I don't know

698
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,869
whether they were able to show it

699
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:38,939
because it's difficult disentangle the

700
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:41,099
nucleus earlier faster than my country

701
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:44,490
is there always inherited together at

702
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:46,109
least in most organisms and they were to

703
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:47,730
show that these had a big impact on for

704
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:50,399
example survival to drought and it was

705
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:52,079
an example of local adaptation of these

706
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,850
so that was like really nice and very

707
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:54,899
cool studies but then you also see like

708
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:58,849
I mentioned with the southern hemisphere

709
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:01,080
peach you see he's like really nice

710
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:04,039
latitudinal stratification of different

711
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:07,039
more glasses but not the nuclear genome

712
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:07,039
because

713
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:12,450
the mitochondrial genome duplication as

714
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:15,029
well or in the evolution of jinan

715
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:17,940
sometimes we have is to forget particles

716
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:22,670
of genomes see any duplication of my

717
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:26,309
vagina Hey well it does happen you have

718
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:28,650
what is it is it mine species with this

719
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:32,429
massive mitochondrial genome in its side

720
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:34,320
in a witch just expands dramatically but

721
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:36,390
are you wondering about like when

722
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:38,429
polyploidy happens or yeah really fun

723
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:40,009
well polyploidy is just something that

724
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,029
happens in the nucleus because

725
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:43,980
mitochondria for bus is already are

726
00:26:42,029 --> 00:26:49,379
effectively polypoid just as many copies

727
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:52,829
of the main every cell so i left thank

728
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:54,990
you whatever caused me like i can

729
00:26:52,829 --> 00:26:58,529
imagine a situation where you have both

730
00:26:54,990 --> 00:27:01,410
the wild side and i would be

731
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:04,559
advantageous for a platform that's a

732
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:06,990
really good question and we never found

733
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,909
it so i checked for a plasma we never

734
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:11,490
found it in arabidopsis but it was a

735
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:14,009
nice science paper published in i think

736
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:15,990
it was the late 80s or early nineties oh

737
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:19,549
forget Kentucky language has almost

738
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:23,839
never been cited interesting and which

739
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:30,240
they showed that what was the species

740
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:33,269
senecio had heteroplasmy for resistance

741
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,950
and non-resistant go fast and it has way

742
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:36,629
of maintaining this type of but me which

743
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,610
is most interesting because a lot of

744
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:40,650
people study had proposed me in tissue

745
00:27:38,609 --> 00:27:43,049
culture in the 1990s and then they did

746
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:46,080
these product last fusions and then you

747
00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:49,048
get like a mixed

748
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:51,269
by of organelles and almost always it

749
00:27:49,048 --> 00:27:53,460
segregates have rapidly so you get one

750
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:55,140
crunch which has one particular Corvus

751
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,519
another branch was another mitochondria

752
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,380
are being more promiscuous often they

753
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,480
actually mix 30 notes you get inside

754
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,360
there my country the chloroplasts don't

755
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,548
do that these three literature i bred so

756
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:06,839
usually is the assumption is that had

757
00:28:05,548 --> 00:28:09,480
four blood moons never really maintain

758
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:11,129
its lost out during mitosis but this

759
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,349
organism was able to maintain and

760
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:15,149
philosophy very interestingly when they

761
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:17,908
subjected its selection so for example

762
00:28:15,148 --> 00:28:21,778
the strong herbicide application it went

763
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:23,700
to homo plasma of resistant genotypes

764
00:28:21,778 --> 00:28:25,019
and it never went back after that so

765
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,909
obviously the knowledge system points

766
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:28,649
have gone extinct it's somehow but in

767
00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:31,679
the absence of the airside applications

768
00:28:28,648 --> 00:28:32,908
somehow therefore maintain nobody's that

769
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:37,740
already followed that up and that's the

770
00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:38,850
only known example our case so you

771
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,460
didn't go into this but at the beginning

772
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:42,339
you show the plot with it photosynthetic

773
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:46,240
efficiency

774
00:28:42,339 --> 00:28:48,220
and seems to be a complex and you said

775
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,259
if we wanted Fugee us but we never

776
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:53,528
really worked you actually wanted it to

777
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:56,259
look at nuclear genes so yeah that would

778
00:28:53,528 --> 00:28:59,079
be in a different talk and what and yet

779
00:28:56,259 --> 00:29:02,470
to answer your question yes indeed if he

780
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:07,178
was we found someone outside and it was

781
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:09,038
I was young it's very and it wasn't it

782
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:12,220
was like I don't know does anybody here

783
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:21,609
done he was on complex rights ya done it

784
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:23,288
were you happy with okay so basically my

785
00:29:21,609 --> 00:29:24,639
answer will be was pretty for me I

786
00:29:23,288 --> 00:29:26,169
thought it was a bit disappointing or

787
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,840
because was oversold to me and I was

788
00:29:26,169 --> 00:29:32,049
very global believe all the stories I

789
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:34,089
was told but in the end most of the

790
00:29:32,048 --> 00:29:35,710
large effect goes I like the large eglo

791
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:37,089
say we come had already be found for

792
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,980
disease resistance for the defects

793
00:29:37,089 --> 00:29:41,428
photosynthesis because it gives an

794
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,429
autoimmune

795
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,480
basically plants are killing games

796
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:48,009
before other plants so you see this

797
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,140
coming off of the master production

798
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:51,910
photosynthetic efficiency we did find

799
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:54,030
other low side when I didn't manage in

800
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:56,440
time I have to play a little

801
00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:58,690
characterized and police what they made

802
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,390
sense in certain genes no this didn't

803
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:03,549
make any sense whatsoever what we did

804
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:05,620
find stuff that's what you were

805
00:30:03,549 --> 00:30:07,059
wondering about I can't like it I can

806
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:08,949
help you I can show you what I've done

807
00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:13,750
later from camera but all of the so she

808
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:18,039
goes I'm completely on board with your

809
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:21,069
concept that nuclear genes can hitchhike

810
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:22,750
with big organelle but I'm skeptical as

811
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,960
to whether you really have an example of

812
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:28,750
that and the reason I'm skeptical is

813
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:33,210
that triazine resistance has a rising

814
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:36,279
spraying has been used that long so this

815
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:38,620
this plant could have arisen perhaps on

816
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:40,899
your birthday and there you were born

817
00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:43,599
and then these plants are actually

818
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:45,610
fairly young like you so how do we know

819
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:48,849
they've had enough time for the nuclear

820
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:50,439
variation to occur that it retin it

821
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:52,269
rather than it's simply being that they

822
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,750
haven't had enough time to get old and

823
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:58,569
change so do you have a way to refute my

824
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:03,640
my skepticism I have to be honest I

825
00:30:58,569 --> 00:31:06,879
don't understand what you so here's my

826
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,830
theory the reason you're finding all the

827
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,600
nuclear genomes the same as they simply

828
00:31:08,829 --> 00:31:12,279
haven't had enough time to change

829
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:14,619
especially since you've gotten

830
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:17,049
inbreeding species alright if you have

831
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:18,879
an out crossing species then i would

832
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:20,109
agree there must be some reason that

833
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,300
they're staying the same but you have an

834
00:31:20,109 --> 00:31:24,939
inbreeding species these moments could

835
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:26,740
be in or no I understand your question

836
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,759
yeah the fact that there is same is not

837
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,710
a problem for me

838
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:30,879
that doesn't mean that the hitchhiking

839
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,769
hasn't occurred it means that the

840
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,740
hitchhiking was extremely tight linkage

841
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:38,259
I think was if the interesting is why

842
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:42,299
did we never see how cross why did we

843
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:44,589
never see a individual which had the

844
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:46,839
resistant chloroplasts which was at how

845
00:31:44,589 --> 00:31:48,099
the mixed nuclear Tina time and I think

846
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:49,689
the answer doesn't we don't have been to

847
00:31:48,099 --> 00:31:50,769
enough sampling basically I think it's

848
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,240
probably out there but it occurs a

849
00:31:50,769 --> 00:31:54,190
little frequency because like you say a

850
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,380
rabid opsys is highly in reading the

851
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:57,940
fact that we see no differences is a

852
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,560
combination of fact we've only got 22

853
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:02,620
snips I think we did whole genome

854
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:04,029
sequencing we see more polymorphisms 32

855
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:05,739
states is not a lot and it doesn't mean

856
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:07,960
a lot of time but that doesn't mean that

857
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:10,870
HIV has not occurred unless I miss for

858
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:13,150
the city no I so I guess my point is you

859
00:32:10,869 --> 00:32:15,129
haven't proven that as is has occurred

860
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:18,210
because you simply don't have enough

861
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:20,890
time and arabidopsis has a fairly low

862
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:23,529
outcrossing frequency i guess i don't

863
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:26,290
know in England it's imagine somebody's

864
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:28,089
measured how much outcrossing happens in

865
00:32:26,289 --> 00:32:30,190
nature and do you have any idea what

866
00:32:28,089 --> 00:32:33,549
perky nose cut it out crossing frequency

867
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:35,910
between so you saw like point 95 in

868
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:35,909
reading

869
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:42,619
almost so that's really what i'm saying

870
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:45,798
i think i completely ablute believe that

871
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:48,229
the nuclear genome it is probably

872
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:50,179
dragged along with with the organelle

873
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:52,548
gentleman under many circumstances since

874
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:55,190
there are protein complexes in the

875
00:32:52,548 --> 00:32:57,619
chloroplasts that are from both you know

876
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:59,058
made by x from both nuclear and

877
00:32:57,619 --> 00:33:01,879
organelle genes you would imagine that

878
00:32:59,058 --> 00:33:04,639
there are some some reason that you

879
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:07,100
would want to have nuclear genes of fit

880
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,450
best with the organelle genome but i

881
00:33:07,099 --> 00:33:11,329
just don't think you have shown it yet

882
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:13,759
with you know the metadata that you have

883
00:33:11,329 --> 00:33:15,529
but i'm not suggesting that there is a

884
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:17,839
correlation between these two this

885
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:19,819
nucleus and a support us no i'm not

886
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:22,970
suggesting that either i'm just saying

887
00:33:19,819 --> 00:33:26,509
that unless you have more time in more

888
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:28,429
plants and you know more outcrossing i

889
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:30,500
think it's hard to say that the reason

890
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:34,220
that those nuclear genomes are all the

891
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:35,960
same is because of dragging along the

892
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:38,419
nuclear genome with the organization

893
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,210
what would be the alternative hypothesis

894
00:33:38,419 --> 00:33:42,500
that how else would they be all the same

895
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:45,679
that simply hasn't been enough

896
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:47,390
outcrossing and you haven't collect

897
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,710
enough friends to see the ones that have

898
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:53,240
crossed so you know you could be you

899
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:56,569
could be right i just think i wouldn't

900
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,429
want more proof okay that's why not

901
00:33:56,569 --> 00:34:02,389
accept that but i still don't i don't

902
00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:04,250
really get why this I don't get it

903
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:07,070
basically what the point is that they're

904
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:08,989
all the same is that's the evidence but

905
00:34:07,069 --> 00:34:11,269
that's not me I'm just saying that your

906
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:14,418
evidence isn't strong enough yet okay I

907
00:34:11,269 --> 00:34:17,030
need more plans more markers and you

908
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:19,908
know to look for whether they really are

909
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:22,460
all the same or whether they just

910
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:26,898
haven't had enough time to help cross

911
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:30,260
and I mean these plants could have

912
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:36,259
arisen in 1990 and well they well they

913
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:39,500
were connected in 1988 as I said behind

914
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:41,570
your za Charlie things were sprayed in

915
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,398
England since nineteen sixty most

916
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:45,350
evidence regarding the rate of evolution

917
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:47,480
of resistance is that it happens with

918
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:49,489
entertaining for 10 years in most

919
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,409
instances so probably it was around

920
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:53,089
since the 70s that's still not a lot of

921
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:55,490
time but the fact that they're all

922
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:57,710
identical is like me know it was one

923
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:59,599
event and this nuclear genome has

924
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:01,039
nothing to do with resistance yet is

925
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,949
that much higher frequency as a

926
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:04,529
consequence so it is very definition of

927
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:06,960
these

928
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:10,680
sound of genetic a shocking but if

929
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:13,949
another population spawned from a single

930
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:16,349
ancestor in 1970 and you tracked that

931
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:18,419
population I've looked at the variation

932
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:20,969
you know they both started at the same

933
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:24,180
time and I merged would that have as

934
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:26,129
many differences either over that have

935
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:27,779
many differences or with all the genomes

936
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,640
formed by that population all right

937
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:32,180
seeing those populations at the same way

938
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:35,539
of looking at this is that try zooming

939
00:35:32,179 --> 00:35:38,369
essentially extinguish all other

940
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:41,190
competitively Regina so there's really

941
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:43,170
nothing left even if they're out

942
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:48,150
crossing you still the same nuclear

943
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:51,119
issue so you have inbreeding going on in

944
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:53,639
getting incredibly intense way yes and

945
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,529
that probably occurred when it's red but

946
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:58,529
now that we go by the example these

947
00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:01,560
plants are a mix of styles with others

948
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:04,260
speak with no with other message

949
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:06,590
individuals yeah so it did possibility

950
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:08,880
are crossing certainly there yep and

951
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:11,530
what's not a possible if you've got a

952
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:15,000
customer as long as that

953
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:18,000
yes well so you really have the time the

954
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
opportunity

955
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:28,420
from the time they stopped the actual

956
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:32,739
truth and when was that base 92 yeah so

957
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:35,650
so you basically have 20 at most 25

958
00:36:32,739 --> 00:36:40,689
years or something to explore other

959
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:43,869
nuclear genomes as a post-dated court

960
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:45,820
but so I comin in reading any evidence

961
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:46,809
it's not that strong but I agree with

962
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,369
you but the thing is that the nuclear

963
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:51,909
genome has already increased massively

964
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:53,890
and frequency so even as it ever crosses

965
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:56,230
I'm and this nuclear genome gets into

966
00:36:53,889 --> 00:36:59,049
other organ air backgrounds and vice

967
00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:01,510
versa it has massively increased in

968
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:03,310
frequency it's a rare genotype we switch

969
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:05,020
over the relation is apart from the

970
00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:07,239
resistant individuals we don't find many

971
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:09,309
times supposed to relate all of England

972
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:10,838
or in northwestern Europe it's kind of

973
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:12,369
an odd one out thing is now it's at a

974
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:14,828
much higher frequency in an editor was

975
00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:16,660
before which is beside me as I

976
00:37:14,829 --> 00:37:18,430
understand it it could also be seen as a

977
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:20,529
fog effect I mean it's essentially what

978
00:37:18,429 --> 00:37:22,019
you have it's like an island that it's a

979
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:24,030
long railway

980
00:37:22,019 --> 00:37:26,639
I mean if they didn't receive durable

981
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:29,370
aside from hell no every site is

982
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:31,170
definitely gone also because there's

983
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:35,549
species of bacteria which evolved to eat

984
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:36,990
it as a nitrogen source but you can also

985
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:39,090
see that upon the fact I here with you

986
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:41,339
about hitchhiking but when I found the

987
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,840
reflected in checking our heart our two

988
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:44,910
sides of the same point as I understand

989
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:47,100
it's just a look of association with a

990
00:37:44,909 --> 00:37:48,569
particular locus that gives you to our

991
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:53,339
frequency or the look of getting on the

992
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:56,640
island first that is hiking occurs with

993
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:58,740
more individuals are competing and I

994
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:01,379
guess it's take a chiropractor small

995
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:03,419
sample size that goes through okay yeah

996
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:06,390
depend around the region where is

997
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:08,099
selection occurs in the genome it's

998
00:38:06,389 --> 00:38:10,769
effectively like a founder effect right

999
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:13,319
okay well I'm always really that goes

1000
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:16,050
with that kinda sad would be to just

1001
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:18,180
walk for this simulation and just find

1002
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:21,810
exactly what that happened but you could

1003
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:23,579
answer what I would need sequence start

1004
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:25,469
again be able to get out the signals but

1005
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:27,489
since you have a couple of snips to have

1006
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:32,799
a vacation

1007
00:38:27,489 --> 00:38:34,779
no clear polymorphisms in yellow they're

1008
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:38,410
completely identical for all 32 states

1009
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:41,290
of the new cochlear neutrogena thank you

1010
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:43,539
yeah it's right across to you so there

1011
00:38:41,289 --> 00:38:45,460
it is it's continuing reading are you

1012
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:50,440
suggesting but I think the reason we

1013
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:52,780
haven't how many ever you need a lot

1014
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,389
more simply you find at the rate of

1015
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:57,700
everything that would hurt okay I have

1016
00:38:55,389 --> 00:38:59,769
an experiment for you to do okay all

1017
00:38:57,699 --> 00:39:02,109
right you show them your little map that

1018
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:04,509
you had some railway stations where

1019
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:06,849
there were non triazine resistant and

1020
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:09,550
try seemed resistant plants why not

1021
00:39:06,849 --> 00:39:12,069
collect seeds and then see if there's

1022
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:14,230
any outcrossing and if you're saying

1023
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:16,900
that the reason was those plants are all

1024
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:18,760
one nuclear genome is because there's

1025
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,680
been selection for them why don't you

1026
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:24,190
measure the rate of outcrossing in those

1027
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:27,389
regions where the plants are located i'm

1028
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:33,240
trying to do that and money

1029
00:39:27,389 --> 00:39:36,929
i would like to i did find somehow no

1030
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:39,449
crossing in a non-existent en place so

1031
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:40,768
there were 7 episode gossipy so there is

1032
00:39:39,449 --> 00:39:42,929
no crossing occurring in these

1033
00:39:40,768 --> 00:39:44,788
populations I was just never looking on

1034
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:48,000
find one which I've crossed with a

1035
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:50,069
resistant or resistant month which had

1036
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,559
any degree of crossing man surrounded

1037
00:39:50,068 --> 00:39:54,989
and it is compatible it does may get one

1038
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,910
this is perfectly cross-pollinate a book

1039
00:39:54,989 --> 00:39:59,669
that's not there's no physiological

1040
00:39:56,909 --> 00:40:01,739
barrier to prevent this well but maybe

1041
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:03,690
there is a nature maybe for some reason

1042
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:05,759
that planet is less likely to help cross

1043
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:09,269
in nature they flower at the same time

1044
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:13,200
so there's no sort of making in nature

1045
00:40:09,268 --> 00:40:15,088
and they're all flowering one I like

1046
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:16,649
it's possible of course I cannot move it

1047
00:40:15,088 --> 00:40:18,630
out but I never how many of its to

1048
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:21,119
suggest that I my feeling is I just

1049
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:22,559
didn't have enough samples I think if I

1050
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,150
went back and sampled even more

1051
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:26,309
intensively with like hundreds of my

1052
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:29,389
screaming population I would find it

1053
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:31,829
thank you and I'm across the middle I

1054
00:40:29,389 --> 00:40:33,900
don't remember answering your question

1055
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:35,940
properly I think it was it was tapped on

1056
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,309
to it was like an example of what

1057
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,869
learning the same but I have a different

1058
00:40:38,309 --> 00:40:42,660
question about something you're gonna

1059
00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:45,660
get slight with you I'm not saying that

1060
00:40:42,659 --> 00:40:48,449
this is what happens here but could you

1061
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:52,108
ever imagine a case where you have a

1062
00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:53,608
chloroplast gee that's so it's not

1063
00:40:52,108 --> 00:40:55,469
physically linked of course the nuclear

1064
00:40:53,608 --> 00:40:58,048
genes but there's a genetic interaction

1065
00:40:55,469 --> 00:41:00,989
like the proteins interact and then you

1066
00:40:58,048 --> 00:41:02,969
get genetic draft from not the

1067
00:41:00,989 --> 00:41:05,548
chloroplast gene but nuclear genes that

1068
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:06,868
work well with that chloroplast genes

1069
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:09,538
then you could have had centered

1070
00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:10,920
chloroplast having in direct genetic

1071
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:13,079
drivers

1072
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,730
and if you have something as complex as

1073
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:16,650
photosynthetic machinery could you

1074
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:18,900
imagine that happening like gauging

1075
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:20,579
multiple sites throughout the nuclear

1076
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:23,460
genome and then you can't distinguish

1077
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:27,329
chloroplasts genética choking from like

1078
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:29,519
in direct nuclear draft and yeah that's

1079
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:31,109
the something when you I mean the best

1080
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:33,960
example of that aside buzzin castor

1081
00:41:31,108 --> 00:41:37,289
ility where you have a nice occurs in

1082
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:42,199
the mitochondria give me one example of

1083
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:44,460
iterative corpus for you have some using

1084
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:47,969
your proteins are involved in this

1085
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:50,460
basically is a mitochondria evolves to

1086
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:52,108
kill the column mitochondria is one

1087
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,030
plants that are polymers the rationale

1088
00:41:52,108 --> 00:41:55,529
behind it of course it's not thinking

1089
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:57,690
like this book as a selective advantage

1090
00:41:55,530 --> 00:42:00,630
if it's in a modern man this is more

1091
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:02,369
scenes in males there are plants usually

1092
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:04,410
produce more seats and then you get more

1093
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:06,088
out of proxy a story so often you get

1094
00:42:04,409 --> 00:42:08,068
advantages of hybrid vigor and all of

1095
00:42:06,088 --> 00:42:09,929
that but of course as it rises in

1096
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:11,519
frequency more and more plants are no

1097
00:42:09,929 --> 00:42:13,618
longer able to produce pollen so it

1098
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:15,630
becomes an advantage to be able to

1099
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:16,920
produce pollen but this side of cosmic

1100
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:18,599
background is also increased in

1101
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,920
frequency so then you get the evolution

1102
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:22,318
of restore factors and you basically

1103
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,470
have an arms race with being a nuclear

1104
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:27,269
genome the mitochondria and these in

1105
00:42:25,469 --> 00:42:29,459
Europe proteins or the proteins that

1106
00:42:27,269 --> 00:42:31,309
alternative high restore factors show

1107
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:35,400
very similar evolutionary package a

1108
00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:37,440
pattern to packaging resistant students

1109
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,680
they occur these kind of sets of

1110
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,150
duplicates and

1111
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:42,279
so it really looks like it's sort of

1112
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:45,010
almost in a new interaction between the

1113
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,960
nucleus mitochondria so that is an

1114
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:49,240
example of that in terms of like

1115
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,389
proteins working together I make an hour

1116
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:55,119
particular example so I didn't go into

1117
00:42:52,389 --> 00:42:57,159
it today but because this jeans like

1118
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:00,400
worried me so much as it messed up my

1119
00:42:57,159 --> 00:43:02,619
gos results I came up with a way along

1120
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,019
with a PhD student of using a mitotic

1121
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:06,909
immune to genome Eliminator line some of

1122
00:43:05,019 --> 00:43:10,090
you may have heard of this nhp line from

1123
00:43:06,909 --> 00:43:12,579
the sun-eater to eliminate the nuclear

1124
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:14,230
genome an aggressive mutation into

1125
00:43:12,579 --> 00:43:17,519
multiple so the cosmic background so i

1126
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:20,019
made a diary of nuclear cytoplasmic

1127
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:21,909
combinations complete reciprocal dying

1128
00:43:20,019 --> 00:43:25,239
and I included this persistent in tight

1129
00:43:21,909 --> 00:43:27,609
and works perfectly fine all of her side

1130
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:30,549
selfies so the reason my physiological

1131
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:32,860
basis for at least no evidence for

1132
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:34,420
physiological basis for this association

1133
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,789
between the core class and meticulous

1134
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:39,099
what we're looking at what I argue we're

1135
00:43:36,789 --> 00:43:41,469
looking at is a statistical association

1136
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:42,969
look at this genotype occurred is

1137
00:43:41,469 --> 00:43:45,279
neutrogena fight occurred with this

1138
00:43:42,969 --> 00:43:47,500
floor class which we've got resistant to

1139
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,210
the herbicide arose in frequency due to

1140
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:51,519
selective advantage in plastic near

1141
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:52,869
habitat along the railway tracks got to

1142
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:54,699
a very much you can see the Selective

1143
00:43:52,869 --> 00:43:57,309
pressure is no longer there it's

1144
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:58,669
occurring mixed stands but the damage so

1145
00:43:57,309 --> 00:44:01,340
to speak is already being done

1146
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:03,079
it has done the H i think it is now at a

1147
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,760
very high frequency it has had the

1148
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:07,519
benefit of being close to be associated

1149
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:09,050
with this corpus which is why i argue

1150
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:11,570
against connecticut hiking in the fact

1151
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:14,000
that they're identical the nuclear

1152
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:15,710
