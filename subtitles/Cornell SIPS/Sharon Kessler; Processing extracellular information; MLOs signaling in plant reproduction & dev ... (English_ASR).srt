1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,359
This is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,320
University. All right. So, um, today I'm

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,919
going to be talking to you about two

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,280
different parts of development. So, I'm

5
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,000
going to talk about things happening in

6
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:20,079
the flower and things happening in root

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,920
hairs. So, that hasn't made it onto our

8
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,159
website yet, but we've been thinking

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,000
about root hairs a lot in the past

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,480
couple of years.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,160
Um, so first I want to talk so what

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,278
you'll notice is when I have a flower up

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,799
here that means I'm talking about

14
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,600
reflection and when there's a root I'm

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:38,199
talking about below ground stuff. So my

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,640
first lab is communication in plant

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,399
reproduction. And um probably I don't

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,439
need to tell most of you here but what

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,719
happens is we have pollen lands on a

20
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:49,599
stigma. There's communication between

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,840
the pollen and the pill. If it's a

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,640
compatible interaction, a tip growing

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,520
pollen tube will grow and then it needs

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,359
to make its way to the ovules which

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,199
contain the female gitapytes. Um, and

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,079
during this process, there's a lot of

27
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:08,640
intercellular communication occurring as

28
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,158
this pollen tube encounters various

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,359
different cell types. I think it's six

30
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,760
or seven different types of cells. Um

31
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,840
the pollen its whole purpose in life is

32
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,000
to carry the two sperm cells to the

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,719
female gamitaphyte so that double

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,359
fertilization can occur to make the um

35
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,359
embryo and the

36
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,879
endosperm. Um and the female gamitaphyte

37
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,719
also has these specialized cells called

38
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:36,000
synergis. And synergis are my favorite

39
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:38,239
cells. So they're hloid cells. um

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,920
they're not gametes, but they're in

41
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:44,319
charge of telling the pollen tube what

42
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,640
to do when it reaches its target. Okay,

43
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,559
so we basically have two highly

44
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,519
polarized cells that need to talk to

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,280
each other during pollen tube reception.

46
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:58,319
And so we have tip growing

47
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:03,040
oops tip growing pollen tubes

48
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:05,599
um that grow by adding material new cell

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,439
wall material and new membrane only to

50
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:13,120
the tip. So they don't get wider but

51
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:17,318
they get longer. And then inside ovules

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,319
um we have these synergs

53
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:27,439
um that are also highly polarized

54
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:30,000
cells. It's the stick. Um and we can see

55
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,000
here the two synerggets. Here's the egg

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,080
and the central cell. And these

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,360
synerggets have a highly specialized

58
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:41,680
region called the bilopform apparatus.

59
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,080
So this filifform apparatus. So this is

60
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,959
a scanning blockbased SEM through an

61
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,760
ovule showing the two synergs. Here's

62
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,800
the egg central cells back here. And we

63
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,919
can see there's um dark material here.

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,200
This is a membrane rich

65
00:02:54,919 --> 00:03:01,839
region. And if we segment this

66
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,598
um we can see that it it's um looks like

67
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,800
fingers that project up into the

68
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,799
cytoplasm of the synergy cell. And this

69
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,959
is where all the action takes place in

70
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:16,480
the communication between the

71
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:18,640
synergy pollen tube. Um, and we know

72
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,318
that communication is very important

73
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,759
from some studies that were done by

74
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:27,359
Higashyama and Hamura back in 2008 where

75
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:31,598
they took a ovule of terinia and placed

76
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,080
it on pollen tube growth media and then

77
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:37,119
they germinated. They had a pistol over

78
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,879
there and let pollen tubes come out. And

79
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,519
what the scientist is doing is moving

80
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,679
the ovule away. And what I hope you can

81
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,280
notice is the pollen tube is following

82
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,959
the ovule. And this suggests that the

83
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,840
ovule specifically these two synergs are

84
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,158
emitting molecules that then the pollen

85
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,000
tube has a receptor for and the pollen

86
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,079
tube can change its growth direction in

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,759
response to signals from the female

88
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,760
gitaphyte.

89
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:07,280
um Picosiana's lab um identified these

90
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,239
signals and they're actually small

91
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,000
cysteine rich peptides that they named

92
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,400
bur and then the pollen tube receptors

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,238
for these slurs

94
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,680
also. So that's first indication that

95
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,599
synergies are really important for

96
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,600
telling the pollen tube what to do.

97
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,879
Um second um in this study this was done

98
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,960
in Ulu Genlaus's lab by Queen Yo who was

99
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,918
another postoc when I was there and what

100
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:34,239
we have here are two synergas expressing

101
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,399
calcium reporters and then we have a

102
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,519
arriving pollen tube this is a minute

103
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:42,000
timer and I hope you can see and red

104
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,439
means high calcium blue is low as the

105
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,439
pollen tube starts to talk to the

106
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,199
synergs we get these calcium

107
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,120
oscillations happening in the two

108
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:53,680
synergs also So calcium levels increase

109
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,199
greatly in the tip of the pollen tube.

110
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,680
And in this case, after about 40

111
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,560
minutes, the pollen tube then starts to

112
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:05,240
grow again and it gets up near the top

113
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:09,038
and burst to release sperm

114
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:11,600
cells. The second synerg stays alive and

115
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:14,079
it acts as a backup. So it can attract a

116
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,400
second pollen tube by sending out lures

117
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,000
again to get another pollen tube to come

118
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,719
if the two sperm cells from the first

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,519
one can't use. So then the same process

120
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,120
can repeat itself. And recently a group

121
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:29,599
in China showed if both tries don't work

122
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,478
then the central cell can also send out

123
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,199
a signal and attract another pollen tube

124
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:37,439
to try yet again. So the plant really

125
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,080
wants pollination double fertilization

126
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,800
to occur.

127
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,959
So when I was a posttock in the gross

128
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,079
lab, we were taking a genetic approach

129
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:51,198
to try to understand um the molecular

130
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:54,279
recognition of fallen tube synergid

131
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:58,840
communication which we call

132
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:58,839
um fallen tube reception.

133
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:06,478
um and two and so mutants on the female

134
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,800
side that disrupt this process, they can

135
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,399
still attract a pollen tube, but the

136
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,759
pollen tube doesn't burst. So, it

137
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:13,758
doesn't get the signal it's okay to

138
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,759
release the sperm cells. Instead, it

139
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,639
keeps growing around and around. So, the

140
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,879
first mutant discovered was feronia, and

141
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,879
this encodes a receptor like kynise.

142
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,199
It's expressed in synerg, but it's also

143
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:28,079
expressed throughout the plant um in

144
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,240
most cells except for pollen.

145
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,079
Um but its gamophetic phenotype is that

146
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,639
if you have a hetererozygous feronium

147
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,879
mutant half of the ovules will remain

148
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,000
unfertilized because the polyry doesn't

149
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:42,240
get the signal to burst. Um when I was a

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,560
postto I was working on a second mutant

151
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,400
which we named Nordia. These are named

152
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:52,079
after Ruskin goddesses ofility. That's

153
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:54,560
not me naming them. Um but this one was

154
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,318
really interesting. So similar phenotype

155
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,759
pollen tube overgrowth. pollen tube

156
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,800
pollen tube doesn't get the signal to

157
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,199
burst. Um, in some ovules the palm tube

158
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,000
can burst. So it's not an all or none

159
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,800
like the feronia phenotype. Um, and so

160
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,240
we see lower levels of infertility than

161
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,879
in fonia.

162
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:17,199
Um it's also shown um in Ulie's lab in B

163
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,519
study that the those calcium

164
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,520
oscillations if you quantify them we can

165
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,279
see in wild type we can see in both the

166
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,680
receptive synergy and the non-receptive

167
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,598
synergids we have these calcium

168
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,079
oscillations

169
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:32,959
um and we also have it in the pollen

170
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:35,758
tube as well and then after the pollen

171
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:38,000
tube burst um we see the pawn tube's

172
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:42,400
dead now and then also the receptive

173
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,079
synergid the and or the receptor synergy

174
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:48,159
will die and then the other synerg stays

175
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:50,000
alive. In feronium mutants, those

176
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,960
oscillations don't occur at all and

177
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,560
either the receptive or non-receptive

178
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:57,198
synergid. But in Nordia mutants, they

179
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,759
occur, but they're at a lower amplitude.

180
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,478
So the idea was that the reason why

181
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,400
Nordia mutants aren't an all ornone

182
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,478
phenotype is that sometimes

183
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:08,478
stochastically you get enough calcium

184
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,639
oscillation that then the pollen tube

185
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,279
gets triggered to burst.

186
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,360
Okay.

187
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:18,000
So from all this and from work that

188
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:22,319
several labs have done there's a model

189
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,279
that we have feronia and and a a GPI

190
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:28,400
anchored protein called laureli that are

191
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:32,000
found at this film apparatus and they

192
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:35,199
act as a co-ceptor for Ralph peptides

193
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,360
from the arriving pollen tube and this

194
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,759
co-ceptor then triggers a signal

195
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,240
transduction cascade which leads to

196
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,918
calcium oscillations in the synergy

197
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,879
Um and then I'm going to talk a little

198
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:49,079
bit more about this Nordia NTA and what

199
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,679
happens to it during this

200
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,360
process. Okay. So how does Nordia

201
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,319
control the amplitude of synergic

202
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,759
calcium

203
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,680
oscillations? So Nordia is actually an

204
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:02,720
MLO protein. This stands for milder

205
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:06,000
resistance locus O. Um the arabidopsis

206
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,240
genome has 15 members of this family and

207
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,480
all of them are predicted to have seven

208
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,839
transmembrane domains.

209
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,839
um and a big extra extracellular loop.

210
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,120
Um there's two cyines that make a

211
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,959
dulfide predict a d sulfide bond here

212
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,679
and then this cyine and this cysteine

213
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:26,319
make another bulfide bond in the c

214
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,719
terminal tail. There's a calm modulin

215
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,399
binding

216
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,320
domain. Um malo proteins have been

217
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,159
popping up a lot lately. So they were

218
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,640
originally discovered in the context of

219
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,639
powdery mildew infection. So they were

220
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:41,199
discovered in barley and if you have a

221
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,080
barley malo mutant the plant becomes

222
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,000
completely resistant to powdery mildew

223
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,480
infection. Later it was found that clay

224
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,399
five malos and arabidopsis play the same

225
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,560
role. So a triple mutant becomes

226
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,360
completely resistant. Single mutants

227
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,919
have lesser degrees of resistance. Um

228
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,360
nordia is involved in pollen tube

229
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:02,319
reception. And then there's another four

230
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,879
mls 159 and 15. If you knock all of them

231
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,560
out, the pollen tubes burst early, so

232
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:11,720
they can't maintain their

233
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:14,399
integrity. Um, the MLO disease um

234
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,360
phenotypes are conserved across monocots

235
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,440
and died. So basically any plant that

236
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,680
gets infected by powdery mildew, if you

237
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,680
can find the right MLO and knock it out,

238
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,199
then the plant becomes resistant. So

239
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,439
this means that we don't know what those

240
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,278
MLOs's are actually doing for the plant,

241
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,800
but the powdery mildew takes advantage

242
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:34,799
of them. Um we also showed back when um

243
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,359
I was a posttock in collaboration with

244
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:40,679
Ralph Pensrugo's lab that feronia

245
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,959
mutants so the receptor mutants are also

246
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:45,078
resistant. So this gave us this idea

247
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,679
that there's conserved

248
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:50,239
pathways. Um and so we have powdery

249
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,078
mildew are a tip growing cell that must

250
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,320
communicate with and penetrate make

251
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:58,159
a interaction with a plant cell. Pollen

252
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,920
tubes are also tip growing cells. they

253
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,719
must communicate with the female

254
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:05,759
gamitaphyte to deliver the sperm cells.

255
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:09,120
And in both cases um it was shown that

256
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:12,240
malo proteins actually accumulate they

257
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,360
become polarly localized to the site of

258
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,519
tip growing cell

259
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:21,200
communication and nordia also does this.

260
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:23,679
So before pollen tube arrival um nordia

261
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,278
is localized in the golgi and then when

262
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,319
a pollen tube arrives there's signaling

263
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:30,078
that moves it to that

264
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,640
polaratus and we can see that here. So

265
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:34,479
these are

266
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:37,199
synergs before a pollen tube arrives we

267
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:41,039
see these punctate pattern um which with

268
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,600
complete overlap with GG and then when a

269
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:47,399
pollen tube arrives we can see this

270
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,000
starts to accumulate um at that filorm

271
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,639
apparatus. Okay so we wanted to take a

272
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,559
closer look at this accumulation. So

273
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,199
what we used was a semi-invivo pollen

274
00:11:54,559 --> 00:12:00,719
tube guidance and reception essay that

275
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,360
had been developed by Lelayor Bovida and

276
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,600
Ravi Ponu and several other groups in

277
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,839
the plant reproduction field and the

278
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,159
idea is that you can germinate pollen on

279
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,720
media and it'll make a pollen tube but

280
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:14,719
those pollen tubes can't be attractive

281
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:17,440
to so what we need to do is to apply

282
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,600
pollen to a stigma give it a few hours

283
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,680
to grow through and then we cut the

284
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,240
stigma we can put it on media and

285
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,559
arrange of ovules around. So then we can

286
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,759
follow what happens to the pollen tubes

287
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:32,159
and what happens to our nordia protein

288
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,319
during pollen tube reception. So here's

289
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,879
a live movie of this and if you watch

290
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,360
this ovule right here we can see when

291
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:42,360
the pollen tube approaches we see a

292
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,278
shift in the

293
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,800
geop. So that was exciting. Um but we

294
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:50,720
didn't know if that was a cause or a

295
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:53,599
consequence. Um, and so Jing, my former

296
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,160
PhD student, did a lot of live imaging.

297
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,040
So we have a DS red labeled pollen tube

298
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,958
and then we have Nordia GFP. And I hope

299
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:03,519
you're can be convinced that we see a

300
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,599
shift in the signal. Um, we can look at

301
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,480
time here and we see that this actually

302
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,519
happens um starts to happen as soon as

303
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,839
the PL tube makes contact arrives at the

304
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,159
synergist.

305
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,639
Um at this point we wanted to test

306
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:21,199
whether this was required for pollen

307
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,959
tube reception and so we took advantage

308
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,600
of an earlier study we had done where we

309
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,278
expressed different MLOs's under synergy

310
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,399
specific promoters to see if they could

311
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:33,120
complement the media phenotype and we

312
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,159
came upon one of the MLOs's MLO1 that

313
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,879
actually constitutively goes to the one

314
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:41,439
expressed in synergype

315
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,559
[Music]

316
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,639
um but we thought we could take

317
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:47,278
advantage of this to try to do some

318
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,919
domain swaps to manipulate nordia

319
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,000
accumulation patterns. Um and I should

320
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,559
also mention in epidermal cells, so this

321
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,039
is in tobacco transient expression,

322
00:13:54,559 --> 00:14:00,638
Nordia goes to Golgi and Emilo one goes

323
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:02,639
to So we did a bunch of domain swaps and

324
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,360
we found that the C terminal cytoplasmic

325
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:09,600
tail was sufficient to make Nordia and

326
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,240
Nordia chimeic protein accumulate mostly

327
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,759
at the film apparatus. And then we

328
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,680
tested whether this could complement the

329
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,519
Nordia mutant phenotype and it

330
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:18,879
complements um just fine. So I'm going

331
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,360
to show a lot of these graphs. We have

332
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,480
percent unfertilized ovules. Sometimes

333
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,680
it will be percent ovules with pollen

334
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,560
overgrowth. And we can see in Nordia in

335
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:31,439
this experiment it was about 40ome

336
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:33,359
percent. And our Nordia MLO1 was able to

337
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,600
complement. So that meant it wasn't

338
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,440
dangerous to have it there early. One

339
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,519
hypothesis was maybe it's poisonous and

340
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,760
it needs to stay out of that region

341
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:46,320
until it's necessary. that did not seem

342
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:49,838
to be the case. Okay. Um we also knew

343
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,920
that feronia itself is required for this

344
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,440
trafficking of Nordia to the filiper

345
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:58,958
apparatus. So in feronia mutants nordia

346
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,360
stays in the gg. It doesn't go.

347
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:04,159
So the obvious question was can we take

348
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,199
our constitutively filiperitis localized

349
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:09,879
nordia which we now call

350
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:12,719
FAordia can that complement the feronia

351
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:16,320
phenotype. So we did this experiment. So

352
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,240
that's faordia. This is regular nordia

353
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,399
and we put it in a feronia background

354
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,799
which has 80 to 90% infertility and we

355
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,480
can see we start to see seeds

356
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:28,719
developing. We can quantify that. So

357
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,839
bonia here this is a homozygous bonia

358
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,000
mutant with 80% infertility. We can

359
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,720
complement the phenotype um to about

360
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,799
half using

361
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:42,000
our so and we can also check pawn tube

362
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,919
overgrowth is the same thing. So yeah we

363
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,159
can actually bypass a very important

364
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,559
signal transduction pathway by just

365
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:51,759
moving a protein to the place in the

366
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:54,078
cell where it needs to do its action. Um

367
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,399
and also we showed that bronia is not

368
00:15:54,078 --> 00:16:00,278
necessary for Nordia to perform its

369
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:02,639
function or the MLO to perform its

370
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:05,838
function. So at this point we still

371
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,360
didn't know what MLOS stood molecularly.

372
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,839
Um but we came up with what we called

373
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,839
our booster signal

374
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:14,320
hypothesis and that was that feronia was

375
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,279
absolutely required to give a signal

376
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:21,600
that would lead to pollen to bursting.

377
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:24,399
um but also it causes uh trafficking of

378
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,560
Nordia to this filiper apparatus which

379
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,440
then helps to boost the signal to make

380
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:32,919
sure that the ties burst. So if we take

381
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,920
out feronia and just have a a Nordia

382
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:38,958
mutant or and just have Nordia film

383
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:43,759
apparatus the FA Nordia um it's able to

384
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:46,799
to do it do the function. Um so that was

385
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:49,199
our booster signal. Um and somehow we

386
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:51,879
also think that veronia either by

387
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:54,399
increasing calcium leads to this

388
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:57,000
trafficking or it's directly somehow

389
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,600
intersecting and causing Nordia

390
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,078
trafficking. Okay. So the question was

391
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,880
what are signals X and Y from Veronia

392
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:08,159
and Nordia? Are they the same molecule?

393
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,400
And for this um we went back to we and

394
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,959
others went back to this this

395
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:17,160
observation that in Nordia mutants the

396
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,839
calcium oscillations occur at lower

397
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,439
intensity and Shang Lewan's group in

398
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:24,000
2022

399
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,400
um tested the hypothesis that maybe are

400
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,038
actually calcium channels and so they

401
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,000
took all 15 arabidopsis malos expressed

402
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:34,798
them in cost seven animal cells and they

403
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,798
found some of them could conduct calcium

404
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:40,960
um but Nordia couldn't and Malo1

405
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:43,759
couldn't. Um then they took advantage um

406
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,600
so then they took a closer look at where

407
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:48,960
these proteins were going in the cost 7

408
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:52,159
cells and Nordia GFP actually looks in a

409
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,279
pattern very similar to Golgi. Um but if

410
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,160
they co-expressed with feronian laureli

411
00:17:55,279 --> 00:18:00,240
the protein would go to the plasma

412
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:02,960
membrane or if they used our faordia

413
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,519
construct um the protein would would

414
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,880
start to also

415
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:09,279
appear. So that's that and then they

416
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,679
tested whether the plasma membrane

417
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:15,759
localization of nordia or faordia would

418
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:18,720
lead to calcium um in intake into the

419
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:22,160
cells and indeed it did. So the

420
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,919
conclusion was um malos or maybe calcium

421
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,519
channels they need to be a plasma in the

422
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,559
membrane to do their job. Okay. So now

423
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:33,119
we know um Nordia X downstream of

424
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:35,839
feronia it regulates calcium influx into

425
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,839
the synergists. Um another question

426
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:40,159
we're trying to answer in my lab is how

427
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:43,359
do those calcium oscillations in the

428
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,880
synergists lead to pollen tube rupture?

429
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:48,079
Stay tuned. That's a really hard

430
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,480
question to answer. Um, but we think it

431
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,879
might actually be related to not what's

432
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,558
going on in this cell and this cell, but

433
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,720
what's actually going on. So maybe we're

434
00:18:55,558 --> 00:19:00,960
depleting calcium outside the cells and

435
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,720
that's allowing cell wall changes to

436
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,919
occur that are then going to let that

437
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,200
pollen burst. Okay, now I'm going to

438
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,679
change gears a little bit. We're going

439
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,600
to go underground. Um, so how many

440
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,240
people in this room had heard of Feronia

441
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:16,959
before I mentioned it in this talk?

442
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,720
Yeah, it's pretty famous now. um its

443
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,120
first first publication was that it's

444
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,960
involved in pollen tube reception and

445
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:26,079
since then it's been implicated in a lot

446
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,880
of different things. So immunity

447
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:33,199
um not just the powdery mildew but also

448
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:36,000
bacterial immunity um cell growth stress

449
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,080
responses morphagenesis

450
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,480
um cell wall mechanical integrity it's

451
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:42,558
been proposed to be a cell wall sensor

452
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,120
and so we made a hypothesis that maybe

453
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:47,678
there was a conserved signaling module

454
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:50,159
where feronia activates an MLO

455
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,360
downstream and this helps cells to

456
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:56,000
communicate with their external

457
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:58,558
environments. Um so what we did is we

458
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,759
took our FA Nordia GFP which is a gain

459
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:03,599
of function channel and we expressed it

460
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:04,879
this time with the feronia promoter. So

461
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,279
it would be expressed everywhere where

462
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,080
feronia would be expressed and also with

463
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:12,480
the 35S strong promoter that would be

464
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,558
active in sporidic excels. And then we

465
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,519
tested what phenotypes of bronia could

466
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:20,079
we complement with epordia. And so first

467
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,639
we looked at just our

468
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:25,279
uh pollen tube reception phenotype that

469
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,159
we had studied using a synergy specific

470
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:31,759
promoter mid98. And we found that both

471
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,360
the feronia um promoter-driven faia

472
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:34,119
could complement at about the same level

473
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,918
as

474
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:39,399
mid98. But surprisingly the 35S promoter

475
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,679
um construct could complement

476
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:46,159
completely. And the lore had been that

477
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:49,280
35s is not expressed in excels. it

478
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:52,240
actually is sometimes so not all the

479
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,639
time it's a positional effect but 35s

480
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,400
can be active

481
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,799
um the second phenotype that we tested

482
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,400
so it had been shown that so when pollen

483
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:03,440
tubes leave the transmitting tract

484
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,720
usually only one leaves at a time and

485
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,279
this is a there's a feronia mediated

486
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,960
gating mechanism here that sort of opens

487
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:13,839
the gate lets one pollen tube bell and

488
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,679
then recloses it and the phenotype in

489
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,279
feronia plants is that more than one

490
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,600
pollen tubal leaves the transmitting

491
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:23,200
tract at the same time. Sorry, this is

492
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:25,119
getting cut off. That one's fine. Um and

493
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,640
indeed uh this was with an inner

494
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:29,359
specific cross. It also happens with

495
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:33,120
conspecific crosses or FA Nordia could

496
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:35,399
also complement that. So just having an

497
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:39,678
activated MLO channel is

498
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:41,840
enough. Um interspecific uh pol crosses.

499
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,320
So if you cross a rabbidopsis theiana

500
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:47,119
with a rabbidopsis liada um one

501
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:49,359
phenotype is so pollen can germinate on

502
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,119
a stigma send a pollen tube through but

503
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:53,199
in a lot of ovules the pawn tube doesn't

504
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:56,399
get the same reversed

505
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,720
um and if we express epordia or if we

506
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,798
overexpress nordia itself we can

507
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:05,000
actually improve inner specific che in

508
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:08,319
specific crosses

509
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,839
um interestingly in a feronia background

510
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:12,480
this doesn't work anymore

511
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:14,798
So we need feronia for epinordia to be

512
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,360
able to do its job in these inerson

513
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:19,440
processes which is still a mystery.

514
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:23,119
Okay. Finally a lot of people have

515
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:26,640
looked at feronia root phenotypes. Um so

516
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:29,319
feronia roots actually are longer than

517
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,600
wild type roots. This is all in a

518
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:34,639
rabidopsis. Um but the more striking

519
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:37,119
phenotype is that feronia root hairs are

520
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,440
stunted and they often burst early. So

521
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:41,239
they can't maintain their tip integrity.

522
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,720
That phenotype is completely

523
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,880
complemented by expressing FARIA with

524
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,480
either the 35S promoter or with the

525
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:53,360
Feronia promoter. I'm only showing the

526
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:56,798
35S thing here. Um we took a closer look

527
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:59,918
Oh, sorry this looks bad. Um, we took a

528
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:02,400
closer look at Veronia root hairs and

529
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,799
what we saw was that not only do they

530
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,840
burst early, they tend to be more

531
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:11,038
triangular shaped and also we also

532
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:13,519
sometimes see spherical root hairs. So

533
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:16,440
they've completely lost their polarity

534
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:19,558
and those phenotypes um can all be

535
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:22,759
complemented by having our FAordia

536
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:27,440
construct. Also the the if we add

537
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:29,279
faordia the root hairs become more um

538
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,798
less triangular in shape. So this is

539
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:36,960
measuring width over base tip width over

540
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:39,679
base width. And we can see we go back to

541
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,558
um finally another phenotype of feronia

542
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:45,600
is that the plants are dwarfed. Um and

543
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:48,960
that phenotype could not by either

544
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:52,480
feronia driven epordia or

545
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,679
yeah. So from this we conclude that some

546
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,960
but not allianotypes can be

547
00:23:54,679 --> 00:24:00,080
complemented. So pollen tube overgrowth

548
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,640
poly tuby from the septum primary root

549
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:04,240
length abnormal root hair growth but

550
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,799
interpecific pony reception and

551
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,000
vegetative orphasism cannot. So what we

552
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:12,079
think is this with army knife verunia

553
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,880
some of the things it does need calcium

554
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:17,519
downstream and some don't and so the

555
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,760
ones that need calcium we can bypass

556
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:22,319
with with an

557
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:24,679
MLO okay so what about calcium so I told

558
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:27,119
you MLO's are are thought to be calcium

559
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:29,440
channels we know from lots of groups

560
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,199
work that there's a tip focused calcium

561
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,320
gradient that's established after root

562
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,600
hair initiation and it's linked to

563
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:39,759
polarized growth root hairs

564
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:42,158
Um I showed you earlier that we have

565
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:45,519
this calcium gradient or calcium

566
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:49,278
oscillations that occur in synergs upon

567
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:51,440
pollen tube arrival. Um and that this is

568
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,359
also linked to being able to have a

569
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,278
pollen tube that burst and releases its

570
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,278
sperm

571
00:24:54,278 --> 00:25:00,240
cells. So we decided to take a look at

572
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:04,000
what happens to calcium in feronian

573
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,240
fenordia root hairs. So for this we used

574
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,919
um an AR echo marker just because we had

575
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,798
it in the lab. We understand that

576
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,520
chameleon is better. Um but we used

577
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:16,400
light sheet imaging to capture images

578
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:18,960
every 3 seconds for 12 minutes from

579
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,360
growing root hairs. And then we measured

580
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,400
what was happening with calcium at the

581
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:26,399
tip of the root hair. Um here's the

582
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,679
light sheet system. So this allows us to

583
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,559
do sort of 3D

584
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,640
um imaging in time.

585
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:38,158
And here's what we see. And I'm going to

586
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:41,000
need to do this. So in Colombia, you can

587
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:44,320
see these calcium oscillations root

588
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,640
hairs. In Feronia, we can see round

589
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:48,960
spherical root hairs. You can see some

590
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,200
root hairs trying to grow. And then

591
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:55,120
these flashes are root hairs actually

592
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:58,240
bursting. And when we add fayordia back

593
00:25:55,119 --> 00:26:02,479
in, we now recover tip growth and we see

594
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,480
oscillations occurring again.

595
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:10,558
Um, we also

596
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,918
um quantified this and again I'm sorry

597
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:14,639
about the quality of that picture. I

598
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,240
didn't realize it did this. Um, but what

599
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,038
we see is in Colombia, if we just look

600
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,640
at the oscillations, this is from one

601
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:23,919
example. Um, versus Feronia, we see in

602
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,080
Feronia, they get very erratic. Um, so

603
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,159
they're kind of out of control. In the

604
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:32,240
spherical root hairs, we see very little

605
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:34,640
calcium. But if we add back in um 35 SFA

606
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,640
Nordia, we can restore the calcium

607
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:41,440
oscillations pretty much to

608
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:43,440
normal. Um so so that's good, right? So

609
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,919
maybe we're complementing Feronia root

610
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,200
hair phenotypes by restoring the ability

611
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:51,038
to do calcium oscillation. So that FARI

612
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,440
is a synthetic fusion protein. So we as

613
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:56,400
then asked the question, is there an MLO

614
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,320
involved in regulating root hair growth?

615
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,798
And what we did is we looked at some

616
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:04,558
single cell data publicly available and

617
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:07,839
we found that emlo 15 is really specific

618
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:10,678
to root hairs. Um we can zoom in right

619
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:13,918
here. So green is is high expression

620
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:17,519
here. Um and when we look at reporters

621
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:20,400
we can see strong expression of 15 at

622
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:23,759
the tips of root hairs. And if we get an

623
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:26,400
MLO15 mutant, we see dwarfed root hairs.

624
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,839
Um, a phenotype that's similar to

625
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,440
Veronia but a little bit

626
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:35,038
more. So next we looked at root hair

627
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,558
growth in Colombia versus Malo 15. So

628
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:40,000
first number of root hairs doesn't

629
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:43,119
really change um but we see final length

630
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,319
is much shorter. And if we just measure

631
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:49,038
root hairs along a root um from the tip

632
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:51,839
up to the hypocodal, we can get a faux

633
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:56,278
growth curve. And we can see pink here

634
00:27:51,839 --> 00:28:01,278
is Colombia. Blue is emo 15. So it grows

635
00:27:56,278 --> 00:28:03,558
less. And our malo 15 GFP can complement

636
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:05,839
and maybe even get longer root

637
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:09,759
hairs. Okay.

638
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:13,278
And we can also show um that MLO15 root

639
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:15,599
hairs shown here in blue grow at roughly

640
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:17,919
half the rate of wild type and they're

641
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,678
very similar to feronian root hairs that

642
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:24,559
are still maintaining growth haven't

643
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:26,720
burst yet. Okay, run out of time. Um so

644
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:28,240
question is does 15 subellular

645
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,798
localization change during different

646
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,759
stages of root hair

647
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:36,240
growth? Um like like we see with Nordia.

648
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:38,558
So here's some light sheet with um

649
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,640
envelope 15 GFP. We can see it's very

650
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:42,240
tip

651
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,640
localized. Um if we look more closely we

652
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,200
can see it's not there yet during root

653
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,679
hair initiation and then it comes on

654
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,840
once the bulge starts to be made and

655
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,320
then it seems to be being trafficked

656
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:56,319
down to the

657
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:58,079
tip. Um, we also see if we look at old

658
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:00,960
root hairs that have already stopped

659
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:04,439
growing, we it seems to be that the GFP

660
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:07,679
signal gets sequestered maybe in the

661
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,679
GI. So the idea is that once growth is

662
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,640
no longer needed, you don't need MLO to

663
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:16,480
be there at the tip. So then it gets

664
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:19,278
endocytos. Okay. So last question, does

665
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,440
Malo 15 also affect calcium dynamics in

666
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:25,519
root hairs? So we did the same

667
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:28,480
experiment. We used Colombia 15 and then

668
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:31,839
a 35S MLO15 construct that complemented

669
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,240
the MLO5 mutant phenotype. And just

670
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:37,359
roughly at first we could see okay MLO

671
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,599
15 root hairs seem to have dimmer signal

672
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:44,479
but this is not a ratio. So we looked

673
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:49,359
also at patterns and in wild type we see

674
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:52,480
a frequency that's at this about 0.0

675
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:57,599
um four in Colombia. So that's every 25

676
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:59,839
seconds there's a peak um in 35s 15 this

677
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:01,798
gets completely deregulated and we've

678
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:04,558
got peaks all over the place different

679
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:06,200
frequencies and then we recover it back

680
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:10,158
to almost the same

681
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:13,440
frequency express it. So this so from

682
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,760
this we made a model that somehow during

683
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,278
root hair tip growth again we have

684
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:19,519
feronia

685
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:22,240
um acting to control what's happening

686
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:24,240
and maintaining tip integrity

687
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,679
um probably there's other calcium

688
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,278
channels also involved in setting up um

689
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,399
calcium gradients that's been shown

690
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:35,278
several CGC channels are involved and

691
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:38,558
then maybe the MLO's again are acting to

692
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:40,558
boost that um signal and then we've also

693
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:43,200
also got some data I'm not going to talk

694
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:46,000
about but that we can also recover

695
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:51,480
reactive oxygen species accumulation in

696
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:54,880
root hairs by just um adding in a nordia

697
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,480
construct. Okay. So to conclude we have

698
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,039
signal mediated trafficking of the

699
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,038
emiloprotein nordia from the golgi to

700
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:03,440
the film apparatus during pollen tube

701
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:06,000
reception. This increases calcium

702
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,558
transport into synurgids and mediates

703
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,798
signaling that leads to proper

704
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:13,599
communication and pollen tube rupture to

705
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:15,558
release sperm cells. Um feronia

706
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:20,199
signaling is required for nordia

707
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:24,319
trafficking. Um but epordia and bypass

708
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:26,159
feronia in both synurges and in roots.

709
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:30,480
Um and finally we've discovered a new

710
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:32,039
function for an inflow m 15 in um tip

711
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,240
growth in root

712
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:36,640
hairs. So I just want to leave you with

713
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,880
a couple of thoughts here. Got a couple

714
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,840
of minutes I think. Um so what we think

715
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,000
is maybe these mllows are kind of acting

716
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:47,839
like the volume knob on an oldfashioned

717
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,880
radio, right? So so you you set your AM

718
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:53,199
or FM

719
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,720
um band and then you tune in to a

720
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,960
station, right? So that's maybe what

721
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,278
Baron is doing. It's helping to tune it

722
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,759
in and then we have these MLOs's that

723
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:03,519
are then able to like to turn up the

724
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:05,679
volume so that you get the proper

725
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,480
response happening. Why would you want

726
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:11,919
to do this? Right? So especially in

727
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,440
pollination and reception um you want to

728
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,200
make sure that if you've got the right

729
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,960
pollen tube you want to really ensure

730
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,759
that it's going to burst. And so

731
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:24,159
synerg arrives they're lur factories. So

732
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:26,319
they're pumping out these attractants

733
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,080
and then when the pollen tube arrives

734
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,798
they need to stop attracting and they

735
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:33,519
need to switch to reception mode. And so

736
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:36,319
you could imagine um if you don't have

737
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:38,798
the right lians the Ralphs that are

738
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,240
going to trigger feronia then the ovule

739
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:42,480
doesn't want to waste time in that

740
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,120
pollen tube. However, if it has the

741
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,960
right lians it wants to make sure that

742
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:49,119
that pollen tube will deliver its sperm

743
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,000
cells. So I think that's part of this

744
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:53,839
signal mediated track. So let's let's

745
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,599
keep it at a level where we can kind of

746
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:57,119
trigger it, but then once it gets

747
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:59,519
triggered, we really want to make sure

748
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:01,759
it happens. And maybe in the inner

749
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,599
specific crosses, what's happening

750
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:05,720
that's causing pollen tube overgrowth is

751
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:08,000
that there's just not quite enough

752
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:10,120
triggering and it doesn't reach the

753
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:15,599
thresholds that then the

754
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:17,759
epordia do its job. Okay. Um root hairs

755
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:20,038
similar deal, right? You want to keep a

756
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:23,200
balance. too much calcium is bad as too

757
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:26,558
little. Um, and maybe modulating these

758
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,360
MLOs's helps to sort of keep things

759
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:31,000
moving in the right

760
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:33,678
direction. All

761
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,319
right. Um, want to leave you with one

762
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,640
more thought. So there are actually 17

763
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:40,439
feronial like genes in rabbidopsis. So

764
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,240
most species these are big gene

765
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:46,240
families. Um, there's 15

766
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:48,720
malos. Um, lots of these now have

767
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,240
functions assigned to them. MLOS's were

768
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:55,038
working on filling out this this what

769
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,558
functions are for all of these. Um but I

770
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:59,119
think it's interesting to think about

771
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:01,918
especially with plant reproduction. So

772
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:04,678
so far seven feronial like genes have

773
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:08,398
been implicated um in places like the

774
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:10,838
stigma pollen tube tip growth um in the

775
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:13,838
transmitting tract and at pollen tube

776
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:16,398
reception. Um and four MLOs's have been

777
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:19,480
implicated on the pollen tube side. So

778
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:24,398
with pollen tube tip growth

779
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:26,599
um and pollen tube reception. So we also

780
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:29,199
think there's more malos

781
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:32,720
involved places. So I think this is a

782
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:34,559
really interesting um conservation. Um

783
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,959
and here I list some of these the genes

784
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,878
that have been found. And I think if

785
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,199
you're thinking about any process where

786
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:43,838
cells are talking to their external

787
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:46,559
environment, um often there's calcium

788
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:48,639
involved in this and and I think having

789
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:52,559
this ability to to work on the volume

790
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,800
knob um maybe has great advantages for

791
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,320
plant

792
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,320
cells. Okay. So with that, I'd like to

793
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,680
thank the main people who did this work.

794
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,838
So um Jen and Yan did the early work

795
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:06,719
with the live imaging of voluntary

796
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:10,000
reception. Um, Yan did all the faordia

797
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:11,679
and synergas and then Sienna um did all

798
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,920
the root hair stuff. So we had never

799
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:16,239
worked on roots in my lab. She figured

800
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,000
it out. She went to Chris Digger's lab,

801
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:20,919
learned how to use the light sheet and

802
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,159
calcium stuff. And she's finishing her

803
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:26,079
Phy this spring

804
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:28,159
and was slow to look for postocs. So if

805
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,720
anybody wants a really great postto,

806
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,559
Sienna's your girl, let me know. And

807
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:34,159
then Somia is a new student in the lab

808
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:38,159
that started a year ago and she's

809
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:40,239
working on um Nordia trafficking and

810
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:42,799
trying to understand how that's working

811
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:44,838
within synergists. And I'd also like to

812
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,119
acknowledge the National Science

813
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:49,519
Foundation. And with that, I can take

814
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,519
any

815
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,880
questions. I'm wondering if you'd be

816
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:59,078
willing to share how your thinking is

817
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:01,160
emerging on the functional

818
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:04,079
uh need for

819
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:06,319
oscillations and the mechanistic basis

820
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:10,039
for oscillation. So, I was just talking

821
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:12,880
about this with Maria. Um, I don't know

822
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:15,519
like is it we, you know, we said is it a

823
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,519
red herring, right? How how do we is it

824
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:19,400
really needed? At least in pollen tube

825
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:21,800
reception, if you damp down those

826
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,320
oscillations, the pollen tube doesn't

827
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,800
burst. So, we do know something's going

828
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,559
on, but like I said, we're now starting

829
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,960
to lean more to it's what's happening

830
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:34,799
outside the cell than what's inside. Um

831
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,679
yeah and I'm still I don't think the

832
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,599
field really

833
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:42,559
knows but we do know in in Fonia we do

834
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:45,440
see these really aarent oscillations

835
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:48,880
which is very bad for root hair

836
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:52,280
correlates with bad um outcomes for root

837
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:55,358
hoops. Yet another do the

838
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:57,640
oscillations function like a thermostat

839
00:36:55,358 --> 00:37:00,239
that the oscillation itself isn't so

840
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:02,519
important but you're trying to get a

841
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:06,078
certain amplitude

842
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:08,119
possible. So um so the question is do do

843
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,640
the oscillations function like a

844
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:12,838
thermostat and Mark Johnson's lab at

845
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:15,679
Brown University they did a bunch of

846
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:18,480
interpecific crosses

847
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:20,399
um looking at synergas and oscillation

848
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,119
patterns. So some of them the pollen

849
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,960
tubes could make it and then they don't

850
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:29,000
burst. They didn't see any correlation

851
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:32,000
between frequency or amplitude and the

852
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,559
ability to receive the volunte. So we

853
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,119
know they need to happen but I don't

854
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:38,400
know it was kind of disappointing. We

855
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,559
all thought oh this is going to be the

856
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:44,160
thing. Um but yeah it's good

857
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:45,838
mystery just hey that was that was that

858
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:47,319
was a great presentation. So thinking

859
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:49,440
about the bursting

860
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,480
mechanism, I can imagine there could be

861
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,320
it could be that you get perturbed cell

862
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,719
deposition growth and so t pressure

863
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:02,240
blows it open or it could be cell

864
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:04,959
degrading enzymes from the Yeah. So or

865
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:08,078
both. Would do you have any any idea as

866
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,199
to how that operates? No. So I mean

867
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:15,039
people think that so there's a

868
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:18,879
similar binia like K Ralph stuff there's

869
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:21,679
a paracrine signaling and so people

870
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,079
think okay that gets disrupted

871
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:26,440
um but what's weird to me is the pawn

872
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:29,920
tube drives up

873
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:32,358
stops and then there's communication and

874
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,519
then it doesn't just burst it grows

875
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:36,358
again and then

876
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:40,639
bursts and

877
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:43,078
So they're still intact enough to allow

878
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:45,679
that last growth

879
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:47,880
phase. I'd like to hear your opinions as

880
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:52,399
a cell wall person.

881
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:54,519
Um but yeah, I mean it could be that

882
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:58,519
degrading enzymes are

883
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:58,519
activated somehow.

884
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:02,239
Um

885
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:10,400
yeah from that then what what happens to

886
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,760
the film membrane is this burst open

887
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,559
too. So the filerm apparatus um the

888
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,800
gicost lab has showed so it's

889
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:21,440
invaginated

890
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:25,119
membrane and it's kind of as the palm

891
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:27,200
tube grows in it expands like a glove

892
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,079
like a balloon right or like sticking

893
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:33,039
your hand in a glove. So part of it

894
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:37,599
could be you need to change calcium

895
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:39,759
there so that it actually can can loosen

896
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:43,039
somehow and there's little bits of cell

897
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:47,280
wall there. It's not completely covered

898
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:48,960
with cell wall. Um, yeah, old literature

899
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,680
said it entered the synergy and then

900
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,679
burst. That doesn't seem true. Has

901
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:56,000
anybody looked at pH dynamics? Because

902
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:58,239
if you got a drop in pH in a very

903
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,320
localized way, an expansion suddenly

904
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:04,078
active and that's it. There they go.

905
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,960
I'm not aware of anyone doing that. We

906
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,440
tried some in vitro. Yeah. stuff. But we

907
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,440
need to put

908
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:14,800
the extracellular

909
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:17,358
pH that could be a way of achieving

910
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:21,320
extremely localized very rapid or

911
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:21,319
listening at that spot.

912
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:28,000
Let me just wonder about calcium in that

913
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:30,640
that facility. So so calcium comes from

914
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,880
the cell wall right for right. So I kind

915
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:35,118
of wonder whether calcium dynamic at the

916
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,440
tip integration from the cell wall can

917
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:40,000
contribute to the burst or activity of

918
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,639
the enzymes or so it's I mean one

919
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,880
hypothesis is pectin cross linking

920
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:47,679
there's a lot of pectin in two cell

921
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,240
walls so maybe you're depleting I don't

922
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:51,719
know if it would be enough to deplete

923
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:56,399
and then

924
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:56,399
cause changes in cell wall

925
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,039
sure that be part of

926
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:08,400
about how MLS got co-opted for

927
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,960
pathogenesis.

928
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,440
Yeah. What you're saying? Yeah. Okay.

929
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,920
But so how would that happen? They're

930
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,159
modulators.

931
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,240
So yeah. So that's a good right because

932
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:25,920
it's not like a resistance gene. It's a

933
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:30,399
susceptibility factor, right? And so if

934
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:33,200
MLOS's were there during monitoring of

935
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,039
cell integrity and things, right? So you

936
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,879
have

937
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:41,119
Veronius related monitoring cell wall

938
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:44,160
integrity, then bringing in a backup MLO

939
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,960
to turn up the volume. Then maybe

940
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:49,920
somehow that you could imagine that

941
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,000
somehow crossed over to

942
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,000
um pathogens being able to take

943
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
advantage

944
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:04,800
Um it's pretty amazing how ethnicia

945
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,800
complments most of the feronia

946
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,358
defects. Did you see any negative

947
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:13,639
tradeoffs of Yeah. So Margaret's

948
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:17,679
question is are there negative tradeoffs

949
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:20,000
of overexpressing this epordia

950
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:21,598
plants look completely normal. We've

951
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,280
done all kinds of measurements. grows

952
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,760
out size is the same. Everything looks

953
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:30,440
fine. Um, but they do have differential

954
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:34,079
responses to

955
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:36,240
stress. So, salt and drought. We're

956
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:39,720
collaborating with a physiologist in our

957
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:43,000
department to do a bunch of water

958
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:47,480
regulations. So, maybe it the plants are

959
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,679
primed to be able to respond to certain

960
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,800
stresses. Yeah, I was shocked. It's like

961
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:53,118
this is going to mess up the plant.

962
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,039
We're deregulating calcium and it

963
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,280
doesn't. So it just shows you that

964
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:00,000
there's a lot of compensation that can

965
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,240
occur.

966
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,239
On the stress topic, so in your slide

967
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:06,199
you mentioned that foria somehow

968
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:09,679
medulates heavy metal

969
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:12,799
stress and so I kind of wonder um with

970
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:15,838
regard to root hair growth. So iron

971
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,920
deficiency causes root hair growth.

972
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:19,239
Uhhuh. And so I kind of wonder what your

973
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,039
thoughts about like is

974
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:25,199
feronia in war like anything known

975
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:30,400
because I haven't we've not tested it

976
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:34,318
but we could or yeah I mean I think is a

977
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:37,838
weird one. So basically labs have done

978
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:39,759
transcrytoic stuff pull downs any

979
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:42,318
interactor you look at you can find a

980
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:45,760
phenotype that fits what you want to

981
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:48,358
see. Um, so definitely there's some

982
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:51,280
stuff with translation

983
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:53,519
and messenger RNA processing. I don't

984
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,519
think that stuff is going to be

985
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:59,358
complemented with an MLO with that being

986
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:00,719
pretty fun. Um, but yeah, there's a some

987
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:03,440
stuff in the literature I'm not sure

988
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:06,559
about, but it' be it's very easy for us

989
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,559
to test. We could test

990
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:13,439
that. Oh, one more thing. I also have an

991
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,358
open postoc position for at least a

992
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,679
year. If anyone's interested, please let

993
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:20,159
me know. Could you check online if any

994
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:23,480
question over there?

995
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:23,480
No questions.

996
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:29,239
Thanks, Sharon.
