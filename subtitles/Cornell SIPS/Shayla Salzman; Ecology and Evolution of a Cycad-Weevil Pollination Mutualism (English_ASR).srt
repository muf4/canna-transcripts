1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,279
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:11,490
University let's see if this microphone

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:14,638
works okay Thank You Chelsea I always

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,350
tell everyone that I the moment I first

5
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:17,939
heard of Psych has changed my life and

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,980
this is the first time I get to say this

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,330
in the room with Chelsea the I first

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,699
heard of psych heads in her plant

9
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:25,528
morphology course at UC Berkeley and she

10
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,640
said at the end of that she was talking

11
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:27,599
about all the different amazing things

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,830
that I'm gonna tell you about about

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,570
psych heads and she said if you're more

14
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:32,429
interested you should go read Island of

15
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,590
the colour-blind by Oliver Sacks and I

16
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:37,019
literally stopped on the way home at the

17
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,780
UC Berkeley library which did not have

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,760
it I have to say so we'll have to check

19
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,070
Cornell um and then stopped at the

20
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,589
Berkeley City Library and got that book

21
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,030
that day and it definitely was a change

22
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,460
in my life I have fallen in love with

23
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,629
psych heads ever since my background is

24
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,189
that I've always been interested in

25
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:54,628
plant insect interactions particularly

26
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:55,769
from an agricultural perspective my

27
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:58,108
background is working a lot in

28
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,890
sustainable agriculture before Chelsie

29
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,448
changed my life so it's okay it's great

30
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,769
I think I hope everybody likes that

31
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:09,478
Telsey changed my life so I always like

32
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:11,310
to start with this picture for a number

33
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:12,750
of reasons I think that right off the

34
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,010
bat I'm used to speaking to really

35
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,109
diverse audiences and so their first

36
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,909
question is what is a psych head so I

37
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,989
like this picture because it tells you a

38
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,460
couple important things about the

39
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:22,079
biology of the system psych heads are

40
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:24,269
gymnosperms which I don't have to tell

41
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,069
this room means that they have cones as

42
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:27,868
their reproductive structures and

43
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:29,849
they're also dioecious so the female

44
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:31,680
cones or the ovulate cones are housed on

45
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:33,599
separate plants and the pollen cones or

46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,009
the male cones and Here I am looking at

47
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,129
a female plant and looking at all of

48
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:40,290
these cones but also I love this picture

49
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:42,449
because it tells a story that matters to

50
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,118
me this was at a field season in Florida

51
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,290
that I went with my husband I have you

52
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,328
can see my wedding ring that was

53
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,210
subsequently stolen when I was mugged in

54
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:53,158
Brazil the evolution conference and I

55
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:54,959
think those two things thinking about

56
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,310
relationships and thinking about the

57
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,989
history and the importance of

58
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,629
relationships and thinking about these

59
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:02,728
plants really come together to like give

60
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:04,379
a good introduction to what I'm going to

61
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:07,799
talk about today and really what I talk

62
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:09,538
about always I think that relationships

63
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,430
are inherently interesting to all of us

64
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,378
and I always say that's evidenced by the

65
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,860
success of every ridiculous romantic

66
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:16,319
comedy

67
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,960
we ever made no matter how silly the the

68
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,269
storyline or insane the outcome is and

69
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,920
that makes a lot of sense to me because

70
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,290
we're curious we are innately curious

71
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,519
like to answer questions about these

72
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:28,829
relationships and these are some

73
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,750
examples of movies that I love if none

74
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,250
of you have ever seen this or read the

75
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,069
book this is Lonesome Dove it's an

76
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,439
amazing epic miniseries if you know

77
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:39,120
anything about me deeply this this movie

78
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,159
sort of and book influences my whole

79
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,990
life I have like a handmade purse of

80
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:45,569
Lonesome Dove I love this movie so

81
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:49,350
please all go watch it when you're sick

82
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:50,759
because it's like six hours long so well

83
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:52,139
we're quiet we're curious we're curious

84
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:55,199
about how did we get here and where are

85
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,849
we going how can we help each other how

86
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,530
does this relationship even work and

87
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:00,180
does someone have to change for this

88
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,199
relationship to work these are things

89
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:06,000
that were curious about when we're

90
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:08,189
watching this media depictions of human

91
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,810
relationships but in fact all organisms

92
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,370
engage in a diverse range of

93
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,890
interactions with other organisms

94
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,110
ranging from the obvious predation and

95
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:18,809
pollination or even or bivy even of

96
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,280
highly toxic plants right to some that

97
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,009
are a little less obvious these are

98
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,810
acacia tree panel obeah more Bocelli

99
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:27,269
pandemonium and they're ant mutualist

100
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,400
these plants make these DeMeo that the

101
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:31,469
ants are housed in and in fact on a one

102
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,560
tree will be an entire ant colony that

103
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:37,259
literally protects them from giraffes

104
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,090
and elephants right this is a mutualism

105
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:40,798
that we might not know as much about or

106
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:45,150
this which kind of looks gross two-room

107
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,069
of not insect biologists but these are

108
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,560
butterfly caterpillars butterfly larvae

109
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:51,359
and they are finge eros is that is the

110
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,719
genus name and their entire life is

111
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,880
dependent on host ants finding them in

112
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,680
the wild on the ground finding them and

113
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,109
taking them into their nest where these

114
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,420
guys parasitize the ant colony by being

115
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,370
fed from the ants so this is a highly

116
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:08,000
specialized relationship that the the

117
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:10,829
lineage the evolutionary lineage of this

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,840
organism is dependent on a mutualism a

119
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:15,120
parasitic mutualism and of course

120
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,728
everyone knows this one I'm assuming in

121
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,228
this room with lichen but then I also

122
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:20,430
put this up this 'santa bacteria but

123
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:21,930
really just to say that we're getting

124
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:25,019
more and more knowledge about how

125
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,848
bacteria is important in many ways in

126
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:27,659
our world from changing behavior and

127
00:04:26,848 --> 00:04:31,289
changing diet

128
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:33,840
outcomes but if we wanted to ask those

129
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:35,580
same questions in a biological framework

130
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,679
we might use a little bit more sciency

131
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:40,169
sounding questions we might ask instead

132
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,930
what is the evolutionary trajectory what

133
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:45,030
type of symbiosis are we what mechanisms

134
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,860
work to keep us together and has there

135
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:50,159
been any evolutionary innovation in this

136
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,740
relationship so I study that in psyche

137
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,170
heads specifically because psyche heads

138
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,850
have highly specialized relationships

139
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,590
with both pollinators and

140
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,110
herbivores so these are one-to-one

141
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:02,759
relationships where the pollinators live

142
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,470
their entire lifecycle on the on the

143
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,089
plant and the plant is dependent on

144
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,890
reproduction on the pollinators I'm

145
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:09,209
going to talk a lot more about this but

146
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:11,219
they also have a lot of highly

147
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:12,870
specialized herbivore relationships

148
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,580
these are you may us at a lab

149
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,350
butterflies that as you can see because

150
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:18,269
they aggregate they do great damage to

151
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:21,780
the plant and their entire lifecycle is

152
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:23,430
dependent on the host plant but I also

153
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:27,089
study psych heads because they're just

154
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:29,579
incredible and I had someone reviewing a

155
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:31,109
paper once not at the review stage but a

156
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,609
collaborator reviewing a paper saying

157
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,050
you should really be careful and not

158
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,240
assume that everyone loves psych heads

159
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,680
which is great if you should all think

160
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,090
about that and writing your papers don't

161
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,860
just assume everyone loves your system

162
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:42,629
but honestly what is wrong with our

163
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,400
world if you don't love psych heads so

164
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:46,139
I'm gonna take just a few minutes to

165
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,810
convince you all that psych heads are

166
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,519
incredible plants first off they are

167
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,930
just incredibly beautiful these are

168
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:53,819
photographs that my husband took at

169
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,168
Montgomery Botanical Center I put these

170
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,389
in not just to show you the beautiful

171
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:59,370
diversity but also to point out that

172
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:01,139
psych heads are highly endangered the

173
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,750
most endangered organism are the most

174
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:06,089
endangered group of plants in the world

175
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:10,910
most ranged from threatened to

176
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:12,689
endangered just that louder and

177
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,490
Montgomery Botanical Center is a

178
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:18,050
conservation garden down in Florida that

179
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:20,250
grows XE true groupings of these plants

180
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,610
here's just another picture that I love

181
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:27,180
but also they also demand your attention

182
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:29,490
in in nature so this is a some field

183
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,870
work I was doing in Panama and just look

184
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:34,189
at that it's screaming for your

185
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:38,180
attention right and the attention of

186
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:40,139
herbivores I should point out but also

187
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,699
there they have an

188
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:44,098
incredible fossil record extending back

189
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:46,319
over 265 million years some with this

190
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:50,128
incredible level of cellular diversity

191
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,870
so they are an ancient plant lineage 265

192
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:54,210
million years I always feel like I have

193
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,639
to say that a few times to really drive

194
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:58,168
this home and there's lots of

195
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,468
information that we can learn from this

196
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:03,060
from their from their fossil record that

197
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:06,439
hopefully we'll learn more about with

198
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,699
Liz learning a little bit with her but

199
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,080
this is also just kind of interesting to

200
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,718
me because the United States used to

201
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,698
have a fossil National Park a cycad

202
00:07:12,718 --> 00:07:15,930
fossil National Monument it's one of the

203
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,639
very few national monuments in the

204
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,259
history of the US that's ever been

205
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,968
decommissioned and that's because of

206
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:22,379
theft of the fossils that actually most

207
00:07:20,968 --> 00:07:23,848
of the theft was done by this George

208
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:25,740
Weiland which is this Yale

209
00:07:23,848 --> 00:07:27,509
paleontologist that really worked to

210
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,158
establish the plants so there's a lot of

211
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:32,879
fossils of cycads and they're related

212
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:33,990
and and their related plans so that's

213
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:35,908
just an interesting side note that I

214
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,158
love but psych heads are also

215
00:07:35,908 --> 00:07:39,778
thermogenic so this this means that they

216
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:42,149
have their own body temperature they

217
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:43,560
have their own body temperature a way of

218
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:45,179
heating up and they do this in their

219
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,158
reproductive structures this is actually

220
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,050
really quite where rare in plants and

221
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:50,668
when it is found in plants it's usually

222
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,379
that there is either one big burst of

223
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:53,968
temperature increase or like an increase

224
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:56,520
in an siRNA maintenance at one level

225
00:07:53,968 --> 00:07:58,379
cycads however have an even more

226
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:59,728
interesting pattern in my opinion they

227
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:01,199
increase and heat up in their

228
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:03,478
temperature over the course of the day

229
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,189
every day for about two weeks when the

230
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:07,019
plants reproductive it happens in both

231
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:08,789
the pollen cones and in the ovulate

232
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:11,459
cones and to a much less degree in the

233
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:13,199
ovulate cones this is something you

234
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:15,000
might think of as like an animal trait

235
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,199
body temperature but they also have

236
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,788
another thing that people tend to think

237
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,528
of as an animal trait they have mobile

238
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:21,478
sperm they have flagellated sperm that

239
00:08:19,528 --> 00:08:23,218
are also gigantic you can literally see

240
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:25,680
these with the naked eye which is a

241
00:08:23,218 --> 00:08:28,800
really fun thing to do that we should do

242
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,240
in course we're kind of here but just to

243
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,490
prove that they are the end-all be-all

244
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,610
they have an Omega patterning in their

245
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:38,519
leaf rei'kas and I love this because I

246
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:40,079
had this really crazy and is probably in

247
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,879
a perfect to say but slightly drunken

248
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:43,259
night a McGovern Botanical Center where

249
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:46,049
I was talking to a girlfriend there was

250
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:47,639
somebody there that is an artist from

251
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:50,750
New York and she was there doing art

252
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:52,919
based on sort of botanical

253
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,549
representation in religious ceremonies

254
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:55,319
and

255
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:56,549
she and I got all you know a little a

256
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,839
little tipsy together and I was like

257
00:08:56,549 --> 00:09:02,699
dude what if psych heads are God and so

258
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,089
they they're not the Alpha and the Omega

259
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,470
but they certainly have Omega patterning

260
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:08,970
but they are actually used they have a

261
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,350
lot of religious connotation in

262
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,000
indigenous cultures there's a lot of

263
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,820
anthropology work that goes back and

264
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,470
looks at things for instance that Aztec

265
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,839
maize God the Aztec corn God they

266
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,910
believed is sort of a like a movement

267
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,459
beyond an evolution from a psyche head

268
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:25,230
worship they believe that psyche had

269
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:27,088
consumption could have been important

270
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,589
for the Mexican Revolution there's tons

271
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:31,019
of great information about the history

272
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:33,180
of psyche heads in that way and they are

273
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:34,230
still using a lot of religious religious

274
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:36,439
ceremonies specifically where

275
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:40,920
Catholicism has taken in some indigenous

276
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:42,060
religious connotations but something is

277
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:44,519
a little more important for our story is

278
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:45,989
that psych heads are super toxic so they

279
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,539
have two classes of toxins I'm just

280
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,610
going to call BMAA and man these toxins

281
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:53,370
are mutagenic neuro toxic and

282
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,019
carcinogenic and they're they're present

283
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,929
and all cycad Jenner and in all psyche

284
00:09:55,019 --> 00:10:00,028
head tissues and the effects of their

285
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:02,069
toxicity have been recorded in insects

286
00:10:00,028 --> 00:10:05,278
and animals and even plants which is

287
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:08,550
amazing if you think about it but that's

288
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:10,850
a talk for another time and this of

289
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:13,109
course famous famously has been

290
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:14,250
discussed in Oliver Sacks his book the

291
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:17,278
island of the color blind where he

292
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:20,759
really connected consumption of cycad

293
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:23,220
toxins with neurodegenerative diseases

294
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:25,350
of the people of Guam and in fact this

295
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,110
is still a very active area of research

296
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,909
is the toxin BMAA and its connections to

297
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,310
ALS and alzheimer's and parkinson's

298
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:36,088
disease and so there's a lot of medical

299
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:38,099
research that's still ongoing they also

300
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:39,690
have besides their relationship their

301
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,800
specialized relationships with insects

302
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,940
they have other specialized

303
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:43,229
relationships and this is some of the

304
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,510
stuff that Chelsey first told me about

305
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,009
that blew my mind they have some

306
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:48,750
specialized morphology to make their

307
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:50,309
association with cyanobacteria

308
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,899
so they have these colloid roots which

309
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:53,849
may not be able to see this is a deep

310
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:56,370
potted plant and here you've got sort of

311
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,199
a caller ID root growing up here's some

312
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,759
if you see in a root ball me holding it

313
00:10:58,198 --> 00:11:01,909
if you cut one of those root nodules

314
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,289
open you'll see a ring of cyanobacteria

315
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:05,610
this is some ongoing work down at Long

316
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,959
hibiyo and they're really working out

317
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,820
that it's not just cyanide

318
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,680
that's in present in these roots that

319
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,910
there are other bacteria and that the

320
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:13,379
interactions between those different

321
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:15,179
bacteria can do different things for the

322
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:16,620
plants and of course the hypothesis has

323
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:18,509
always been obviously that Santa

324
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,190
bacteria is fixing nitrogen for cycads

325
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:24,419
but actually that has not yet been

326
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:26,250
proven I however am really I think of

327
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:27,809
myself as a symbiosis biologist and I'm

328
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,090
interested under this umbrella of

329
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:32,159
symbiosis I'm really a hippie and so I

330
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:34,230
really think a lot about mutualism but

331
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,939
nothing is just a pure mutualism you may

332
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,580
have a mutualistic relationship with

333
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,230
your partner or your family but trust me

334
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,450
there are some parasitic aspects of that

335
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,610
relationship and so in order to really

336
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:47,160
understand mutualism you need to also

337
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,409
think about parasitism right and so in

338
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,000
cycads there are very clear distinctions

339
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:52,259
that allow me to ask those kinds of

340
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,519
questions there's the pollinator

341
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:55,259
mutualists that i'm going to talk a lot

342
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,699
about today and then i'm gonna i'm gonna

343
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:59,549
give you some insights that I've gotten

344
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,870
from the parasitic herbivores that that

345
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:02,309
allow me to understand a little bit more

346
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:04,409
of the relationship with the pollinators

347
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:06,269
and what I'm interested in here is

348
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:06,990
mechanisms I want to understand how does

349
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:09,720
this work

350
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:12,330
how is this relationship work so I start

351
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,970
by saying that specialized pollination

352
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,230
is widespread and cycads so for a

353
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:19,290
long-standing time we thought that

354
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,820
psyche heads were wind pollinated even

355
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:22,289
even though the presence of insects had

356
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,820
been found on the cones but we now

357
00:12:22,289 --> 00:12:26,549
believe that all psyche heads appeared

358
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,260
to be obligate ly insect pollinated and

359
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:29,819
in fact it seems to mostly be Coley

360
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:31,710
after which is the order that includes

361
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,930
beetles and weevils it's found across

362
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,550
the phylogeny and some recent fossil

363
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:37,259
evidence even dates that - before the

364
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:39,659
rise of flowering plants so we have a

365
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:42,029
fossil that shows us where this this

366
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:43,319
beetle has already evolved morphology

367
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:45,629
that is specific to its relationship

368
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:49,800
with psyche heads and living with inside

369
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:51,779
heads so I study the genus zania which

370
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:53,759
is neotropical it's we've got one

371
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:55,409
species native to Florida and then the

372
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:56,970
rest grow through the Caribbean down

373
00:12:55,409 --> 00:13:00,230
through Central and South America Mexico

374
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:02,850
and all the way down to Bolivia and I

375
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,500
study this because it's easy cuz it's

376
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,000
here in the US it's much easier

377
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,070
especially because these are endangered

378
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,009
plants and societies regulated and all

379
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:12,060
that but also because of some great work

380
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:13,649
done by two different group of

381
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:15,359
researchers in the 80s studying two

382
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:16,709
different groups of plants and they were

383
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,029
working on the pollination of those

384
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,769
plants and really challenging the idea

385
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:20,639
that these are wind pollinated those

386
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:22,980
researchers

387
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,649
found that they were pollinated by these

388
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,240
genus of weevil row Paulo true weevil

389
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:29,549
and these were different species of

390
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,740
broke elope cherry weevil they found

391
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:33,299
also that within a common garden they

392
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,310
were working at Fairchild botanical

393
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:38,338
Center and / Montgomery botanical Center

394
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:39,629
or Fairchild botanical garden that the

395
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:41,730
weevil stayed faithful to their host

396
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:43,409
plan so one of those groups of

397
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:46,079
researchers went even further and worked

398
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:47,879
out the lifecycle of the rope hello tree

399
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:48,870
weevil and I'll just walk you through it

400
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:49,980
and then I'll show you some of my own

401
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,110
pictures to give you a little bit more

402
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,570
connection with it so this is a large

403
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,850
male plant with pollen cones all over it

404
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:58,860
the weevils aggregate on the outside of

405
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,269
a pollen cone at a certain stage of

406
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,730
development of the cone a little bit

407
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:05,039
before the cone opens then they begin

408
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:07,259
feeding inside they lay their eggs on it

409
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,539
and on a microscope fill so I'm just

410
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:11,519
gonna call it a cone scale so they lay

411
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:13,828
their eggs inside the microspore fill

412
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,860
inside the cone scale the larvae develop

413
00:14:13,828 --> 00:14:18,809
if they develop inside hollowing it out

414
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,209
if one encounters the other you

415
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:23,338
cannibalizes it and then pupate sin the

416
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:25,198
stock of the of the cone scale where he

417
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:27,209
then emerges and does the process all

418
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,889
over again because of their pollination

419
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:30,509
work we knew that they visited the

420
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:32,610
female plants they visited the ovulate

421
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:34,078
cones but they never feed on them they

422
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,220
never aggregate they're in large numbers

423
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,198
they don't lay their eggs on it they

424
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,660
don't develop on there so this was still

425
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:41,729
an unknown why why do they visit the

426
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:43,409
female plants and this relationship is

427
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,959
so specialized and important in fact

428
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:47,610
that the plants only have reproductive

429
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,649
cones for about one and a half to two

430
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,909
months a year so the rest of the ten

431
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:52,379
months of the year the weebles are in

432
00:14:50,909 --> 00:14:53,939
diapause which you can think of is like

433
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:56,159
Arrested Development or hibernation

434
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,680
right and think about this this is in

435
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,719
Florida nobody goes to Florida to

436
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:02,549
hibernate right this is where this is

437
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,379
where people go to retire because it's

438
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:06,208
comfortable this is where you know girls

439
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:08,189
none wild spring break stuff happens

440
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:09,539
nobody is going there to retire but so

441
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:12,839
for 10 months out of the year these

442
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:13,319
weevils find Florida - inhospitable for

443
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,480
them

444
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,120
because their life cycle is so tied to

445
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,159
their host plant even when there's a

446
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,159
closely related host plant a meter away

447
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:26,429
all right so here's some of my own

448
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:27,719
pictures of that here's a here's a male

449
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:29,129
plant you can see there's a bunch of

450
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,600
cones it's hard to tell but this cone

451
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:32,698
here is a lot of weebles all over it

452
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,629
look at them just aggregating like crazy

453
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,669
and

454
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:37,950
if you break this cone open you'll see a

455
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:41,339
lot of frass that's weevil poop and

456
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:43,350
nibble marks here's a weevil covered in

457
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,759
pollen and if you look at a cone and you

458
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,950
open it up you see a little weevil

459
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:50,159
standing on top of a microscope with the

460
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:51,960
pollen sacs above them and then here's a

461
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,730
female cone that is cracked open so when

462
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,860
a cone is receptive it goes from being

463
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:59,490
tightly bound to cracking open to

464
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:01,440
receive pollen so of course in trying to

465
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:04,620
understand this connection why do they

466
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,880
leave this house this great home that

467
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,080
gives them everything they need all

468
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:08,850
their friends are there it's a party

469
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,710
there's food it's like your mom's house

470
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,269
and you're a teenager and then you go

471
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:14,009
out into the world on your own and you

472
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:15,649
have to feed yourself right what did

473
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:17,909
your mom do to kick you out of the house

474
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:20,009
what how did we get them out of this

475
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:21,000
house what is this what is this so I

476
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:22,980
think it has something to do with

477
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,620
communication and I have a little bit of

478
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:28,379
reason to think that there there are two

479
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:31,019
other really well-known obligate brood

480
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:35,189
sight pollination mechanisms which means

481
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:36,870
that the insect is house and it's and

482
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,490
it's brood develops within the

483
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,840
reproductive tissue of the plant that it

484
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,669
pollinates so the ones that you guys

485
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,740
have all probably heard of are the yucca

486
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:47,429
and the yucca moth and the fig and the

487
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,779
fig wasp but I'm doing it in something

488
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:50,549
that doesn't have a flower which i think

489
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:51,899
is particularly interesting so I think

490
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:53,939
that has something to do with chemical

491
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:55,110
communication and that's my hypothesis

492
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,060
and that's why I started working with

493
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:59,639
and thank God I got lucky because it

494
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:02,399
meant I got to get a PhD so I started by

495
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,289
asking what is the plant signal this is

496
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,000
communication 101 this is what your

497
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:07,289
therapist will talk to you about what is

498
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,359
your signal what are you trying to say

499
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:11,639
how does your partner perceive the

500
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,289
signal and how what is their behavioral

501
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,870
response to the signal that you give

502
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:17,369
them and does the plant use that to

503
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:19,799
enact reproduction or does your

504
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,629
communication result in the desired

505
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:24,000
behavior or the desired outcome that

506
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:25,709
you're hoping for so I start by asking

507
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,949
what's the plant signal and for this I

508
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:28,170
do

509
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:31,529
headspace collection methods so I have

510
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:33,539
here is a D hissing pollen cone and I'm

511
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:36,059
taking volatiles from it so I have a

512
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:39,450
inert plastic bag over it literally a

513
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:42,240
Reynolds oven bag tied off this filter

514
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:44,730
here has absorbent material in it and a

515
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,500
vacuum pulling over it so for 45 minutes

516
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:49,329
I'm pulling the airspace around the cone

517
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,890
over this adsorbent material to get the

518
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:53,319
smell that the plan is producing the

519
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,490
volatile bouquet which I then aleut and

520
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:56,379
run on something called gas

521
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,240
chromatography mass spectrometry which

522
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,309
is very simply just a way to separate

523
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,079
all of the ten to fifteen compounds the

524
00:18:00,308 --> 00:18:04,649
plant may be producing so that I can ask

525
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:08,319
questions about each individual compound

526
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:09,788
when I do that I find that the plan that

527
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,319
I'm studying is a Mia for Gracie which

528
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:13,419
is the one that had had all of that

529
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:15,158
great pollination work done already in

530
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:17,320
it the plants really produce two main

531
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:18,940
volatile compounds one that I identified

532
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:20,649
as 1/3 octave een and one that I

533
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,509
identified as little oh so that's the

534
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:24,100
plant signal the plant really only has

535
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:25,390
two channels that it's communicating

536
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:27,699
through at least of all at least

537
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:29,799
chemically but that doesn't tell me what

538
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,240
the insect proceeds so insects are

539
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:33,849
different than humans we can smell

540
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,589
everything right insects have sort of

541
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:37,658
like a lock-and-key mechanism they have

542
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:38,980
proteins in their antennae that you

543
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:41,049
could think of as the lock and the

544
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:44,259
volatile is the key that it has to come

545
00:18:41,048 --> 00:18:45,970
in and match right to close that lock to

546
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:48,099
fit into that protein in order for the

547
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,450
insect to perceive it so just the fact

548
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:50,709
that the plant produces both of these

549
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,860
doesn't tell me what the insect

550
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:55,720
perceives so for that I do something

551
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:58,359
called electro antenna graph detection

552
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,220
so this is that GCMs that I talked about

553
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:01,839
what separates all the volatile

554
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,150
compounds like and asked questions about

555
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,678
each of those and what I'm doing here is

556
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:07,538
I'm separating those volatile compounds

557
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,038
I'm sending half to be detected and

558
00:19:07,538 --> 00:19:11,109
produce that same image that you just

559
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:13,119
saw having the peaks at different times

560
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:15,279
but the other half is coming down this

561
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:18,009
tube and being bathed to cost this prep

562
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:20,710
but this is is two electrodes and that's

563
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:23,230
a weebles little head that I just

564
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:26,169
chopped off I'm sorry and his head is on

565
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:28,360
one side and antennae on the other side

566
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:30,520
and so when the volatile comes and

567
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:32,619
bathes across that that's the key that

568
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:34,690
comes into the lock closes the lock and

569
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:36,639
it closes this electrical circuit and it

570
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,409
creates an electrical charge because I'm

571
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,390
coupling that with the with the other

572
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:43,750
analyses I'm able to identify which of

573
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:45,429
those compounds the insect perceives so

574
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,288
this is what that data looks like you've

575
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:48,820
got that exact same image over top and

576
00:19:47,288 --> 00:19:51,669
on the bottom here's my electrical

577
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:53,710
charge and then here's the dip dip the

578
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:55,870
weevil physiologically can perceive 1/3

579
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,220
octave and cannot perceive lynn Lowell

580
00:19:55,869 --> 00:20:00,398
which is a much more common plant

581
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,370
compound but 1/3 octave nyan is not very

582
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:02,899
common it's found in

583
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:06,799
and a couple other cycads really in

584
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:08,809
Africa of all places so this tells me

585
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,250
that the physiological perception and of

586
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:12,319
course you have to do this many times

587
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,700
and to really identify this you have to

588
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:14,960
this compound there's many things that

589
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,819
go behind it but you really have to have

590
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,470
a chemist synthesize this standard and

591
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:21,409
test the weevil against that standard

592
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:23,269
and I did as the same as little ole and

593
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:25,009
all the different kiemas of lentil so

594
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:27,769
we're positive that this weevil

595
00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:29,839
perceives 1/3 octave and nothing else

596
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:31,430
that the plant produces but that doesn't

597
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:32,599
tell me what the behavioral responses

598
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:36,019
that tells me about the insect is

599
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:37,759
capable of perceiving so for that I did

600
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:40,910
something called pitfall tests this is

601
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,319
very basic so I've got these petri

602
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:44,300
dishes with the whole cut in the middle

603
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:45,250
and a pit in the bottom and in the

604
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:47,869
bottom I'm putting different

605
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:50,720
concentrations of 1/3 octave Dean and a

606
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:52,519
control of course and I put some weevils

607
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,170
in the top close the lid

608
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:56,000
put in the darks there's no visual

609
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,679
signaling going on and I come back after

610
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,900
30 minutes and see how many weevils have

611
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,360
fallen into the pit telling me is this

612
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:04,309
an attractant a lot of compounds can be

613
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:06,199
deterrents for weevils right in fact

614
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:08,779
that you know this because you you put

615
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,279
different chemicals in to keep you put

616
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:11,928
chemicals in to keep mice out of the

617
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:13,609
barn and you put chemicals down to keep

618
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:15,259
insects out of places right they act

619
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:19,639
chemicals can be an attractant or a

620
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:21,558
deterrent so when I do that I see it and

621
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,690
do it a bunch of times right I see that

622
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:25,639
it isn't attractant this is the number

623
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,558
this is the proportion of weevils that

624
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,270
have gone down into the pit and all of

625
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:32,000
the different concentrations or amounts

626
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:33,650
base amounts of 1/3 octave and what you

627
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,599
see is that it isn't attractant here's

628
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:37,700
nothing in very low amounts it isn't

629
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,558
attractant but it is not linear so you

630
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,620
would think that just if you really like

631
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:44,149
something it you know the more the more

632
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:46,099
of it the more attracted you are right

633
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:48,140
hey Zeus you said you love Donuts is

634
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:49,490
that right the more donuts the more

635
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,929
attracted you are do you get up to a

636
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:56,720
point where too much Donuts is

637
00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:58,610
unattractive right so so it tells me it

638
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,589
tells me that this is a track this is an

639
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:02,629
attractant but not linearly which is

640
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:04,129
pretty interesting so that made me think

641
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:06,050
maybe this has something to do with what

642
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:08,240
causes the movement from the pollen cone

643
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:10,339
to the ovulate cone and for that I want

644
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,309
to ask can i illicit movement and I

645
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:15,529
cause insect movement using these two

646
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:17,579
different concentrations which are

647
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:20,279
ecologically relevant right these two

648
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:22,470
different concentrations so with that I

649
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:24,720
do something where I build these arenas

650
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,460
and so what you've got here is a box

651
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,029
arena with a bunch of weevils in it and

652
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:31,590
the sides are all mesh so that there is

653
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:34,549
airflow so there's no like build-up of

654
00:22:31,589 --> 00:22:37,289
volatiles on one side I may put the the

655
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:38,789
volatile amount on the other side the

656
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:41,789
1/3 octave Dean amount on the other side

657
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:43,500
I put a control but nothing to see and

658
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:46,500
now I'm gonna track these weebles over

659
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,390
time and see if their location changes

660
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,099
do they are they more attractive do they

661
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:52,350
move towards the lower concentration and

662
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:53,609
away from the higher concentration this

663
00:22:52,349 --> 00:22:56,149
is what that looks like I just always

664
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:58,829
think it's such a fun video there goes

665
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:00,660
so I'm just tracking them over time and

666
00:22:58,829 --> 00:23:02,308
of course some various important things

667
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:07,019
if a weevil doesn't move at all they're

668
00:23:02,308 --> 00:23:09,058
not counted they may not be dead they

669
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:11,069
just may be maybe this is the compound

670
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:13,079
and they're happy they may not be dead

671
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:15,058
but you can very easily do that using

672
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:16,678
pixels right understanding that like you

673
00:23:15,058 --> 00:23:18,000
take an average pixel density at this

674
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:21,000
location throughout the course of the

675
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,150
video and see how it changes right and

676
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,890
when I do that and I'm I'm saying I'm

677
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,900
looking at their change in asymmetry

678
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:30,330
their change in direction towards the

679
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:32,460
bait I see that yes at this lower amount

680
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:34,349
they are attracted they move towards to

681
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:38,549
the bait at the higher amount they move

682
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:42,659
away from the bait so what does that

683
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:44,220
mean though for how plants use that that

684
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:47,940
weevil behavioral preference for their

685
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:50,100
volatiles to enact reproduction and I

686
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,380
had some some knowledge right this is

687
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:54,178
something that I had done in the lab we

688
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,130
know that cones will continue to undergo

689
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:58,380
at least their thermogenic thermogenic

690
00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:01,530
behavior and even we know that cone

691
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:03,929
scales are able to continue producing

692
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:05,700
volatiles and throughout the course of

693
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:08,280
the day if they're broken off from the

694
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,019
plant so I had taken broken off cone

695
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:12,420
scales from pollen cones and ovulate

696
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:14,220
cones 16 of each arranged them in this

697
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:17,100
arena had it so that air could flow all

698
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:19,440
of this introduced for weevils into like

699
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:21,240
a circular arena with a with the pollen

700
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,460
cone scale or an ovule at cone scale in

701
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,460
the center and then I just attract them

702
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:28,380
all day and said how many are on the

703
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,340
cone scale or within one little

704
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,620
millimeter of it

705
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:34,019
and you can see from this that there's

706
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:35,548
definitely they're more attracted to the

707
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:37,019
pollen cone scale than to the ovulate

708
00:24:35,548 --> 00:24:38,579
comb scale and that there is this big

709
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:40,499
dip and attraction in the pollen count

710
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:44,339
scale there is also a statistically

711
00:24:40,499 --> 00:24:46,169
significant dip in the in the female

712
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:48,839
cone scale but of course this is a lab

713
00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:50,490
setup and so I don't know how much how

714
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:51,658
much of this dip in either case is

715
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:54,359
related to the fact that these are

716
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:56,309
broken off cone scales or what it may

717
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,199
mean right but I do know that I at least

718
00:24:56,308 --> 00:24:59,849
see some difference and I see a

719
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,249
difference in traction of pollen and

720
00:24:59,849 --> 00:25:06,028
ovulate cones and also a big dip in

721
00:25:02,249 --> 00:25:08,730
attraction to pollen cones so I go back

722
00:25:06,028 --> 00:25:11,038
to the plants and I take volatiles the

723
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:13,860
same way I told you but I do it every

724
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,569
hour for pollen cones and for ovulate

725
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:16,859
cones every hour and watch how those

726
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:19,528
volatiles change throughout the course

727
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:21,388
of the day the first thing I noticed is

728
00:25:19,528 --> 00:25:23,819
that there is a characteristic pattern

729
00:25:21,388 --> 00:25:25,319
in both in both pollen cones and ovulate

730
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:27,329
counts so pollen cones are in blue here

731
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:29,308
goblet cones are in red what you're

732
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:31,168
seeing is the percent composition of 1/3

733
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:32,849
octave that's all I'm looking at now not

734
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:34,350
even little ole which you know obviously

735
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:37,048
because it's the other compound does an

736
00:25:34,349 --> 00:25:39,269
opposite shape what you see is that

737
00:25:37,048 --> 00:25:40,648
there's a real dip in production of 1/3

738
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:43,079
octave diene in the middle of the day

739
00:25:40,648 --> 00:25:46,648
and then they approach a hundred percent

740
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:48,329
so this is not this is not overall

741
00:25:46,648 --> 00:25:49,618
amount that they produce this is what

742
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:51,569
they are producing they produce these

743
00:25:49,618 --> 00:25:53,638
two compounds and they shift making only

744
00:25:51,569 --> 00:25:57,118
1/3 octave diene towards the evening a

745
00:25:53,638 --> 00:25:59,459
little after 8:00 p.m. and I can see

746
00:25:57,118 --> 00:26:02,308
also that pollen cones on average

747
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:04,649
produce overall more volatile so this is

748
00:26:02,308 --> 00:26:06,418
both 1/3 octave ena and little o how

749
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:08,219
much do they produce and I'm looking at

750
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:10,710
total ion abundance which is a value

751
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,778
that I get from GCMs pollen cones again

752
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:14,639
in blue so pollen cones produce more

753
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:17,278
than ovulate cones and they have some

754
00:26:14,638 --> 00:26:20,368
peak at the end is that peak related to

755
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:22,710
1/3 octave a very similar graph but this

756
00:26:20,368 --> 00:26:26,009
is now looking just at 1/3 octave e not

757
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:28,288
at overall volatiles and yes the pollen

758
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:30,089
cones produce more 1/3 octave diene and

759
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:33,778
have a big increase at the end of the

760
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:35,189
day in 1/3 octave e ok so at the same

761
00:26:33,778 --> 00:26:36,538
time that I'm taking these volatile

762
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:38,879
measurements every hour I'm also

763
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:40,829
videotaping cones so I've got all these

764
00:26:38,878 --> 00:26:42,359
pollen cones 10 of them that I've broken

765
00:26:40,829 --> 00:26:43,199
off and put in these little plastic

766
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:45,719
containers

767
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,340
airflow in them and I videotape them all

768
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,069
day long and they just literally go and

769
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:51,599
count how many weevils are in you know

770
00:26:50,069 --> 00:26:54,629
how many weevils are in the container

771
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:58,109
which means out of the cone and what I

772
00:26:54,630 --> 00:27:00,659
see is that at this time that I have

773
00:26:58,109 --> 00:27:02,668
this big increase percent increase in

774
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:04,950
production of 1/3 octave een in the

775
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:07,259
pollen cones that's the same time that I

776
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:08,610
have a big expulsion of pollinators from

777
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:11,970
the pollen counts so I'm counting and

778
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:14,009
it's like two two two two forty right so

779
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,600
there's some massive movement and I wish

780
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:17,819
that I'm just not technologically

781
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:20,158
advanced enough to be able to take like

782
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:21,720
a ten-hour video and break it down into

783
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,130
thirty seconds for you guys because it's

784
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,480
insanely striking I mean you're just

785
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,590
watching and there's nothing nothing

786
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,240
nothing nothing and then it's just a

787
00:27:25,589 --> 00:27:32,129
million weevils right so we so our idea

788
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,409
here is that I'm going to break this

789
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:35,700
down and just use two one pollen count

790
00:27:34,409 --> 00:27:37,740
and one ovulate cone to make it a little

791
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,750
bit clearer but our dia here is that

792
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,490
there is difference in concentration

793
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:43,138
that is attractive to the pollinator and

794
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:44,788
that the plants use their daily

795
00:27:43,138 --> 00:27:46,379
patterning as a way to move the

796
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:48,960
pollinators between the pollen cone and

797
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:51,179
ovulate con so it's almost as if there's

798
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,860
this low level of production of 1/3

799
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:55,950
octave een and this looks like zero but

800
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:57,509
it's slightly above it's just not really

801
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,490
attractive to the pollinators they just

802
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,919
don't really care it's not enough to get

803
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:03,058
them to move or get them to do anything

804
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:04,528
but then there's a window that is

805
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:07,319
attractive to them an amount that they

806
00:28:04,528 --> 00:28:09,659
like and an amount that they don't like

807
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:12,720
right and the way I always describe this

808
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:16,340
is my husband I love it if he has a

809
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,690
little aftershave on but I cannot stand

810
00:28:16,339 --> 00:28:20,490
Cologne

811
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,929
so we've all been next to this person on

812
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,759
the elevator and you want to get off as

813
00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:25,200
fast as you can alright that's the same

814
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:26,609
thing that the weevils are doing we

815
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,580
believe so

816
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:31,109
just schematically that would look a

817
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:33,359
little something like this there's a

818
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:35,569
pollen cone here on the left an ovule it

819
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:38,548
cone here on the right you have your

820
00:28:35,569 --> 00:28:40,740
increase in production of 1/3 octave

821
00:28:38,548 --> 00:28:42,778
Dean sort of as a heat map and you can

822
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,548
imagine that over that daily cycle

823
00:28:42,778 --> 00:28:46,288
there's an amount that is attractive to

824
00:28:44,548 --> 00:28:48,000
weevils they're happy and they hang out

825
00:28:46,288 --> 00:28:50,669
in there then they get on the elevator

826
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,710
with mr. stinky and they've got to get

827
00:28:50,669 --> 00:28:55,080
off and the only thing that works for

828
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:57,090
them because their entire life is bound

829
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:58,470
to this plant this plant

830
00:28:57,089 --> 00:28:59,939
that smell is where they're gonna lay

831
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,200
their eggs it's where they're gonna feed

832
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,150
it's where they're gonna reproduce

833
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,470
they're gonna mate right they're gonna

834
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:06,509
their larvae are going to develop

835
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:08,400
so they have no desire to find anything

836
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:10,079
else and so once they're pushed out of

837
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,150
this cone they're sort of pulled into

838
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:13,679
this cone sort of deceptively right a

839
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:16,980
cheap mechanism because there's no food

840
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:18,690
here for them and then maybe and so in

841
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:21,599
this case this is still an unknown to me

842
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:24,240
is this one consistent amount or is

843
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:27,809
there sort of a it appears from this

844
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,519
data and it it appears that what's

845
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:30,899
happening is the female cone is making

846
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,000
not enough to be attractive but is

847
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:35,210
becoming attractive at the same time

848
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,309
that the pollen cone is becoming

849
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:40,829
repulsive right but from the earlier

850
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:42,329
data showing them in the lab it seemed

851
00:29:40,829 --> 00:29:44,399
like maybe the female cone is being

852
00:29:42,329 --> 00:29:45,659
pretty consistent throughout the day so

853
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,030
that I think we should work out a little

854
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:50,490
bit more but this is actually called

855
00:29:48,029 --> 00:29:53,099
push-pull pollination and it's been

856
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:55,140
described and one other species of or

857
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:57,029
one of their genus one species period

858
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:59,040
but it's in a different genus macrosomia

859
00:29:57,029 --> 00:30:01,769
and macadamia have pollinators that are

860
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:04,859
thrips vastly vastly different from

861
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:06,720
beetles right so we know that the same

862
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:09,750
pollination mechanism exists in

863
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,210
macadamia and ends amia and we also know

864
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:14,250
that that thermogenic patterning that I

865
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:17,039
told you about produces a similar

866
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:18,990
volatile patterning like we like I'm

867
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,490
showing so we know that it's not just

868
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:23,900
that an increase in temperature makes

869
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:26,009
you more stinky it's actually that the

870
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,870
substrates that are necessary for

871
00:30:26,009 --> 00:30:30,390
volatile production are produced during

872
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:33,569
the thermogenic process and so it's it's

873
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:35,220
a you're able to test and see that it's

874
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:36,899
predictable that there's a pattern where

875
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,339
you have a peak and thermogenesis at

876
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:41,040
about ten to thirty minutes later you

877
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:44,099
have a peak in volatile production we

878
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:46,019
also know that everywhere that it's been

879
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:48,240
tested in cycads every time it's been

880
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:50,039
tested we have this volatile patterning

881
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,230
and of course we know that that

882
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:54,740
thermogenesis is ancestral in the group

883
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:57,930
so this really suggests to us that

884
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:59,579
because every cycad has brewed site

885
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:01,620
mutualists where the organisms live

886
00:30:59,579 --> 00:31:03,480
within the pollen cone and that every

887
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:05,339
pollen cone undergoes this thermogenesis

888
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,110
that we know creates this volatile

889
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:09,389
patterning we think that this

890
00:31:07,109 --> 00:31:10,558
pollination mechanism may be ancestral

891
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,090
in this group and in fact

892
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,009
maybe a pollination mechanism that

893
00:31:12,089 --> 00:31:15,480
existed before the visual signaling that

894
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:19,860
you get with the rise of flowering

895
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:21,839
plants so just a brief summary of that

896
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:24,028
little section we know that they only

897
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:25,709
perceive 1/3 octave Dean and that it's

898
00:31:24,028 --> 00:31:27,628
both a repellent and an attractant and

899
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:28,829
that plants change that amount

900
00:31:27,628 --> 00:31:30,658
throughout the course of the day in a

901
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:32,519
predictable pattern and that that can

902
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:34,350
enact weevil movement between the pollen

903
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:35,878
cone and the ovulate column and this

904
00:31:34,349 --> 00:31:38,248
push-pull pollination mechanism is

905
00:31:35,878 --> 00:31:39,599
likely ancient and has existed long

906
00:31:38,249 --> 00:31:42,298
before the rise of flowering plants

907
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,888
potentially but in still understanding

908
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:46,470
mechanisms I need to bring in this idea

909
00:31:43,888 --> 00:31:48,388
of parasitism because these are these

910
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:51,659
pollinators are herbivores of the plants

911
00:31:48,388 --> 00:31:53,069
and the plants are super toxic right so

912
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:55,409
in order to understand that one of the

913
00:31:53,069 --> 00:31:57,509
first things I did was look at a

914
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:58,889
phylogeny of Lepidoptera so Lepidoptera

915
00:31:57,509 --> 00:32:01,230
is the order that includes butterflies

916
00:31:58,888 --> 00:32:03,240
and moths and this may come as a massive

917
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:04,829
surprise to you because it totally blew

918
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,618
my mind is coming from a plant

919
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:09,689
background butterflies are nested within

920
00:32:07,618 --> 00:32:11,668
moths they're not two separate

921
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:15,419
monophyletic groups which is incredible

922
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:17,700
I expected gas so this black is

923
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:18,210
butterflies and all of the gray are

924
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,980
moths

925
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,808
I've colored on the tips here where we

926
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:24,240
have evolutions of sike had every in

927
00:32:21,808 --> 00:32:26,548
many cases they are radiation so there

928
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:31,138
general that have radiated onto cycads

929
00:32:26,548 --> 00:32:33,569
and have you know 8 to 20 species and in

930
00:32:31,138 --> 00:32:35,069
most cases so all of these guys which

931
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:36,778
include butterflies and a couple Moss

932
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:38,999
these large herbivores that feed on

933
00:32:36,778 --> 00:32:40,648
leaves there's a post Matic coloring it

934
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:42,298
may not be as obvious in this one but it

935
00:32:40,648 --> 00:32:44,878
is we do not see any a plasmatic

936
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:46,319
coloring here no somatic just means that

937
00:32:44,878 --> 00:32:48,689
they have warning coloration they're

938
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:50,700
like I'm super bright red don't eat me

939
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:52,919
because I'm toxic and we know a little

940
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,720
bit about this one here

941
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:57,059
that it does sequester the plant toxins

942
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,308
that it uses them in their own body for

943
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:02,069
defense against against herbivores these

944
00:32:59,308 --> 00:33:03,569
guys down here are all detritivores

945
00:33:02,069 --> 00:33:05,638
which means that they feed on dead

946
00:33:03,569 --> 00:33:07,798
tissue and so it's possible that they're

947
00:33:05,638 --> 00:33:10,258
feeding on dead cones we're back where

948
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:11,878
some of these chemical compounds these

949
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:13,740
toxins may have already been leached

950
00:33:11,878 --> 00:33:16,769
from that system who knows what's going

951
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:18,899
on with these little guys but looking at

952
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:20,759
this gives me the idea that psych had

953
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:22,739
every has evolved many times

954
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:25,380
independently right

955
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:28,109
and what's more likely that they all got

956
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:30,570
the same ability to feed on toxic psyche

957
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:33,058
heads or that they acquired some ability

958
00:33:30,569 --> 00:33:34,799
to feed on toxic psyche heads and so for

959
00:33:33,058 --> 00:33:36,119
that in order to understand the

960
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,950
mechanisms I thought I would look at the

961
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:39,149
gut bacteria we know a lot about what

962
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:41,819
God bacteria does and how it's related

963
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:44,450
to diet and so I thought maybe these

964
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:48,119
guys all have shared shared gut bacteria

965
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:49,470
I guess these are my questions so is

966
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:51,149
their shared got bacteria amongst

967
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,679
herbivores of psyche had tissues and if

968
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:56,730
so can we infer anything from the

969
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:59,250
function so for this what I first did

970
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:00,929
was I took herbivores from this is in

971
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:02,670
three different species of zania in

972
00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:04,769
three different locations in Florida and

973
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:05,429
then one species of psychist and

974
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:08,489
Singapore

975
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:10,710
I took leaf herbivores cone herbivores

976
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:12,239
and there's two different one this guy

977
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,829
only feeds on the microscope or Phil

978
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,509
this one only feeds in the cone peat

979
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:18,418
uncle and then this guy that feeds on

980
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:20,310
the stem the underground stem and it is

981
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:22,049
very basically asked what is the

982
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:24,389
bacterial community of these herbivores

983
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,250
and is there anything shared so for this

984
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:27,869
you do something 16s sequencing you

985
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:29,909
sequence all the bacteria in their guts

986
00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:32,280
and identify them sort of like I TS like

987
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:33,929
an eye tag for bacteria and then I just

988
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,119
looked at it with a diversity analysis

989
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:37,800
and the first thing I see that stands

990
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:40,129
out is that bacterial communities are

991
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:43,050
generally distinct so this is any

992
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:44,849
individual of this species

993
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:47,460
it's got bacterial community is more

994
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:49,469
closely similar to other gut bacterial

995
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,829
communities of the same species this is

996
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:55,289
not surprising this is totally expected

997
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:58,380
and we expect we expect phylogeny to

998
00:34:55,289 --> 00:35:01,139
have an influence on gut bacteria I can

999
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,940
also look at the core so that last image

1000
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:05,489
was every bacteria in the gut so you

1001
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:07,889
yourselves may have 200 species of

1002
00:35:05,489 --> 00:35:09,539
bacteria in your gut right but if I took

1003
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:11,339
the gut bacterial community of everyone

1004
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:13,559
in this room and everyone had 200

1005
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:15,119
species and I asked what's the core what

1006
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:17,190
are bacteria that are found in the guts

1007
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,350
of all humans and maybe that there are

1008
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:21,269
three species or ten species or 15

1009
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:23,190
species that are found in every single

1010
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:24,809
one of us and so that's what I did for

1011
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:27,420
each one of these and the first thing

1012
00:35:24,809 --> 00:35:29,039
you see is that six species here and

1013
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:32,190
then large ones for some of these

1014
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:33,559
beetles also again not surprising we

1015
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:35,980
know from the literature that

1016
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:37,480
butterflies in general have

1017
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:41,170
transient bacteria they don't have

1018
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,909
really a core bacteria and beetles

1019
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:45,190
usually do this is a little interesting

1020
00:35:42,909 --> 00:35:47,259
the other thing that's interesting to me

1021
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:48,730
is that this guy these guys are feeding

1022
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:50,200
on leaves and this guy is feeding on a

1023
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,429
microscope Phil right so it's a little

1024
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:53,230
more similar than some of the other

1025
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:57,219
tissues right who's feeding on a stem

1026
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:59,260
and a confit Dunkel but when I look at

1027
00:35:57,219 --> 00:36:01,449
all of those I find that there are five

1028
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:03,520
shared bacteria amongst all of them

1029
00:36:01,449 --> 00:36:05,409
which is also super interesting when you

1030
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:08,289
think that these guys only have six so

1031
00:36:05,409 --> 00:36:11,319
five of their six are found in all other

1032
00:36:08,289 --> 00:36:14,500
cycad herbivores and not in related non

1033
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:18,100
cycad feeding out groups so can I infer

1034
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:19,869
anything about this function and yes

1035
00:36:18,099 --> 00:36:23,019
just a few things use the bacteria we're

1036
00:36:19,869 --> 00:36:24,940
able to identify one two species one two

1037
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:27,639
genus and then two two families and one

1038
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:29,289
totally unidentified and we can get some

1039
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:31,569
information about them we know that

1040
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:33,340
these two both do nitrogen fixation we

1041
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:36,070
know that Penta way I can be involved in

1042
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:37,358
oxygen talks and degradation and protein

1043
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:39,400
hydrolysis which is particularly

1044
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:42,069
interesting because BMAA is a non

1045
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,750
protein amino acid and what it does is

1046
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:46,059
get into or one of the things that does

1047
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:48,250
is get into your proteins and change the

1048
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:50,380
conformation but we also have this

1049
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:52,900
interesting anti-cancer capability and

1050
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:55,180
in fact this is used it's this bacteria

1051
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:57,730
is found in earthworms and is used in

1052
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:59,259
Chinese medicine related to cancer and

1053
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:00,809
it has I'm gonna have to read it so I

1054
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:04,330
don't get it wrong

1055
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:06,730
cytotoxicity and a Potok ik topic and

1056
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:08,230
necrotic death of mammalian cancer cells

1057
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:11,469
due to the activity of a protein

1058
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:13,000
polysaccharide complex so that gives us

1059
00:37:11,469 --> 00:37:15,189
some interesting idea that maybe these

1060
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,559
bacteria are involved with the ability

1061
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:19,329
to feed on toxic cycads it was

1062
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:20,980
interesting enough to us that we went

1063
00:37:19,329 --> 00:37:22,750
and did this even further so that

1064
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:24,039
previous study was published but is

1065
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:27,130
interesting enough that we did further

1066
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:28,989
we have 12 species now of herbivores

1067
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:30,490
from all across the world and this was

1068
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:31,989
your idea for this figure it was great

1069
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:34,179
it's beautiful so I hope you all

1070
00:37:31,989 --> 00:37:35,858
understand it but so you can see there

1071
00:37:34,179 --> 00:37:37,989
we have all different feeding tissues

1072
00:37:35,858 --> 00:37:39,759
and and across different generative

1073
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:41,618
cycads and from different geographies

1074
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,130
and those five shared bacteria are still

1075
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:47,440
there I'm working with some colleagues

1076
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:49,269
down at Long hibiyo they're working out

1077
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,159
the function of these bacteria so

1078
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:54,400
they have cultured insects gut bacteria

1079
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:55,599
that I brought them from they have

1080
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,660
cultured them in the presence and

1081
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,069
absence of BMAA one of the toxins grown

1082
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:01,690
them up over time they have been

1083
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:03,580
separately individually cultured

1084
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:06,280
bacteria and sequence their genomes and

1085
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:08,529
we're working just this week even on on

1086
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,060
that publication they're finding some

1087
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:11,530
pretty interesting stuff understanding

1088
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:15,909
the function that these bacteria may be

1089
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:18,790
doing but I don't have time to get into

1090
00:38:15,909 --> 00:38:20,409
it today so maybe for further time so we

1091
00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:22,900
know that there is a core microbiome of

1092
00:38:20,409 --> 00:38:25,480
feeding on psyche head plants and then

1093
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:27,460
it may allow in some way maybe maybe

1094
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:30,760
it's just transient maybe this may be

1095
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:32,470
the psych heads in the in this gut

1096
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,720
bacteria is selecting for this and has

1097
00:38:32,469 --> 00:38:36,219
nothing to do with the insects right but

1098
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:38,139
this was the first evidence of

1099
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:39,939
convergence of a gut bacterial community

1100
00:38:38,139 --> 00:38:42,460
across a diverse set of insects that

1101
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:45,940
share a common host plant so if we go

1102
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:48,190
back to our questions that we're

1103
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:51,070
interested in in relationships we can

1104
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:52,240
ask them about psych heads and we can

1105
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:54,130
think about what is the evolutionary

1106
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:56,858
trajectory and so this is something that

1107
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:58,119
I'm here working on with with Chelsea we

1108
00:38:56,858 --> 00:38:59,739
know a little bit about the evolutionary

1109
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:00,730
history of psych heads and in fact

1110
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:03,039
there's just this really amazing

1111
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:04,780
phylogeny where the lineages themselves

1112
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:06,820
are quite ancient but the general have

1113
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:08,650
all recently radiated and and we have a

1114
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:11,070
published phylogeny of zania the the

1115
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:13,450
genus that I study just this last year

1116
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:14,890
but we don't know anything about the

1117
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:16,689
evolutionary history of anybody else

1118
00:39:14,889 --> 00:39:17,858
involved in this mutualism network we

1119
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:19,720
don't have the evolutionary history of

1120
00:39:17,858 --> 00:39:22,269
the pollinators of the butterflies of

1121
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:24,159
the bacteria and so looking at an

1122
00:39:22,269 --> 00:39:26,199
evolution of a mutualism network as a

1123
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:27,608
whole and not as individual players and

1124
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:29,919
understanding how those relationships

1125
00:39:27,608 --> 00:39:31,269
have evolved over time and how there may

1126
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,650
be correlations that are what

1127
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:34,300
correlations may exist that we've been

1128
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:35,590
unaware of until now and then

1129
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,000
understanding some of the morphology

1130
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:38,400
that may be associated with these

1131
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,500
relationships

1132
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,240
what type of symbiosis are we so it

1133
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,039
seems pretty obvious right that the

1134
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:46,899
pollinators are mutualists they produce

1135
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:48,489
they provide reproductive services to

1136
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,500
the plant they're necessary the plants

1137
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:53,649
don't set seed unless the pollinators

1138
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:55,480
are there and they feed on essentially

1139
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:57,639
disposable tissue just cone tissue that

1140
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,740
is going to die and rot away after the

1141
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:01,269
reproductive event anyways but like I

1142
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:02,539
said there's all there's a little bit

1143
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:04,369
parasitism and every

1144
00:40:02,539 --> 00:40:06,050
relationship which my husband doesn't

1145
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:08,929
like when I say but oh my god it's so

1146
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:12,320
true and if you guys don't have kids yet

1147
00:40:08,929 --> 00:40:13,429
it gets even worse but this is something

1148
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,019
that I'm working on a little bit further

1149
00:40:13,429 --> 00:40:17,119
here with Rob Roy do so in the

1150
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:18,949
neurobiology department I just really

1151
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,980
want to understand from the plants

1152
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:24,379
perspective you need your volatiles to

1153
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:26,269
be to be static essentially you need to

1154
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,680
be able to your pollinator has to be

1155
00:40:26,269 --> 00:40:28,820
able to find you and we've shown that

1156
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:30,529
that's really important

1157
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,480
volatile production is really important

1158
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:34,220
to that however you also need to hide

1159
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,170
from your herbivores because like I said

1160
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:38,480
these herbivores decimate they can

1161
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:39,530
decimate an adult plant right nothing

1162
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,420
feeds on them because they're super

1163
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:43,220
toxic and they aggregate in great

1164
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,480
numbers need a plant to the ground so

1165
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:46,879
there's strong selective pressure in

1166
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,880
both both areas right sort of opposing

1167
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,079
selective pressures but similarly you

1168
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,030
have something going on with the insects

1169
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:55,069
we know that these highly specialized

1170
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:57,019
relationships are sort of tenuous right

1171
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:59,690
those are people call them evolutionary

1172
00:40:57,019 --> 00:41:02,329
dead ends so you don't what do you do

1173
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:05,360
what mechanisms exist that both maintain

1174
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:07,549
fidelity the pollinator to the plant but

1175
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:10,220
also allow for diversity that also allow

1176
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:11,390
for you to change host plants or to find

1177
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:12,739
host plants and that may explain

1178
00:41:11,389 --> 00:41:14,929
diversification in both of these

1179
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:18,709
lineages and maybe even explain some of

1180
00:41:14,929 --> 00:41:20,599
this crazy phylogeny that we see what

1181
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:22,490
mechanisms keep us together that's what

1182
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:24,259
I really talked about today and I think

1183
00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:26,089
your therapist will tell you it's

1184
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,110
communication and eius and by osis

1185
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:30,289
biologists will tell you it's

1186
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:31,910
communication you have to make sure that

1187
00:41:30,289 --> 00:41:33,500
your signal is clear are you telling

1188
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:35,750
your partner what you mean to be telling

1189
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:37,550
them you have to understand how they

1190
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:39,170
perceive the signal are they even

1191
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:40,310
capable of perceiving a signal and

1192
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:41,920
showing up and being there at that

1193
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:44,570
moment to understand what you're saying

1194
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:48,430
what is their behavioral response right

1195
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:51,350
to the signal that you're producing and

1196
00:41:48,429 --> 00:41:53,089
and doesn't give you the desired outcome

1197
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:55,789
right does your communication give you

1198
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:57,470
the desired outcome and of course there

1199
00:41:55,789 --> 00:41:58,759
may be some hidden diversity and this is

1200
00:41:57,469 --> 00:42:00,409
something we talk a lot about and even

1201
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,060
something that Chelsey with her new Dean

1202
00:42:00,409 --> 00:42:04,460
position thinks a lot about there's

1203
00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:06,619
hidden diversity that allows us to show

1204
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:07,909
up and be present in this moment and is

1205
00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:09,980
things that we don't know about and that

1206
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:12,170
in biology have been less tractable

1207
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,269
until now but maybe there is something

1208
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:15,800
that is necessary before you can even

1209
00:42:14,269 --> 00:42:18,079
show up and be a part of this really

1210
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,090
changeup and then of course has there

1211
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,369
been any evolutionary innovation and I

1212
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:24,140
think that the really wonderful thing

1213
00:42:22,369 --> 00:42:25,519
about systems like this some systems

1214
00:42:24,139 --> 00:42:28,190
that we would call a component community

1215
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:30,710
is that meaning that it's something

1216
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:33,769
where there's a psych head over E is a

1217
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:35,360
unique and sort of unusual food source

1218
00:42:33,769 --> 00:42:37,789
and kind of extreme food source because

1219
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:40,039
of its toxicity and unique and extreme

1220
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:42,050
environments in nature we expect a lot

1221
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:44,980
of endemics and that's what we have

1222
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:47,000
cycad herbivores are almost exclusively

1223
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:49,969
except for these weird to try divorce

1224
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,590
but almost exclusively specialized on to

1225
00:42:49,969 --> 00:42:53,209
psych heads and feed on nothing else and

1226
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:54,740
when you have a system like that allows

1227
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:57,380
you to ask really wonderful questions

1228
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:58,699
looking at convergence and weave and you

1229
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:00,230
can see great examples in the literature

1230
00:42:58,699 --> 00:43:01,759
where people use convergence to

1231
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:03,769
understand molecular mechanisms and

1232
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,300
ecological mechanisms and we're having

1233
00:43:03,769 --> 00:43:07,219
some of the first evidence that there

1234
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,980
may be some sort of I'm not even sure

1235
00:43:07,219 --> 00:43:11,809
what you would call this an ecological

1236
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:14,269
convergence of interactions I'm not sure

1237
00:43:11,809 --> 00:43:16,219
but so because we have this great

1238
00:43:14,269 --> 00:43:19,099
component community of not just the

1239
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:20,539
butterflies but also the the the Beatles

1240
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:22,519
and the weevils we can ask questions

1241
00:43:20,539 --> 00:43:25,940
about what it means to be a cycad

1242
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:27,530
herbivore and with that I'll just thank

1243
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:29,990
everyone these are people that help

1244
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:31,460
specifically with this work James was

1245
00:43:29,989 --> 00:43:33,289
actually just here a couple weeks ago

1246
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,699
giving a talk he specifically helped me

1247
00:43:33,289 --> 00:43:36,139
with that behavioral arena and the

1248
00:43:34,699 --> 00:43:40,159
tracking he's responsible for that

1249
00:43:36,139 --> 00:43:41,539
amazing video not me and a lot of people

1250
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,069
that help specifically with the work I

1251
00:43:41,539 --> 00:43:44,119
really need to thank Montgomery

1252
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:46,100
Botanical Center this is the

1253
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:47,809
conservation garden down in Florida if

1254
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:50,779
any of you work on psych heads or palms

1255
00:43:47,809 --> 00:43:53,389
please go there they are highly

1256
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:55,550
dedicated to conserving these plants but

1257
00:43:53,389 --> 00:43:58,940
also to research they are there for you

1258
00:43:55,550 --> 00:44:01,789
and they do incredible work I did all

1259
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:03,320
this work as as a graduate student and

1260
00:44:01,789 --> 00:44:06,650
Noemi Pierce's lab and so you can see I

1261
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:08,330
was in a butterfly lab but I studied

1262
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:10,160
plants really she studies species

1263
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:13,039
interactions and then I just want to end

1264
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:14,899
by saying I'm on the board of the cycad

1265
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:16,279
Society which we send out quarterly

1266
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,500
newsletters related to psych head

1267
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,030
research dedicated to conservation and

1268
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,980
research and we even have some small

1269
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:24,440
grants for psych head related research

1270
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,909
and I brought some fliers for it if

1271
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,440
anyone's interested in joining it's a

1272
00:44:25,909 --> 00:44:29,750
great society there's flyers in the back

1273
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,510
and up here so please come

1274
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:34,489
to me if you're interested and that's it

1275
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:40,200
I take some questions if anyone has any

1276
00:44:34,489 --> 00:44:40,199
[Applause]

1277
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:46,010
honor in the cycad leads no so we have

1278
00:44:44,869 --> 00:44:47,659
that some of the work we've done down at

1279
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:49,010
Long hibiyo so they're specifically

1280
00:44:47,659 --> 00:44:50,480
looking even at the caller ID roots

1281
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:53,060
right and we're not finding a

1282
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,980
correlation of them being on the plant

1283
00:44:53,059 --> 00:45:10,670
tissue or even within the caller ID

1284
00:44:54,980 --> 00:45:12,920
roots so that so they're still ongoing

1285
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:14,900
debate about if BMAA is produced by the

1286
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:16,579
plants or the santa bacteria so santa

1287
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,889
bacteria is the only other place in in

1288
00:45:16,579 --> 00:45:20,539
nature that you find BMA and in fact

1289
00:45:18,889 --> 00:45:22,579
that's why it's so connected to

1290
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:24,259
Alzheimer's and ALS and that sort of

1291
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:26,900
stuff I mean they find BMA in the brains

1292
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:28,730
of these patients but there has been

1293
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,559
work where they've grown the plants in

1294
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:32,570
sterile conditions without the presence

1295
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:35,449
of sound of bacteria and find that they

1296
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:37,250
still produce BMAA and even that there's

1297
00:45:35,449 --> 00:45:38,779
sort of like a like sequester

1298
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:40,760
sequestering I guess to use an insect

1299
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:42,140
term of BMAA in certain tissues right

1300
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:45,170
that would be more than the sound of

1301
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:47,719
bacteria can produce so and dennis

1302
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:49,039
Stevenson who's a good friend and on my

1303
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:50,269
committee really strongly believes that

1304
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:52,400
there's been this horizontal gene

1305
00:45:50,269 --> 00:45:55,009
transfer from that and so of course I

1306
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,450
love him so I sort of believe it but I

1307
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:57,740
but I don't know I mean and you can

1308
00:45:56,449 --> 00:45:59,059
probably attest the difficulty it would

1309
00:45:57,739 --> 00:46:01,549
be to grow something without

1310
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:02,929
cyanobacteria getting into it right so

1311
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:07,310
that's kind of a problem with thinking

1312
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:09,109
about that that work but I don't know so

1313
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:10,909
that the reason that we chose BMAA

1314
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:12,890
in at long hibiyo to grow the bacteria

1315
00:46:10,909 --> 00:46:15,259
in the presence and absence of BMAA is

1316
00:46:12,889 --> 00:46:18,710
because we thought that BMAA would have

1317
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:21,830
more effect on bacteria than the mam

1318
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:24,289
glycosides right and we are finding

1319
00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:25,730
interesting stuff right so the idea of

1320
00:46:24,289 --> 00:46:27,469
growing bacteria in the presence and

1321
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:29,420
absence is saying how do i watch this

1322
00:46:27,469 --> 00:46:32,629
community of bacteria change over time

1323
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:34,909
and with with BMAA in the system are

1324
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:36,530
they using BMAA do we see BMAA change

1325
00:46:34,909 --> 00:46:40,670
its concentration change in the system

1326
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:41,930
and we do so understanding how exactly

1327
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:43,588
BMAA may have something to do with

1328
00:46:41,929 --> 00:46:45,298
bacteria is interesting

1329
00:46:43,588 --> 00:46:47,099
but I don't have the answer for you yet

1330
00:46:45,298 --> 00:46:50,518
and of course you know there's

1331
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:52,588
potentially great medical implications

1332
00:46:50,518 --> 00:46:54,958
for this right because of the connection

1333
00:46:52,588 --> 00:46:56,998
with Alzheimer's and and whatnot but I

1334
00:46:54,958 --> 00:47:01,879
don't have the answer for exactly what

1335
00:46:56,998 --> 00:47:01,879
it might be doing yeah yeah sorry

1336
00:47:03,588 --> 00:47:08,278
species where his face has to take down

1337
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:11,849
there else does it look like when we are

1338
00:47:08,278 --> 00:47:12,989
dying is a consistent signal and so

1339
00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:14,999
within my species

1340
00:47:12,989 --> 00:47:17,548
absolutely it's in every one I've ever

1341
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:19,649
tested and we have I've tested quite a

1342
00:47:17,548 --> 00:47:20,938
bit across Zambia and that's one of the

1343
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,949
things I'm doing here with Chelsea is

1344
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:24,478
looking at other phenotypes as well as

1345
00:47:22,949 --> 00:47:27,769
the volatile phenotypes across the

1346
00:47:24,478 --> 00:47:30,808
phylogeny and it is not common in in

1347
00:47:27,768 --> 00:47:31,978
Zambia it is found in one other it's

1348
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:33,749
found in two other species of

1349
00:47:31,978 --> 00:47:36,748
encephalitis which are like super

1350
00:47:33,748 --> 00:47:38,009
million years diverged in Africa but in

1351
00:47:36,748 --> 00:47:40,798
fact one of the things I didn't have a

1352
00:47:38,009 --> 00:47:41,938
chance to talk about is I've gone

1353
00:47:40,798 --> 00:47:43,920
further because I'm going in this idea

1354
00:47:41,938 --> 00:47:45,118
of coevolution and so here's the one

1355
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,539
that I showed you I'm just gonna call it

1356
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:50,519
the blue species 1/3 octave een and I

1357
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:52,259
I've done now another species because

1358
00:47:50,518 --> 00:47:53,848
this you have to use live weevils for

1359
00:47:52,259 --> 00:47:57,389
this to cut their heads off and stuff

1360
00:47:53,849 --> 00:47:58,829
and so since there's only two that I can

1361
00:47:57,389 --> 00:48:00,568
do that with right and so in this one

1362
00:47:58,829 --> 00:48:02,579
this plant produces vastly different

1363
00:48:00,568 --> 00:48:04,528
chemical compounds and the weevil

1364
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:07,048
responds to this is methyl salicylate

1365
00:48:04,528 --> 00:48:09,059
actually and they cannot perceive the

1366
00:48:07,048 --> 00:48:11,639
other host plant so this weevil cannot

1367
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:13,709
perceive 1/3 docketing and this weevil

1368
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:17,159
cannot perceive methyl salicylate so it

1369
00:48:13,708 --> 00:48:19,348
is not common within zania 1/3 arcanine

1370
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:21,088
but it is common within the larger or

1371
00:48:19,349 --> 00:48:25,939
not even common but does exist within

1372
00:48:21,088 --> 00:48:25,938
the larger group of psyche heads so

1373
00:48:32,268 --> 00:48:46,578
might come out incorrectly it seems to

1374
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:53,880
me that there's producers produced and

1375
00:48:46,579 --> 00:48:56,560
what this was the Coons and at this

1376
00:48:53,880 --> 00:49:00,630
point is the amount of

1377
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:03,849
then produced by the Millikan's is it

1378
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:11,410
they just mooing out because there isn't

1379
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:16,360
that much in producing something else

1380
00:49:11,409 --> 00:49:18,279
that attracts the Beavers yeah so I

1381
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:21,340
think that that kind of gets it two

1382
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,860
questions one is is insect tracking and

1383
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:25,150
insect signaling right and so when

1384
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:27,370
you're an insect can you have to travel

1385
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:28,960
a long distance your first connection is

1386
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:30,819
volatile right that's the thing that

1387
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,590
tracks you from a long distance until

1388
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:34,120
closer and that's usually when visual

1389
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:35,920
signaling kicks in and then of course

1390
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:37,989
you land and there's tactile simulating

1391
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,150
and gustatory receptors on the little

1392
00:49:37,989 --> 00:49:41,409
legs and stuff once they get in and

1393
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:43,210
remember because these are dioecious

1394
00:49:41,409 --> 00:49:44,769
plants these and they're you should see

1395
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:47,199
them they're like these big bushes right

1396
00:49:44,769 --> 00:49:48,909
so the weevils have to get out of that

1397
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:51,489
and I think they're sort of pushed out

1398
00:49:48,909 --> 00:49:54,190
of that because of that smell and then

1399
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:55,959
how they find the other one it they're

1400
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:58,720
likely still looking for the same smell

1401
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:02,019
that maybe at a lower signal but the

1402
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:04,209
cones their only other tracking would be

1403
00:50:02,019 --> 00:50:06,250
sort of a visual signaling to get to the

1404
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:08,349
female cones from that perspective so

1405
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:09,760
that's one of the reasons I want to work

1406
00:50:08,349 --> 00:50:10,839
with Robert do so is to think about

1407
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,430
things we know that there's

1408
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,019
thermogenesis involved which means that

1409
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:16,690
there's humidity and there's you know

1410
00:50:14,019 --> 00:50:18,489
even like thermal thermal signaling

1411
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:21,340
right that's involved that we would like

1412
00:50:18,489 --> 00:50:23,049
to look at it's possible that the pollen

1413
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:25,840
that the ovulate cones are acting as an

1414
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:27,490
attractant at that lower level right or

1415
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:30,760
it's possible that it's just completely

1416
00:50:27,489 --> 00:50:32,589
by mistake and that that the pollen

1417
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,000
cones active is an attractant at a lower

1418
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:36,190
level and a repellant at a higher level

1419
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,659
and it's really all about men but I'm

1420
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:40,179
like so sick of living in a world where

1421
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:41,409
it's all about men but I really want to

1422
00:50:40,179 --> 00:50:43,480
believe that the woman's making a choice

1423
00:50:41,409 --> 00:50:46,210
right but I do but I don't know I don't

1424
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:49,570
have that I don't have that that data to

1425
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:52,090
show right I have done like sticky traps

1426
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:53,559
near pollen cones and or ovulate cones

1427
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:56,019
and then sticky traps just sort of like

1428
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:57,690
in the world right and the ovulate cones

1429
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:59,590
do get more insects on the sticky traps

1430
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:02,500
then the ones that are out in the world

1431
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:04,630
but it's also chaotic you saw how many

1432
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:06,460
hundreds of insects are on a pollen cone

1433
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:08,470
all of a sudden it's just like a burst

1434
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:10,389
of weebles that are out and flying

1435
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:12,189
around it could totally be by accident

1436
00:51:10,389 --> 00:51:16,420
but in nature like that picture I showed

1437
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:17,860
in Panama some of these like you're not

1438
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,930
showing up and sing like a bunch of

1439
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:22,510
cycads really close to each other it's

1440
00:51:19,929 --> 00:51:26,500
they have to travel quite a ways right

1441
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:28,690
so how are they right that I don't know

1442
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:31,239
but it is true that in all psyche heads

1443
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:34,380
that the females have a lower level of

1444
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:36,579
that in all cycads we know that the the

1445
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:39,130
patterning is the same and it's at the

1446
00:51:36,579 --> 00:51:43,179
same time and that females produce less

1447
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:44,710
heat and less volatiles even even if

1448
00:51:43,179 --> 00:52:06,789
you're like correcting first size and

1449
00:51:44,710 --> 00:52:07,960
stuff like is that not well so if you

1450
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:10,179
think about you're an insect right your

1451
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:12,220
warrant your cold-blooded right so any

1452
00:52:10,179 --> 00:52:14,589
heat is gonna allow you to just warm up

1453
00:52:12,219 --> 00:52:16,480
your fly muscles which is going to make

1454
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:19,150
you more active so it's the same as like

1455
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,920
a chemical chemical process that you

1456
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:22,630
would do in organic chemistry with heat

1457
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,550
things just start like bumping around

1458
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:26,710
and moving around more so I believe

1459
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:28,750
unquestionably thermogenesis has some

1460
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:31,030
cue for the insects what's interesting

1461
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:32,860
is that you can in it you can elicit

1462
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:34,390
this behavior in both the thrips that

1463
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:36,340
were studied before and the weevils that

1464
00:52:34,389 --> 00:52:38,829
i've studied here regardless of

1465
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:40,420
temperature and we also know that the

1466
00:52:38,829 --> 00:52:41,980
temperature if you recall I showed that

1467
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:43,750
there's a temperature increase it's

1468
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:47,860
about thirty minutes before the volatile

1469
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:49,599
increase that we don't see them behavior

1470
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:52,660
really starting to happen and tell that

1471
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:54,670
thirty minutes which of course like is a

1472
00:52:52,659 --> 00:52:56,440
little window of time honestly right so

1473
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:58,329
a massive window of time but so I think

1474
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,679
that unquestionably thermogenesis has

1475
00:52:58,329 --> 00:53:01,150
something to do with it

1476
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:02,919
just because the weevils will become

1477
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:05,349
more active and they'll be more able to

1478
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:07,599
fly and more because these guys don't

1479
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:09,069
like they don't fly really and they even

1480
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,170
play dead when you're working on them

1481
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:12,309
they're sort of like I mean really it's

1482
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:13,840
kind of adorable and they lay there for

1483
00:53:12,309 --> 00:53:16,150
a while before they get up so

1484
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:17,410
temperature there's no way that you

1485
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:19,780
could have such a strong signal as a

1486
00:53:17,409 --> 00:53:22,089
plant and have it not have some some

1487
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:24,160
impact but the fact that you can create

1488
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:26,318
this behavior based just on that

1489
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:28,838
and like I said temperature also affects

1490
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:30,338
humidity which affects all kinds of

1491
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:31,808
stuff right so that's a lot what I want

1492
00:53:30,338 --> 00:53:52,659
to work out is like what are all of the

1493
00:53:31,809 --> 00:53:55,690
signals she's around this has been a

1494
00:53:52,659 --> 00:53:59,909
production of Cornell University on the

1495
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:59,909
web at Cornell edu
