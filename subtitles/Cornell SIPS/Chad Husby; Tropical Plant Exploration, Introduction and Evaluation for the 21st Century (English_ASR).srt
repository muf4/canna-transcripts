1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,810
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:08,809
University well it's a real honor to be

3
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:12,018
here and you know there's some

4
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:14,329
fascinating connections between South

5
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:17,420
Florida and Cornell that I want to first

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:21,198
introduce you to before delving into our

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:23,720
topic here and this first photo actually

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,670
gives a hint of that this is a scene

9
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:28,009
from the opening day of Fairchild

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:31,130
tropical Botanic Garden at that time

11
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:33,770
called Fairchild tropical garden in 1938

12
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:35,899
and a great figure from Cornell was

13
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,580
there dr. Liberty High Bailey and he's

14
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:41,119
standing right next to David Fairchild

15
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:44,359
for whom the garden was named and then

16
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:46,369
there was Robert Montgomery who was the

17
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:49,759
impetus behind the founding of a lot of

18
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:52,729
these gardens in South Florida and they

19
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:56,420
all were converging in in one place and

20
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:58,669
I want to share with you some of the

21
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,250
great little passages that I've been

22
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,679
able to unearth from our archives of

23
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,629
what these figures had to say about each

24
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,510
other and the times they were they were

25
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:11,479
in and so this is Robert Montgomery who

26
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:14,359
actually provided the funds and the land

27
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,100
for these gardens in South Florida who

28
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:17,870
was originally from Connecticut and was

29
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:21,079
a self-taught accountant and tax lawyer

30
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:23,150
whose hobby was trees and you know he

31
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:24,799
has a gift for great compelling titles

32
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:28,240
for books you can see there are 50 years

33
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:31,310
of Accountancy was his autobiography and

34
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:33,379
but he had a great understated sense of

35
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,000
sense of humor as well but he was

36
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:38,060
mentioning how at the opening of the

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,620
garden the great figures who got it

38
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,560
started including him mentioned dr.

39
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:44,630
Bailey first dr. Fairchild some other

40
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,790
great figures here of the botanical

41
00:01:44,629 --> 00:01:49,129
world and at that time and publishing

42
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:54,320
Rolfe and but he says if you're not

43
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:56,539
thrilled I'm sorry for you garden so and

44
00:01:54,319 --> 00:02:00,439
this was a photo that David Fairchild

45
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,969
took of dr. Bailey's address at the at

46
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:03,439
the inauguration of the garden so

47
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:05,959
there's dr. Bailey there it's pretty

48
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:10,699
dark but that's that was him and the

49
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:14,009
23rd of March in 1938 and and these were

50
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:16,768
some key words that dr. Bailey shared

51
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:18,689
with assembled crowd there that the

52
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:20,640
garden was he had a lot of admiration

53
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:24,120
for David Fairchild who when they went

54
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:26,699
back long ways to another land-grant

55
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:31,140
institution Michigan State University

56
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:32,818
where dr. Bailey studied and where David

57
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:37,199
Fairchild grew up as his father was

58
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:39,268
there and and so but and dr. Bailey

59
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,939
wanted this garden not only to be a

60
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:45,420
great honor to dr. Fairchild and whatnot

61
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:48,539
but also to be a place for rejuvenation

62
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:52,679
and to and to study the processes of

63
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:55,949
nature in the tropics and this was and

64
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,810
dr. Bailey came repeatedly in the latter

65
00:02:55,949 --> 00:03:00,719
years of his life to the annual members

66
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,759
meetings so it was him standing next to

67
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,939
no Montgomery Jennings Robert

68
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:10,739
Montgomery's wife and down there in

69
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:13,949
South Florida 1939 the next year and and

70
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:16,680
then later in 1947

71
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:18,568
dr. Bailey came with his with his

72
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,659
daughter also had a big role to play

73
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:26,668
here and I know in me Bailey Hort aureum

74
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:28,469
yeah so some beautiful words about about

75
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:30,480
their history together that he was a

76
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:33,239
little boy at Michigan Agricultural

77
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,518
College back then when he was able to

78
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,200
see dr. Bailey at work when he was only

79
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,129
a little boy and then seven years later

80
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,949
I was able to honor him and have him

81
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:50,608
speak of the garden that was named after

82
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:52,530
dr. Fairchild and and so this part was

83
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:54,120
very just said etc etc from all the

84
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,459
different and accomplishments of dr.

85
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,739
Bailey but you know but he says when he

86
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,840
was reading what he had done there would

87
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:06,750
have been a shorter task to talk about

88
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:09,480
what he had not that and and he went on

89
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,759
to talk about the great emotion at that

90
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,229
moments when he was a when if I thought

91
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,179
he was and turned out to be the last

92
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:21,389
time that dr. Bailey would come to the

93
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:23,500
garden and he also said that them you

94
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:25,210
know you know I do not think you can

95
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,430
if I feel the emotion of this moment

96
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:29,229
there are manses of this event which we

97
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,660
have with us today not only the great

98
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:34,840
Liberty High Bailey but his world known

99
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,100
and distinguished daughter Ethel Zoe who

100
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:37,509
has been the life companion and

101
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,400
botanical assistant of her father

102
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:41,289
through the wonderful years of his

103
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:46,359
botanical and horticultural explorations

104
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:47,800
and and he was proud to have lived to

105
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,720
see this moment and proud to introduce

106
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:54,009
these two great forces plants and then

107
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,410
at the end we don't actually know if he

108
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:58,930
said all this whoops because at the end

109
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,130
he had this little note said this is

110
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,530
what he wanted to say but you probably

111
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:04,389
would forget to say something

112
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:07,869
it's always fun looking at archives

113
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:11,500
because you get to hear their voices and

114
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:14,379
and dr. Fairchild visited Cornell in

115
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,819
1938 after the opening of the garden so

116
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:19,240
these are some photos in our archive

117
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:21,189
from that visit in June of the of the

118
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,840
Bailey port Orion plantings at that time

119
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:28,529
some raised beds they had there and

120
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:31,449
there's an Ethel Zoey working with

121
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:37,000
another assistance of dr. Bailey's and

122
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:38,709
in the workroom and a man Liberty High

123
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,240
Bailey also had great admiration for

124
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:44,319
David Fairchild um don't you know he's

125
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,478
everybody you know it's interesting to

126
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:49,259
think of how these these figures at that

127
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:52,990
time were really major public

128
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:54,819
intellectuals major public you know

129
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:56,350
people who were interpreting science to

130
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:58,180
the public whereas today you know we

131
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,850
don't hear as many horticultural figures

132
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,139
who've reached this status and so it was

133
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,450
kind of refreshing to know that there

134
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:07,120
was a time and hopefully hopefully will

135
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:09,399
be again they both wrote these very

136
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,569
influential in quite popular books like

137
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:15,549
this was about some he was reviewing

138
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:17,889
David Fairchild's and appreciating David

139
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,990
Fairchild exploring for plants his first

140
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:22,180
book David Ferriero alone only wrote

141
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:24,418
four books and Bailey wrote many more

142
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,418
and

143
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:29,250
mentioning how just his enthusiasm and

144
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,989
the way he expressed himself was

145
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:36,160
something that was very refreshing and

146
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:38,170
charming and and then the Fairchild

147
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,240
garden has a beautiful part of the

148
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:43,930
garden that's actually dedicated to dr.

149
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,699
Bailey Bailey palm Glade and like the

150
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,410
Fairchild roat's a very long and

151
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:49,870
beautiful appreciation of Liberty High

152
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:52,510
Bailey as part of his effort to raise

153
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,730
support for construction of this which

154
00:06:52,509 --> 00:07:00,099
still is a central part of the garden

155
00:06:54,730 --> 00:07:03,040
and and once again reflecting on on what

156
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,780
he experienced in this little boy on the

157
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,800
campus of him Michigan State

158
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:13,509
Agricultural College and where he first

159
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:16,600
experienced horticulture and and

160
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:18,519
professor Bailey's leather life he

161
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,230
focused a lot on palms which were a big

162
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:22,000
part of why these gardens in South

163
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:25,210
Florida came to be because Robert

164
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,189
Montgomery was real palm enthusiast when

165
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:29,500
he got tired of the winters in the

166
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:31,209
Northeast he bought a winter home and

167
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,769
started collecting homes and there's a

168
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:34,539
lot of correspondence between him and

169
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:37,870
dr. Bailey about which calls to include

170
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:39,879
in the collection and and then that

171
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:46,689
turned into a eventually a public garden

172
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:49,240
and and so they're mentioning that he

173
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:51,399
was mentioning that this is a reason why

174
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,460
they needed the Center for Palms here in

175
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:57,429
the tropics in South Florida and this is

176
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:59,409
the back in the early 40s they when they

177
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:03,189
were just constructing the Liberty the

178
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:05,560
Bailey palm Glade and then what it looks

179
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:07,899
like today so it's grown in quite a bit

180
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,668
since then and it wasn't much the worse

181
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:12,759
for wear after the hurricane so we have

182
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:16,029
some more planting to do there and this

183
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:20,019
is the memorial plaque it's hit the

184
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:25,659
empty overlook there for the Bailey Palm

185
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:27,430
Glade and we also have the privilege of

186
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,560
featuring of one of the most spectacular

187
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,480
poems in the world which is named after

188
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,320
dr. Bailey copra nice iya Bailey Jana

189
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:38,180
the Bailey poem from Cuba and it said as

190
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,159
it gets older it develops this wonderful

191
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:42,918
that looks like almost like a concrete

192
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:45,819
pillar and it's a slow-growing poem but

193
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:47,960
very robust and has this beautifully

194
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,370
geometrical crown that leaves are very

195
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,700
stiff very fan-like

196
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:57,610
and it's one of the most prized poems

197
00:08:52,700 --> 00:09:00,470
that there is that was definitely I am a

198
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:02,060
great honor and one of the thing one of

199
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,889
the letters I found between Fairchild

200
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:07,699
and Bailey was about like what's going

201
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:09,830
to happen with them after they after

202
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,649
they pass on and others have to take up

203
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:14,720
the work and in many ways that's what

204
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:16,730
we're all doing we're carrying on the

205
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,720
work of these great founders of these

206
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:22,970
institutions and and there's still a lot

207
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,100
of progress being made as as Professor

208
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,839
Bailey predicted to you that the some of

209
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,920
the effort despite the fact that we all

210
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:33,190
have our own interests and our own foci

211
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:37,699
we're still bringing things forward and

212
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:40,580
that brings us to the tropics and which

213
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:43,550
is where most of the action is in the

214
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:45,740
plant kingdom and we know that even more

215
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:49,879
precisely than we did back back in the

216
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:52,370
days of Fairchild and Bailey that's you

217
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:55,000
know in basically the entire North

218
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:57,200
temperate forest area we have about

219
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,889
eleven hundred and sixty-six tree

220
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,690
species but in half a square kilometre

221
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:07,330
in Borneo you have actually more tree

222
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:09,950
species berries and and also in Ecuador

223
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:13,220
about that same same number of tree

224
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:15,560
species so the tropics are unbelievably

225
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:18,440
rich compared to the temperate zone so

226
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:20,899
that's where most of the most of the

227
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,420
plants are and most of the threatened

228
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:27,519
plants as you would expect are also in

229
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:30,469
that area where where the plants are and

230
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,778
and David Fairchild wrote quite

231
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,570
poetically about the importance of

232
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:38,028
understanding exploring the tropics that

233
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,920
he you know he grew up in Michigan up in

234
00:10:38,028 --> 00:10:41,720
the north tempered zone and also spend a

235
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,189
lot of his career in Washington DC

236
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,040
working for the US Department of

237
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,839
Agriculture but got a chance early on to

238
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:50,059
start traveling through the tropics and

239
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,160
to see that

240
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:54,709
tropics are where where you find most of

241
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:57,789
the plants and most of the remarkable

242
00:10:54,710 --> 00:11:00,200
animal diversity so I really can't new

243
00:10:57,789 --> 00:11:05,990
life on earth without knowing the

244
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:07,879
tropics and and also toward the end of

245
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,080
his life Liberty High Bailey was was

246
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:10,850
spending more and more time in the

247
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,180
tropics studying poems and this is

248
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:18,110
showing in the pressing home specimens

249
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:19,939
in Florida and but this was when he was

250
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,070
he was in his 80s and he was in Trinidad

251
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,570
working with poems and he was talking

252
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:26,090
about how being there despite the

253
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:28,940
discomfort extends the boundaries of

254
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:30,889
life so that because the world is such a

255
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:35,630
big place in such an incredibly diverse

256
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:37,639
place to explore in the tropics and so

257
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:39,860
we have a lot of plant work to explore a

258
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:41,480
lot of you know there's still most of

259
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,909
those plants in the tropics haven't been

260
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,090
cultivated even many of the useful ones

261
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:48,980
haven't been brought back yet but there

262
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:51,410
are challenges because even though there

263
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,879
are lots of things that make working

264
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:54,079
with plants easier in the modern era

265
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:58,100
there are some things that make it more

266
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:00,379
difficult many countries have

267
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,960
implemented a lot of restrictions on

268
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:05,629
collecting from the wild due to changes

269
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,700
in intellectual property laws and

270
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:09,470
perspectives worldwide which led to the

271
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:13,670
Convention on Biological Diversity and

272
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:17,269
other United Nations conventions and the

273
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:20,719
fled countries to want to make it harder

274
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:22,509
to access their biodiversity and we're

275
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,120
becoming more and more aware of

276
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:28,039
potential risks to ecological concerns

277
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,500
of introduced plants and animals and

278
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:33,110
some of them we know that have become

279
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:39,019
problems in various regions of the world

280
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:41,629
and various concerns about also of the

281
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:44,659
problems caused by by pests that come

282
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:47,720
along with plants have led to increasing

283
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:50,059
complexity of import restrictions and

284
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,340
the US Department of Agriculture for

285
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:54,319
many years has it basically a innocent

286
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,690
until proven guilty approach with plants

287
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,700
and they are gradually shifting to a

288
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:02,450
guilty until proven innocent approach so

289
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,500
various generate are being prohibited

290
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,530
from entering

291
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:09,950
didn't used to be and there's a they put

292
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:11,659
together all of the current regulations

293
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,640
of the USDA are in one document now you

294
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:15,199
can find as a PDF fortunately because

295
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:18,590
it's all it's already over twelve

296
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:21,620
hundred pages long so it's a it's more

297
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:23,870
complicated to navigate and ever but

298
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:28,250
it's still possible to do a lot of work

299
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:32,860
and so to elaborate a little bit on some

300
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:35,259
of these challenges of the 21st century

301
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:38,389
where we're in the period of transition

302
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:42,529
for most of human heritage for most of

303
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:44,960
human history plants move pretty freely

304
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:46,879
worldwide indigenous peoples tended to

305
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,710
bring their useful plants from place to

306
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,320
place like the breadfruit is a famous

307
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,700
example moving across the Pacific people

308
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,580
often brought there useful plant you

309
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,770
know the clutch corn moved into the

310
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:00,710
Americas from Mexico by the various

311
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:03,379
indigenous peoples and in most countries

312
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:05,210
rely on foreign plants for their close

313
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:10,580
to their food and fiber and other

314
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:12,200
applications and a most of when

315
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,450
varieties would then be improved and

316
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:18,800
selected they would be free to be shared

317
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:21,590
with everyone as starting in the early

318
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,449
80s especially when patenting of genes

319
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:26,570
and patenting of living things started

320
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:28,430
to be a big factor that became actually

321
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:31,640
legal first in the US and then a lot of

322
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:33,859
the developed world's instead of these

323
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:36,559
improved varieties being being freely

324
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,600
shared to those countries for example

325
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,819
from which the original germ plasm came

326
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,580
they were now being sold back to those

327
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:45,770
countries that were being forced to to

328
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:48,500
abide by the patent regimes of the

329
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:51,500
developed world's and this led to to

330
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:54,049
those countries restricting access not

331
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,299
wanting their germ plasm to be moved out

332
00:14:54,049 --> 00:14:57,979
of their country and then freely and

333
00:14:56,299 --> 00:15:01,159
then being sold back to them that was

334
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:05,720
understandably seen as as as what's

335
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:08,990
called bio piracy and and so this is a

336
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,970
good little summary of the state of

337
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:13,240
things by a wonderful international

338
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:16,250
lawyer sabrina Safran who negotiated

339
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,879
some of these trees on behalf of the

340
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,578
united state

341
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:21,319
and has done written probably the best

342
00:15:19,578 --> 00:15:23,988
articles explaining how things have

343
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:28,519
changed and how they might change in the

344
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:32,329
future that basically we have moved from

345
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:34,009
a plate from this world where where are

346
00:15:32,328 --> 00:15:37,008
things where was basically a commons

347
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:38,449
free a freely available genetic

348
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:40,068
resources weren't the property of

349
00:15:38,448 --> 00:15:43,269
governments they weren't the property of

350
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:48,259
corporations and now we have not only

351
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:50,778
governments and corporations but also of

352
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:52,639
often many times indigenous peoples are

353
00:15:50,778 --> 00:15:55,100
also claiming claiming ownership of

354
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,928
their genetic resources to in hopes that

355
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,749
they won't get they won't get taken by

356
00:15:56,928 --> 00:16:01,578
these other entities so and then those

357
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:04,579
of us who are working with plants for

358
00:16:01,578 --> 00:16:07,099
horticulture with plants for for basic

359
00:16:04,578 --> 00:16:09,258
scientific research often get caught in

360
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:14,479
the middle of these forces that are

361
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:16,038
still still being worked out today so

362
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:17,689
that's something that's still in

363
00:16:16,038 --> 00:16:20,208
progress and we'll talk a little bit

364
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:23,178
more about that later but I want to

365
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:25,278
mention the another of the big factors

366
00:16:23,178 --> 00:16:26,749
that's change in our perception and how

367
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:29,749
we deal with plants is the issue of

368
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:32,449
invasive species the issue of native

369
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:36,319
versus non-native species and much of

370
00:16:32,448 --> 00:16:39,528
this debate hinges on philosophy as much

371
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:41,208
as science and values because a lot of

372
00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:44,149
public policy issues that interface with

373
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:47,358
science or issues of value as much as

374
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:48,889
they are of actual data but we a few

375
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,499
years ago we did a little study to try

376
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:54,168
to try to actually include some data in

377
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:56,058
consideration of this issue we looked at

378
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:58,188
plants that the fairchild garden had

379
00:16:56,058 --> 00:17:00,408
distributed as part of its plant sales

380
00:16:58,188 --> 00:17:05,438
and distributions in the early days

381
00:17:00,408 --> 00:17:07,808
before from 1955 to 1979 i was before

382
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,189
there was a much concern about

383
00:17:07,808 --> 00:17:13,128
non-native plants and invasive plants

384
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:15,350
and we matched them with ex situ

385
00:17:13,128 --> 00:17:17,958
conservation species that had come into

386
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:19,969
the garden since then plants that in

387
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:22,269
nature were more restricted and were

388
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:27,129
brought in for other purposes besides

389
00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:28,509
just bigger in cultivation and

390
00:17:27,128 --> 00:17:29,769
interesting enough

391
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:31,480
found that there certainly were some

392
00:17:29,769 --> 00:17:33,309
differences that in this if we'd use

393
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,990
this system called the Australian weed

394
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:37,990
risk assessment system which you can

395
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:39,819
adapt to different regions which uses a

396
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,700
you score a bunch of different variables

397
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:44,769
like how prolific it is you know whether

398
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,450
how widespread it is in nature how its

399
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:49,450
seeds are dispersed whatnot with

400
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:51,430
environments it grows in and it's a way

401
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:55,029
to integrate all that information into a

402
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:56,650
risk assessment and and so basically

403
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:58,960
there are several categories there's

404
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:01,360
accept which is the clear area here and

405
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,759
then there's evaluate further meaning

406
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,469
there's not enough there's some concern

407
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,019
but there's not enough information and

408
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:10,150
then there's reject and of all the

409
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:12,190
species we evaluated there was only one

410
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,900
of those horticultural introductions

411
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,630
that was in the reject category there

412
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,519
were more that we're in the evaluate

413
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,810
category and the conservation species

414
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:22,930
there was only one that was in

415
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:24,460
evaluation category so it wasn't there

416
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:26,350
weren't a lot of these plants falling

417
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,299
into a high-risk category and in fact

418
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:31,059
even those that were in the evaluate

419
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:34,450
category were just just barely above

420
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:36,519
zero which is the cutoff so whereas the

421
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,370
conservation species were well below so

422
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:40,990
generally we the the risk didn't look to

423
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:43,299
be all that great although there are

424
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:44,470
certainly of the thousands of species

425
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:47,079
that have been introduced into the u.s.

426
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,490
a few have become problems some of them

427
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:51,699
here of course and some of them in the

428
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:53,049
more tropical areas but I think it's

429
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,029
important to keep it and put it in

430
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:56,740
context and we need to be aware of that

431
00:18:55,029 --> 00:19:01,059
some species will pose a risk but that

432
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:04,539
most don't and and so I think that's a

433
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:07,899
good baseline to to use for starting to

434
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:09,970
evaluate whether plants whether you know

435
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:14,259
how we we interface with non-native

436
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:16,120
species and there's also the danger of

437
00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:17,769
guilt by association that sometimes

438
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:19,479
people we have some of the earliest

439
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:21,970
introductions of a given family are

440
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,650
given genus was usually easiest to grow

441
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:26,620
and so that was most likely to be a

442
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:28,300
problem and then all other members of

443
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:31,029
that group and it tend to be looked down

444
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:33,809
on later and such as the Australian

445
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:36,519
Pines the cassia Ryan is in Florida are

446
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:38,679
considered quite quite aggressive and

447
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:41,049
they certainly score very high on the

448
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,310
Australian weed risk assessment but then

449
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:44,829
in the same family but

450
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:46,750
looks fairly similar gymnast Toma which

451
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:48,250
I collage eclis is very very different

452
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,740
though it's a very close relative of the

453
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,509
kazarina's that scores a low risk and

454
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:54,640
it's been whining for fifty years and

455
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:56,500
hasn't been a problem and I think that's

456
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,110
a good baseline if it's in Hawaii for a

457
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:01,210
long time and hasn't spread because just

458
00:19:59,109 --> 00:20:04,839
by any plant can find a niche in Hawaii

459
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:06,880
that it likes so but once again if we

460
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:08,259
were to just kind of say well all the

461
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,800
plants in this family must be bad

462
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:14,890
because when genus was bad we would be

463
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:19,899
writing off a lot of beautiful plants

464
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:21,580
and very that aren't a risk but despite

465
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:25,750
you know some of these challenges that

466
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:27,549
complicate plant introduction there's a

467
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,109
there are some factors in the modern

468
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:31,629
world that make plants introduction

469
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:35,619
actually facilitated and such as the

470
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:37,150
rapidity of transportation is even you

471
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:39,579
know fifty years ago it was much harder

472
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:42,340
to move plants quickly and you know when

473
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:44,230
you taking cuttings or old plants how

474
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:46,750
long they spend in a dark box or on a

475
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:48,819
ship or on a cargo hold of a plane and

476
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,799
what temperature the cargo hold of the

477
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:52,899
plane is those are all big limitations

478
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:56,680
on what on how much success you will

479
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:58,990
have and the exchange of botanical and

480
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:01,720
horticultural information is just risen

481
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:03,970
exponentially so now people can learn

482
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,240
about what plants might be promising for

483
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,470
food what might be promising for as

484
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,140
beautiful plants or what plants might be

485
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,059
even risky as invasive all that

486
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,280
information is so much more rapidly

487
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:17,619
available now we can really collaborate

488
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:20,649
with people overseas so much more easily

489
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:24,009
and that and that's facilitated things

490
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:26,640
quite a bit and and there is a growing

491
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:30,069
interest in in tropical plant diversity

492
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,350
especially in Asia there's a there's a

493
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:35,439
Thailand has just exploded in the last

494
00:21:32,349 --> 00:21:37,089
15 20 years with interest you know there

495
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,850
are small nurseries going all kinds of

496
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:43,990
amazing plants there China has become

497
00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:45,730
actually a great great economic engine

498
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,140
for a lot of that horticultural activity

499
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:49,269
in Thailand and elsewhere because

500
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,740
there's so much demand now as the

501
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:52,389
economy has improved there and there's a

502
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:55,839
lot of appreciation for the beauty of

503
00:21:52,390 --> 00:22:00,310
tropical plants same in Japan and

504
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:02,109
and in the certain segments of even in

505
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:04,240
the u.s. there's increasing interest for

506
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:05,829
example and the world of air rights we

507
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,509
just had a big arrow I'd show at

508
00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:08,919
Fairchild Garden and we everybody was

509
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:10,839
coming at how many young people were

510
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:13,360
there because they're now popular

511
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:15,490
houseplants and people are getting

512
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:17,849
excited about all the different types

513
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:23,799
that can be available and can be grown

514
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:26,649
and and the horticulture fortunately

515
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:30,460
provides a way to work with the changing

516
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:33,790
international regime of accessing plant

517
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:35,920
genetic resources because many countries

518
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:38,379
view horticulture very differently than

519
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,940
maybe you going directly to the wild and

520
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,630
collecting something for a scientific

521
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:45,670
project because some countries are

522
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:47,620
fostering the development of their own

523
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:49,060
horticultural industries and may of

524
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:51,459
course want them to be able to sell

525
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:53,109
plants overseas and they see that the

526
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:55,150
benefits of that coming back to their

527
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:58,419
countries in the form of money which is

528
00:22:55,150 --> 00:23:00,280
easiest benefit to see and countries

529
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,810
like Ecuador where be very difficult

530
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:03,369
it's often very challenging you get

531
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:07,869
permits to do anything that requires

532
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:09,789
bringing plants back but if you work

533
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:11,559
with nurseries there they can bring a

534
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:15,059
wonderful new plants into cultivation

535
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:17,889
and that can then be freely shared and

536
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:20,349
for the for the benefit enjoyment of all

537
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:22,300
and that's happening in many many

538
00:23:20,349 --> 00:23:23,980
countries because it's a way that

539
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:25,480
countries seed benefits from their

540
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,700
biodiversity coming back to their

541
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:31,019
country and we can benefit by enjoying

542
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:33,789
those plants in horticulture and and

543
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:35,680
that's that's pretty encouraging and in

544
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:38,109
countries like Thailand especially are

545
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:41,470
showing just the tremendous potential of

546
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:44,589
that we're huge economic sectors of the

547
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:46,990
economy are are being built on this and

548
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:51,119
basically the plant biodiversity and

549
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:51,120
enjoyment of it and

550
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,940
and another another aspect that's

551
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:58,259
becoming at least more appreciated in

552
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,029
the Botanical Garden world and is

553
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:03,299
starting to actually be appreciated

554
00:24:00,029 --> 00:24:05,369
internationally is that introduction of

555
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:08,849
new plants can sometimes save species

556
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:10,679
and save genetic diversity because

557
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:12,089
sometimes there's a growing number of

558
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,100
cases where one person or one

559
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:16,169
institution just with interest in

560
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:18,569
growing a plant that's endangered or

561
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,980
rare in the wild has saved that plant

562
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:22,558
and that plant could then be repatriated

563
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:25,500
to the country of origin showing that

564
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:28,920
you know the planted reduction effort

565
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:33,150
can have you know huge huge conservation

566
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:36,029
benefits and plants that are now very

567
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:39,570
very rare in the wild as when people are

568
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:42,299
now with an advent of genetic technology

569
00:24:39,569 --> 00:24:44,220
for looking at population genetics have

570
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:46,289
been discovering that some of these old

571
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:48,000
garden collections have alleles that are

572
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:50,250
now no longer far out in the wild

573
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,049
population there's a point interesting

574
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:53,970
recent case is the double coconut and

575
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:55,919
the world produces the world's largest

576
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:57,150
seed and they're old collections in the

577
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,000
same port in the Singapore Botanic

578
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:02,009
Garden that were introduced in the 30s

579
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,990
and when they started doing population

580
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:05,759
genetics I found the quite a few alleles

581
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:07,049
in that and those cultivated plants that

582
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,119
aren't found in the Seychelles where

583
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:11,849
it's needed anymore so it's been able to

584
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:15,199
extend the genetic conservation of that

585
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:19,529
species and some very very rare species

586
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,150
are able to be backed up in cultivation

587
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:22,319
the entire you know all their genetic

588
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:24,420
diversity because you can take cuttings

589
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:26,369
from all the extant plants and grow them

590
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:30,509
in a fairly small face in a greenhouse

591
00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:32,159
and you know make sure that however

592
00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:33,539
whatever happens with the pressures on

593
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,269
the native environment there will least

594
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:38,250
be a backup of that genetic diversity

595
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:42,480
that can be returned once things

596
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:46,319
stabilized in situ and and we certainly

597
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:49,289
need more diversity in the world of food

598
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:52,159
and ornamental plants and just plants

599
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:54,960
are appreciated for their wonder because

600
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,640
despite all the advances in agriculture

601
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,220
and horticulture in the last century

602
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,220
we've still only 12 crops or supplying

603
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:04,079
80% of the world's food and when we have

604
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,710
30,000 species that are known to be

605
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,599
edible and that's just with other

606
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,909
plants that doesn't include medicinal

607
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,829
plants and all the other and this is an

608
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:14,528
example at fair trial we have a major

609
00:26:11,829 --> 00:26:17,589
program of mango diversity and we have

610
00:26:14,528 --> 00:26:20,648
over 300 mango cultivars at San offsites

611
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:22,359
garden that we have and each July we

612
00:26:20,648 --> 00:26:24,158
feature this tremendous cultivar

613
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:27,639
diversity all the flavors and textures

614
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:29,909
when most people experience mangos

615
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:32,200
especially in temperate climates they

616
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:34,778
you know they're they're just having one

617
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,880
usually one cultivar that ships well has

618
00:26:34,778 --> 00:26:40,019
a lot of fiber in it it's not nowhere

619
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,730
near as nice as a mango can be and

620
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:44,379
whereas the the potential for this fruit

621
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:45,849
is tremendous and then their main fruits

622
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:51,100
whose potential has been far less

623
00:26:45,849 --> 00:26:52,808
explored than the mango and and one that

624
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:54,298
one of the places where this some

625
00:26:52,808 --> 00:26:58,058
there's been an interface between

626
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:59,470
conservation and and food has been the

627
00:26:58,058 --> 00:27:01,658
breadfruit Institute at the National

628
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:03,579
Tropical Botanic Garden Hawaii and this

629
00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:05,740
is an example of where one person dr.

630
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:07,449
Diana Oni who did their PhD on

631
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,140
breadfruit in the Pacific back in the

632
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,210
late 80s

633
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:12,038
she went throughout the Pacific and

634
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,390
collected fruits from the different

635
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:15,879
islands and brought them back to the

636
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,840
National tropical Botanic Garden and in

637
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,700
the succeeding years

638
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:21,038
there are many of those islands where

639
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,630
they're as they're the cultures are

640
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:25,179
going through urbanization and different

641
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:27,490
economic changes they would lose their

642
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:28,929
their their native breadfruit cultivars

643
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:31,058
that had been developed on their

644
00:27:28,929 --> 00:27:32,798
individual islands but many of those

645
00:27:31,058 --> 00:27:35,678
were saved at the breadfruit Institute

646
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:38,859
and be returned to those islands and

647
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,480
also made available or feeding hungry

648
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:42,969
people throughout the tropics and now a

649
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,250
tissue culturing several new varieties

650
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:47,649
each year and just making them freely

651
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:49,089
available to countries in the world that

652
00:27:47,648 --> 00:27:51,719
that are interested in this very

653
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:53,769
nutritious and low-maintenance food that

654
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,089
we're you which you can grow just by

655
00:27:53,769 --> 00:27:59,980
anywhere where there isn't where there

656
00:27:55,089 --> 00:28:02,339
isn't frost or cold weather and and some

657
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:04,870
other really great examples of how

658
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:07,178
horticulture can actually save species

659
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:08,648
through their just some enthusiasm and

660
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:11,019
through sometimes moving the plants

661
00:28:08,648 --> 00:28:13,418
around out of there out of where they

662
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:16,388
were native this is actually this is a

663
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:18,159
hibiscus relative in Hawaii that just

664
00:28:16,388 --> 00:28:19,250
thanks to a few people who decided to

665
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,910
graph it

666
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:26,029
um it's not not in danger of extinction

667
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:28,070
there's only a few genotypes left but it

668
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:29,990
was just down to one tree several and

669
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:31,279
several times several occasions and if

670
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:34,849
they hadn't brought it to the Botanic

671
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:36,980
Gardens it would be extinct and one of

672
00:28:34,849 --> 00:28:39,230
the few modern horticulturists to make

673
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:41,150
it to celebrity status good friend of

674
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:45,890
mine Carlos Magdalena have two gardens

675
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:47,900
has become a bit you know a bit of a

676
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:50,600
celebrity by saving some really

677
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:52,280
prominent plants from extinction plants

678
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:54,139
that were sometimes called the Living

679
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:55,849
Dead where they're down to one

680
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,830
individual and they can't propagate it

681
00:28:55,849 --> 00:29:00,589
they may have a disease that's flowing

682
00:28:57,829 --> 00:29:03,470
down its metabolism like this is which

683
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:05,599
was the case with this beautiful coffee

684
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:07,339
relative ramos-montigny Rodrigue SEI

685
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:12,980
which is endemic to the island of

686
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:14,839
mauritius and he kept trying to torture

687
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:16,819
different different individuals of this

688
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:18,319
plant that it would not set seed on its

689
00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:21,079
own and there was only one clone left

690
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:22,460
and eventually growing one you know in a

691
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:24,679
certain way that was a little stressful

692
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:26,720
he got one one seed to develop a viable

693
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,950
embryo and the germinate and then he

694
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,620
could cross that seedling with

695
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:33,470
appearance and because he just would not

696
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:35,659
give up on this beautiful rare plant it

697
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:37,850
wasn't because he had tremendous

698
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:40,190
resources behind him to do this a lot of

699
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:41,929
staff to help him it was because he

700
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:44,630
cared and that's I think a very

701
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:47,029
empowering message about plant

702
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:49,190
conservation is that even though in in

703
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:50,960
many cases hard to influence governments

704
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:53,509
it's hard to influence international

705
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,819
trends but one person can make a

706
00:29:53,509 --> 00:29:57,920
difference for a species and I think

707
00:29:55,819 --> 00:29:59,389
that's a that's a beautiful aspect of

708
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:04,519
horticulture that we need to talk about

709
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:07,100
more and a recent example of this even

710
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:08,839
more recent is I just happened in the

711
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:12,169
wake of Hurricane Maria which struck

712
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:13,849
Berto Rico um late last year and they

713
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:15,920
got hit much harder than we did in South

714
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:19,369
Florida we had the edge of Hurricane

715
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:22,490
Emma and but Hurricane Maria was just

716
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:26,089
devastated Puerto Rico and one of its

717
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:28,190
endemic potato and tomato relatives so

718
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:30,199
let's align them and so folium was down

719
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:32,539
to just a few individuals that were left

720
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,549
at a few sites and after the

721
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:36,889
storm none of those could be found again

722
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:38,740
they seemed all been destroyed and a

723
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:42,410
graduate student who was working on the

724
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:44,450
endemic Solanaceae enrico was able to

725
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:45,680
just search online and find out of all

726
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:48,920
places the University of Connecticut

727
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,750
their wonderful research collection and

728
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,850
teaching collection they had two clones

729
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:55,730
addressed that had been grown at

730
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:58,099
Fairchild Garden up until the mid-2000s

731
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:59,900
it was probably Hurricane Wilma that did

732
00:30:58,099 --> 00:31:02,059
those plants him but fortunately a

733
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:04,100
student who'd been studying them from

734
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:05,629
the Northeast took cuttings Scott

735
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:07,789
brought them up to Connecticut and they

736
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:10,070
were maintained there at the teaching

737
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:12,170
collection and as far as we know these

738
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:13,879
two individuals are the last of the

739
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:17,150
species and it was just because a couple

740
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,530
people decided to propagate it it's

741
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:20,900
going to be around to hopefully

742
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:22,490
repatriate to Frederico we of course we

743
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:25,040
all hope it'll reappear in Puerto Rico

744
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:26,539
so that there will be more diversity but

745
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,430
at least we have a couple of individuals

746
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:30,799
or their cuttings from wild

747
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:32,539
well plants and this is one that was

748
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,339
just sent back down to Fairchild from

749
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:35,720
the University you know they can so now

750
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:37,459
that we know how important this is we're

751
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,279
trying to get it spread as far as we can

752
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:45,680
to make sure that it's um it won't be

753
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:47,960
lost to posterity and to nature and lest

754
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:51,769
you think that this is that these are

755
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:54,650
just you know isolated anecdotes if we

756
00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:57,650
look at the best documented cases of

757
00:31:54,650 --> 00:32:00,340
extinction and an extinction in the wild

758
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:03,650
where it also exists in horticulture um

759
00:32:00,339 --> 00:32:05,329
based on the IUCN Red List they've

760
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:07,519
documented a hundred one plant species

761
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:09,139
extinct you know many more are extinct

762
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,829
they're mainly extinct that we'll never

763
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:14,210
know that they existed but this is the

764
00:32:12,829 --> 00:32:18,079
old these are the only hard numbers we

765
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:19,819
really have now and but but in addition

766
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,899
there are 35 species they're extinct in

767
00:32:19,819 --> 00:32:25,369
a while but survived in cultivation so

768
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:28,550
without horticulture that means there'd

769
00:32:25,369 --> 00:32:29,289
be 29 percent higher extinction rate for

770
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:32,690
plants

771
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:35,299
whereas if animals the same figures are

772
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:36,650
less than five percent plants are have a

773
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:38,659
lot of advantages you can take cuttings

774
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:40,610
you know of them so you can clone them

775
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:43,279
very easily they don't need a lot of

776
00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:44,539
space you know you can grow a tremendous

777
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,710
amount of diversity in a small space

778
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:48,849
they're the most you know

779
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:51,370
exchangable they're easy to send long

780
00:32:48,849 --> 00:32:53,109
distances so we can we can do a lot more

781
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:55,149
with plants and the potential to

782
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:57,009
conserve them through horticulture is

783
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:58,809
pretty impressive and this is not

784
00:32:57,009 --> 00:33:02,200
through any concerted effort this is

785
00:32:58,808 --> 00:33:04,470
just through a disorganized group of

786
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,690
gardeners Botanic Gardens and

787
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:08,860
universities across the world doing this

788
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,919
imagine what could be done if we

789
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:16,719
actually put our minds to it and

790
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:18,759
coordinated so as a Botanic Garden we

791
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,500
introduce plants from from a variety of

792
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:22,269
sources I'm going to give a couple

793
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:25,480
examples of how that's done in the

794
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:28,410
modern era we do the traditional way

795
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,669
which is while collecting expeditions

796
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:33,250
also exchanging with other botanic

797
00:33:30,669 --> 00:33:36,100
gardens commercial nurseries and private

798
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:38,339
collectors those are the main sources

799
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:40,539
and they go to to a gardens nursery

800
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:43,079
where we do our first stage of

801
00:33:40,539 --> 00:33:45,700
evaluation trying to keep them alive

802
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:49,000
keep the proper gills alive and seeing

803
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,860
how easy they are to propagate and and

804
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,839
then there are all kinds of uses in a

805
00:33:50,859 --> 00:33:55,959
modern botanical garden and in other

806
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:57,849
botanical institutions that they may be

807
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,329
used for education research beauty

808
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:05,709
conservation and evaluation for the

809
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:07,449
broader use in horticulture and so while

810
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,619
collecting expeditions as I mentioned

811
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:11,918
they're harder they're getting harder

812
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:14,019
all the time in most countries and even

813
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:16,269
if you're allowed to collect many times

814
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:19,269
they want to make agreements that are

815
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:22,119
very restrictive with regard to what can

816
00:34:19,269 --> 00:34:24,340
later be done with those plants so you

817
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:26,108
need to in this new area you need to

818
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:28,500
carefully negotiate to make sure that

819
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:31,449
everybody's interests are respected and

820
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,889
and so in some countries we've had a

821
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:34,509
little more latitude to collect than

822
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:38,349
others we have it we have a great

823
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:40,359
relationship with garden there and we

824
00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:45,460
made a couple of expeditions there in

825
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:47,108
2012 and 2013 and this is what just you

826
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,220
know like client collecting was in the

827
00:34:47,108 --> 00:34:50,710
old days we're going out and collecting

828
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:52,269
cuttings and seeds and using interesting

829
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,398
conveyances and sometimes it was a

830
00:34:52,269 --> 00:34:55,898
pickup truck and there's no room for the

831
00:34:54,398 --> 00:35:00,539
most elegant things we just pile them on

832
00:34:55,898 --> 00:35:03,630
top of ourselves and bring them back and

833
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:05,369
get them inspected for for pests in the

834
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:07,680
country of origin and packed up very

835
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:10,410
carefully and brought back labeled

836
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:13,409
accessions and hopefully they'll survive

837
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:14,969
and one of the are successful

838
00:35:13,409 --> 00:35:16,649
introductions was this is clevy of

839
00:35:14,969 --> 00:35:18,929
doming dentists which is endemic to

840
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:21,599
haiti which is a lot of conservation

841
00:35:18,929 --> 00:35:24,329
struggles in the modern era it's about

842
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,949
98 percent deforested and this is a

843
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:27,779
species that's founded just a handful of

844
00:35:25,949 --> 00:35:31,529
individuals it's a very beautiful

845
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:32,580
ornamental and and the Botanic Garden

846
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,200
the Dominican Republic has been

847
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:35,819
propagating it for a number of years

848
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:38,579
from early collections they made and

849
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:40,080
they've been sharing propagations with

850
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:41,429
other gardens throughout the world and

851
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,949
now we have a number of those we have

852
00:35:41,429 --> 00:35:45,960
about 10 individuals growing Fairchild

853
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:47,909
and we think they'll flower flowers soon

854
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,409
and that we've been working with the

855
00:35:47,909 --> 00:35:51,269
Botanic Garden he needs to make more

856
00:35:49,409 --> 00:35:53,279
wild collections from the handful of

857
00:35:51,269 --> 00:35:55,108
remaining individuals to make sure we

858
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,590
conserve as much genetic diversity as

859
00:35:55,108 --> 00:36:01,469
possible and we worked with our partners

860
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:03,990
there to make the first successful

861
00:36:01,469 --> 00:36:06,059
horticultural introduction of a special

862
00:36:03,989 --> 00:36:09,239
plumeria species plumeria Magnum one of

863
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:13,529
the biggest fragile pennies there is it

864
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:14,879
can get to be 90 feet tall and and the

865
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:17,310
Botanic Garden there had not been

866
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,769
successful in grafting or grafting them

867
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:21,809
or propagating them from cuttings so we

868
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:23,309
we've had success now and we're going to

869
00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:25,980
be bringing them back on our next trip

870
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:28,199
to the Botanic Garden there so they'll

871
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,949
be able to use them in plantings in the

872
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:33,509
Dominican Republic where its native

873
00:36:30,949 --> 00:36:36,599
we've had some Nitze follow-up

874
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:39,660
opportunities on some of the things that

875
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:42,868
David Fairchild dreamed about possible

876
00:36:39,659 --> 00:36:44,759
in his time but they're possible now we

877
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:47,039
have trouble in the in the deep tropics

878
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,080
growing the Mediterranean fig because we

879
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:51,840
have trouble with humidity and heat

880
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:56,029
there it's um you get a rust fungus they

881
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:58,108
get nematodes and there's this Sun

882
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:59,940
several tropical figs that are edible

883
00:36:58,108 --> 00:37:03,630
but most figs require their pollinator

884
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:05,760
wasps to ripen and and be palatable and

885
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:08,519
certainly true of this this is the

886
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,160
Roxburgh fig ficus auricular sometimes

887
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:13,289
called the coconut feet and but there

888
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:14,098
are a few clones that actually are what

889
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:15,858
I'll personal

890
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:18,568
perfect like the banana where they will

891
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:20,608
like our common Cavendish banana where

892
00:37:18,568 --> 00:37:22,528
the fruit will ripen without being

893
00:37:20,608 --> 00:37:25,259
fertilized so there aren't and without

894
00:37:22,528 --> 00:37:27,509
producing viable seeds and it turns out

895
00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:29,719
that one of our neighboring Gardens had

896
00:37:27,509 --> 00:37:32,130
inadvertently introduced one of these

897
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:34,618
collecting plants after Hurricane in

898
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:36,479
Indonesia one clone they brought back if

899
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:39,150
this species turns out to be part no

900
00:37:36,478 --> 00:37:40,739
carpet and we've been propagating at

901
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:43,259
David Fairchild he wrote a whole article

902
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:44,909
when when does anyone gonna do something

903
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:47,099
about the great figure of the Himalayas

904
00:37:44,909 --> 00:37:49,409
you know and here the plants at his home

905
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:51,930
at the Kampong he spent years using all

906
00:37:49,409 --> 00:37:54,210
these tricks like olive oil to slather

907
00:37:51,929 --> 00:37:55,768
the fruit and trying to make it ripen it

908
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:57,778
never worked and now we fortunately have

909
00:37:55,768 --> 00:38:01,978
one the one that he would have wanted

910
00:37:57,778 --> 00:38:03,778
and similarly he was very keen on the

911
00:38:01,978 --> 00:38:08,159
potential of the sycamore fig of the

912
00:38:03,778 --> 00:38:10,920
Middle East and in Africa which is a fig

913
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:13,288
that thrives vegetatively in South

914
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:16,079
Florida and in tropical climates but

915
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:18,450
also generally requires its pollinator

916
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,950
wasps but there's a variety that rose in

917
00:38:18,449 --> 00:38:22,468
the Middle East about sixteen hundred

918
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:25,828
years ago that will ripen without

919
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:27,509
pollination called Bellamy and collector

920
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:29,729
in South Florida worked about thirty

921
00:38:27,509 --> 00:38:31,559
years to get this into cultivation and

922
00:38:29,728 --> 00:38:33,989
finally did and shared cuttings with us

923
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:37,349
and they've made fruits that are quite

924
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:40,228
tasty so david fairchild also was trying

925
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:42,719
for years with this species he had a one

926
00:38:40,228 --> 00:38:44,548
of the typical form at his home and one

927
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:47,460
of the traditional ways of making these

928
00:38:44,548 --> 00:38:48,929
ripe and going back to antiquity was to

929
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,460
cut the small the figs when they were

930
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:52,440
very very tiny which would stimulate

931
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:54,269
ethylene production and make them ripen

932
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,318
so he had to cut individually each of

933
00:38:54,268 --> 00:38:57,689
the figs and he could never get the

934
00:38:55,318 --> 00:38:59,489
stage just right and so he never

935
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:01,200
succeeded in but now we have the one

936
00:38:59,489 --> 00:39:04,739
that you don't need to do anything we'll

937
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:07,139
just write them and we're also

938
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:10,139
introducing plants that are important

939
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:11,879
conservation value some of which

940
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:13,710
required the collaboration of several

941
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,559
institutions to make a successful

942
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:18,509
introduction this is a important conifer

943
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:20,729
from new caledonia our acharya muller i

944
00:39:18,509 --> 00:39:22,228
this is kind of from new caledonia is

945
00:39:20,728 --> 00:39:24,449
this lost world in the south pacific

946
00:39:22,228 --> 00:39:26,968
with 4746

947
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:27,929
I guess 47 now endemic conifer species

948
00:39:26,969 --> 00:39:29,690
in the tropics

949
00:39:27,929 --> 00:39:32,099
now the place we usually associate with

950
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:34,200
conifers but Congress happen to be one

951
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:36,389
of the most endangered plant groups in

952
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:38,759
the world about 34% of them are

953
00:39:36,389 --> 00:39:41,579
considered threatened or endangered so

954
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:44,100
that's an important group to be backing

955
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:46,349
up in different collections and so this

956
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:48,809
was shared with with us by the Royal

957
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:50,400
Botanic Gardens Edinboro and then our

958
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:52,110
colleagues at the University of Florida

959
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,639
that managed to graft it on to a

960
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:56,099
rootstock that's much better for our

961
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:57,960
soils but it's too cold up there to grow

962
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:00,360
this outside year-round so they gave us

963
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,369
this grafted individual to plants in the

964
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:05,099
garden now so our three institutions has

965
00:40:02,369 --> 00:40:07,230
finally made this and some horticultural

966
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:12,569
expertise has made this possible to get

967
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:14,309
this conserved xc2 and increasingly

968
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:17,000
we're going through this route of

969
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:19,949
horticulture for plant introductions and

970
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,800
in Thailand is the epicenter for

971
00:40:19,949 --> 00:40:24,329
tropical horticulture and so we're we're

972
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,510
going increasingly ever just every

973
00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:29,309
December to the biggest plant show in

974
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:32,610
Southeast Asia the Rama nine plants show

975
00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:34,980
and sale we're basically anybody who's

976
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:36,690
in the botanical world and horticultural

977
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,630
world in Southeast Asia tries to get to

978
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:41,610
this and you get probably about nearly a

979
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:45,000
hundred vendors in this giant circle in

980
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:46,980
this big part in Bangkok and just you

981
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,949
just it's overwhelming what you'll find

982
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:51,210
there all the amazing plants and

983
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:52,829
individual nurseries specializing in

984
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:55,079
plants of this family and an AC

985
00:40:52,829 --> 00:40:57,179
specialize in Podocarpus specializing

986
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:59,880
this this the diversity is just

987
00:40:57,179 --> 00:41:02,129
fantastic and each time we go around

988
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,539
we'll go around the first time and find

989
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:04,829
a whole bunch of things and they go well

990
00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:07,019
we've got a few things we still need to

991
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:08,610
find the next day and we go around it's

992
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:10,259
not a few things it's still just as many

993
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:12,570
and then the next day we find even more

994
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:14,660
and so it's just it's pretty

995
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:18,059
overwhelming like what we can find and

996
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:20,730
what's available now and also in the

997
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:22,259
various local nurseries in Thailand that

998
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:25,050
are introducing all kinds of wonderful

999
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:27,030
new things to cultivation this is

1000
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:30,390
sock who's a legendary collector from

1001
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:31,980
from that area and to many things in

1002
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:33,809
this very favorable climate they're able

1003
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:36,000
to just use clear plastic bags to

1004
00:41:33,809 --> 00:41:38,489
cuttings and grow things from leaf

1005
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,369
cuttings and graft and Thailand they

1006
00:41:38,489 --> 00:41:43,469
graph so many things it's amazing

1007
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:46,589
their master graph drafters there and we

1008
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:49,429
can find nurseries with row after row of

1009
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:52,110
amazingly grown epiphytic like a pots

1010
00:41:49,429 --> 00:41:57,119
which is a pretty amazing thing to see

1011
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:59,460
and and just that these are now all

1012
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,259
available and as beautiful specimens

1013
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,929
that can be shipped to the US is pretty

1014
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:06,900
pretty amazing and so fortunately our

1015
00:42:03,929 --> 00:42:09,569
Thailand is set up for for horticultural

1016
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:11,400
introductions so everything is very very

1017
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:13,289
efficient there we have a good friend

1018
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,440
and colleague who comes to Miami several

1019
00:42:13,289 --> 00:42:19,230
times home SAP OC reach lvanych

1020
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,030
and he he's able to get this all air

1021
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:23,699
freight into Miami in about a day and a

1022
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:25,650
half and so they agree of all the

1023
00:42:23,699 --> 00:42:28,319
phytosanitary documents we go through

1024
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:29,400
all the regulations and you know we're

1025
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,740
still able to get about eighty percent

1026
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,050
success this way sometimes even higher

1027
00:42:31,739 --> 00:42:36,389
depending on the type of plant and so

1028
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:40,620
last December we we brought back 22 big

1029
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:43,259
boxes of new plants this way and they

1030
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:48,659
keep out of it as well the opportunities

1031
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:50,730
exist and we also even have a growing

1032
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:53,159
network of exchange with botanical

1033
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:54,929
institutions overseas as well this was a

1034
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:58,259
botanic garden north of Bangkok that

1035
00:42:54,929 --> 00:43:01,289
gave us several of their endemic plants

1036
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:03,090
trees of limestone areas around there

1037
00:43:01,289 --> 00:43:05,070
which we have very similar substrates in

1038
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:06,690
Miami where we're a lot of limestone and

1039
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:08,280
they were able to give us an entire

1040
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:09,990
genus Santa zukie oh there are two

1041
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,620
species and they gave us both of them so

1042
00:43:09,989 --> 00:43:15,539
it's nice to be able to complete

1043
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:17,460
collections and you know just like in

1044
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:19,679
the old days plants collecting can be

1045
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,119
pretty messy this is a little apartment

1046
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:23,129
in singapore botanic garden where they

1047
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:26,009
let me stay they let me stay even after

1048
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:27,599
i've done this multiple times and filled

1049
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:29,040
everything up with plants and then

1050
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:33,299
brought him back in my and my luggage

1051
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:36,779
after they get get inspected and we get

1052
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:38,910
them back to the garden and and you know

1053
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:40,800
even after a very rigorous trip you know

1054
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:43,230
then the work has just begun we have to

1055
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:47,190
get all of these settles posit up with

1056
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:49,579
under mist or fog and and try to get

1057
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:52,500
them into a favorable microclimates and

1058
00:43:49,579 --> 00:43:53,840
see if we can get most of them to

1059
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,809
succeed

1060
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:59,240
and sometimes we even find plants that

1061
00:43:56,809 --> 00:44:01,039
are they're very useful that are that

1062
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:03,769
are new fruits like this is sand or acum

1063
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:05,179
which is a very fluffy fruit that they

1064
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:09,650
have all these new different cultivars

1065
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:11,569
in the entire island of it but some of

1066
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:13,730
these many of these plants we just bring

1067
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:15,620
back because they're wonderful and one

1068
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:17,449
person who was influenced by Liberty

1069
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:20,659
High Bailey was Wendell Berry and I

1070
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:22,699
think is what he said about twenty years

1071
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:25,429
ago that that if we don't learn to value

1072
00:44:22,699 --> 00:44:28,339
things for just for being wonderful in

1073
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:30,409
of themselves we're going to lose a lot

1074
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:32,450
of them because a lot of current

1075
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:34,730
approach to conservation and whatnot

1076
00:44:32,449 --> 00:44:36,949
tends to be what is what are things

1077
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:39,590
useful for are they useful for they can

1078
00:44:36,949 --> 00:44:41,269
be useful for medicine food or carbon

1079
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:42,970
storage or something but the problem is

1080
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:46,400
that all those things may come and go

1081
00:44:42,969 --> 00:44:47,779
but we still need this biodiversity for

1082
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,760
the future and we need to figure out how

1083
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:54,290
to appreciate it for how wonderful it is

1084
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:55,790
and one plant that I've gotten extremely

1085
00:44:54,289 --> 00:44:58,670
interested in it's like its deltoid here

1086
00:44:55,789 --> 00:45:01,219
which comes in all these amazing local

1087
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:03,889
it's an epiphytic fig in Southeast Asia

1088
00:45:01,219 --> 00:45:05,750
that comes in all these local reforms

1089
00:45:03,889 --> 00:45:08,239
and different habitats and they're all

1090
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:11,750
part of the same species but they're

1091
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:13,250
they're all genetically distinct and you

1092
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:17,059
see some of their big leaves some of the

1093
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:19,329
small big big small figs and a wonderful

1094
00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:22,400
example of just evolution in action and

1095
00:45:19,329 --> 00:45:24,289
that you can demonstrate by you know

1096
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,510
just growing a whole diverse range of

1097
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:29,389
this individual species in the tropics

1098
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:31,070
and you introduce some very other

1099
00:45:29,389 --> 00:45:33,259
promising ornamentals like this

1100
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:34,640
beautiful gorilla that as bold and leaf

1101
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:36,890
undersides most ravillious

1102
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:38,299
and the pro tac family don't do well in

1103
00:45:36,889 --> 00:45:40,969
South Florida they don't like our high

1104
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:42,500
pH soils but we discovered we saw this

1105
00:45:40,969 --> 00:45:44,779
growing in several places in Southeast

1106
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:47,210
Asian said let's try it and it's turned

1107
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:48,890
out to be remarkably adaptable and it's

1108
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:53,720
not sensitive the phosphorus like many

1109
00:45:48,889 --> 00:45:57,019
of them are even they're going so so low

1110
00:45:53,719 --> 00:46:00,379
as to as two or so high as to appreciate

1111
00:45:57,019 --> 00:46:02,659
bryophytes and this is a liverworts

1112
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:06,079
brought back a couple years ago that's

1113
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:07,670
got this beautiful central black portion

1114
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,769
that illustrates its like how the mist

1115
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:11,420
branching and that's caused a bit of a

1116
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:16,639
sensation among my growing with our

1117
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:18,349
community and Sailaja Nellas even this

1118
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:20,568
is what I call a gateway Sailaja nella

1119
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:23,568
so those of you who haven't gotten

1120
00:46:20,568 --> 00:46:25,969
bitten by this incredibly diverse Lika

1121
00:46:23,568 --> 00:46:28,039
fide group this is salah janela picta

1122
00:46:25,969 --> 00:46:30,980
from vietnam it's a recent introduction

1123
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:33,170
to horticulture and now that's a in

1124
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:35,420
Thailand it's being propagated widely

1125
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:37,940
but it has its central leaves turn

1126
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:39,889
whites very early in development so it

1127
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:41,750
has this natural variation that's quite

1128
00:46:39,889 --> 00:46:43,789
striking and it's not that hard to grow

1129
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:46,068
and another it this is a beaut

1130
00:46:43,789 --> 00:46:47,900
beautifully primeval endangered Sailaja

1131
00:46:46,068 --> 00:46:50,929
nama species from the Philippines that's

1132
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:52,309
just entered horticulture and there's

1133
00:46:50,929 --> 00:46:53,568
actually endangered in the wild but

1134
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:56,119
they've been but it's actually not that

1135
00:46:53,568 --> 00:46:57,679
hard to grow and it's just gorgeous it

1136
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:02,510
looks like it's made of plastic and came

1137
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:05,179
right at leas oh except as I mentioned

1138
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:07,130
many exchanges with Botanic Gardens this

1139
00:47:05,179 --> 00:47:08,779
is from a new species from the Solomon

1140
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:10,910
Islands a Podocarpus from the Royal

1141
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:13,599
Botanic Gardens Edinboro that it's new

1142
00:47:10,909 --> 00:47:17,118
we've look as pretty as any flower so

1143
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:19,818
and a lot of wonderful poems that are

1144
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:22,220
coming into horticulture that are just

1145
00:47:19,818 --> 00:47:23,750
you know on the level of a Bailey's

1146
00:47:22,219 --> 00:47:26,808
wonderful poem and they're wonderful

1147
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:28,608
geometry some plants that look like

1148
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:32,240
poems of it aren't poems this is a

1149
00:47:28,608 --> 00:47:33,980
cyclin from the Americas and this is a

1150
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:35,539
group of plants that has tremendous

1151
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:37,670
horticultural potential that's actually

1152
00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:39,920
more appreciated in Asia than it is in

1153
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:41,630
the new world for their for their

1154
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,548
tremendous diversity and beauty and

1155
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:45,108
they're actually more closely related to

1156
00:47:43,548 --> 00:47:47,088
the pan downs and to the palms

1157
00:47:45,108 --> 00:47:49,098
but where we're introducing a lot more

1158
00:47:47,088 --> 00:47:52,308
of these and evaluating how they do in

1159
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:54,318
horticulture some of the beautiful

1160
00:47:52,309 --> 00:47:55,819
plants from Mauritius this like this

1161
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:58,279
plant that is these beautiful shiny

1162
00:47:55,818 --> 00:47:59,900
small leaves look like oak leaves that

1163
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:02,059
we brought back from a collection in

1164
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,680
Thailand that's never been grown and in

1165
00:48:02,059 --> 00:48:09,470
the u.s. before but looks very very

1166
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:11,509
promising easy to propagate we never get

1167
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:13,879
tired of iridescent blue plants this is

1168
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:16,450
a sedge from Southeast Asia you know if

1169
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:19,010
you thought that sedges were just little

1170
00:48:16,449 --> 00:48:20,838
nondescript green things in the in the

1171
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:23,900
swamps this is a in the Trop

1172
00:48:20,838 --> 00:48:25,728
say they can become really spectacular

1173
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,410
this one has this special kind of

1174
00:48:25,728 --> 00:48:30,889
iridescent based on the different layers

1175
00:48:27,409 --> 00:48:33,288
of silica on its leaves and gets the

1176
00:48:30,889 --> 00:48:37,098
shiny blue color in the in the shady

1177
00:48:33,289 --> 00:48:40,099
areas and this is a cool ago a poem

1178
00:48:37,099 --> 00:48:42,349
grass which is a Nepal more grass type

1179
00:48:40,099 --> 00:48:45,019
sweet heaven horticulture have been a

1180
00:48:42,349 --> 00:48:47,229
pretty bland green but this is a wild

1181
00:48:45,018 --> 00:48:51,468
species from Southeast Asia

1182
00:48:47,228 --> 00:48:53,509
and nobody had has it in horticulture

1183
00:48:51,469 --> 00:48:55,929
until very recently so there's so much

1184
00:48:53,509 --> 00:48:58,989
potential out there so much to explore

1185
00:48:55,929 --> 00:49:01,879
it's pretty exciting in the tropics and

1186
00:48:58,989 --> 00:49:04,909
like this potato and tomato relative of

1187
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:07,420
solanum it feels like velvet just really

1188
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:10,518
densely velvety leaves from Ecuador

1189
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:11,989
that's got into some collections through

1190
00:49:10,518 --> 00:49:13,518
the Ecuadorian nurseries and now you can

1191
00:49:11,989 --> 00:49:16,789
find in the toilet they're enjoying it

1192
00:49:13,518 --> 00:49:19,278
there as well and this is a brand new

1193
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:21,349
introduction to North American

1194
00:49:19,278 --> 00:49:23,358
horticultural med NOAA that when we

1195
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:26,390
first just tired in the conservatory a

1196
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:27,949
Fairchild a couple of weeks ago and the

1197
00:49:26,389 --> 00:49:29,179
Sun came through its leaves which are

1198
00:49:27,949 --> 00:49:32,179
red in the back we saw this amazing

1199
00:49:29,179 --> 00:49:34,210
effect where the red blending into the

1200
00:49:32,179 --> 00:49:36,558
green you know gives this just a

1201
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:39,769
wonderful kind of orange II red glow to

1202
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:42,380
it so which no one else who's grown this

1203
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:43,459
genus before is seen so you know we

1204
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,259
never know what we're going to discover

1205
00:49:43,460 --> 00:50:02,210
when we introduce these wonders these

1206
00:49:45,259 --> 00:50:04,190
new wonders yeah it hasn't flowered yet

1207
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:05,630
but some med nillas have pendulous

1208
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:07,489
flowers some of them have flowers on the

1209
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:12,140
stem so there's all different some are

1210
00:50:07,489 --> 00:50:13,440
more showy than others so we're know

1211
00:50:12,139 --> 00:50:15,088
now that's action

1212
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,010
just the effect of the Sun line shining

1213
00:50:15,088 --> 00:50:18,779
through the red backs of the leaves so

1214
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:20,819
it's actually it's basically green on

1215
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:24,240
the top and red underneath so it's yeah

1216
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:25,829
it's yeah in Thailand they're really

1217
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:29,068
into variegated plants so I'm not even

1218
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:32,160
going there right now that would be that

1219
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:35,759
would be many lectures on the science of

1220
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:37,170
irrigation in Thailand and I don't want

1221
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,970
to leave out some flowers even though

1222
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:41,670
I'm a big fan of foliage but this is a

1223
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:45,209
beautiful and an AC of area that has

1224
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:47,250
this mysterious resin that it produces

1225
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:48,990
in the middle of its flowers but it's

1226
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:50,608
pretty spectacular and it also makes

1227
00:50:48,989 --> 00:50:54,899
notable fruit so it's not only gorgeous

1228
00:50:50,608 --> 00:50:57,119
but edible and there's also some active

1229
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:58,920
breeding going on in Southeast Asia and

1230
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:01,410
a lot of popular plant groups and this

1231
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:03,480
is one of the most exciting new triumphs

1232
00:51:01,409 --> 00:51:06,690
of a wonderful horticulturist in

1233
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:10,019
Indonesia this is your sina stardust JT

1234
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:13,019
stardust and it's a hybrid between one

1235
00:51:10,019 --> 00:51:15,210
Bornean species that keeps its spots all

1236
00:51:13,019 --> 00:51:17,519
its life but is pretty diminutive and

1237
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:19,769
one that has big beautiful strap-like

1238
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:21,449
leaves but has spots early on but then

1239
00:51:19,769 --> 00:51:23,670
loses them when it matures so this one

1240
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:26,759
has the big strap-like leaves and it

1241
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:28,170
keeps it spots so it's a really example

1242
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:34,349
of the best of both species for

1243
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:36,240
ornamental uses and and I'd like to end

1244
00:51:34,349 --> 00:51:39,690
with ajust a couple of reflections from

1245
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:42,179
David Fairchild here and even though he

1246
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:46,380
had a very illustrious career in many

1247
00:51:42,179 --> 00:51:48,118
ways but in the end it came down as his

1248
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:50,099
philosophy at the end of his life was it

1249
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:51,390
was really all about the plants that you

1250
00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:53,818
know all the things he did all the

1251
00:51:51,389 --> 00:51:55,618
things he wrote and whatnot but he said

1252
00:51:53,818 --> 00:51:59,130
that what what was more important to him

1253
00:51:55,619 --> 00:52:01,079
were the trees and at his home at the

1254
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:02,789
Camco and all the wonders that were

1255
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:04,680
associated with them so he had really

1256
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:06,989
you know he was certainly even though

1257
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:11,309
he'd focused a lot on useful plants on

1258
00:52:06,989 --> 00:52:13,618
plants being important to enrich us food

1259
00:52:11,309 --> 00:52:16,920
and and us ornament but he just loved

1260
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:20,180
the plants in and of themselves and and

1261
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:22,559
this was sometimes called his last

1262
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:24,419
Testament here that he wrote after his

1263
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,829
last big expedition right before World

1264
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:29,230
War two to Southeast Asia

1265
00:52:26,829 --> 00:52:31,539
but what one collects in the shape of

1266
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:33,250
opinions data facts and figures have a

1267
00:52:31,539 --> 00:52:35,739
rather small chance of being passed on

1268
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:37,750
to others and doing some good and some

1269
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:40,629
of that you know it superseded as we

1270
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:42,730
know but he saw that you know

1271
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:45,039
introducing some seeds and plants that

1272
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:47,889
may be passed on to someone in the

1273
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:51,789
future and grown by them selected by

1274
00:52:47,889 --> 00:52:53,500
them just appreciated have a good chance

1275
00:52:51,789 --> 00:52:57,969
of doing something good to people long

1276
00:52:53,500 --> 00:53:00,280
after the shadows fall and and his other

1277
00:52:57,969 --> 00:53:02,049
aspect of whether he hopes that our

1278
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:05,350
gardens would do is to be places of

1279
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:07,630
wonder and and to in some way change the

1280
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:09,130
world and I know that Cornell University

1281
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:11,980
is at the forefront of that kind of

1282
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:14,980
activity and I hope you can all work

1283
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:18,300
together to to further this this vision

1284
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:20,590
of making the world a greener and and

1285
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:25,970
friendlier place for humans and plants

1286
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:29,190
and and just for the wonders of nature

1287
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:32,259
