1
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:18,358
good afternoon everyone I am Kimberly

2
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:20,720
Davis with Florida A&amp;M corporative

3
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,640
extension and I am the extension

4
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:27,799
disaster education specialist as well as

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,480
the crd program leader so my focus of

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,399
today's um topic is going to be building

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,840
climate resiliency through D disaster

8
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:37,399
preparedness

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,559
education and I live in the state of

10
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,879
Florida

11
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:46,039
so you know what that

12
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:49,280
means lots of disasters Florida ranks

13
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:51,160
number five in the top five among those

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,079
with that have a lot of billion dollar

15
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:55,799
disasters every year and a lot of

16
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:58,518
disasters period so far this year we

17
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:02,238
have truly been slammed with hurricanes

18
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:04,599
and tornadoes and flooding so that's why

19
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:07,239
one of the things that we focus on is

20
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:09,079
building disaster resiliency through

21
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:11,478
preparedness because we know that a lot

22
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:13,798
of the disasters that we're having now

23
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:15,640
they are really a result of climate

24
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,360
change that's why we have extreme

25
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:22,439
flooding extreme heat events extreme

26
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:26,719
drought so we want to focus on training

27
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:29,438
our citizens how to be better prepared

28
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:32,200
and more resilient to respond to the

29
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:35,919
various disaster that they may face this

30
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:40,399
is just a snapshot of this year

31
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:43,399
um in the this corner this is these are

32
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:44,840
are all really happened in this area

33
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:47,640
because we haven't really been slammed

34
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,439
in Tallahassee but this year we were so

35
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,879
this is a flooding event that happened

36
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:55,158
not far away from campus um in earlier

37
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,759
in in

38
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,680
September this is really student housing

39
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,159
around the corner from fam's campus

40
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,159
this is one of the Hurricanes that we

41
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:08,080
had that happened down in Tera County

42
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,599
which is 50 miles from campus this is a

43
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,760
tornado that hit campus this is another

44
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,639
tornado um a h exis a hurricane that

45
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:19,239
happened in the neighboring County and

46
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:22,039
this is a wildfire wildfire that

47
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,759
occurred in Central Florida and these

48
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:27,840
all happen in vulnerable and at risk

49
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:29,519
areas so that's one of the focus one of

50
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,159
the things that we focus on at Florida

51
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:35,000
ANM extension is that that we work with

52
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:38,359
communities that need a little more help

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,239
so this is why we do this so what we do

54
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,200
is we do disaster preparedness education

55
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:45,120
we do environmental and conservation

56
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,639
education and Community resilience and

57
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,800
mitigation planning these are the things

58
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,719
that we think help to build resiliency

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,480
in communities because you need to be

60
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,239
prepared for disasters and when you

61
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:59,878
better better stewards of the

62
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,158
environment you lessen the impact of

63
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:03,840
course of climate change and then we

64
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,840
talk to our communities about things

65
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,759
that they can do to be more resilient

66
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,400
such as resiliency and mitigation

67
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,439
planning so one of the main programs

68
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,400
that we have is the family extension

69
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:19,158
disaster preparedness education and

70
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,039
safety program and this program is

71
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:23,798
really to work with our vulnerable

72
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:26,798
communities our youth our families our

73
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:29,400
seniors small farms and businesses when

74
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,799
it comes to disaster preparedness we

75
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,640
want to reduce the vulnerability of our

76
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,080
of of these citizens when it comes to

77
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:38,318
Natural hazards and emergencies through

78
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,560
an enhanced all preparedness education

79
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:44,079
Outreach programming we want to increase

80
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,158
their their ability to prepare for

81
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,799
respond to recover from and mitigate

82
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:53,479
against Natural Disasters and we offer

83
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,319
programming in all those areas and we

84
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:58,158
want to make sure that they have safe

85
00:03:55,318 --> 00:04:00,158
communities and homes because that's

86
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:03,158
really important when it comes to to

87
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,679
being resilient to climate change and we

88
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:07,840
promote preparedness throughout the

89
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,840
entire year so in Florida some can can

90
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,120
happen any month so we want to make sure

91
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,360
that we are prepared for anything in any

92
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,239
month because the for the photo that I

93
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,439
showed you of the tornado that happened

94
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:22,719
in May so we weren't expecting um

95
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:26,959
Tallahasse had never really been hit by

96
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,560
a severe tornado but we know that we're

97
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:31,599
with the changes that we have in our

98
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,918
weather in anything is possible now so

99
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,879
that made us more alert in Tallahassee

100
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,478
because before coming to FAMU I was

101
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,959
actually the State Environmental

102
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:43,360
scientist for emergency management and

103
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:45,159
we never thought about tornadoes even

104
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,479
though we prepare for disasters

105
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,320
throughout the state but it was rare

106
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:53,000
that tahat would have the magnitude of a

107
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,839
of a tornado that they had back in May

108
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,120
so that's why it's really important and

109
00:04:54,839 --> 00:05:00,159
then the pictures that I did show you

110
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,079
those happen in the most vulnerable

111
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,680
count areas in our city of

112
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:07,399
Tallahassee and believe it or not that

113
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,199
occurred in what we what is known as is

114
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:13,159
zip code

115
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:16,360
32304 and that is in the in the capital

116
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,840
of Florida that is the poorest zip code

117
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,120
in the State of Florida who would think

118
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:23,719
that the PO zip code would be in the

119
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,800
capital but it

120
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:30,400
is so that's why another reason why we

121
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,439
focus on that programming and that zip

122
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:37,679
is really within walking distance to our

123
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:39,519
campus so we have funded projects to do

124
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,240
this work I know Jennifer said that

125
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:45,478
we're volunte volunteers but volunteers

126
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,439
need money too so we do have funded

127
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:51,000
projects that help us with our

128
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:54,079
programming um we have a USDA Grant an

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,720
1890 capacity building Grant building

130
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,079
Community resilience to strengthen

131
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,880
capacity to climate change and natural

132
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:04,599
disaster we also have a southern S Grant

133
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:09,038
which is targeted towards small scale

134
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:11,160
Farmers we have a NFA rapid response

135
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:14,279
Grant and what that is is after the

136
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,919
storm happens nifa has rapid response

137
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:20,279
monies available so that is using we're

138
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:23,079
using photo voice to go into communities

139
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:26,038
to see how they are recovering

140
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:27,918
connecting and healing and then we do

141
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:31,120
two programs that are targeted towards

142
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:33,240
Youth and teachers that is the fam Sumer

143
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,319
sea science and Environmental Education

144
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,199
Academy and it's funded through

145
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,439
Mississippi state for a grant they

146
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,160
received from NASA and we have

147
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:46,000
strengthening forestry and conservation

148
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,000
education which is f funded by the USDA

149
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,439
Forest

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,399
Service the disaster preparedness and

151
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:55,360
safety education we deliver programming

152
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:57,478
that focuses on the five facets of

153
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,560
Emergency Management and that's

154
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:02,478
prevention preparedness response

155
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:05,478
recovery and mitigation and we focus

156
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:08,478
primarily on youth families seniors and

157
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:12,758
small scale farmers and remember a

158
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:15,199
family is also of one so we just focus

159
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,720
on everyone that needs to be prepared

160
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,800
especially those in socially

161
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:23,440
economically challenged urban and rural

162
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,439
communities so in Emergency Management

163
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,079
there are five phases there is

164
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,879
prevention and that's going to be those

165
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:32,598
actions that you take to avoid the

166
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:37,199
incident so we do do things

167
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:39,038
um to help with prevention um so

168
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,639
prevention may be something simple it

169
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:46,959
may not we may not see it as a climate

170
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,879
um related but a mass shooting being

171
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:51,519
able to being able to prevent and what

172
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,120
to do when it comes that happens then we

173
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,478
have preparedness which are those plans

174
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,598
that you do immediately before disaster

175
00:07:55,478 --> 00:08:01,839
occurs such as um getting your emergency

176
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:04,959
it then there's the response phase which

177
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,918
is the immediate actions recovery which

178
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:10,158
are those long-term actions after the

179
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:12,079
storm and mitigation so mitigation is

180
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:14,519
really where you are building that

181
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:18,198
resiliency because mitigation are those

182
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:20,598
long-term actions that you can take such

183
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:23,598
as when you live in a flooded area one

184
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:27,000
of those long-term actions may be simply

185
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:28,839
to get your home elevated so when you

186
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,639
think about building resilience and you

187
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:34,240
think about litigation it could be that

188
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:36,680
but because we work with vulnerable

189
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,519
populations we teach them those things

190
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:41,239
that they can do that may have a lower

191
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:44,038
cost because it cost a lot to mitigate

192
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,360
your home but there are some things that

193
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:49,720
you can do that are are that are more

194
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:53,560
cost efficient for mitigation so if you

195
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:56,879
live in a wind prone area you may just

196
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:59,719
use ply board um to learn how to

197
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:02,320
mitigate your house or hopefully we

198
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,519
working with our we have we do an energy

199
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,160
efficiency because I am the crd program

200
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:09,720
leader and under our crd programming we

201
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:11,399
do Energy Efficiency so those are some

202
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,399
of the things that you can do especially

203
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:17,320
for extreme heat understanding Energy

204
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:21,799
Efficiency and energy efficient measures

205
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:24,399
so FEMA um defines resilience to

206
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:27,240
disasters as Community resilience the

207
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,159
ability for the community to prepare for

208
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,879
anticipated hazards adapt to changing

209
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:36,039
conditions and will stand and recover

210
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:38,439
rapidly from disruptions so that's why

211
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:41,039
emergency preparedness and disaster

212
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,480
preparedness is important because you

213
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:47,559
want communities to be able

214
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,680
to respond quicker than they would if

215
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:52,199
they weren't prepared because we know

216
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:55,359
disasters cause so many different things

217
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,440
health related social economic and

218
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,360
environmental conditions that weaken the

219
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,880
community so and we know that a weakened

220
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,759
Community cannot also can't with withand

221
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,200
to climate change as well so that's why

222
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,078
it's important that we are working with

223
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,600
our communities and doing those things

224
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:15,439
so every year fima does a national

225
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,120
household survey but the survey that

226
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,240
really caught my attention and the one

227
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,720
that I like to use in my presentations

228
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,560
is the one from

229
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,560
2021 because we have been doing a better

230
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:30,958
job at preparing so this was the one

231
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:33,679
that was really the catalyst to us um

232
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:36,000
doing disaster preparedness and

233
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,120
resiliency because we found that there

234
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,519
are differing needs for historically

235
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,440
underserved communities and as I

236
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:46,759
mentioned a few few minutes ago we want

237
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,720
to promote lowcost ways to bridge the

238
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:51,399
gap for those that are social

239
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,160
socioeconomically

240
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:57,399
disadvantaged so that was one of the

241
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:59,799
things that when in this survey that

242
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:03,480
really stuck out that when they surve a

243
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:05,838
home homeowners and renters a lot of

244
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:10,320
them responded saying that there needs

245
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,920
to be a way that they can prepare at low

246
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,839
cost ways because as I mentioned if

247
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,879
you're flooded one of the things is

248
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,839
elevating your homes and another thing

249
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:20,519
is actually getting your home acquired

250
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,000
but just think about if your home is

251
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:26,360
acquired out of the flood zone now you

252
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,480
have to worry about did I get did I have

253
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,879
enough equity in my home that is enough

254
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,399
to buy enough another home will I be

255
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,320
able or do I have to rent so those are

256
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,320
things that you have to think about and

257
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,839
we think about and work through with our

258
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,839
communities when it comes to building

259
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,880
resiliency because some things may work

260
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:46,680
for other communities but for

261
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:49,399
historically underserved communities

262
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:51,919
those things just don't work and one of

263
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,759
the things that we do for preparedness

264
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:56,159
is that we work with the youth because

265
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,639
what does a child do a child will simply

266
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,360
go home and say hey Mom hey Dad guess

267
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,680
what I learned today hey Grandma I

268
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,320
learned

269
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,958
that these are the different clouds so

270
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,800
in one of the photos this is just

271
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:11,039
teaching kids about the different clouds

272
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,399
so they can understand well When I See

273
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,639
This Cloud especially a nimal cumulus

274
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,360
cloud that I think I need to go inside

275
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:20,399
because it's going to be some severe

276
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,039
weather and then ducking cover teaching

277
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,759
them just when there's a tornado they

278
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:27,759
need to be able to Duck and Cover how

279
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:31,559
tornadoes are made so we teach them

280
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:33,480
those things using a stem approach so

281
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:36,278
that when we're teaching them stem we're

282
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,360
teaching them the science behind storms

283
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:40,559
we have as I mentioned we have the fam

284
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,879
sea program which is our sea science

285
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,559
program so that's really focusing on for

286
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:48,320
example one of the activities that we do

287
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:51,000
with the kids was how can you protect

288
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,959
your home from extreme heat so we do an

289
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,839
activity where the kids design a home

290
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:59,838
that can withstand um extreme heat and

291
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,199
what kinds of materials

292
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,560
a home would need for extreme heat so

293
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:06,240
those are some of the things that we do

294
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:07,719
with our youth so like I said when they

295
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,079
get home they're hopefully the

296
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,160
activities are exciting that once they

297
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,838
do them and we tell them why it happens

298
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:18,639
and what you can do that they go back

299
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:20,959
and um share that with their adults

300
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,039
because youth are really really

301
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,278
important when it comes to preparedness

302
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:28,159
and can you tell yes I was I started out

303
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:31,600
as a family 4 agent so 4 and youth

304
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:34,120
program is very dear to my heart so

305
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,759
working with our children and making

306
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,560
sure that they understand and not only

307
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:42,240
that we also teach them how to um

308
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:46,198
environmental stewardship we teach them

309
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,320
about single single use of plastics so

310
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:51,399
all this goes into our preparedness

311
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:55,278
because we know that Plastics are a big

312
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:56,799
driver to um climate change and not only

313
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,240
that another thing that we're doing with

314
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:02,159
our youth is that we're teaching them

315
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,440
about to just get the food that you're

316
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,519
going to eat because we know that a lot

317
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,279
of food goes to the landfills and that

318
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:12,600
creates a lot of messing gas so we teach

319
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:14,278
the kids just just don't just eat what

320
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,278
just get what you're going to eat so

321
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:18,439
it's just those simple things when we

322
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:21,039
are doing preparedness in these classes

323
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,000
with our kids that we're helping them

324
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:25,120
not only are we talking about disaster

325
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,078
preparedness but we're also talking

326
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,159
about environmental stewardship and

327
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:30,319
conservation

328
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,039
other thing is that when we're working

329
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,360
with our adults we do a lot of community

330
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:38,439
workshops on preparedness especially

331
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:41,759
with our seniors and our um our our

332
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:44,399
single moms as well as families we do a

333
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:47,440
lot of preparedness workshops and we do

334
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,679
community resiliency planning so we work

335
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,480
with communities that need to understand

336
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:55,359
what are the flood zones in your

337
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,680
community what are the different um what

338
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,360
are the different risk in your community

339
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,519
so when they understand that that they

340
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,320
can better be better prepare and do

341
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,519
mitigation plan planning because under

342
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,399
um FEMA every state has a state has a

343
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,759
mitigation plan so we make sure that

344
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,320
communities understand that everyone's a

345
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:17,120
part of the state has a mitigation plan

346
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,480
and that if your community does

347
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,519
mitigation planning you can help your

348
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,399
community better withand to disasters so

349
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:27,159
the main thing about our building

350
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,440
resiliency is changing the outcomes we

351
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:32,600
want to change the threat change the

352
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:36,040
impact and change their survivors so

353
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:39,040
that is the end of my presentation thank

354
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:43,278
you thank you

355
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:46,000
Kim um there's one question for Kareem

356
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:48,600
uh from kareim can the curriculum used

357
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
with adults and youth You Youth be

358
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,839
shared with us very

359
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,639
interested yes it can be I forgot to

360
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:59,480
mention I am a part of the extension

361
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,799
disaster education Network Eden

362
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,639
and the curricula that we use we make

363
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:06,000
sure that we post the curricula on the

364
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:08,318
Eden Eden website and I'll post it in a

365
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,600
minute and you can go to Eden because

366
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:13,719
your extension and you can get anything

367
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,639
that they have and some of the

368
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,959
um some of

369
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,680
the information of course you know

370
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,039
because we're extension and we share

371
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:26,838
resources it it's friendly where you can

372
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:29,838
put your logo on it and and and tailor

373
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:31,959
it to your needs so there there is the

374
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,360
Eden website and the youth curricul that

375
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:37,638
I use FEMA has a program called Step so

376
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:42,278
I'll put that in as well and what we did

377
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:45,360
with um with step I worked on the actual

378
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:48,240
step part but Illinois Extension made

379
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,278
step into a 4 program book so if you're

380
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,919
4 there is a 4 program book for disaster

381
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:57,318
preparedness as well so I will um put

382
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:59,879
the link for Eden in here and and that

383
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:02,278
step for each program is on the Eden

384
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:05,160
website as well question which is from

385
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:06,720
CJ Kelly Kim have you noticed push back

386
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,558
from folks who do not believe in the

387
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,318
driving forces of these

388
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:13,759
disasters actually I haven't and then

389
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:15,599
you know because I'm in the State of

390
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:20,160
Florida there there certain words that

391
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:22,198
we use and we don't use but um I think

392
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,240
because like I said when Tallahassee got

393
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,600
slammed and the areas that got slammed

394
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,359
that are getting slammed I I think

395
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:31,079
there's been a wakeup call so

396
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:33,759
I haven't had the push back that I

397
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:36,038
thought I would have so which has been

398
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:38,200
good because I really when I go into a

399
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:40,279
workshop I do go with that mindset like

400
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,600
okay there's going to be a denier in

401
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:47,119
here but I haven't had that push back

402
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:49,519
yet thank you um Kim that was a

403
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:51,239
wonderful presentation I'm definitely

404
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,798
going to be looking up some of those

405
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,400
resources you

406
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:59,158
mentioned so thank you for sharing all

407
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:02,679
that um my name is Megan Krueger and I

408
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:05,039
am an evaluation and research specialist

409
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:07,840
at West Virginia University but also

410
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,839
serve as an environmental educator in

411
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,918
some

412
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:14,798
capacities um my presentation today is

413
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,520
going to go over a grant-funded project

414
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:19,158
that we have right now calling uh which

415
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:22,038
which is called preparing agents of

416
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:24,280
change for tomorrow um building youth

417
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:28,359
confidence and capacity for climate

418
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:28,359
resilient Futures in Appalachia

419
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,919
okay so the Catalyst of this project was

420
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:38,480
a major um natural disaster flooding

421
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,400
event that happened in West Virginia on

422
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:45,038
June 23rd

423
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:47,559
2016 um we had a Thousand-Year flood um

424
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:51,158
which was catastrophic it was caused by

425
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:53,079
a storm that uh delivered about a

426
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:54,720
quarter of the state's annual rainfall

427
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:57,240
in just 24

428
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,600
hours and

429
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,359
um it had over a billion dollars in

430
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:06,599
Damages and you can see some of the

431
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:10,639
other uh sad uh impacts of that

432
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:11,519
storm um this storm took a lot of people

433
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,159
by

434
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:18,279
surprise um a lot of these damages that

435
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:20,960
happened were really highlighting some

436
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:23,678
of the vulnerabilities that we have in

437
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,759
West Virginia and Appalachia and a lot

438
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,919
of the underresourced communities that

439
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,319
we have especially in the southern part

440
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,640
of the state

441
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:34,399
um we have a lot of social vulnerability

442
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,919
a lot of issues with infrastructure and

443
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,519
this flood just really highlighted a lot

444
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,559
of those

445
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:45,319
problems um these are two photos from

446
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:48,839
that flooding event um that happened on

447
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:52,399
that day uh you can see just how much

448
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:54,399
water uh was dumped in this area and if

449
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,679
you've been to West Virginia you know

450
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,720
that there are a lot of valleys and

451
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:03,120
these valleys um have have rivers that

452
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,640
run through them and um they can put

453
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,839
people at extreme risk when these

454
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,880
flooding events

455
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:12,319
happen uh we also know based on some

456
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:15,120
research being done in the State uh from

457
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:18,359
our University that uh flooding is

458
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:22,879
expected to get worse in West Virginia

459
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:25,079
um we have um seen predictions that

460
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,400
because of climate change and increased

461
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:29,240
pre uh increased temperature that we

462
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,759
will have increased precipitate a you

463
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:35,679
can see on the image on the on my left

464
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:38,400
anyway it's the the state the country um

465
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,840
this is from risk factor and it just

466
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,798
shows uh where people are most at risk

467
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:46,639
for flood damage and you can see this

468
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:48,960
dark blue area is where West Virginia is

469
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,919
um you know even though we are not a

470
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,159
coastal area um we still have a lot of

471
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:58,000
risk of riverine flooding and flash

472
00:20:55,159 --> 00:21:01,799
flooding and uh it is expected to get

473
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:05,159
worse we also have this county map here

474
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:06,839
um where you can see the percent change

475
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:09,919
of properties that are at risk for

476
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:12,918
flooding by 2050 compared to

477
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:15,919
2020 and um you can see some of our

478
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:18,799
counties are at 40% more properties are

479
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,440
at risk for damage um West Virginia

480
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:24,200
University is up here in in this part of

481
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,600
the state um but we work with extension

482
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,200
in All Counties um so we're really

483
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:32,359
looking at this

484
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,319
um so yes despite West Virginia being

485
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:36,959
one of the most flood prone States uh

486
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:39,278
there's a significant lack of

487
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,319
preparedness for these environmental

488
00:21:39,278 --> 00:21:44,119
challenges especially as flooding is

489
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:47,278
getting worse we already know based on

490
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:49,719
um surveys and opinion maps and Yale

491
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:52,839
climate opinion maps that over half of

492
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:55,000
our state are having some issues with

493
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:57,158
denial uh with existence of global

494
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,599
warming and it does complicate efforts

495
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:03,520
to build um Community

496
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:06,759
resilience so our solution was um this

497
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:08,839
project we saw a funding opportunity

498
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:12,079
from Noah's environmental literacy

499
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:14,480
office and we developed a partnership

500
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:18,759
between extension at West Virginia

501
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,798
University and two other um Labs uh one

502
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:24,158
is the mountain hydrology lab which is

503
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:26,879
out of our forestry uh college and one

504
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,039
is out of our geography College which is

505
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,278
a resilient communities

506
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:34,200
uh lab which had originally been working

507
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:38,079
on food deserts but now has also been

508
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,919
working on climate related disaster so

509
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:43,720
the preparing agents for change for

510
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:46,278
tomorrow is um in one sentence summary

511
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,640
is a comprehensive initiative to enhance

512
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:50,798
climate resilience through youth

513
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,600
education and engagement across West

514
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:55,240
Virginia and this is the first kind of

515
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:57,879
Statewide initiative we've had uh to

516
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,038
build resilience to flooding in West

517
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,120
Virginia

518
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:04,679
so the idea of this project which was

519
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:08,000
funded um about a year and a half ago so

520
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:10,400
we're about halfway through it um is to

521
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,240
really build confidence and capacity for

522
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,640
flood preparedness and resilience

523
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,038
planning so our idea is that if we build

524
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:21,600
self-efficacy in youth confidence in

525
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:25,000
Youth and hope um that we will increase

526
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:27,879
youth's climate literacy and

527
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,319
resilience we have a comprehensive

528
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:35,360
theory of change which is one document

529
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:38,439
that um really um was provided to us by

530
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:40,599
Noah that is available to everybody and

531
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,960
and I it's going to be in the chat it's

532
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:47,439
a great document and anyone can adapt it

533
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:49,480
so what we did is we took Noah's um

534
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,200
theory of change that they they put out

535
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:55,278
to everybody and they said you know try

536
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,240
and adapt it for your state see how you

537
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:59,720
can do it this theory of change is

538
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,839
supposed to n Essence build resilience

539
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,200
in communities through a couple

540
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:06,399
different Pathways and the pathway that

541
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,278
you can build is dependent on where you

542
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,120
are and what you're doing so we're

543
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:13,558
choosing this pathway of Youth and so

544
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:16,599
this is our adaptation of the theory of

545
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:20,639
change so youth will youth go through

546
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:22,879
three tiers the top tier tier one is

547
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,080
where we get most of our youth in this

548
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,679
is done through an in school programming

549
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:30,558
through extension our extension system

550
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:33,519
has uh really great uh robust School

551
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:35,359
enrichment where extension agents go

552
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:38,599
into the schools teach about different

553
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:42,319
things agriculture stem so on and so

554
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:45,558
this tier one mirrors that and so in

555
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:48,918
tier one youth are in the schools um and

556
00:24:45,558 --> 00:24:51,119
they're taught uh through a five-day

557
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:54,080
program and you can see some of the

558
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:56,000
outcomes that we aim to reach uh in this

559
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:57,678
tier one so we want to increase their

560
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,960
awareness of vulnerabilities in their

561
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:03,240
community of hazards in their community

562
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:06,079
of climate change itself of how

563
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,759
communities can be more resilient and

564
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:11,678
just even basic things such as Watershed

565
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:13,558
Dynamics and then after they go through

566
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,720
this first tier of programming they're

567
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:17,759
invited into the second tier which is

568
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:21,440
smaller of course because not everybody

569
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:24,398
will choose to join but those that do

570
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,480
will be trained by um people on our team

571
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:29,199
and graduate students to understand how

572
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,839
to actually map uh vulnerabilities in

573
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,159
their Community they will co-create uh

574
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:38,439
vulnerability Assessments in their

575
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:41,080
communities um and then communicate that

576
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,840
to others in their community and then

577
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:45,720
the final tier three which is where

578
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:48,278
we'll probably have the smallest amount

579
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,000
of of Youth participation but the most

580
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:53,319
meaningful if you think about it is that

581
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,319
the youth will go through a Leadership

582
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:59,158
Summit and we are going to train them on

583
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:02,278
leadership communication and then have

584
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:04,640
them present their ideas and some of

585
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:07,398
their concerns about their community's

586
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,720
vulnerability to um the state government

587
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:12,479
during a legislative day which we have

588
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:15,000
each year and then we hope to continue

589
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,278
mentoring them to become decision makers

590
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,119
around building Community resilience and

591
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:22,960
kind of really in essence um making a

592
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:27,359
peer network of Youth throughout the

593
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:29,919
state that have similar interests and um

594
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:32,839
want to these kind of change makers in

595
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,880
their community and assist with reducing

596
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:40,119
you know impact of

597
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:43,159
flooding so we've already um created the

598
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:46,319
curriculum for that tier one that I

599
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:49,000
mentioned and it is an in school

600
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:52,480
five-day curriculum that is for high

601
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,839
school students and um we've already

602
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:59,000
piloted in two high schools and have

603
00:26:54,839 --> 00:27:03,519
some some good results so far uh the

604
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,200
five classes kind of move a student from

605
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:08,759
understanding floods and waterways all

606
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:12,200
the way into understanding hope and

607
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:15,599
resilience and so in the first class um

608
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:18,038
we kind of introduced them to a their

609
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,959
Watershed and it's surprising that a lot

610
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:22,319
of them don't know what their Watershed

611
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,319
is or really like what water is even

612
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:27,639
around them and so we do an activity to

613
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:29,558
map what's Upstream of them and what's

614
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,960
Downstream of them to really kind of

615
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:34,678
place them in where they are in their

616
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,798
Watershed and um we do that through some

617
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:39,038
different

618
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:41,319
visualizations um that we found and then

619
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:43,158
we go back the next day and we really

620
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:45,720
kind of do more of a science heavy

621
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:47,799
lesson on the science behind floods and

622
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,798
we talk a lot about riverine and flash

623
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:54,359
flooding and we visualize um rainfall

624
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:56,879
using Legos and so this was an activity

625
00:27:54,359 --> 00:28:00,678
we adapted from the jet propulsion

626
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:04,200
Laboratory um called precipi towers and

627
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:07,440
in this one um students actually look at

628
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,159
real data that um was collected in West

629
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,399
Virginia about annual precipitation from

630
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:16,278
the past 50 years and they build Lego

631
00:28:13,398 --> 00:28:19,000
towers to show how much precipitation

632
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:22,159
was for each year and then the average

633
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,359
and so then they can see in the past 10

634
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:28,480
to 15 years how much physically that

635
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:31,240
Lego tower is is towering over that

636
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,640
average precipitation and we've had

637
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,798
really good uh feedback on that because

638
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,840
it's something Hands-On that they can do

639
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:40,398
and helps them understand like how do we

640
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:43,599
even know where this data is coming

641
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:45,199
from uh we also look at some simulators

642
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:48,158
of like what's the difference between

643
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,399
flash flood and RI River and flooding

644
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,679
and then the third class we're talking

645
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:57,000
about place-based information West

646
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:59,480
Virginia so how do you um know your risk

647
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,240
as an individual person or an individual

648
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:05,480
community and so we talk about how we

649
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:08,440
identify vulnerable people in places um

650
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:11,519
you know using FEMA resources um and how

651
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:14,320
to understand like what happens if

652
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,240
there's a flood am I at risk and there's

653
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,839
some tools we use where they can put

654
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,399
their address in um on their Chromebooks

655
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:22,759
and see like are they in a flood zone

656
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:25,959
and some of them were and they didn't

657
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:28,599
even know and then the fourth one after

658
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,278
we've kind of scared them a little bit

659
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:33,398
not intentionally but you know they're

660
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:35,880
like oh no so we talk about preparing

661
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:38,639
and responding and so we talk a lot

662
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,640
about flood safety tips like what do you

663
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,720
absolutely not do during a flooding

664
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,840
event what should you do during a flood

665
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,798
event how do you be prepared and then we

666
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:51,079
give them a list to start building a

667
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:53,158
household emergency kit um for flooding

668
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:55,720
and then the last class is kind of

669
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:58,840
building that hope and resilience so

670
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:02,278
there's a story map published by um

671
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:05,000
Kentucky uh Red Cross where they did an

672
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:08,839
amazing job at showing kind of how that

673
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,278
Community responded uh to the 2022

674
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:12,839
floods and going through all the

675
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:15,759
different things Community level

676
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:18,798
engagement neighbors helping neighbors

677
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:22,679
and we talk about how um you can be a

678
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:25,119
helper and you know how Community plays

679
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:28,600
a role in in building resilience and

680
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:31,879
your neighbors and your friends

681
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:34,278
um so that was the the pilot of of tier

682
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,840
one which we've done twice now and then

683
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:39,720
we've also piloted that tier two I

684
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:43,079
mentioned and this one is more intensive

685
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:46,038
um it's actually starts as a a whole

686
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:48,158
weekend workshop and the students come

687
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:50,679
to campus and they come for two and a

688
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:53,440
half days and they really learn a lot

689
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:55,639
about mapping Community vulnerabilities

690
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,679
they go through different activities

691
00:30:55,638 --> 00:31:00,599
like mental mapping family Mapp mapping

692
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:03,480
environments and then finally Community

693
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:05,519
mapping they walk around campus and they

694
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,319
start identifying where they think oh

695
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,599
this could be a risk for flooding

696
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:12,319
there's erosion there's you know water

697
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:16,278
coming over the road things like that

698
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:18,038
two minutes okay and then um they also

699
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:20,119
start understanding vulnerability

700
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:21,638
through the built environment and social

701
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:24,678
vulnerability so what's the difference

702
00:31:21,638 --> 00:31:27,038
between you know our vulnerabilities um

703
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:29,120
in the built environment and what kind

704
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:31,158
of pre-existing social vulnerabilities

705
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:35,079
are going to make those things even

706
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:36,720
worse um we're evaluating the program um

707
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:38,678
we're evaluating the outcomes of the

708
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,679
program and the youth participants we're

709
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:42,480
measuring their levels of Hope around

710
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:44,559
climate natural disasters at the

711
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,599
beginning and the end trying to see like

712
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:48,720
where they are on this hope Spectrum are

713
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:50,839
they feeling despair are they feeling

714
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,558
hopeful and then we're also measuring

715
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:55,918
their self-efficacy confidence um around

716
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:57,359
being prepared for flooding and then of

717
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,440
course their knowledge increase on

718
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:03,759
climate change um we're hoping that um

719
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,120
eventually we'll be able to see some

720
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:07,919
intergenerational learning taking place

721
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:09,518
that's kind of The Next Step we're

722
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,600
hoping to see some of this knowledge

723
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:15,359
we're um partaking like on the youth to

724
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:17,638
their parents or their caregivers

725
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:20,278
changes in knowledge attitudes and

726
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:22,359
behaviors um so we have about two more

727
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:24,798
years left on the project we're going to

728
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:27,319
finalize the curriculum run the program

729
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:29,240
consistently over the next two years but

730
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:31,558
we're hoping to make it sustainable by

731
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,919
branding it as an extension program

732
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:36,000
that's offered via train the trainer

733
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,639
workshops where any extension educator

734
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,720
in the state could go and take this

735
00:32:37,638 --> 00:32:45,199
program and do it in their County um so

736
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:48,440
that's the plan um we're already seeing

737
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:52,360
really good uh feedback so far but I

738
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:56,679
will um keep talking about this as we

739
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:58,439
learn more thank you so much when you

740
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:02,240
try to assess

741
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,720
hope how do you connect that to doing

742
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,120
like in other words you're trying to

743
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,278
assess it but then you're also you know

744
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:08,518
it's kind of like one of those things

745
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:11,278
you never really want to leave

746
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:13,200
open-ended right like you kind of want

747
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:15,159
to like prompt it and then you want to

748
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,038
take it Forward how are you taking it

749
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,200
forward and Jack if you could start

750
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:20,480
sharing your

751
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,639
screen do you mean Taking It Forward

752
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,038
like continuing the

753
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:28,278
conversation continuing the conversation

754
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:29,638
but also enabling and like an powered

755
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:32,038
action

756
00:33:29,638 --> 00:33:34,158
like you know figuring out where they

757
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:36,200
are at in their hope spectrum and then

758
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:39,880
trying to connect it to a

759
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:42,120
doing oh yes yeah that's a really good

760
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:44,320
question so right now we're in the

761
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:47,439
process of creating an instrument and

762
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:51,038
we've been testing it so there is some

763
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,919
validated scales on Hope but none um

764
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:55,000
that we found specifically related to

765
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:57,960
flooding and so right now what we're

766
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,000
doing is adapting a scale uh to to

767
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:03,159
measure hope around flooding flooding a

768
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,440
natural disaster and we're testing it to

769
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:07,960
see if it's measuring effectively doing

770
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,079
some different statistical tests on it

771
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:13,720
and so I think that once we get to that

772
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:16,280
point we're going to have to

773
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:18,959
conceptualize how people fall in that

774
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,280
scale and where they fall and if they're

775
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,039
like low hope versus medium hope versus

776
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,040
High Hope and I think that will only

777
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:28,199
come after we keep developing this

778
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:30,320
instrument right now we're not giving

779
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:33,439
them that information we're kind of just

780
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:36,519
testing it as of right now oh there's

781
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,200
four open questions how did I miss that

782
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:41,079
can you have a time do you have a

783
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:45,158
timeline for when you hope the t2t will

784
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:48,119
be available to Cooperative Extension

785
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:51,480
Personnel train the trainer oh train the

786
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:53,838
trainer yeah uh no we don't yet um we

787
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:56,960
will we are working with Eden uh we

788
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:59,519
finally got delegates now um for Eden

789
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,280
and so once our curriculum is finished

790
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:04,199
we plan to upload it onto there um we're

791
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:07,960
going to start train the trainer in West

792
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:10,719
Virginia first and then if it works well

793
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:15,000
we would be open to doing it

794
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:18,879
elsewhere also Kim if you could uh find

795
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:22,000
the adult curriculum um as well as the

796
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,079
step curriculum link Karim I think I put

797
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,079
the step in the answered

798
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,200
Q&amp;A um but you're asking specifically

799
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:35,000
for the adult

800
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:38,960
curriculum um for Eden in Florida I

801
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,159
think um well my name is Jack voy um I'm

802
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,119
a senior in environmental engineering

803
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:46,000
here at NC State and I just finished up

804
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,160
my semester and I also do some research

805
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,280
in the Coastal Engineering department

806
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,000
and I'm from the coast as well so a lot

807
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,440
of these issues really strike home with

808
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,880
me and this summer I had the opportunity

809
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,800
to work for a new initiative called the

810
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,680
Coastal Community commity resilience

811
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,599
immersive training program or secret for

812
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:06,679
short and this is really a huge

813
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,760
collaboration between americore provided

814
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:10,598
funding uh the coastal resilience and

815
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,760
sustainability initiative here at NC

816
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:14,640
State and the Keenan Institute of

817
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,400
engineering and Technology also here at

818
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,879
NC State so this was a really big

819
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,280
initiative and we've got to go out and

820
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:25,800
work with a local County Jones County

821
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:28,480
which was a was really great u in terms

822
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,800
of giving back to Community after I've

823
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,240
been kind of doing this work here at NC

824
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:36,440
State all through the computer for a

825
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:38,239
while so I just wanted to quickly

826
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,880
highlight uh the team we had here

827
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,279
because as I'm the one presenting to you

828
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,280
today there was uh five other

829
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,680
undergraduate students who worked with

830
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,119
me um and the whole body of our work

831
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:49,440
that we went through uh really wouldn't

832
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:51,559
have been possible without having these

833
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,480
six undergraduate students all working

834
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:56,759
together in a team uh towards one goal

835
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,079
so that was a big part of how we're able

836
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,720
to gather so much data and how we were

837
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:03,240
able to engage the community so

838
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:05,559
frequently uh going down and frequent

839
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:08,439
visits every week throughout the this

840
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:08,440
10e program we

841
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:15,598
had so our approach we were aiming to

842
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,920
follow the model of a North Carolina

843
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,440
division of coastal Management program

844
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,240
called the resilient Coastal communities

845
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:25,720
program uh and this program essentially

846
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:29,959
is just a four-phase program that it

847
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:32,919
aims to create uh on the ground uh

848
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:36,358
construction projects that can tackle

849
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:39,200
climate uh solute uh climate problems or

850
00:37:36,358 --> 00:37:41,519
flooding issues uh a lot of this has got

851
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:43,960
to do with storm water and you know

852
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:46,679
increasing capacity for areas

853
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,760
that this money probably wouldn't be in

854
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:50,039
the in the works for a while if it was

855
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,040
they weren't able to facilitate the

856
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:55,599
funds through this so our aim was to do

857
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:59,039
this for a community that was not part

858
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:02,880
of the uh C the coastal area management

859
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:04,800
act or k as this rccp program only

860
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,160
applies to those K counties that you

861
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,920
could see outlined here in green and

862
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:11,239
Jones County even though it's not part

863
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,318
of K it is only 50 miles away from the

864
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:15,919
coast and they've had some severe

865
00:38:13,318 --> 00:38:17,679
impacts from hurricanes recently and it

866
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,119
seemed like a really great start to aim

867
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:23,480
our project uh but the only part of this

868
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,880
4 phase program that we were doing was

869
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,679
the uh first phase obviously as we were

870
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,519
not quite getting out there and getting

871
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:30,519
shovels dirty

872
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:38,078
yet so our approach uh we reviewed

873
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:40,599
existing documents that we gathered from

874
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,000
you know like land use plans anything

875
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:44,480
that essentially that Jones County had

876
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,079
already had in the recent years and then

877
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,800
we developed a community engagement

878
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,440
strategy in terms of you know how are we

879
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,800
going to go out there and approach the

880
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,280
community and how are we going to take

881
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:57,519
that uh the feedback they give us and

882
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,519
taking an account into our work so we

883
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:01,679
after that we wanted to identify and map

884
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:03,119
all the critical assets uh natural

885
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:05,318
infrastructure and some of the socially

886
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,240
vulnerable populations within the

887
00:39:05,318 --> 00:39:09,920
county and we also wanted to conduct the

888
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:11,598
risk and vulnerability assessment that

889
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,599
was the aim of that phase one of the

890
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,599
rccp that I showed you

891
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,640
guys so all deliverables uh there was

892
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,960
two final deliverables that we finished

893
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:25,598
with uh one was the risk and

894
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,000
vulnerability assessment that I talked

895
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:31,440
about that aims to kind of be phase one

896
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,880
of rccp that Jones County can now go use

897
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,760
in applying for some of these grants um

898
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,519
but we also wanted to make a more

899
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,839
consumable uh media that we made in an

900
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:45,000
args story map um this map kind of

901
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:47,199
starts out with some cultural assets to

902
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,039
really highlight some of the key areas

903
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:52,399
that we we were heard from Jones County

904
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:54,800
people were very important to them as

905
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,358
well as going into some of the the data

906
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,318
about the flooding issues that has

907
00:39:56,358 --> 00:39:59,318
occurred recently

908
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:08,000
so a quick assets overview um we were

909
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:10,199
able to really get a large quantity of

910
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,199
assets with the six undergraduate

911
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:13,759
students we had and we're all

912
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:16,719
engineering students so we're all very

913
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,960
interested in stat statistics and you

914
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:21,439
know different ways to manipulate them

915
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,280
and just just using rjs and different

916
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,639
tools to really you know do whatever we

917
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,760
can we can think of doing um this is

918
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:31,480
some of the just basic things that we

919
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,400
were able to quantify um Jones County is

920
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,400
a very agricultural County even though

921
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,880
it's close to the coast so productive

922
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:41,400
land and its ability to grow crops is a

923
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,318
with a huge emphasis on some of these uh

924
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,318
during these flood

925
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,318
events here is US uh meeting with some

926
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:52,838
local government officials with uh

927
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:54,920
initially on June 3D with Dr Georgina

928
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:58,078
Sanchez and Dr Rebecca Ward our advisers

929
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:00,000
who kind of led us through this program

930
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,680
uh we basically got a crash course on

931
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
the entire Jones County history that day

932
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:07,719
and everything that was going on and

933
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,679
basically got up to date immediately

934
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:12,279
with the state of it and kind of the

935
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:15,000
sentiment that people had about the

936
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,800
storm even six years later as hurricane

937
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,159
Florence was the the main storm that

938
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,720
people seem to be worried about and that

939
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:22,078
occurred all the way back in

940
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:24,118
2018 and we immediately got invited

941
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,160
again a couple weeks later to uh

942
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:28,880
exercise a hurricane exercise which is

943
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:30,559
basically a mock hurricane where the

944
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,519
National Hurricane Center came and kind

945
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:35,838
of walked through all the local

946
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:38,119
officials on how you know how the the

947
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:40,119
reports go out how they should take into

948
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:41,800
account and the emergency manager is

949
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:44,039
essentially assigning jobs to all the

950
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,000
different local officials in Emergency

951
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:49,039
Management time because Jones County is

952
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,760
a rather small County and a lot of the

953
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:52,880
local officials have to wear multiple

954
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,760
hats in the sense that they have to be

955
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,440
prepared to be Emergency

956
00:41:54,760 --> 00:42:01,240
Management facilitators in some in some

957
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,800
way uh when these events occur and we

958
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:04,000
also got to speak in front of the Board

959
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,920
of Commissioners meeting to kind of

960
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,880
introduce ourselves to the county in a

961
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,039
more broad sense and try to try to be

962
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,838
good stewards and local champions in the

963
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:16,358
sense that we're there to serve the

964
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:18,920
public and listen gain feedback and put

965
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:18,920
that into this

966
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:27,319
report we also surveyed local residents

967
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:29,039
at uh two different areas um one was

968
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:31,400
just a restaurant called agie pizzas and

969
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:34,159
sub it just happened to be near a lot of

970
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,119
the uh town offices that we had

971
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:37,799
initially gone out and met at and when

972
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:39,440
we went in there to get some food the

973
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,760
first time we realized that it was a

974
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,519
probably one of the higher foot traffic

975
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,920
areas in the entirety of Jones County

976
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:46,239
and one of the few restaurants that

977
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,880
remained open after this storm and we

978
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:49,799
realized we could you know gain some

979
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,880
feedback from the community there and

980
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,559
take that into account for our report

981
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,920
and we also wanted to to get different

982
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:59,640
senses of more vulnerable communities so

983
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:01,838
we also sent out a couple coordinators

984
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:04,358
to survey people at The Filling Station

985
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:07,639
was such a nonprofit which is giving out

986
00:43:04,358 --> 00:43:10,558
uh food and we want we just wanted to

987
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:12,799
get as broad of a resident pool as we

988
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:15,640
could and take into account as much

989
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,640
feedback as we

990
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:21,720
could so this is some of what we heard

991
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:23,960
from the residents we asked them what

992
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:25,519
they were what they thought was the most

993
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,318
important or they were most worried

994
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:29,519
about out of all these either either

995
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:32,079
environmental hazards or Community

996
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:35,639
assets um you see schools was the main

997
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:37,720
Community Asset people worried about and

998
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:40,400
with just shortly behind Public Safety

999
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:42,639
in the emergency medal services uh and

1000
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,639
then flooding and hurricanes was clearly

1001
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:47,679
the kind of runaway environmental hazard

1002
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:50,318
which we kind of expected coming in

1003
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:53,598
after hearing uh the the stories about

1004
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:53,599
hurricane Florence back in

1005
00:43:56,039 --> 00:44:00,599
2018 here's just a couple pictures from

1006
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,880
hor hurricane Florence this is uh in

1007
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:04,838
poville and that man right there is

1008
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,720
walking across uh the bridge that you

1009
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:11,519
can see here to the right and the US

1010
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:14,480
Geological Survey meter readed over 20

1011
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:17,800
feet of flooding above the normal Water

1012
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:20,559
Crest so this was a extreme event a

1013
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:23,359
500-year flood as they call it but I'll

1014
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:25,319
kind of get into later why what a lot of

1015
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:28,119
our work does is breaking down what that

1016
00:44:25,318 --> 00:44:30,000
500-year flood means and and how we can

1017
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:33,000
kind of move forward as extension

1018
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,719
coordinators and science communicators

1019
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,719
better in communicating this

1020
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:43,039
issue so here is just some of the data

1021
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,400
that we compiled from different reports

1022
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:48,159
and satellite imagery and FEMA flood

1023
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:50,039
plane data um this is Hurricane Matthew

1024
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:53,039
which was two years before Florence and

1025
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:55,920
Florence and we just essentially use

1026
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:58,318
this data to take addresses different

1027
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,960
critical assets that we found and mapped

1028
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:01,800
and kind of see where they were in the

1029
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,920
storm extents and the flood plane

1030
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,480
extents and doing this allowed us to

1031
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,599
really think about the differences

1032
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:10,519
between these things and kind of

1033
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,800
communicate some of the maybe the

1034
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:16,039
misunderstandings and flood data that

1035
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:18,920
people have when they're on the

1036
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:22,239
ground so one of our main messages was

1037
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:23,920
flood planes they flood even though it's

1038
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:25,879
a 100-year flood plane it's only

1039
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,680
supposed to have a 1% chance of annual

1040
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:30,000
flooding um we thought that

1041
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:31,960
communicating a 26% chance of flooding

1042
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,079
over a 30-year mortgage is a bit more

1043
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,880
effective in terms of describing what

1044
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,440
this really is and the reason that fem

1045
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,720
flood planes are created is because they

1046
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:43,159
flood so we wanted to make sure that

1047
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:44,639
just because you know it hasn't flooded

1048
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:46,000
this often and this is oh this is the

1049
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:48,078
first time your house is flooded in a

1050
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,559
flood plane you know they these were

1051
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:53,359
created because they're they're flood

1052
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:53,359
and they're a low-lying

1053
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:59,519
area and Beyond the flood plane as well

1054
00:45:57,159 --> 00:46:01,399
there we wanted to quantify kind of

1055
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:03,719
differences between the flood plane and

1056
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,880
like this 250 meter buffer zone just

1057
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:08,558
outside because a lot of that really

1058
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,760
kind of breaks down the issues in

1059
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:12,760
development and discussions in the

1060
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,760
area so we were able to quantify that

1061
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:20,118
even though there's not a ton of

1062
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,319
infrastructure within the flood plane

1063
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:24,640
you can see almost a third of police

1064
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:27,239
stations addresses and buildings in

1065
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:29,838
general and over that a productive land

1066
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:32,279
was inside that 250 meter buffer zone

1067
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:34,000
which really kind of illustrates the

1068
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,160
problem that we have as did Hurricane

1069
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,599
Florence extent outside of the flood

1070
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:40,199
plane and in way into that 250 meter

1071
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:42,519
buff Zone and maybe even beyond that at

1072
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:42,519
certain

1073
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:48,799
points another thing I want to discuss

1074
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:51,639
quickly was uh buyouts FEA buyouts was a

1075
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:55,720
big part of discussion in a big point of

1076
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:57,838
contention I felt um in Jones County 111

1077
00:46:55,719 --> 00:46:59,639
people sought buyouts which was the most

1078
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:02,639
in the state during this hurricane

1079
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:04,879
Florence but they are the fourth least

1080
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:07,358
populous County and there's a lot of

1081
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,640
issues with FEMA buyouts in terms of if

1082
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:13,119
you don't have a deed available if

1083
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:14,199
you're not owning the property uh

1084
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:16,760
there's if there's just some

1085
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:19,078
stipulations in the sense of who gets

1086
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,520
the buyouts and also this is a small

1087
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:24,440
County and decreasing that tax base and

1088
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:26,318
property taxes is a huge hit in terms of

1089
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,358
the income they're making each year and

1090
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:32,639
actually SP ending to make it a more

1091
00:47:28,358 --> 00:47:32,639
resilient future for the Jones County

1092
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:38,119
residents quickly I wanted to show this

1093
00:47:36,838 --> 00:47:39,719
map because I think there was a nice

1094
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:41,559
story with this map and I was really

1095
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:44,159
excited about making this at first uh

1096
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:47,240
this is poville and I kind of overlapped

1097
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:48,960
the flood plane and then the Hurricane

1098
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:51,318
Matthew extent and hurricane Florence

1099
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,760
extent and then both and I was really

1100
00:47:51,318 --> 00:47:56,119
excited about this map and I thought it

1101
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,440
might provide really good data for some

1102
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:01,760
people down there on the ground but then

1103
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:05,358
I sent this map to the mayor of poville

1104
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:08,880
and he told me that while the Florence

1105
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:10,358
data was actually not quite as large as

1106
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,160
it should have been as this satellite

1107
00:48:10,358 --> 00:48:14,799
imagy was taking a couple days after

1108
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:17,000
Peak flooding the Hurricane Matthew data

1109
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,559
actually overextended and showed too

1110
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,760
much damage as a lot it was only a

1111
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:25,400
couple houses that actually had water in

1112
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:27,760
uh inundate their their homes and damage

1113
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:31,920
anything most of the flooding imagery

1114
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:35,160
from Matthew actually was you know

1115
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,800
relatively o overestimated in terms of

1116
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:39,598
the way it's shown on this map so I

1117
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,280
wanted to kind of share that and show

1118
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,200
the importance of creating Community

1119
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,880
connections because without that I might

1120
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:46,759
have just gone along and thought this is

1121
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,400
a great map and I can't wait to show it

1122
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:51,480
to everybody and tell everybody this is

1123
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,519
exactly what happened but I I was able

1124
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,679
to ground truth it by sending it

1125
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:58,719
directly to the mayor poville so that

1126
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:58,719
worked out well

1127
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,920
this is the final map I created and we

1128
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:04,920
took a step back in terms of including

1129
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:07,280
all the addresses and kind of focusing

1130
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:09,440
more on these critical assets and I also

1131
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,680
put in the 500-year flood plane here

1132
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,000
because that was something we heard a

1133
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:16,879
lot about it was a 500-year flood plane

1134
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:20,039
it was a 500-year storm and I kind of

1135
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,838
wanted to show that this flood extended

1136
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:23,838
to the 500-year flood plane and some

1137
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:25,318
points Beyond it seems like from some of

1138
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:27,679
the imagery and videos that I've

1139
00:49:25,318 --> 00:49:30,639
gathered from this day

1140
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:31,919
and while 500-year flood plane it's not

1141
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:34,000
a storm that's going to happen very

1142
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,119
often you know with increasing

1143
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,079
uncertainties and the climate future and

1144
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:44,240
lack of different

1145
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:46,440
flood flooding uh issues being accounted

1146
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:49,159
for in these FEMA flood planes they

1147
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:51,920
shouldn't be the end all Beall in terms

1148
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:54,118
of understanding a flood plane and how

1149
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,280
you accept and intake the data and I

1150
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:57,358
think there needs to be a lot more in

1151
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,798
reach

1152
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:01,759
and ground truthing in terms of

1153
00:49:59,798 --> 00:50:05,639
communicating how these floods are going

1154
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:08,319
to go go ahead in the future and what

1155
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:11,078
the work we need to do to ensure that

1156
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:13,639
people are safe and understand some of

1157
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:17,640
the risks that are coming forward so

1158
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:17,639
thank you and any

1159
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:23,039
questions Jack before you leave the

1160
00:50:20,358 --> 00:50:27,480
screen can you go back one

1161
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:30,199
image or maybe two now yeah this one so

1162
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:32,920
when you ground truth I first of all yay

1163
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:35,719
congrats I love that um when you ground

1164
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:38,760
truthed with the mayor um but didn't you

1165
00:50:35,719 --> 00:50:42,159
say that actually the Florence was

1166
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:45,319
expanded further so yes and that's why I

1167
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:47,639
included this image up here because uh

1168
00:50:45,318 --> 00:50:49,838
this image up here up here where my

1169
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:52,239
cursor is right here that is the schools

1170
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:55,798
that you can see over here and you can't

1171
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:57,519
see it in the imagery here but there is

1172
00:50:55,798 --> 00:50:59,440
water all under schools and there was up

1173
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:01,400
to three feet I believe of water in

1174
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,440
those schools they they had to build a

1175
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,760
brand new school and by the time they

1176
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,679
got into those schools there was mold

1177
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:09,440
growing in it so this was kind of a way

1178
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:11,519
of me being having to step back and say

1179
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,599
oh you know sometimes it's easy to

1180
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:16,639
overlook and not realize oh yeah that

1181
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:19,000
was taken two days later and there's

1182
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:20,078
clouds over the peak flooding day and

1183
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,838
they weren't able to get satellite

1184
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,720
imagery and it was really kind of a

1185
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:24,519
great experience in terms of

1186
00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:27,118
understanding the importance of

1187
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:29,000
community engagement and how

1188
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:31,160
that can really create like a nice

1189
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,400
feedback loop in terms of research and

1190
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:36,078
also

1191
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:38,760
education okay and Megan has a question

1192
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:41,039
in the chat or Mara sorry Mara has a

1193
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:44,119
question in the chat

1194
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:46,759
um asking about liar maps and the role

1195
00:51:44,119 --> 00:51:49,920
in the 500-year flood plane delineation

1196
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:52,440
do you have any thoughts on that um I

1197
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,400
mean I'm not really sure what if exactly

1198
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:57,960
how the 500-year flood planes are

1199
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:01,280
created entirely I'm I looked too

1200
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:03,639
directly into that in the lar Maps but I

1201
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:06,040
think there's I'm not exactly sure if

1202
00:52:03,639 --> 00:52:07,879
they account for the different hurricane

1203
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:09,798
precipitation all the different flood

1204
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:11,880
effects because we heard ground truth

1205
00:52:09,798 --> 00:52:14,079
thing on the ground that uh the river

1206
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:16,240
that this Trent river flows into where a

1207
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:18,240
lot of the flooding comes from that

1208
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:19,199
River was flowing backwards during

1209
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:22,838
Hurricane

1210
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:24,358
Florence and things like that you know

1211
00:52:22,838 --> 00:52:26,960
I'm modeling I'm doing a lot of coastal

1212
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:29,558
modeling myself I'm not even sure where

1213
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:34,240
how you start to model that how you take

1214
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:36,119
into account wind Tides hurricane you

1215
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:38,439
know the hurricane Vortex winds in

1216
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:40,599
general and how you take all that into

1217
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,880
account it's it's really difficult and I

1218
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:44,559
think it's something that we have to

1219
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:49,039
communicate and be honest as modelers

1220
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:52,119
that models aren't always correct you

1221
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:53,798
know okay I'm gonna ask another question

1222
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:56,880
um

1223
00:52:53,798 --> 00:53:00,159
so if you had your magic ball or

1224
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:03,720
actually your magic wand

1225
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:07,480
um uh how would you reorganize the FEMA

1226
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:09,519
buyouts so that um because all the spots

1227
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:13,639
you showed look like they needed to be

1228
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:16,239
bought out period right like so I mean

1229
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:19,679
it's not for lack of logic for buying

1230
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:24,399
them out um what what would be your one

1231
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:28,039
sort of policy drive or wish for making

1232
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,680
that a more Equitable system

1233
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:33,079
well I don't even

1234
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:34,798
know it's hard because you know I

1235
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:36,359
understand the need for deeds and these

1236
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:37,798
things to ensure that you know people

1237
00:53:36,358 --> 00:53:39,798
aren't you know trying to take advantage

1238
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:41,199
of the system I understand that but I

1239
00:53:39,798 --> 00:53:43,599
think in general there just needs to be

1240
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:45,439
more maybe competition because I know

1241
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,440
that there some byouts were facilitated

1242
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:51,159
by the NC office in

1243
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:55,358
resiliency and maybe just more programs

1244
00:53:51,159 --> 00:53:57,558
besides FEMA to maybe even just you know

1245
00:53:55,358 --> 00:54:00,159
try to make them compete and make it

1246
00:53:57,559 --> 00:54:02,440
easier for people to facilitate bi if

1247
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:04,199
they really want to but like I said at

1248
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,760
the end of the day I kind of was

1249
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:07,759
thinking about that a lot and then I I

1250
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,119
also talked to the county manager and

1251
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,599
realized you know buyouts really can't

1252
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:13,880
be the end all be all when you're in a

1253
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,599
really small populist County because

1254
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:18,559
they need to get money so they can make

1255
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:21,559
more resilient you know infrastructure

1256
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:24,119
too so I don't think there's really an

1257
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:25,720
good answer there but I think in general

1258
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:27,519
there needs to be it needs to be easier

1259
00:54:25,719 --> 00:54:29,279
for people to get money in these

1260
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:32,719
disaster events they shouldn't have to

1261
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:35,400
struggle and you know go through this

1262
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:35,399
over and over

1263
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:41,079
again does anybody else have any other

1264
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:43,039
questions either from the panel or in

1265
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:46,240
the

1266
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:48,519
chat okay well I want to thank you all
