1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:04,759
University

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,519
so I'm here today to talk about

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,519
mushrooms and International Development

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:20,039
I was able to travel to two unique

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,140
locations in the world Bangladesh and

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,820
Rwanda

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,518
Bangladesh was not all about mushrooms I

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,260
did go following love I went to go visit

10
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:31,198
my girlfriend Amanda while she was

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,020
collecting her data for her PhD

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,579
thanks Amanda

13
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,859
but it was also for adventure you know

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,239
there's a lot of lessons that you can't

15
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:41,339
learn in the classroom and you can't

16
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:42,959
find in the library and so I was really

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,420
excited for these sort of experiential

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,160
learning opportunities

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,539
um and then uh

20
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:50,159
you know I'm interested to get into

21
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,879
International Development

22
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,819
um

23
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:57,000
and I asked Dr Peter Hobbs who some of

24
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,100
you may know I asked him how I could

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,719
become involved in international

26
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,640
agriculture development he said Brian

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,739
you just got to do it you just got to go

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,579
there and get experience and do it and

29
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,299
so

30
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:10,978
I went and uh that's that this is also

31
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,560
sort of an opportunity for my own

32
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:16,140
Shameless self-promotion

33
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,420
um I'm gonna hopefully graduate this may

34
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,640
so I'll be looking for a job anybody

35
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,939
knows a good good opportunity I'd be

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,439
happy to entertain that

37
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:28,079
um so let's start by combating

38
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:30,000
stereotypes about mushrooms mushrooms

39
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,819
are the fruiting body in the kingdom

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,799
fungi fungi their own unique Kingdom

41
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:37,258
there are a number of

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,180
um players The Good the Bad and

43
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,739
according to George hudler no no uglies

44
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,060
right

45
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:43,859
um

46
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,960
and there's a number of uses number of

47
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:48,118
ways different mushrooms and fungi can

48
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:50,759
contribute to society in terms of human

49
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:52,319
health and ecological Health

50
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,659
um

51
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,000
so yeah and then you know one stereotype

52
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,579
we encounter a lot here in the

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,739
university is the um psychedelic

54
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,478
mushrooms so if you guys need to get it

55
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:05,099
out of your system maybe make a joke to

56
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:08,580
your neighbor really quick and then we

57
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:10,978
can move on from this stereotype

58
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,780
so

59
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,280
I uh first became interested in

60
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,900
mushrooms and reading this book mycelium

61
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,818
running by Paul stamets

62
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,379
Paul stamets is a he's a rock star

63
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:21,839
Mycologist

64
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:26,098
um really very

65
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,840
um persuasive and sort of convincing all

66
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:30,000
the benefits that mushrooms can provide

67
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,378
to society

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,479
um some of the benefits including

69
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:36,120
include the remediation of Agriculture

70
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:37,859
runoff on the top you see a number of

71
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,379
mushroom species I know it's kind of

72
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,180
small trust me they're there and then a

73
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:45,479
number of potentially disease-causing

74
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,379
organisms that are often the result of

75
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:50,818
um wildlife and and in rain water runoff

76
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:52,799
and so these mushrooms were incorporated

77
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:55,619
into riparian buffers have the ability

78
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,379
to kill

79
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,519
a number of these pathogens some of

80
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,979
which are beginning to develop

81
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,560
antibiotic resistance

82
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:06,539
they've also certain mushrooms are also

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,580
capable of remediating chemical chemical

84
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:09,739
contaminants as a result of industrial

85
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,120
activities

86
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:13,259
what's really neat about these mushrooms

87
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,539
is that they have the ability to

88
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:17,899
metabolize these chemical contaminants

89
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:20,280
rather than just absorb and translocate

90
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,260
as is common with

91
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,300
more traditional bioremediation

92
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:26,639
strategies plant-based bioremediation

93
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,620
strategies and so you see things in here

94
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,719
like

95
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:35,219
organophosphates pesticides try not

96
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:38,039
toluene that's TNT so this is you know a

97
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:41,340
remarkable way to use a living organism

98
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:43,679
to sort of fix the damage we as humans

99
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,700
have done to the environment

100
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,080
mushrooms can also be used as pesticides

101
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:51,839
the most expensive Mushroom in the world

102
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,719
is a member of the cordyceps genus which

103
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,878
is pictured here it affects caterpillars

104
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,439
in the Himalayan plateau in Central Asia

105
00:03:56,878 --> 00:03:59,878
and like I said this is the most

106
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:01,378
expensive mushroom

107
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:03,780
in the world there's also certain

108
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:06,419
cordyceps species that will infect ants

109
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,840
or grasshoppers can really help to

110
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:11,818
reduce

111
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,878
economic reduced populations to below an

112
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:16,199
economic threshold

113
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,819
mushrooms are also very beneficial in

114
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,739
human health they have a great ability

115
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:21,358
to bridge the gap between foods and

116
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:24,478
medicines there are a number of

117
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,879
different disease and disease

118
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:30,000
pathologies that they've been associated

119
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,319
with affecting I've got citations for

120
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,540
all of these if you'd like to talk more

121
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:34,800
about this later

122
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,180
but really they're you know there needs

123
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,660
to be more research done into the

124
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,340
applied aspects of mycology

125
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,439
it's a great way to sort of bridge

126
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:46,500
explore the interaction between both

127
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:50,279
human and environmental health

128
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:53,100
so on to the journey Bangladesh was um

129
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:55,799
first became a country in 1971 before

130
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,320
that it was known as East Pakistan after

131
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,220
the 1947 British partition

132
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:05,819
but due to a number of factors not the

133
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,740
least of which was Geographic separation

134
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:10,139
Bangladesh

135
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,439
fought for their independence and gained

136
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:14,720
that in 1971.

137
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:17,579
there continue to be a number of

138
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,400
political issues in Bangladesh that have

139
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:23,099
sort of affected its its coming of age

140
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:26,339
as a country but in addition to the

141
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:28,919
political turmoil Bangladesh is also the

142
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:31,439
site of the highest concentrations of

143
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:34,680
naturally occurring arsenic in the world

144
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:36,538
it infects the soil and groundwater and

145
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,418
has been described by some as a public

146
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:42,060
health emergency close to 50 percent of

147
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:43,399
Bangladesh's population is at risk of

148
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,620
exposure

149
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:48,198
and traditional strategies rely on the

150
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,699
filtration from water

151
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:53,639
which is significantly inhibited by

152
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:55,020
access to financial resources in terms

153
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,060
of getting this technology out to the

154
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:59,758
people who really need it

155
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,060
so in in doing my research for my

156
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,879
Master's Degree I came across this paper

157
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:08,819
mitigation of arsenic mediated stress in

158
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:11,339
rats and while it is a big jump from

159
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:14,519
rats to humans this is very promising

160
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:16,859
and it's the light bulbs went off in my

161
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:21,418
head and I wanted to explore this more

162
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:23,699
how can mushrooms help Bangladesh

163
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:25,560
um so I traveled to Bangladesh with two

164
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,538
main questions

165
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,879
um what is the current state of mushroom

166
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:32,219
activities in Bangladesh from an

167
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:33,959
extension standpoint and then our

168
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,580
specialty mushrooms an appropriate

169
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,439
strategy and preventing

170
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:39,659
um arsenic toxicity

171
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,740
and so for the first question

172
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,300
um

173
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,038
I knew a little bit of information going

174
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,259
there Amanda had traveled to Bangladesh

175
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:48,060
and uh in the year prior

176
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:49,080
and wanted me to come visit her the next

177
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,699
time she would be traveling to

178
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:53,159
Bangladesh so I said hey find something

179
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,840
with mushrooms and I'll be there and so

180
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,280
she was able to come up with the

181
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:58,138
national mushroom development and

182
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:00,239
Extension Center

183
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,800
um which engages in research activities

184
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,319
to promote a national collection of

185
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,639
useful mushrooms human resource and

186
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,560
agriculture development training

187
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,960
researching quality parameters of

188
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,300
products and production tools to enhance

189
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:14,279
branding and verification expanding

190
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,139
consumer awareness in addition to

191
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:18,359
increasing consumer interest in order to

192
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:21,120
develop trade relationships for an

193
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,139
export driven development

194
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,538
um

195
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:26,639
so that's that's what she found and I

196
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:27,538
was there to explore it um I know in

197
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,460
their mission this is their mission

198
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:32,699
statement that I just read to you and

199
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:33,418
they describe export driven development

200
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,120
um

201
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:39,180
just out of curiosity does anybody have

202
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,098
any opinion on the goal of export-driven

203
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,019
development versus regional development

204
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:45,259
in terms of a novel crops such as

205
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:47,339
mushrooms it could be for anything

206
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:49,020
special to you know high value

207
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:50,399
Horticulture products

208
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:52,560
I don't know if anybody has an opinion

209
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:55,579
on on that I don't want to be the only

210
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,579
one talking here so

211
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:02,418
well

212
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:10,519
right you can can you I mean the goal of

213
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,960
export is it exploitation

214
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:14,698
and provide shootings for the goal of an

215
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,159
export-driven development opportunity

216
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:19,199
are you exploiting environment and

217
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,419
people or can you really help people

218
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,800
with an export driven

219
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,799
goal it's been used

220
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:33,918
anybody else

221
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,320
that's sort of what I think but I don't

222
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:39,478
want to

223
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,399
you know I know some people believe in

224
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,278
that export-driven development

225
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,000
strategies are the way the way to go

226
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:46,679
um

227
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,620
so yeah I'd be happy to talk with

228
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:52,679
anybody after that after the talk

229
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,879
um so uh the national mushroom

230
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,739
development and Extension Center

231
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:57,659
currently There are 16 sub-centers

232
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,659
located throughout the Republic of

233
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:04,500
Bangladesh the center is in Savar the

234
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:07,379
the main Center or the facility was

235
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,778
started in 1979 and experienced a

236
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:12,179
significant lag phase until 2003 when

237
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:15,000
they began to Gear Up production systems

238
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:16,199
thanks to uh grants from the Asian

239
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,458
development Bank

240
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:24,060
in 2009 the Japanese Development Bank

241
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:25,819
ex gave another Grant to the Extension

242
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:28,079
Center

243
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,600
promoting their current capacity of the

244
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,120
16 sub-centers

245
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,940
and making it a part of the national

246
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:39,360
extension system in Bangladesh

247
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,760
um one thing I should mention is that um

248
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,839
literally literally translated the word

249
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:48,299
mushroom and Bangla is frog umbrella so

250
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,640
that may give you sort of a hint on on

251
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:52,939
how people will accept mushrooms as a

252
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,939
food product

253
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,838
um so after arriving in Dhaka we

254
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:59,399
traveled to the southern district of

255
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,940
Milwaukee

256
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:05,240
um and I hired a translator and spent

257
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,920
the time roaming the countryside

258
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,620
pursuing my own interest we found that

259
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:13,559
several former mushroom Farmers no

260
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,299
current mushroom farmers who told us

261
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:16,319
that when when they were selling

262
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:19,559
mushrooms

263
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,540
they would sell for about 200 taka per

264
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:23,819
kilogram fresh and 2000 Taco per

265
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:25,679
kilogram dry taka is the currency of

266
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,060
Bangladesh it's roughly 80 taka to a

267
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,778
dollar

268
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,018
um

269
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:32,879
so this is a pretty high value product

270
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:35,940
and and maybe not within the purchasing

271
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,539
capacity of many rural households

272
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,180
um

273
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:41,299
they mentioned that obstacles to the

274
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:43,859
expansion of their Enterprise

275
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:46,199
included lack of acceptance of mushrooms

276
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:49,560
as a food product a lack of profitable

277
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,600
Market outlets and unreliability or poor

278
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:54,018
quality of Spawn that was being sold to

279
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,620
them by the either the national

280
00:10:54,019 --> 00:11:00,720
Extension Center or private Enterprises

281
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:02,399
but there was promise that they

282
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,800
recognized they began to cultivate

283
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,278
mushrooms because they recognized the

284
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:10,500
unique properties mushrooms contain as a

285
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:12,899
food item one of the gentlemen we spoke

286
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,179
to began cultivating mushrooms because

287
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:16,500
his father was sick and he wanted to

288
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:17,819
grow mushrooms because he thought the

289
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,200
mushrooms would help his father get

290
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,660
better

291
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,740
um and so you see this in the more

292
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:25,620
educated individuals that they can

293
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,480
recognize and understand the benefit

294
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,839
um that that mushrooms can have in the

295
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,839
human body

296
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,959
um

297
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:36,000
following our visit in newarkly and

298
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,139
there were a couple other experiences in

299
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,399
this region

300
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:39,958
um

301
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,059
Excuse me while I was in newaukee we

302
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:44,639
traveled to Camilla which is another

303
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:47,458
city in Bangladesh and visited this

304
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:50,159
Camilla substation here they were

305
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:53,939
currently producing mushrooms they sold

306
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:57,059
for 130 taka per kilogram fresh and 1500

307
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:59,279
Taco per kilogram dry

308
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:03,059
um and they explained to me a little bit

309
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:04,259
about the um training that Growers must

310
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:06,479
go through to be a part of this

311
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:07,919
extension system it's a three-day

312
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,860
training program

313
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:13,519
farmer Farmers or people are paid 600

314
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:16,079
taka to attend the training

315
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,240
and then they're given 25 free spawn

316
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:20,399
bags to begin their own Enterprise

317
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,799
so you really you know there's really a

318
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,659
big um push to get these Farmers to

319
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:27,419
attend the meetings a great incentive

320
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:28,799
600 taka that's

321
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:31,500
um you know some of the rural day

322
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,359
laborers we talked with their daily

323
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,078
wages

324
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,399
um

325
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:40,979
range from 200 taka to 500 taka per day

326
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,519
and so this is you know potentially

327
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:47,220
three days worth of wage by coming to

328
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,839
this training session whether they learn

329
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,360
to grow mushrooms or not you know they

330
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,040
were there and they got paid

331
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,480
um

332
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,240
we were

333
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,500
um oh so once the the farmers go through

334
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,339
the training

335
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,600
um maybe a week or two afterwards the

336
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:06,420
extension agents will visit their farms

337
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,459
and provide troubleshooting advice if

338
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:10,860
they aren't able to sell their mushrooms

339
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:13,799
then they will the Extension Center will

340
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,379
buy the mushrooms from them usually in

341
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:19,578
the dried form at whatever the

342
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:21,659
prevailing market rate is

343
00:13:19,578 --> 00:13:23,519
during this time we were also able to

344
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:26,699
visit the Finney substation then he's

345
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:30,000
another city in Bangladesh

346
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,700
and we um

347
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,799
on the way to this station we came

348
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,600
across a doctor

349
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,819
um

350
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,940
I don't know he was he'd been in the

351
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:44,100
pharmacy trade for roughly 25 years I

352
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,399
don't think he he hadn't been to formal

353
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,420
medical school but

354
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,059
anyways he was referred to as a doctor

355
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:54,360
within the village

356
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:56,338
um and he prescribed Pharmaceuticals and

357
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,139
he used a pharmaceutical in his practice

358
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,660
one drug that was a mushroom derived

359
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:02,159
product for Myanmar in 2005 during the

360
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:05,879
caretaker government he wasn't able to

361
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:07,860
access this medicine and decided then

362
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,299
that he would grow his own mushrooms now

363
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,300
mind you this doctor was a former

364
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:14,939
mushroom grower again he cited limited

365
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:18,439
market development as his main obstacle

366
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,440
in developing this Enterprise

367
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:23,939
is the name of the sub Center in Finney

368
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:26,518
that means coconut Garden they had a

369
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,800
number of coconut trees it was uh they

370
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:30,019
were evaluating for different different

371
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:32,219
um

372
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:34,620
parameters and so we got to eat a lot of

373
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,339
coconuts during this visit it was it was

374
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,659
fun

375
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:38,700
um

376
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:42,240
and we talked to the director of the sub

377
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:44,060
Center who described a failure again a

378
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,560
failure of acceptance as a food item

379
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:48,559
lack of markets failure to create a

380
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,759
systemic production system and poor

381
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,958
retention of growers in the training

382
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,740
program

383
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:58,619
and so we see this this big National

384
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,480
um program but it's having trouble

385
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,159
getting off the ground and we'll talk

386
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,320
about some of the strategies in the next

387
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:07,319
but the next visit

388
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,839
um but one of the the positive impacts

389
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:13,220
of mushroom production is that it can be

390
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:17,040
done in sort of a local Village level

391
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:19,199
the number of Muslim communities women

392
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,939
are confined to The Cloister or the

393
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:24,240
group of houses that surround their own

394
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:26,639
household they aren't permitted to

395
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,240
travel to markets

396
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,278
or leave this tight Village area and so

397
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,419
mushrooms you don't have to go out to

398
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:35,338
the farms you don't have to go to the

399
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:36,838
field to cultivate mushrooms you can do

400
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:40,079
it in your backyard or next to your

401
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:41,279
house and so there have been a couple of

402
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,278
papers

403
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:46,620
that suggest Mushroom Enterprise may be

404
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:49,759
a method of gender sensitive development

405
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:53,278
a way to empower women in Bangladesh

406
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,480
we met with one woman this picture is I

407
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:55,620
took that picture that's not from the

408
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,519
paper

409
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,159
um

410
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:01,339
we met with this woman who she was

411
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:03,838
engaged in mushroom production

412
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:05,220
but said that

413
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,600
um she didn't know if it was a

414
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,399
profitable Enterprise because her

415
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,199
husband took care of all the financial

416
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,820
matters so

417
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:14,519
I guess I posed the question is this

418
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:17,720
really a gender sensitive opportunity or

419
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,720
do they need to tweak it a little

420
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,899
um

421
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:25,078
so

422
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,000
following

423
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:29,039
um

424
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,958
uh after a number of different

425
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,240
experiences later on in the fall I was

426
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,319
able to visit the center in Savar and

427
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,940
met with the direct the national

428
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,899
director of the mushroom development

429
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,440
program Dr Nira Chandra shakhar

430
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,240
um

431
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,680
in Savage the primary stage of

432
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,959
development they're trying to establish

433
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:47,159
processing and production technology

434
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,198
and they maintain a very close

435
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:51,059
relationship with India China and Japan

436
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:54,539
this is the source of all their

437
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:56,039
germplasm for the mushrooms so these are

438
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:59,219
all exotic species that are being

439
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:00,919
imported into Bangladesh maybe if they

440
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,959
were able to isolate

441
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:05,480
locally growing species that may be more

442
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,379
culturally adapted

443
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,058
environmentally adapted they may have

444
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,459
more success in their production systems

445
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:13,259
maybe the shape of the oyster mushroom

446
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:14,640
was throwing off consumers if they've

447
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:15,359
found something more recognizable to

448
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,059
them

449
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,399
they may want to eat it more but I think

450
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:23,399
there's really a big Obstacle of

451
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,900
perception with mushrooms in Bangladesh

452
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,900
as a whole

453
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,900
um

454
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,620
foreign

455
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,660
there are a number of advertising

456
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:35,639
programs on the radio and television

457
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:39,600
trying to promote the benefits of

458
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,520
mushroom as a food source and

459
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:42,899
people some of the people I talked to

460
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,339
suggested that this was making a

461
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,840
difference there's a few papers out

462
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:47,279
saying it's making a difference in

463
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,980
promoting mushroom consumption in

464
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:52,678
Bangladesh but I I'm still skeptical

465
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:55,380
that that they are um

466
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:56,038
actually making an impact

467
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,840
um

468
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:59,759
so just to conclude that section A

469
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,558
little bit uh Bangladesh Harbor is a

470
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,660
very robust extension system for

471
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:06,480
promoting mushroom development but it's

472
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:10,500
a very top-down oriented program coming

473
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,480
from International entities to um

474
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,538
to the local level

475
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,538
um

476
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:32,519
well so I mean mushrooms can be produced

477
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:33,720
in a variety of scales and methods I

478
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,879
mean you can produce it on the household

479
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,380
level

480
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,600
but you know here in the United States

481
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,940
they're all produced on a big huge

482
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,219
industrial scale

483
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,558
um you know I'm not really sure why they

484
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,179
chose mushrooms as a development

485
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,038
opportunity and why it's received so

486
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:52,320
much funding

487
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:53,819
um it I mean it very much seemed like

488
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:55,558
they were trying to force mushrooms on

489
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:57,359
the population

490
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:59,038
so

491
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:00,719
um

492
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,879
yeah but then here in the Chittagong

493
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,579
Hill track region and I'll talk about

494
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:10,260
this region a little bit more this is a

495
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:11,519
um an area a very high indigenous a very

496
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:13,259
high concentration of indigenous

497
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:17,179
ethnicities that are probably more

498
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:20,940
closely related to the Burmese Myanmar

499
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:24,000
folks than than the actual people that

500
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,798
make up the population of Bangladesh and

501
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,038
they love mushrooms you can find them in

502
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:31,619
the market you can find them you know

503
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:34,099
people are very eager and readily

504
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:37,019
consume mushrooms so

505
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:39,538
moving forward maybe the Extension

506
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:41,940
Center should concentrate their efforts

507
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:44,099
in in this region I know there's some

508
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,240
tension between

509
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:48,298
um

510
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:51,380
you know the the banglas and and the

511
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:53,639
indigenous ethnicities in several areas

512
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,520
but I was actually had the opportunity

513
00:19:53,640 --> 00:20:00,120
to work there working with a Spanish NGO

514
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:02,099
and I'll get to that in a little bit

515
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:04,500
um so while I was in Noah we were able

516
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:05,879
to travel around and um you know I

517
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,160
wanted to develop the agriculture

518
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,360
context I wanted to learn how farmers

519
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:14,460
were how they formed what they used

520
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:18,779
while we were in newarkly this is Dr

521
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:20,819
Chandra charkar at the insavar a few

522
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:21,779
pictures of mushrooms that they were

523
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,700
growing there

524
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:25,379
is the pink oyster

525
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,179
it's pink but it doesn't really taste

526
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,940
very good so

527
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:33,419
I don't know these are Rishi mushrooms

528
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:35,940
being grown near Finney this was one of

529
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:38,160
the most prolific growers in the area he

530
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,779
had 2 000 of these spawn bags that you

531
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,798
can see

532
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:42,918
um

533
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:45,859
and this is

534
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:49,380
it's a

535
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:51,538
rice Patty straw so they take the

536
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,460
Harvest the rice and then the stubbles

537
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:55,519
left in the field and they will harvest

538
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,720
that there's also

539
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,279
some of the rice crops they'll grow are

540
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,538
just for the vegetative matter and not

541
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:02,418
for the rice

542
00:21:00,538 --> 00:21:04,740
simply use that too

543
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:06,360
but you know one of the great things

544
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,259
about oyster mushroom is you can grow it

545
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:09,479
on

546
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:11,519
just about anything you stand kind of

547
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,200
tests you can grow it on toilet paper

548
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:15,500
rolls you can grow it on coffee grounds

549
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,120
and grow it on crude oil

550
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:21,179
it's really a very uh

551
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:22,918
very interesting mushroom

552
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,600
um this is in the uh

553
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:27,360
the the

554
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:28,079
uh if any office

555
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,779
um

556
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:33,058
and so we see that education was

557
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:35,759
um a big factor in adoption of mushroom

558
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,480
growing technology so we could say that

559
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:38,579
um

560
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,839
mushrooms make you more educated yeah

561
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:41,158
maybe

562
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:43,019
probably not

563
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:45,900
um but that education can promote the

564
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:48,240
adoption of mushroom growing and

565
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:51,419
consumption and so

566
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,099
you know I think we can suggest that

567
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:55,440
um an education program in Bangladesh

568
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:57,298
sort of as a whole for but one of the

569
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,038
complementary goals would that would be

570
00:21:57,298 --> 00:21:59,879
that people would eat more mushrooms and

571
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,700
so

572
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,559
education

573
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,200
um so like I said I was able to spend

574
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,940
some time in Noah talking with Farmers

575
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,400
learning

576
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,360
um how they farmed

577
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,640
um

578
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:15,719
in the markets Market vendors were

579
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,759
generally very knowledgeable about

580
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,558
product Origins they can tell you what

581
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,619
town it was from what country it was

582
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:23,579
from if it was imported or domestic

583
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:26,279
um

584
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:28,259
and one problem is the post-harvest

585
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:31,019
storage and handling of high value

586
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:32,099
perishable Horticulture Commodities

587
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:34,259
um

588
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:36,599
formally used is widespread in the value

589
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:38,779
chain do you guys know formalin it's

590
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:42,480
used to preserve cadavers

591
00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:44,158
highly toxic highly carcinogenic but

592
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,558
it's used to keep the produce from

593
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,299
rotting

594
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:49,678
from the from the when they buy it in

595
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:50,879
the local market and transport it to the

596
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,100
Urban Market

597
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,340
so we talk about rural urban Connections

598
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:57,058
in terms of urban food security

599
00:22:56,339 --> 00:22:59,158
um

600
00:22:57,058 --> 00:23:01,700
but in providing that food to the urban

601
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:04,260
populations there may be greater risks

602
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:06,419
there's also reports of people using

603
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:09,200
calcium carbide and

604
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:13,980
etaphon for fruit ripening both of which

605
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:15,779
are not permitted for edible crops

606
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,339
and so there's there is our public

607
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:20,399
health risks in turn in the Horticulture

608
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:22,158
value chain in Bangladesh that very

609
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,200
seriously need to be addressed

610
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,240
and people understand these risks and

611
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,640
and do not want to eat formally

612
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:32,038
contaminated food it's unfortunate that

613
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,460
it's mostly only the upper classes that

614
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:36,900
are able to avoid this risk because

615
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,819
grocery stores have branded their

616
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,159
products as formalin free and full

617
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:42,839
charge of Premium

618
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:44,880
um

619
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:46,619
in Milwaukee we encountered a number of

620
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,720
non-governmental groups engaged in

621
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:49,379
agriculture and extension development

622
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,200
um

623
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,760
you see up top this is a focus group

624
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,640
organized by the nookily rural

625
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:59,158
development society

626
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,780
and this Society performs duties similar

627
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:01,500
to an extension agent

628
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:04,798
um

629
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:06,960
except they focus on smallholder Farms

630
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,918
they provide seeds facilitate micro

631
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:13,679
Credit Opportunity organize Farmers into

632
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:16,759
groups they provide tractors and a range

633
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:19,320
for a cooperation within regions

634
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:21,298
and disseminate information and

635
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:22,500
Technology

636
00:24:21,298 --> 00:24:24,418
um

637
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,038
when we talked in this focus group The

638
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:28,620
Farmers you know you ask farmers what

639
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:30,599
their problems are and you better have

640
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:32,219
your tape recorder on because they

641
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:34,158
Farmers love to talk about how their

642
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,480
their lives could be better

643
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,159
they mentioned very few storage options

644
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,259
for perishable Goods that can't be sold

645
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,820
at the market

646
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:44,759
Winter is the most productive season for

647
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:47,460
them and but yet they're limited by

648
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:49,460
access to Water Resources it is winter

649
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,558
is the dry season in Bangladesh

650
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:54,600
and they like I said were you know you

651
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,279
think with this flooded all these

652
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:59,279
flooded rice paddies that water wouldn't

653
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:00,899
be an issue but in the dry season it can

654
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,119
become a very serious issue

655
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,038
some other complaints were lack of

656
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:06,418
Transportation infrastructure limited

657
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:09,359
educational opportunities for their

658
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:10,919
children problems with soil salinity and

659
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,619
lack of access to Capital

660
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:15,419
uh down here in the bottom left we were

661
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:18,959
talking with a gentleman who led an IPM

662
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:21,240
Club this is a group of farmers who try

663
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,679
to disseminate sustainable Technologies

664
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,079
for Pest Management things like

665
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:26,519
pheromone traps were very popular within

666
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:27,418
this group

667
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:29,940
um

668
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:31,679
and the leader this is a translated

669
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,659
quote he said that waiting on government

670
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:37,140
extension service providers is a dark

671
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:39,299
hope so they've really sort of given up

672
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,159
on the government service providers and

673
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:44,099
providing extension services to their

674
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:45,539
agriculture communities

675
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:47,519
um

676
00:25:45,538 --> 00:25:50,339
and so this was mind you this was all in

677
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,319
noakoli in the southern district and so

678
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:53,759
upon hearing this I said well hey why

679
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,879
don't we go talk to the extension

680
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:59,720
officers so we met with uh

681
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,640
an upazilla agriculture officer

682
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:06,480
upazil is just one of their

683
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,340
districts sub-district do you know the

684
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,960
the hierarchy

685
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:12,859
can you rattle it off maybe some

686
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,860
somebody else knows

687
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:18,619
said

688
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,620
hello

689
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,679
yeah so it's just how they arranged uh

690
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,440
okay

691
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:43,079
okay

692
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:48,678
um so we met with the upazella

693
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:50,940
agriculture officer

694
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:53,220
whose primary duties this is

695
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,320
self-reported primary duties include a

696
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,659
thank you

697
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:58,859
include fertilizer distribution

698
00:26:56,659 --> 00:27:02,240
reporting on agriculture activities and

699
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:02,240
monitoring the block officers

700
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:07,940
and so why is a government agent

701
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:12,599
involved in fertilizer distribution

702
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:14,400
they can probably well anyways but this

703
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:17,099
agent was not from the region he wasn't

704
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,900
from Noah he was from another part of

705
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:20,519
the country he doesn't know the region

706
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,298
very well

707
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:23,700
um

708
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:25,079
you know some of his main problems he

709
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,440
advises Farmers on Pest Management

710
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:30,418
strategies but many farmers will come in

711
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,159
with what they think are Pest management

712
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:34,440
issues really turn out to be soil

713
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,500
nutrient deficiencies but there's really

714
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:40,100
a lack of soil testing facilities in

715
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,099
Bangladesh

716
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,580
you know most of the farmers will

717
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,200
receive get their advice from the local

718
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:48,720
shopkeeper

719
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:52,019
and the shopkeeper his first question is

720
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,038
isn't what is your problem you know what

721
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:54,538
have you done

722
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,519
the first question is how much money do

723
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:59,400
you have and so the shopkeeper will sell

724
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,839
the farmers a product based on not on

725
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,580
their problems but how much money they

726
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:03,899
have and so if they've got a lot of

727
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:06,319
money he'll sell them an expensive

728
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:09,179
chemical or product

729
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:11,579
if they're if it doesn't have a lot of

730
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:15,179
money then he won't

731
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:18,480
these are a list of the pesticides that

732
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:21,360
Farmers said they were using in Noah I

733
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:25,019
want to highlight one right here lindane

734
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:27,119
has been banned in everywhere every part

735
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:28,379
of the world except for India and

736
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:29,278
Bangladesh

737
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,020
um

738
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:33,240
in addition to killing insects it also

739
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:34,980
kills people and so it's been

740
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,319
discontinued for sale in the United

741
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,940
States we found one farmer that was

742
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:40,678
using it

743
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,320
some of the other problems is many of

744
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:45,080
the Farmers can't read and so you have

745
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:48,000
these highly technical pesticide labels

746
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:50,579
and they aren't able to

747
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,798
understand the directions and how to

748
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:56,720
apply these pesticides certainly there's

749
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:56,720
no PPE personal protective equipment

750
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:01,139
but you know they're very readily

751
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:04,080
available there's

752
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:07,080
um you know probably three chemical and

753
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:09,538
Seed shops to every small I mean every

754
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,500
every locality

755
00:29:09,538 --> 00:29:13,440
um

756
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:17,099
after talking with the um uh the

757
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:20,159
upazilla agriculture officer we went and

758
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:23,759
found the plant Protection Officer

759
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:25,620
um who described his he said his duties

760
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:28,980
were organizing farmer training he also

761
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:31,558
grants the pesticide shop licenses

762
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:34,860
um he says farmer training are organized

763
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:36,960
into small medium and large farm groups

764
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:39,298
about 70 percent of the farmers in

765
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,460
Milwaukee fall in this small group a

766
00:29:39,298 --> 00:29:43,158
small farm group 25 in the medium and

767
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,778
five percent in the large

768
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:47,340
landless farmers sharecroppers are

769
00:29:45,778 --> 00:29:49,500
grouped into the large farmer Group

770
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:51,240
which I don't know if that makes sense

771
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,519
or not

772
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,558
um egg subsidies in Bangladesh are

773
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,418
distributed by the ministry of AG uh

774
00:29:55,558 --> 00:30:01,859
fertilizer and there's four basic

775
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:03,538
subsidies fertilizer and pesticide are

776
00:30:01,859 --> 00:30:05,278
the entirety of the monies directed to

777
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:07,500
the Bangladesh chemical industry

778
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:09,000
Association Diesel and Equipment

779
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,798
subsidies are direct deposited into

780
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,319
Farmers bank accounts by the ministry of

781
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:15,798
AG so a farmer needs to have a bank

782
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:18,058
account to be eligible for this money

783
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:19,379
there's subsidies to seed and seedling

784
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:21,418
producers which is directed to the

785
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:23,700
Bangladesh agriculture development

786
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:26,700
commission and then there's price

787
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:30,840
setting subsidies for rice and pulse

788
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:32,580
products did I miss anything that's it

789
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:34,558
great

790
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:37,398
um

791
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:41,940
so following

792
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:44,639
we did get to visit ashwagandh

793
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,019
um I'm saying that right right Amanda

794
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,259
great

795
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:51,240
um so and here we found a almost a

796
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:51,960
success of the extension workers

797
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,019
um

798
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,538
I talked with the district assistant

799
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,740
District supervisor of the extension

800
00:30:57,538 --> 00:31:01,859
um

801
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,399
activities in this for this area

802
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:03,778
um

803
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:05,519
you know we talked with a number of

804
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:07,558
different farmers who none of them

805
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,418
complained everybody knew their block

806
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:11,700
officer they talked with the extension

807
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:14,220
agent I think

808
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,558
you know with the dis the district

809
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:19,200
officer said was that

810
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:21,119
this region is more industrial oriented

811
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,240
than agriculturally oriented and so I

812
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:26,879
think when we say in newarkali is just

813
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:29,759
there's too many farmers I don't want to

814
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,980
say that right there's the the extension

815
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:33,839
officers are overwhelmed and here

816
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,759
there's an appropriate number of

817
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:37,558
extension officers to Farmers and so

818
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,140
they can develop a more personal

819
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:42,058
relationship

820
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,700
um

821
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:48,538
let's see some pictures this guy was in

822
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:51,000
the CNG with us CNG is like a natural

823
00:31:48,538 --> 00:31:53,398
gas like a three-wheeled cart that you

824
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,058
can take between Villages there's a man

825
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:58,619
going around selling these snakes

826
00:31:57,058 --> 00:32:00,839
um

827
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:03,719
he said that if he got bit he had the

828
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:05,398
vaccine so that he wouldn't get poisoned

829
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,140
I don't know it was really interesting

830
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:08,398
to see him he brings them out sort of

831
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:11,460
smacks them around

832
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:13,079
puffs up his hood one poem we visited

833
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:15,500
had a pet deer I don't know our deer

834
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:18,359
common in Bangladesh

835
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:20,519
is this like an endemic thing in the

836
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:21,599
Milwaukee region you can see it's I

837
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:22,918
don't know if you can see it's wearing a

838
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:25,199
collar so

839
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:26,340
this is clearly somebody's pet

840
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,899
yeah

841
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:29,459
just that doesn't really have anything

842
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:31,819
to do with anything just wanted to show

843
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,819
you the pictures

844
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:36,240
um so the Chittagong Hill tracks uh

845
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:37,740
during my time in Bangladesh I was able

846
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,019
to get a consulting position with a

847
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:43,500
Spanish NGO

848
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:45,240
working in this region my specific I was

849
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:48,119
an agriculture technical expert working

850
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,640
on rainwater harvesting techniques for

851
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:52,798
dry season agriculture

852
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,500
it was part of their project to

853
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:56,460
strengthening

854
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,440
socio-economic rights of indigenous

855
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,500
women in the region

856
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,500
um

857
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:06,058
when I took this position on

858
00:33:03,538 --> 00:33:08,220
um I I don't know didn't know a lot

859
00:33:06,058 --> 00:33:10,980
about rainwater harvesting I think

860
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:13,679
people had thought that they would have

861
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:16,200
rain you know the rain barrels

862
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,200
from the harvesting runoff from

863
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,700
buildings and things like that

864
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,278
um a number of the buildings in this

865
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:25,679
area were thatched roof not Stu tin

866
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:27,179
roofs that Harbor a number of microbial

867
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,179
contaminants

868
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:34,380
um so and at this point I really became

869
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:35,820
aware of Cornell not just as a brand and

870
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,860
you know a recognizable name but there's

871
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:39,960
actually professors here that are here

872
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:43,819
to provide help when you need it

873
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:48,240
um Dr Norman upoff and Dr Peter Hobbs

874
00:33:43,819 --> 00:33:50,119
and a number of the staff here provided

875
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,839
some incredible resources

876
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:56,398
that helped me in this position and so

877
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:59,278
essentially what we were doing the the

878
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:01,859
um uh we were working in the Llama Ali

879
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:03,599
kadam area it's characterized like I

880
00:34:01,859 --> 00:34:05,819
said by high populations of indigenous

881
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:08,398
groups household income is dependent on

882
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:10,440
agriculture the traditional system of

883
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:12,418
cultivation is called Doom or jume it's

884
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,099
a shifting cultivation otherwise known

885
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:14,759
as slash and burn

886
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:17,039
um

887
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,379
some of the villages due to increasing

888
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,000
land pressure

889
00:34:18,378 --> 00:34:23,098
these Villages would traditionally have

890
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,800
a 30 to 50 year rotation now because of

891
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:27,659
increased land pressure

892
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,000
they're shortened to three to five so

893
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:32,398
the soil and the ecology doesn't have a

894
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,338
chance to recover this soil organic

895
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:37,259
matter and soil nutrient capacity and so

896
00:34:35,338 --> 00:34:39,059
there you've got serious problems with

897
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,780
erosion

898
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:41,960
um

899
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,800
and loss of of

900
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:46,500
livelihoods almost because they fall

901
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,300
into this cycle of poverty where

902
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,878
traditional cultivation practices result

903
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,560
in reduced soil fertility decreasing

904
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:54,358
Vigor of crops in their resulting

905
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:55,639
progeny all of these Villages save their

906
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:57,440
seeds

907
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:59,700
further contributing to lower

908
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,000
productivity and resulting in reduced

909
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:03,899
wages and food insecurity

910
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,980
um

911
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:10,200
and so my goal was to encourage more

912
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,480
perennial systems this is a companion

913
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:15,179
planting guide

914
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:18,480
that we gave to the so I was working

915
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:20,759
with a local implementing agency turanga

916
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,139
I think is what they were called and

917
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,940
they had their own agriculture officers

918
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:25,379
so I was helping to train the

919
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:27,000
agriculture officers who would then

920
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,280
disseminate this information to the

921
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,639
local villages

922
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,500
and in determining projects to implement

923
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:35,759
can you guys see that

924
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,858
um

925
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,720
and determining projects to implement we

926
00:35:37,858 --> 00:35:42,598
were able to go around and interview The

927
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:45,179
Villages you know I tried to engage in

928
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:47,579
the participatory approach to determine

929
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:50,699
who needed what what their needs were

930
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:52,920
and work together we introduced a number

931
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:54,659
of solutions that came from this

932
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,460
publication if you can see that

933
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:58,679
implementing integrated natural resource

934
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:00,960
management projects under the natural

935
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:03,838
National rural employment guarantee act

936
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,838
the National Royal rural employment

937
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:09,719
guarantee Act is an act in India

938
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:13,619
that basically provides a 100 days of

939
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:16,139
paid labor to rural rural people

940
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:19,440
and so there were a number of strategies

941
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:20,940
for rainwater harvesting and soil water

942
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,000
retention that came from this

943
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:25,740
publication that took place in in

944
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,838
eastern India very close right on the

945
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:29,879
Bangladesh border so appropriate

946
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:32,940
technologies that have been developed in

947
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:35,700
a similar region and then we introduced

948
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,880
these to the localities and they were

949
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:40,019
able to decide what they wanted to do

950
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:42,119
there were some cost sharing

951
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:45,980
arrangements with the implementing

952
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:45,980
organization and the locality

953
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:51,599
so it wasn't just sort of a donation

954
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:53,940
here we'll put in you know a pond for

955
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,859
you for nothing it was the the villagers

956
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:59,579
were engaged in in the problem and the

957
00:36:55,858 --> 00:37:01,980
solution and oftentimes paid to pay for

958
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:03,599
their labor to work so a number of the

959
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,940
strategies were based on the slope of

960
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,440
the land we encountered all of these

961
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,519
different slopes within the villages

962
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,039
some people

963
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:12,719
a few of the more isolated Villages were

964
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:15,599
living exclusively on this eight percent

965
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:17,159
and greater slope area

966
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,539
but then like I said a number of

967
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:21,299
different slopes and each strategy

968
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:23,880
depends on the slope

969
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:26,039
um for its appropriate strategies to try

970
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,740
and just hold the soil hold the ground

971
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:32,639
hold the water in in Syria in serious

972
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:37,379
moisture events and here's pictures from

973
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:39,319
the region this is my my friend Nico

974
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:42,240
this is a pond we dug

975
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:44,460
or helped to dig with with one of the

976
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:47,159
local groups

977
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,599
you can see this is maybe two or three

978
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:52,259
days after we dug the pond and it's

979
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:55,740
already I got more than a meter of water

980
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:58,020
in the bottom of it this is a gully plug

981
00:37:55,739 --> 00:37:58,559
this is the same Village

982
00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:01,500
um

983
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:03,119
which so when when the rain falls you

984
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,280
get these channels being cut out of the

985
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,280
hill and these Gully plugs are put in

986
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,400
place to slow the ground slow the the

987
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,680
water so that it reduces erosion

988
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,300
eventually you'll get like um the soil

989
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:17,219
will build up behind the Gully plug and

990
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,960
you'll have a flat space to cultivate

991
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:21,598
your crops it's full of this Rich

992
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,820
organic topsoil

993
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,039
um that has fallen from the rest of the

994
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:28,019
hill and so you know these are some of

995
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:30,300
the strategies we worked with

996
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:33,059
um and again like I said you know

997
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,800
mushrooms were commonly consumed in this

998
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:37,320
area but I didn't really see the

999
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,560
presence there are I think two of the

1000
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:43,559
extension centers in this area to travel

1001
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:45,239
by foreigners is difficult it's

1002
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:49,259
regulated you have to get a special pass

1003
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:51,059
to enter the Chittagong Hill tracks and

1004
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:53,640
you are are not supposed to be working

1005
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:56,059
when you're there this was all volunteer

1006
00:38:53,639 --> 00:39:00,179
so I wasn't working per se

1007
00:38:56,059 --> 00:39:03,059
but it's it's a there's a lot of turmoil

1008
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:04,500
in this region

1009
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:06,358
that I don't really want to get into

1010
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,679
right now

1011
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:10,920
um

1012
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:13,440
so just sort of reflecting on uh my

1013
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,119
experience in Bangladesh it was it was I

1014
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,519
mean it was a great country I had a

1015
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,559
wonderful time I had a lot of great

1016
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,380
experiences but I think

1017
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:25,199
um in terms of the mushrooms you know it

1018
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:29,220
was very top-down oriented approach

1019
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:32,639
um so in in Rwanda I worked for a usaid

1020
00:39:29,219 --> 00:39:33,598
Hort crisp trellis fund that sounds like

1021
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:34,679
a lot

1022
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,559
um

1023
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:40,319
it's a critical crisp is critical

1024
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:42,659
research support program and the trellis

1025
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,119
fund engages graduate students provides

1026
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:48,539
funds for them to travel for two weeks

1027
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,280
to 13 14 different countries I mean you

1028
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:53,579
only get to travel to one country and

1029
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:56,339
work with one NGO in that country I was

1030
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:57,599
paired with sustaining Rwanda Youth

1031
00:39:56,338 --> 00:39:59,460
Organization

1032
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,680
and they had identified mushroom

1033
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:04,260
cultivation as a mechanism they were

1034
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:08,000
hoping to improve

1035
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:10,980
household food security and provide

1036
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,380
rural Enterprise for one Village that

1037
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,780
they work with and near bhutari the

1038
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:17,579
Southern and the southern region

1039
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:19,440
um and so

1040
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:21,300
when I arrived in Rwanda I spent the

1041
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,500
first week traveling to a number of

1042
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,099
different

1043
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,900
um

1044
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:27,300
mushroom people engaged in the mushroom

1045
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,639
industry mushrooms are very popular in

1046
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:32,099
Rwanda it's considered a high value food

1047
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:33,500
item that's associated with significant

1048
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:36,240
cultural events

1049
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:39,260
Sunday Sundays everybody goes to church

1050
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:42,239
it's a family day so they eat mushrooms

1051
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:45,839
for Easter or other religious holidays

1052
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:48,899
baptisms they'll eat mushrooms and so

1053
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:51,539
you know it was once very expensive but

1054
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:54,000
now it's about half the price of meat in

1055
00:40:51,539 --> 00:40:55,079
the market and it's it's quite readily

1056
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,820
available

1057
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:58,339
so this is a group we met with that had

1058
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:01,400
their own mushroom lab

1059
00:40:58,338 --> 00:41:04,259
everybody cultivates oyster mushroom

1060
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,940
because it's the easiest to grow

1061
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,740
this group

1062
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:11,039
was started from what's called a seed

1063
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:13,319
fund from the UN development program to

1064
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,179
start their own Enterprise they they do

1065
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,240
grow some mushrooms but mostly their

1066
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:19,440
tests with education

1067
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:22,019
and they work with a couple of groups

1068
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,338
throughout the country to uh that are

1069
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:25,579
more technically oriented but this group

1070
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:28,699
was very education oriented

1071
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:31,920
Kigali Farms is a

1072
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:33,319
probably our most helpful partner in in

1073
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,659
Rwanda

1074
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:39,900
they're trying to uh like it says bring

1075
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:43,078
affordable high impact crops to Rwanda

1076
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:45,539
um the I think is the CEO of Kigali

1077
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:47,880
Farms was a former CFO of omagang

1078
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:50,338
Brewery just down the road in

1079
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,440
Cooperstown so he asked me to bring him

1080
00:41:50,338 --> 00:41:54,480
a bottle of the Abbey Ale that we shared

1081
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:58,559
when we met up

1082
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:00,000
um but they're trying to uh provide this

1083
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:01,679
was really neat because they were trying

1084
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,960
to they're promoting mushroom

1085
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:05,460
cultivation in rural areas and then

1086
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,519
buying a mushroom and providing a

1087
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:10,440
Marketplace here they have solar dryers

1088
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:13,559
um to extend the shelf life of the

1089
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,358
mushrooms so they can impact and access

1090
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:17,159
more markets

1091
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,799
band producers was probably the biggest

1092
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:24,980
mushroom producer mushroom distributor

1093
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,980
they're a wholesaler in Rwanda

1094
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:30,599
they they had a retail outlet and

1095
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:33,239
probably the biggest Market in Kigali

1096
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:34,859
the capital city although we did hear

1097
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:36,000
rumors that they weren't actually paying

1098
00:42:34,858 --> 00:42:40,400
their Growers that they were just taking

1099
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,400
the mushrooms and writing an IOU

1100
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:45,780
um and near bhutari there's the rabona

1101
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:47,160
agriculture experiment station this is a

1102
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,540
partnership with the Chinese government

1103
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:51,358
and a demonstration of Chinese

1104
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:53,099
agriculture technology this is the media

1105
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:56,098
sterilizer they were using to sterilize

1106
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:57,900
their bags they used an elephant grass

1107
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:59,700
media is what they call it it's really

1108
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:04,260
tall you can see it in the background

1109
00:42:59,699 --> 00:43:07,578
here you know it grows 11 12 feet tall

1110
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:11,400
these are the spawn bags that they were

1111
00:43:07,579 --> 00:43:15,119
cultivating this is so this is a um

1112
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:17,940
uh subsidized you know these bags are

1113
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,880
way below the market price for other

1114
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:22,858
other you know Kigali Farms produces

1115
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,880
spawn bags and they sell them for 400

1116
00:43:22,858 --> 00:43:28,380
Rwandan francs for a bag

1117
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:31,200
the rabona experiment station sells them

1118
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:32,338
for 300 Rwandan francs per bag and they

1119
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,480
probably don't even you know they don't

1120
00:43:32,338 --> 00:43:35,460
have to sell them for that they could

1121
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,440
give them away and they do especially

1122
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:40,019
when it's a program targeted for Rural

1123
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,720
Enterprise development

1124
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:44,159
um after we visited all the Farms so if

1125
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,659
you see here one thing I learned in

1126
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:48,299
visiting these Farms was just sort of

1127
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:50,399
how they grow mushrooms in Rwanda

1128
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,200
um because

1129
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,900
mushrooms require a high moisture

1130
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:56,879
capacity high moisture content it's very

1131
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:59,700
difficult to control to create a

1132
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,579
controlled atmosphere and so they'll put

1133
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:04,439
the mushrooms bags into the soil and so

1134
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:05,460
they can regulate soil moisture much

1135
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,039
better than they can regulate

1136
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:10,139
atmospheric moisture

1137
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:13,159
and so I offered a training I spent

1138
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:16,980
about an hour talking what is a mushroom

1139
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:19,379
providing marketing advice and

1140
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:22,440
production technical production advice

1141
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:24,660
and then we built a pilot plot behind

1142
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,240
this community church so that women

1143
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:29,578
could see how to grow mushrooms we gave

1144
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:30,899
them maybe 50 bags to cultivate as a

1145
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:31,440
community

1146
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,838
um

1147
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,619
the training was targeted at a women's

1148
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:41,219
cooperative and Rwanda is a very sort of

1149
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:43,980
Cooperative country they

1150
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:45,059
the women are they're identified as as

1151
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,780
having

1152
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:48,539
um

1153
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:51,060
malnourished children they're invited to

1154
00:44:48,539 --> 00:44:53,599
attend a maternal and child feeding

1155
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:56,460
class it's a 10 week class and after

1156
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:59,280
completing the class they are invited to

1157
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:01,260
join the cooperative and when you become

1158
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,180
a Cooperative in Rwanda you're given a

1159
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,680
savings account and formally recognized

1160
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:07,799
by the Rwandan government you're giving

1161
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:09,598
like a certificate and so

1162
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,280
you know they have a savings account for

1163
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,079
which they could promote micro credit

1164
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,339
activities

1165
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:19,140
um and it was targeted by the the

1166
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:20,578
sustaining Rwanda Youth Organization for

1167
00:45:19,139 --> 00:45:22,799
a number of uh rural Enterprise

1168
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:26,220
activities

1169
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,539
um and so following the training we uh

1170
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:29,699
we bought some mushrooms and brought

1171
00:45:27,539 --> 00:45:32,219
them to this training and the women we

1172
00:45:29,699 --> 00:45:34,618
all cooked them together and then shared

1173
00:45:32,219 --> 00:45:37,019
lunch after following the training they

1174
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:38,660
make a really nice Curry mushroom curry

1175
00:45:37,019 --> 00:45:40,920
with peanut flour

1176
00:45:38,659 --> 00:45:43,259
onions and tomatoes

1177
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:46,920
some other rural Enterprise that we

1178
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:50,040
witnessed in in Rwanda this is a wooden

1179
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:52,200
cup it's intricately carved very nice

1180
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:54,480
this is all sorghum that's being malted

1181
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:57,239
they do a lot of home brewing and beer

1182
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,858
production in in the rural areas of

1183
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:01,739
Rwanda

1184
00:45:58,858 --> 00:46:03,960
um I didn't try any I don't know if I

1185
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:05,699
regret that or not

1186
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,440
um and so just sort of Reflections on

1187
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:10,019
the Rwanda experience

1188
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,240
um Market access in our specific project

1189
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:14,579
was limited by household consumption

1190
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:16,739
so I don't know if that's a bad thing or

1191
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:18,359
not it's sort of affects the

1192
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:21,000
sustainability of the project because

1193
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:22,679
they aren't able to generate income but

1194
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,858
they're also getting a nutritious food

1195
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:27,598
source in their household so you know it

1196
00:46:25,858 --> 00:46:28,920
goes goes back and forth

1197
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,960
um

1198
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,420
the sustaining Rwanda Youth Organization

1199
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,699
the director and some of their

1200
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:37,079
volunteers you know I was with a

1201
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:39,059
different volunteer every day which was

1202
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:41,460
nice but they weren't able to develop

1203
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:44,960
the technical capacity that they needed

1204
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:47,400
to encourage this Enterprise in Rwanda

1205
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:50,579
there were some serious issues with

1206
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:52,980
termites so I was able to suggest

1207
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:54,300
biocontrol options I don't know if they

1208
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,119
were able to get a hold of those buyer

1209
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:58,140
control options or not

1210
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:01,559
and so it's really difficult to

1211
00:46:58,139 --> 00:47:04,379
determine what impact my time in Rwanda

1212
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:07,500
made that the people in Rwanda it was a

1213
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:08,720
profound experience for me but I don't

1214
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,719
know

1215
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:15,919
what impact I had in the locality

1216
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:15,919
comparing the two Rwanda

1217
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:23,220
was a little bit easier to work I feel

1218
00:47:18,838 --> 00:47:23,219
like the you know there are some

1219
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:29,940
very serious ethnic issues in Rwanda but

1220
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:32,220
the government has made laws saying that

1221
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:36,420
you cannot differentiate between the

1222
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:39,838
ethnicities in public media and so

1223
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:42,000
you know the Rwanda experience in their

1224
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:43,739
history is tragic and I think they're

1225
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,880
really looking forward to look behind

1226
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:46,919
that

1227
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,480
um and really work together at being one

1228
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,039
Rwanda

1229
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,500
um

1230
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:54,179
so I don't I don't know but the legacy

1231
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:56,039
of mushroom consumption in Rwanda was

1232
00:47:54,179 --> 00:47:59,699
was very important dispute is a high

1233
00:47:56,039 --> 00:48:01,639
value product with a considerable demand

1234
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:04,078
looking to the future

1235
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:05,400
I think more work on monitoring and

1236
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:08,640
evaluating Mushroom Enterprise

1237
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,420
especially in Rwanda is important

1238
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:11,039
um

1239
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:13,400
there's a lot of information right now

1240
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:16,259
about biochar

1241
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:19,680
whether it works or not people have

1242
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:21,119
different views but in planting the

1243
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:24,480
mushrooms in the soil like we saw in

1244
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:26,338
Rwanda you really are increasing the

1245
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,619
soil organic matter and could

1246
00:48:26,338 --> 00:48:30,559
potentially pave the way for more

1247
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:33,780
perennial cropping systems

1248
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:35,239
such as tree fruits and agroforestry

1249
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:37,619
related systems

1250
00:48:35,239 --> 00:48:40,739
and then you know what is the role in

1251
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:43,440
the government other agencies I wrote

1252
00:48:40,739 --> 00:48:46,318
inhibiting up there because you know is

1253
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,318
in subsidizing their spawn bags is the

1254
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:50,219
Rwanda extension service are they

1255
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:52,079
inhibiting appropriate Market

1256
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:54,299
development

1257
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,339
and then how do you introduce Innovation

1258
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:58,500
to a rural community without having them

1259
00:48:56,338 --> 00:49:01,500
be dependent on your

1260
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:03,420
um on you giving input you know the

1261
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,920
women they after they ate all the

1262
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:07,019
mushrooms they said okay can we have

1263
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:09,358
some more spawn bags now they said well

1264
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:11,400
we don't have any money so I think the

1265
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:12,000
project sort of ended at that

1266
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,220
um

1267
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,780
you know how do you how do you introduce

1268
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:18,000
a new idea without

1269
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,800
the people becoming dependent on your

1270
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,719
inputs

1271
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,339
um so that's all I've got today thank

1272
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:24,358
you for coming out

1273
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:27,619
um

1274
00:49:24,358 --> 00:49:27,619
does anybody have any questions

1275
00:49:31,818 --> 00:49:36,358
in terms of

1276
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:39,119
sort of seemed like limited success of

1277
00:49:36,358 --> 00:49:41,039
mushroom cultivation in terms of their

1278
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,140
every Target holds

1279
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:45,259
um there's like a castle Enterprise kind

1280
00:49:43,139 --> 00:49:45,259
of

1281
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,858
100 but um do you think that there's

1282
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:51,300
opportunities

1283
00:49:49,858 --> 00:49:54,059
you know you started talking about maybe

1284
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:56,818
like in terms of remediation there for

1285
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:59,639
soil fertility or for the

1286
00:49:56,818 --> 00:50:01,980
pricing containing water or I mean is

1287
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:04,858
there is there any additional a better

1288
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:06,480
Niche for mushroom cultivation than

1289
00:50:04,858 --> 00:50:09,420
trying to sell people who don't want to

1290
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,480
buy it yeah

1291
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,480
um

1292
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,359
probably

1293
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:18,420
um

1294
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:20,420
you know I you look at

1295
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,420
um

1296
00:50:22,739 --> 00:50:25,858
in terms of Agriculture inputs you know

1297
00:50:24,539 --> 00:50:28,380
there's pretty heavy Transportation

1298
00:50:25,858 --> 00:50:29,519
costs that are associated with Organic

1299
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,539
inputs

1300
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:32,460
um

1301
00:50:30,539 --> 00:50:33,838
there's a lot of ammonium nitrate

1302
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,659
available

1303
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:38,759
in Bangladesh

1304
00:50:35,659 --> 00:50:41,399
and so as you know to sort of

1305
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,780
differentiate like the

1306
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,920
um

1307
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:48,200
you know agriculture mushrooms excuse me

1308
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,220
um

1309
00:50:48,199 --> 00:50:51,480
you know for agriculture inputs I think

1310
00:50:50,219 --> 00:50:53,639
it'd be difficult

1311
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,260
you know and then you know I don't know

1312
00:50:53,639 --> 00:50:57,659
how do you incorporate into sort of a

1313
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:59,220
market-based system to get it out to the

1314
00:50:57,659 --> 00:51:01,019
people

1315
00:50:59,219 --> 00:51:02,639
um I mean they're definitely

1316
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:04,079
could be opportunity I just don't know

1317
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:06,598
what it would be

1318
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,579
would it be better as a

1319
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:10,920
serving in need

1320
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:12,660
like let's say you know other

1321
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,400
development programs that introduce

1322
00:51:12,659 --> 00:51:16,500
different crops

1323
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:20,119
there's like a paired

1324
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:20,119
cooking kind of component

1325
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:31,559
with small scale

1326
00:51:28,739 --> 00:51:33,058
their development kind of programs

1327
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:35,359
do you think that that sort of approach

1328
00:51:33,059 --> 00:51:35,359
would work

1329
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:41,240
um

1330
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,619
right

1331
00:51:44,818 --> 00:51:49,440
um so

1332
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:52,140
vegetable consumption in in Bangladesh

1333
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,579
was not very common you know around the

1334
00:51:52,139 --> 00:51:55,980
time of their independence

1335
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:57,000
my understanding is that once

1336
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:59,579
um

1337
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
people started working going to Saudi

1338
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:04,619
Arabia and other countries to seek

1339
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,719
employment they said you know they

1340
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:09,240
started bringing back the tradition of

1341
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:09,838
vegetable consumption

1342
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:13,318
um

1343
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:16,380
and so you know in that way it's more of

1344
00:52:13,318 --> 00:52:20,219
the organic sort of ground up

1345
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:23,940
adoption of these habits I don't know if

1346
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:26,399
there would be a

1347
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:29,280
um education program that could

1348
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,380
combat the Obstacle of perceptions of

1349
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,700
mushrooms and Bangladesh

1350
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:34,700
is that what you were asking

1351
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:44,179
anybody else were they doing anything

1352
00:52:41,219 --> 00:52:44,179
with uh

1353
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:53,639
yeah Bangladesh is a very densely

1354
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:56,460
populated country and so space is a

1355
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:58,259
as a constraint so that's why we were

1356
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:01,318
only seeing substrate

1357
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:04,380
cultivation plus you know a lot of the

1358
00:53:01,318 --> 00:53:07,679
yeah a lot of the wood is used for fuel

1359
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:09,059
for cooking fires and so there's not

1360
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:12,019
really that abundance of forest

1361
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:12,019
resources that we see here

1362
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:23,399
I mean in Bangladesh everything's got a

1363
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,400
use

1364
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:28,380
it seems like and so

1365
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,240
you know to be able to

1366
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:33,619
identify as substrate an appropriate

1367
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:33,618
substrate I think it's difficult

1368
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:43,079
with her

1369
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:45,179
okay thank you very much so nice

1370
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:47,460
communication

1371
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:49,558
you know the Bangladesh government is

1372
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:50,599
going to be surprised to the mushroom

1373
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:53,780
calculation

1374
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:53,780
excuse me

1375
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:14,960
and the substation okay also

1376
00:54:10,219 --> 00:54:14,959
the narica Bagan is in Penny yeah

1377
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:20,818
wall Center in the

1378
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:23,519
in the shower why you are not

1379
00:54:20,818 --> 00:54:25,519
oh I did go to

1380
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:25,519
um

1381
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:37,338
like cold storage

1382
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:55,680
well so the I mean that was one of the

1383
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:57,300
to answer your second question first

1384
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:59,879
um you know

1385
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:02,460
farmers were selling their mushrooms

1386
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,599
within in their Village

1387
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:06,358
um you know there were significant

1388
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:07,740
obstacles of transportation and when you

1389
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:11,519
know in these sort of village units

1390
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:13,500
they're able to educate the their the

1391
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:14,880
other villagers about the benefits of

1392
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,659
mushroom

1393
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,579
um

1394
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:20,578
and so I think in that way they're able

1395
00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:23,519
to develop these Market mechanisms they

1396
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:25,260
they still were not sufficient to you

1397
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:26,759
know that I talked to more former

1398
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:28,619
mushroom Farmers than current mushroom

1399
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:31,980
Farmers so you know something

1400
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:34,440
something's not working in that end and

1401
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:37,500
then we did visit Savar I spent a day in

1402
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:39,420
Savar talking with the national director

1403
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:41,280
of the program

1404
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:46,579
