1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,719
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:13,359
University thanks it's a great pleasure

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,118
to be here can you hear me okay yeah

4
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:18,039
good okay so yeah I'm really fascinated

5
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:20,518
by

6
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:22,560
size size is really important and it's

7
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:24,839
deeply fascinating question size is

8
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:27,358
fundamental to everything and it's

9
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:30,359
really important for yield but size is

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,960
not trivially important to yield you

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,480
might think we want things to be bigger

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,640
but we only want the right part of the

13
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,959
plant to be bigger we want the brain for

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,558
instance or the part of the plant we're

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,878
going to eat to be bigger but we want

16
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:44,119
the rest of the plant often to be

17
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:47,079
smaller to fit into a more plants into

18
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:48,919
the same field or the same growing space

19
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,320
and so if you think back to the Green

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,120
Revolution one of the key things was

21
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,119
making smaller plants with bigger grains

22
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:59,119
and here you can see prepr Evolution

23
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:02,078
wheat is larger plants smaller grains

24
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:05,359
postre evolution you got smaller pants

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,118
plants bigger grains so we need to

26
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,239
understand size breeders are very good

27
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,719
at achieving this but I think that if we

28
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,759
actually understand how size and shape

29
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:15,359
are controlled we can do even better and

30
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:18,438
size is one of the things we really

31
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,719
still don't understand that's so

32
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:23,478
basic so my lab studies this in

33
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,879
arabidopsis we like the arabidopsis seil

34
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:29,640
and the leaves for studying this um so

35
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:31,399
our sees are green um outermost floral

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,599
organ they enclose and protect the

37
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,920
flower bud so they're really defensive

38
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,879
organs and one of the reasons sees are

39
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,759
cool is that they have this amazing

40
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,519
pattern of different cell sizes in them

41
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:44,799
in a rops so they've got these giant

42
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:47,798
cells false colored here in red

43
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,280
interpers between smaller cells another

44
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:50,680
reason we chose seil is just that

45
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,439
they're on the outside of the flower so

46
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,479
they're really accessible for Imaging

47
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:55,478
and

48
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:57,560
manipulation another reason is that

49
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:59,920
there's four seil in each arabidopsis

50
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,478
flower so we can look at their size with

51
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,719
in a flower and say are all the seils

52
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:05,399
the same size or not and that's actually

53
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:07,038
important for their function the seils

54
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,080
need to be the same size to keep that

55
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,159
flower Bud close and keep all the uh

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,000
environment insects everything out while

57
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,199
the reproductive organs are

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,919
developing so seil are a great model

59
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,719
system we've now gone on to leaves which

60
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,238
are totally not a great model system but

61
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,639
a lot of people care about leaves and

62
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,878
guess what seil are like little leaves

63
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:27,518
so that makes me

64
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:30,479
happy okay so what we love to do in the

65
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,599
lab is actually image the plants as

66
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,639
they're growing and try to understand

67
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:37,000
how the growth and division of the cells

68
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:39,279
is giving rise to the size and shape of

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,519
the organ and so here we've got living

70
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,598
plants um and this this is one I did

71
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,959
back in the day taped onto a slide and I

72
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:50,199
image it every six hours and watch those

73
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,158
sequels grow so this is a flower bud you

74
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:54,359
can see here's one sequel here's one SQL

75
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:56,679
here's one Sequel and what you're seeing

76
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,519
is the fluorescent uh plasma membrane

77
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,480
marker outlining the cells and

78
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:01,840
fluorescent nuclear marker

79
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,238
you can see there's all kinds of

80
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,400
complexity going on here these cells are

81
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,519
not doing Simple Things uh some cells

82
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,599
are getting really big nuclei and

83
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,360
growing a lot other cells are dividing

84
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:16,039
and making a ton of smaller cells and

85
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,040
all of this is coming together to

86
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:19,878
coordinate so the seals are growing at

87
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:22,120
basically the same right despite the

88
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:24,318
cells doing all kinds of

89
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,039
things now I'm going to continue the

90
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:29,280
theme of image

91
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,959
analysis and say that we love to

92
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,799
understand this computationally through

93
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,959
computational image analysis this is

94
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,000
done in collaboration uh with Richard

95
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,438
Smith La with their amazing

96
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
morphographic software and I'll play

97
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:43,000
that again

98
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:50,199
hopefully so we've colored each

99
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:53,640
cell and all of its daughter

100
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:54,798
cells with the same color it doesn't

101
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,958
want to

102
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,920
play and so you can see that okay there

103
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,039
it jumped um one green cell gave rise to

104
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:04,878
this whole patch of green cells and one

105
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,759
red cell gave rise to this whole giant

106
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,560
red cell and so that's how giant cells

107
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:10,598
are forming they're growing and not

108
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,239
dividing the whole time whereas other

109
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:14,560
cells are

110
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,280
dividing so we can measure the growth

111
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,759
rates we can measure the growth

112
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:21,279
directions we can measure all kinds of

113
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,960
things from these images and that's and

114
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,319
also gene expression patterns so so

115
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,439
we're trying to put all of this together

116
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,719
to understand how this organ is

117
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,519
growing now we do a lot of molecular

118
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,639
genetic work that I can't possibly show

119
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,120
you in this eight minutes and come up

120
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,319
with Gene regulatory networks and I

121
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,720
don't expect you to understand anything

122
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,599
about this except that there's genes

123
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,240
interacting with each other giving rise

124
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,520
to something on that

125
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,439
something uh we like to model and we so

126
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,918
we collaborate this is with P fosa

127
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:52,478
Jordan and his post. Nicholas Russell to

128
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:54,399
model the growth and division of these

129
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,240
cells with their decision- making

130
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,679
process based on this Gene regulatory

131
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,519
Network about whether they divide or

132
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,639
grow and you can see we've got proteins

133
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:05,079
fluctuating up and down and what's

134
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,038
coming out of this model is a pattern of

135
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:10,198
different cell sizes bit like a seel

136
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:12,120
where we've got giant cells see here in

137
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,439
purple interspersed between smaller

138
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,918
cells in brown so you can see it's a

139
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,560
model give it credit it's not quite like

140
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:20,639
a seil but we're still getting that

141
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,959
pattern out of our Gene regulatory

142
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,160
Network one of the reasons I really love

143
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,120
modeling is not when it works like this

144
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,400
does but when it doesn't work when it

145
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,160
doesn't work it tells us what we're

146
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,758
missing we're like oh wait we hadn't

147
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,080
thought about this part or we don't have

148
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,560
it quite right yet those never get

149
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,639
published but they're the most important

150
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,240
models

151
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:42,600
actually so my lab is really focused

152
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,038
around two major questions three two

153
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,240
major questions one is how cells of

154
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:47,680
different sizes created during

155
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,400
development and we're really looking at

156
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,439
this how do you form giant cells in the

157
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:53,758
sea and the leaf both have giant cells

158
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:55,879
and we found this really interesting

159
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,160
role for stochasticity or Randomness in

160
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:59,639
this process we think about development

161
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,479
as being deterministic every

162
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,160
everything's programmed in but actually

163
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:05,079
the plant in this Cas is using

164
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,800
Randomness to generate this pattern so

165
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:09,159
that's exciting to us the second

166
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,639
question sort of the flip side of this

167
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,319
you've got all the cellular variability

168
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,598
how are organs made with reproducible

169
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:18,720
size and shape Des spite variability in

170
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:21,038
the cell growth the cell size cell

171
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,319
division gene expression all of these

172
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:25,399
things and so if you look at across

173
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:27,598
these rabitos flowers you can see they

174
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:30,679
all have four seal all the four seals in

175
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:32,879
each flower are the same size

176
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,439
and they're the same across flowers so

177
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,199
how does the plant do this how does it

178
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:40,279
make this reproducible structure from

179
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,080
this mess um and then we want to apply

180
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:47,598
this to engineering living

181
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:49,000
materials so we have um recently got a

182
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:50,918
grant from the National Science

183
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,160
Foundation in a big collaborative

184
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:55,560
biology integration Institute 12.5

185
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,960
million over six years with a huge

186
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,519
collaboration of people led by Pam suus

187
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,279
at University of Florida to study poly

188
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,159
because our giant cells are polyploid

189
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,918
they have more than one copy of the DNA

190
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,879
so we want to look across organisms and

191
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,439
understand what does having more copies

192
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:14,720
of the DNA do to the cells how does it

193
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:16,120
make them bigger what other properties

194
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,080
does it

195
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,120
have and then we also are very

196
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,159
interested in applying this to

197
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,959
engineering living materials our

198
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,280
materials are not sustainable and we'd

199
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:31,000
like to actually use the properties of

200
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:34,038
living organisms specifically bacteria

201
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,879
fungi and plants uh they have amazing

202
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:37,680
properties and can we incorporate them

203
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,400
into our materials into our buildings

204
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,680
into our even our Chairs into our

205
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:44,519
clothing to make them better and think

206
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,959
about what all of these organisms are

207
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:49,478
good at they use non-petroleum based

208
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:52,439
energy sources they can sense they can

209
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:54,000
adapt they can repair uh think about our

210
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:56,279
roads what do we hate about our roads

211
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,399
all these potholes roads cannot

212
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:00,399
self-repair but what if we incorporated

213
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,878
living materials into to them so that

214
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,120
they can self-repair how awesome would

215
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:05,360
that be okay that's a dream at this

216
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,680
point but it's a dream we've been

217
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,080
talking about uh Lori hberman is part of

218
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,199
this engineered living materials

219
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:12,079
Institute as

220
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,919
well and so there's a bunch of

221
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,598
challenges and speaking to the plant

222
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:19,120
path group I think one of the big

223
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,639
challenges is how do we incorporate

224
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,038
different organisms interacting with

225
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,918
each other because we know we're going

226
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:25,959
to have to have many ecosystems to do

227
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,478
this the challenge that uh most

228
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:30,000
fascinates me is how do we engineer this

229
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:31,598
shape and structure

230
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,918
and mechanical properties and growth of

231
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,918
these

232
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:38,199
organisms and we're starting this with a

233
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,478
buch of datom because they have silic

234
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,080
based frustules and they're

235
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,120
self-organized nanomaterials so look how

236
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,879
cool these little structures are how

237
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,799
they can make them at room temperature

238
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:50,879
this is worked by my postop Trevor cross

239
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,879
and that's it I'd like to thank my lab

240
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,399
for all of this inspirational work we

241
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,799
could not do this without amazing

242
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,799
collaborators both at Cornell and Beyond

243
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:02,319
and thank the ni and NSF for lots of

244
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:04,958
funding so happy to take

245
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,240
any thanks Adrian any

246
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,518
questions uh you showed some models and

247
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,278
I wonder how many parameters do the

248
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,720
models that you play with

249
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:16,720
have how many parameters models we play

250
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,079
with have um we try to keep the

251
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,200
parameter number as low as possible

252
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:22,319
because you know you can get anything to

253
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,560
happen in a model if you add enough

254
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,040
parameters so we're really trying to

255
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:28,239
limit it down to things where we have

256
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:31,000
some kind of biological basis that said

257
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,278
um there is some level of parameters you

258
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
have to have and most of the time we

259
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:37,000
have no biological information for those

260
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,440
parameters so we do a lot of parameter

261
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,559
optimization and look at in what regime

262
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,880
do we get the behavior we expect what

263
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:45,559
regime do we get other things and so

264
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:46,399
there's there's a lot to be done there

265
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:48,838
but yeah we're trying to keep the

266
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,839
parameter number

267
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
low

268
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:59,559
adamant giant is a consequence of

269
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:01,278
pooing our giant cell pooid

270
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:03,239
consquence

271
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:07,360
of that is a question I've been

272
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,560
wondering about for years and I um they

273
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,519
go hand in hand and we so far cannot

274
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:13,759
separate those two things and I think U

275
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:15,759
that's one of the things I would love to

276
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,838
do is separate we need something that

277
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,240
actually separates Floy from size and we

278
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,600
don't have it which tells you what a

279
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,120
universal principle that is so the

280
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,440
question is what's cause and effect and

281
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:31,320
it's totally unclear at this point

282
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,320
follow here so anything we learn

283
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,680
feature

284
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:42,360
from tests that create giant

285
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:45,039
cells in root yeah so those giant cells

286
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,959
are unrelated to these giant cells we

287
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,439
actually sent the molecular marker for

288
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,000
these giant cells to a group that was

289
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,720
working on that and yeah it didn't show

290
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,320
up so that was disappointing slightly

291
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,560
one of the things I should say

292
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,240
about these giant cells is that they are

293
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,119
little bios synthetic factories for a

294
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,720
lot of defensive compounds and our

295
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,000
plants that overexpress giant cells are

296
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,879
actually more resistant things like

297
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,759
powdery mildew and our plants without

298
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:12,240
giant cells are Little Farms of powdery

299
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:14,399
mildew um so there is some defense

300
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,799
response going on here that's really

301
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:21,360
interesting so thank

302
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:22,879
you hi everyone um my name is Holly tuon

303
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,560
I'm an associate professor in plant

304
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,958
breeding and genetics and just like

305
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,919
Justine even though she didn't mention

306
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,958
it I started with lightening with an E

307
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:32,519
so okay I'll just use lights in my title

308
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,439
slides so I'm going to give you a

309
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,799
lightning talk about our work and it's a

310
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,320
bit strange to be here because I

311
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:40,000
actually did my PhD in molecular plant

312
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,160
pathogen interactions and what I do now

313
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,759
is very different so in a parallel

314
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:47,480
universe this would be my department so

315
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,720
it's nice to be home so I'm going to

316
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,839
start with a premise this is very busy

317
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,600
but I'm going to give you the bottom

318
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,720
line and that is our aggra food systems

319
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,560
are driven by structural gender

320
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:02,079
inequality what that means is from value

321
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:04,278
chains reducing Distributing to the food

322
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:06,519
environment to Consumer Behavior are all

323
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:08,240
shaped by societal structural

324
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,679
inequalities okay this is pretty well

325
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,959
established at this point what we also

326
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:15,239
know is how women specifically engage in

327
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:17,919
these Agri Food Systems globally is

328
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,120
shaped by their agency social norms

329
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:22,519
their access and control over resources

330
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,679
and so on and so forth right so this

331
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:26,679
schematically tells you there's a

332
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:29,439
problem right there's a Global Gender

333
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:32,359
inequality Advocate systems which then

334
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,000
shapes outcomes from how people engage

335
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,879
in those Advocate

336
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,600
systems okay bear with me I'm giving

337
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:39,679
more intro slides because it's going to

338
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
be a little bit different from what

339
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,919
you've

340
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,920
watched so the most recent thinking in

341
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,838
the space says then if there is a

342
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:49,679
problem how do we Rectify it how do we

343
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,320
change it how do we what are the levers

344
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:54,759
of change towards more Equitable Agra

345
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,959
Food Systems tells us that we can look

346
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:59,919
at individuals engaging in Agri Food

347
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,799
Systems households community and so on

348
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:04,679
and so forth right there's different

349
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:07,078
layers where you can affect change to

350
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:10,399
really rectify the inequalities and

351
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:14,078
these look at institutional inequalities

352
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:16,519
power relationships agencies and social

353
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:19,078
institutions okay so we're going to come

354
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:22,278
back to this it's like a crash course in

355
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:22,278
gender inequality and Food

356
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,959
Systems within that system of Agra Food

357
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,560
Systems Innovations agricultural

358
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:33,518
Innovations are sub component right we

359
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:36,078
innovate we create new varieties we do

360
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:39,480
mechanization so that we make Farmers

361
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:40,838
lives easier right but what we know now

362
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,120
is again the latest thinking is

363
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:44,920
Innovations don't exist in a vacuum you

364
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,039
don't just develop a tractor and air

365
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:48,679
drop it right there has to be more give

366
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:51,240
and take with the communities who are

367
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:53,879
going to adopt it so the latest thinking

368
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,839
is around context dependent soci

369
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:58,480
technical Innovation bundle say that

370
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,800
three times very quickly what that

371
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,519
basically means means is as you're

372
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:04,078
innovating for an agricultural

373
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,799
technology you must know where that

374
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:09,198
technology will take place right where

375
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,838
will it how in people's lives will it

376
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,000
enter how will they use it how will they

377
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:14,199
interact with so you really need that

378
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,519
context

379
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:20,559
dependency and that's where we

380
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:21,839
are so by we I mean the equal lab we

381
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,078
call ourselves the Equitable

382
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,639
agricultural research lab we just set up

383
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:28,399
last year and really we take an

384
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,519
agricultural Innovation which is CR

385
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,078
Improvement that end to end from a

386
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:35,720
design of a plant variety all the way to

387
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:37,359
the release and Seed systems and we say

388
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,278
how can we really look at gender

389
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,879
equality and social inclusion in that

390
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:45,078
whole process okay now because these are

391
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:47,078
complex problems we can't just do it

392
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:49,039
unilaterally we need a group of people

393
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:51,039
from very different backgrounds so our

394
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,719
lab is kind of a hodge podge of

395
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:53,919
different disciplines and we all kind of

396
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,079
spend half our time trying to

397
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:57,919
communicate with each other but that's

398
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:59,599
the only way we can solve these complex

399
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,039
problems right so we have people who are

400
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,240
have plant reading backgrounds

401
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,559
economists anthropologists and we all

402
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,240
come together and I'll give you examples

403
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:09,198
of what that looks like we're not teed

404
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,959
to a geography we engage in a lot of

405
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:13,278
different projects so the sites of the

406
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,039
research tend to be very different as

407
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:17,078
well as crops we work on because it's

408
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,480
agnostic to a degree these inequalities

409
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:22,078
are pervasive right they're not in one

410
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,199
context but what brings us together is

411
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,078
how we research right using feminist

412
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:28,078
research networks uh Frameworks and

413
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:29,919
approaches and a lot of transer

414
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:32,559
interdisciplinary methods there's not

415
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,240
one solution to these problems and we do

416
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,239
a lot of collaborative research none of

417
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,079
this happens on our own we're constantly

418
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,079
communicating working with programs

419
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:46,519
globally so to sit this on some sort of

420
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:50,560
organizational principle Like You Justin

421
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:52,519
it's not a mess it's just range so the

422
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,278
way I look at it is we do work on data

423
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:57,078
generation which basically means we want

424
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:58,480
to understand what people in different

425
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:00,879
parts of the world and different social

426
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,480
heterogen 0 look for in prop varieties

427
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,439
right that's what I call data collection

428
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,800
traits varal preferences how do we

429
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,600
collect that we also do methodological

430
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,479
work that says how do you collect data

431
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,399
in a way that's more inclusive I'll talk

432
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,360
about that a little bit we try to

433
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,000
synthesize that up so we're giving the

434
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,440
right messages to the plant breeding

435
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,480
programs to say you should care about

436
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,160
this or that and then we do more

437
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:25,159
analysis of the research itself that's

438
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:28,399
the more fun part in my personal

439
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:30,000
opinion I don't have fancy videos so I'm

440
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,839
feeling a little disadvantage but I'll

441
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
show you some examples of our research

442
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:35,880
this may be very new and you're probably

443
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,600
thinking okay what does this look like

444
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:40,679
what what kind of research does this

445
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,319
culminate too so I'll give examples of

446
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:45,958
each on the left both of these graphs

447
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:47,759
are on casava in Nigeria so we do a lot

448
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,958
of work with breeding programs there and

449
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,120
the question the Breeders often ask is

450
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:54,039
who wants what what traits matter to

451
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,839
whom and why what varieties matter to

452
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:58,599
whom and why it seems easy very

453
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:01,839
difficult right so in years and years of

454
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,798
day have accumulated on what Farmers

455
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,038
want from traits but what we also know

456
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:09,038
is that farmers are not homogeneous

457
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:10,558
groups right they're very different

458
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:13,279
where they are what kind of households

459
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:15,359
they're living in matters so on this

460
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:18,000
rather busy plot on the left we're

461
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,639
trying to pull apart trait preferences

462
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,759
for these traits on the bottom through a

463
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,799
heat map here that we're showing it if

464
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,838
you're a woman or a man living in a poor

465
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:27,879
non-p poor household food secure

466
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,480
insecure four different regions you may

467
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,559
get different patterns of trait

468
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,240
preferences right readers don't like to

469
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:37,359
see this but we like to tell them it

470
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,960
matters context matters social heterogen

471
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,279
matters and this is for tray preferences

472
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,720
what you see here is What's called the

473
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,879
placket loose tree and all this is

474
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,038
telling you is these are varieties in

475
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,600
rank order depending on if the farmer is

476
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:51,400
a man or a woman and if they're

477
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,558
interacting with a man or a woman to

478
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,559
process you get different Bridal

479
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:57,720
preferences what does that mean we don't

480
00:17:55,558 --> 00:18:00,079
know but what we know is it happens

481
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,960
because again people don't live in

482
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,279
bubbles right they interact with each

483
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,919
other and they may have different

484
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:08,000
preferences because of those social

485
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,880
interactions so the bottom line is we're

486
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
trying to move away from like these

487
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,120
homogeneous trait buckets and really try

488
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,960
to understand social heterogeneity right

489
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:16,959
at the individual

490
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:21,839
level moving a little bit up one thing

491
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:23,879
that I've become really interested in is

492
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,480
methods so what this means so imagine

493
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,600
you're going to a household you want to

494
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,079
ask people what kind of cassaba do you

495
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,599
like how do you do that right that

496
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,038
itself is a big question often it's

497
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:34,959
surveys but then you have to ask

498
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:37,200
yourself who's responding to the survey

499
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,679
there's a lot of power in politics and

500
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,519
who takes that survey so on the left

501
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,880
here you see a colel density plot where

502
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,918
we're asking husbands and wives from the

503
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,840
same household the same question what

504
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:51,280
how many cassava varieties do you grow

505
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:53,558
that are improved and then we go to the

506
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:56,918
field and we take the leash samples and

507
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:59,798
we compare them right what you see is

508
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:01,280
nobody's consistent right the husband's

509
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:02,599
responses and the wife's responses

510
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:05,440
differ from each other and they both

511
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:06,558
differ from the actual wi tissue now

512
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,759
here I don't want to say anyone's right

513
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,440
or wrong because when we go and do this

514
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:12,960
and we ask people at the plot level you

515
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,360
get a different picture my point here is

516
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,919
who you ask and how matters hugely for

517
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:20,839
adoption rates our assumptions around a

518
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:23,000
variety is adopted or not may be based

519
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:26,439
on wrong assumptions who you ask matters

520
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,119
hug right this is work in sagol and

521
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,600
kelpy where we had five different TRS

522
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,558
and we ask again husbands and wives for

523
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,480
their relative preferences up here

524
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:37,798
classic we separate men and women look

525
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,960
at the relative importance the I more

526
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:42,480
important but then what we did was we

527
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,919
took the same couples and we classified

528
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,319
them by agreement and disagreement on

529
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:49,038
who makes decisions in the household

530
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:51,519
right so then we're saying are there

531
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:53,359
some households that are more kind of

532
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:54,960
together and are there more households

533
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,839
where there's more disagreement does

534
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,240
that matter for the choices they're make

535
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:00,879
it readers don't like us when they see

536
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,159
this because it does matter right but

537
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,919
again we're trying to tease apart to say

538
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:07,200
how can we ask these questions so you

539
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:10,038
get good information oh I ran out of

540
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,038
time okay this is a scoping review we

541
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:14,279
did last year just to tell you looked

542
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:16,440
across all tra preference papers

543
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,960
globally for all crops and we ask the

544
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,038
question how are people collecting

545
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,200
information and what you see is it's

546
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:24,798
often direct questions so when someone

547
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,080
gets asked what do you like or not and

548
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:29,158
often we don't have data from women

549
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:30,839
that's the gender bias in the tot it of

550
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:34,360
the data is significant so we don't

551
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:34,359
actually have data on women's trade

552
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,519
preferences J is staring at me so I'm

553
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,200
going to wrap up here this is the

554
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:42,038
highest level work that I think is

555
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,960
really exciting where we turn the lens

556
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:46,319
back on the researchers themselves a

557
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,440
little bit and we say we are social

558
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:52,158
beings engaging in research we're not

559
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,480
robots right we have characters we have

560
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,520
histories we have social identities how

561
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,720
does that shape how we're actually doing

562
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:59,879
research there's a lot of theory out

563
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,839
there that shows that's true in other

564
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,240
fields so we have two sets of work

565
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,399
coming here looking at care

566
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,919
responsibilities of Faculty how do

567
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,360
faculty balance care responsibilities

568
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,679
and their social identities how does

569
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,319
that play out and the second one is

570
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,960
management leadership what does it mean

571
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:18,439
to be a woman in an international

572
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,079
agricultural research ecosystem and for

573
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,080
their management abilities and

574
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:25,720
perceptions so this is a much higher

575
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:27,359
level thing so I want to thank my lab

576
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,120
there's too many names to name here and

577
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,079
I try to put them on this spectrum of

578
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:31,719
work that we do um and thank you for

579
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:35,079
your

580
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,079
attention uh any

581
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:50,759
questions starting point in terms of

582
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:50,759
like what are

583
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:56,798
or interesting

584
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:58,798
um that would be good to look at we

585
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:02,038
don't often look at soil nutrient stat

586
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,879
and this is I think where disciplinary

587
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:06,119
practice comes in often these questions

588
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,760
are asked by economists if you look at

589
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:09,399
globally how the data is collect us

590
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,558
economists do these surveys a lot and

591
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,880
often it's just I ask you the question I

592
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:16,798
have a box and I ticket and I walk away

593
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,278
what we do control for is you're running

594
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:19,798
kind of like a regression you look to

595
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:21,119
see if there's any covariants that are

596
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:23,079
actually explaining some of that

597
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:24,639
variability so we do check if there's

598
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:26,240
things that are bigger than the actual

599
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,200
trade preference itself if that makes

600
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,519
sense so yes we do check that as much as

601
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,519
we can

602
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:34,798
I have a quick question so you're

603
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,480
generating data for trck preference as a

604
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:39,158
snapshot right contemporary do you have

605
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,640
any way of generating data on a

606
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:44,480
trajectory historically and forward for

607
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,320
the scoping review we tried to do that

608
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,720
for 50 years all crops to see what are

609
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:51,038
the trends and trade preferences the

610
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,240
biggest problem is

611
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:55,359
ontologies every study will Define a

612
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,919
trait in a different way and so

613
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,479
extracting that and relating them to one

614
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,159
another is hugely difficult because

615
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:05,120
there's no standard for social research

616
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:06,400
on traits you say yield I say Lo size

617
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,119
someone has to decide those are

618
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,720
equivalent to look at the totality of

619
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:12,798
the data set is something we're working

620
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,600
on right now to be able to synthesize

621
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:19,558
it hey everybody uh it's great to be

622
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:23,480
here I am happy to tell you a little bit

623
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:28,678
about my research and what I do today I

624
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:31,720
wanted to start off with a first slide

625
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:34,759
let's see let's get there here we are um

626
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:37,640
this is a photo taken outside uh just

627
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:41,879
yesterday um in this

628
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:45,799
uh photo you can see the Tower Road

629
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:48,760
lined with trees and and I spend a lot

630
00:23:45,798 --> 00:23:51,440
of time thinking about how we interact

631
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:53,839
with plants in this kind of day-to-day

632
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,519
level outside of these agricultural

633
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:59,879
systems and in particular I focus on the

634
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:02,720
health relevant interactions that we

635
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:07,120
have with these plants uh this can

636
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:09,120
include everything from the uh the

637
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:11,359
services that these trees provide in

638
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:15,439
terms of cooling on a hot day through

639
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:18,158
both uh uh shading and transpiration

640
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,519
through to the removal of air pollution

641
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,640
such as particulate matter from the air

642
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:26,599
there's also a lot of work that shows uh

643
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:30,000
really extensive mental health benefits

644
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:31,839
uh through exposure to Green spaces uh

645
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,679
and all sorts of other ecosystem

646
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:37,199
services that are also Health relevant

647
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:39,679
at the same time we have all of these

648
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,720
negative interactions with plants

649
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:45,360
everything from the release of

650
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:48,679
allergenic pollen to the release of

651
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:53,359
volatile organic compounds like isoprene

652
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:53,360
which is a precursor to Ozone

653
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:58,839
formation even in the most urban areas

654
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:00,839
we still have

655
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:03,439
uh Landscapes that are filled with

656
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:08,359
plants for example New York City is

657
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,360
currently 22% of it is

658
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:15,439
forested about a year ago now there's

659
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,480
was some local legislation pass to try

660
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,519
and uh increased New York City's canopy

661
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,360
coverage of trees up to

662
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:26,720
30% um and one of the the major

663
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:29,678
justifications for this was people said

664
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,759
hey trees really improve public health

665
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:36,759
so let's have more of

666
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:38,640
that this is not just isolated toic City

667
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:40,440
and we're living at a time when cities

668
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,159
across the United States and the rest of

669
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:47,120
the world too are also channeling

670
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:48,640
resources into planting trees uh and a

671
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:50,719
little bit less into maintaining the

672
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,799
trees that they already have uh much to

673
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,200
the srin of urban Foresters and other

674
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:58,038
Urban free professionals U but it is uh

675
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,600
right now there's about2 billion do

676
00:25:58,038 --> 00:26:05,038
being put into uh urban forestry in the

677
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:08,278
US through the inflation reduction

678
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:11,839
act however even though one of the major

679
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:14,000
motivations for this is improving Public

680
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:16,319
Health through making there be more

681
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,880
trees we don't really have a good

682
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:23,200
understanding of how uh many of these

683
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:25,840
trees how the individual trees interact

684
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,640
with individual people and so we have uh

685
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:30,720
a lot of these large scale patterns like

686
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,000
hey if a neighborhood has a lot more

687
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,038
green space in it it tends to be cooler

688
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,119
but when you get down to the level of

689
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:41,839
how is this individual tree transpiring

690
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:44,759
how is it providing shade uh we just we

691
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:46,678
don't have very good information at that

692
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:49,079
granular scale which is a problem

693
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:51,840
because those are the scales at which we

694
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:53,480
make decisions uh we don't uh tend to

695
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:55,079
say like oh we're going to change this

696
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,399
neighborhood we say no we're going to

697
00:26:55,079 --> 00:27:00,759
plant a tree right here and then we make

698
00:26:57,398 --> 00:27:05,599
decisions about where that tree is what

699
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:07,558
type of tree it is and so on and so my

700
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:10,480
goal and the work that's being done in

701
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:13,440
my lab focuses on quantifying these

702
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,278
interactions with plants in order to

703
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:19,640
improve the decisions that we make uh

704
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:22,880
often around uh Tree Management and so

705
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:26,440
on but also around uh our behaviors as

706
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:29,200
people too in order to improve uh the

707
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:31,679
health of uh people as individ uals and

708
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,679
as a broader group as well so I'm just

709
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:38,278
going to walk you through uh what this

710
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:40,840
looks like um I although you'll have to

711
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:42,919
excuse me because um this is a little

712
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:45,959
bit of a listicle right now sorry

713
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:49,278
everybody so focus on me not the boring

714
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:52,480
text um so one of the the major projects

715
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:54,519
that I have right now is looking at

716
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,960
allergenic pollen concentrations and

717
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:59,399
I'll tell you a little bit more about

718
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:03,519
that in a moment another major project

719
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:06,199
uh that uh I'm working on is trying to

720
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:08,839
uh understand the cooling effects of uh

721
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:13,399
trees in New York City on an individual

722
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:17,839
uh tree scale uh in order to understand

723
00:28:13,398 --> 00:28:20,319
uh what heat exposure is like uh what

724
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,759
the health consequences are in other

725
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:24,480
words um how does that affect the number

726
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:26,960
of people who are going to the emergency

727
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:32,240
department during heat waves and

728
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:35,519
ultimately to to be able to um inform

729
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,798
decisions as like as we're making all of

730
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:41,000
these doing all of these Urban Greening

731
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:43,720
campaigns like when you plant a tree uh

732
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,200
it lasts for a long time and and so we

733
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,079
really should be figuring this out now

734
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,558
because the consequences of today's

735
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:55,158
decisions are going to last with us for

736
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:58,319
decades as part of this uh project um

737
00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:02,039
I'm doing a lot of work with a post in

738
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:05,798
my lab uh Dave Miller trying to

739
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:08,119
um use remote sensing to identify

740
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:11,319
individual trees and because you can't

741
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:14,599
do a good uh a job of managing what you

742
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:18,519
don't know and so uh we're using some

743
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:22,319
new approaches uh uh incorporating the

744
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:25,319
the timing of uh various um life history

745
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:27,480
events for trees uh things like when is

746
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:30,319
it leaing out what color does it look

747
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,880
like in the to to try and untangle this

748
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:35,439
a little bit better so really using the

749
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,640
ecology to inform some of the remote

750
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,720
sensing

751
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,960
analyses now some of the other projects

752
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:46,200
that are happening in the lab now um uh

753
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,319
and touch a little bit on some of the

754
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,798
the associations between things like

755
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:53,960
neighborhood income or uh race and

756
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:57,038
ethnicity and uh how that is associated

757
00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:00,278
with what trees are where uh and there

758
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:02,839
end up being uh it seems large Health

759
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:04,960
consequences for some of these things as

760
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:08,319
different types of trees provide

761
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,679
different Services uh so those are a few

762
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:11,119
of the projects that are happening in

763
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,919
the lab right now and for the last

764
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:15,199
little bit I just want to walk you

765
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:18,120
through uh an example of what one of

766
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:21,080
these projects looks like and so come

767
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:24,479
with me to Texas now uh and take a look

768
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:28,278
at Ash Juniper which is uh one of the

769
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:31,319
most common trees in Central Texas

770
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:35,599
as you can the uh gray things you see

771
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:37,639
here um are not clouds in the sky those

772
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:41,000
that is pollen being released from this

773
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:43,679
tree uh just to give you a some context

774
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,880
here uh people begin to experience

775
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,720
allergic reactions to this pollen at

776
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,840
concentrations as low as uh 10 or 20

777
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:55,000
pollen grains per cubic meter of air

778
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:56,918
uh one a single pollen cone on one of

779
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,880
these trees has about half a million

780
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:02,159
pollen grains in it and you might see up

781
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,639
to a million pollen grains uh a million

782
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:08,278
pollen cones excuse me on one of these

783
00:31:04,638 --> 00:31:12,959
trees um and so what we're trying to do

784
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:14,720
is uh to understand uh both what the

785
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,399
health consequences are through

786
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,960
epidemiological analyses um as well as

787
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:23,439
to create operational pollen forecasts

788
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,120
it it turns out that uh most of the

789
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,759
pollen forecasts that you might find

790
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:29,359
through your weather app they're total

791
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:33,038
garbage they're just like unvalidated

792
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:35,319
like completely um well I'll pause for

793
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:39,119
right now on it but there's a lot to be

794
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:41,240
said I'll hold myself back um and so

795
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:43,558
some of the approaches that we take are

796
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:46,200
uh doing field work so uh field

797
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:49,319
campaigns to take manual measurements uh

798
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,120
we also work uh with uh citizen science

799
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:53,599
organizations especially the national

800
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:56,158
technology Network to enlist people to

801
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:59,839
help us take these measurements um then

802
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:03,440
we also do a lot of scaling up uh to to

803
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:06,119
try and understand um what is happening

804
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,720
with individual plants and then to take

805
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:10,839
that up to uh a site level and

806
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,480
ultimately to Regions or across an

807
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:18,480
entire State and someday I hope across

808
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:21,240
the entire country uh so uh some of the

809
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:25,000
processes that we try and understand are

810
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:27,399
fairly simple like how much pollen is a

811
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,679
plant producing uh and so Justin I'm

812
00:32:27,398 --> 00:32:31,319
really excited to uh think with you

813
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:35,000
about some of the methods that you've

814
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:36,678
been using because um we too hate

815
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,759
counting and trying to avoid it as much

816
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:42,720
as possible um other types of things we

817
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:45,158
try and understand are when uh pollen is

818
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:50,600
being released or how it moves through

819
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:52,600
the air uh I think that's uh most of

820
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:54,879
that project there's a lot of cool

821
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:57,558
things about uh the the intricacies of

822
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,480
the remote sensing we are using but if

823
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:03,158
you want to know more about it you'll

824
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:05,399
have to uh come stop by my lab uh say hi

825
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:08,399
we're up in Bradfield looking forward to

826
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:10,479
talking with you all more

827
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:11,759
thanks question well I I will make an

828
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,278
observation so I think it's what's

829
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,679
exciting is to see some of this

830
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:17,038
wonderful work and urban plant science

831
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,159
right and we've just hiring a new Urban

832
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:20,879
plant ecologist AR SE will'll be joining

833
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:23,039
us very shortly and I can see already

834
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,639
all sorts of threads that connect him

835
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:27,440
with you and also Justine and Z so we're

836
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:29,519
sitting here and uh listening to these

837
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,200
talks

838
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,960
right just a question do you also have

839
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:38,038
models with a bunch of

840
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,679
parameters um sometimes it it depends on

841
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:43,759
the type of model uh we try and do some

842
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:46,278
model uh so basically a lot of this is

843
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:49,240
trying to create predictions and so uh

844
00:33:46,278 --> 00:33:51,798
we are often okay with throwing a lot of

845
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:54,599
things and seeing what sticks generally

846
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:56,519
we do try and you know like think about

847
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:58,879
like what is most biologically

848
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:02,278
meaningful and take the things that

849
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,278
don't have much predictive

850
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,119
value okay thanks thanks

851
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:13,559
yall this has been a production of

852
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:16,560
