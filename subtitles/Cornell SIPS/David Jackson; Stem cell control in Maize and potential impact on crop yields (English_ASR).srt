1
00:00:03,138 --> 00:00:08,689
it's it's great to be back a corn Li

2
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:11,059
every time I come here which is not as

3
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:12,529
often as I'd like I always wish I came

4
00:00:11,058 --> 00:00:14,868
more often because there's so many great

5
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:16,730
people here and so many friends I will

6
00:00:14,868 --> 00:00:18,170
try and come more often but I think it's

7
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,469
been about 10 years since I was last

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,760
here yeah so I'm going to talk about

9
00:00:20,469 --> 00:00:24,859
development which is what we study very

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,200
similar to the work you know from from

11
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:28,879
Mike's lab and you know I'm really

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,800
fascinated by this idea that genes

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,869
control development it's a very simple

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,730
idea but you know development is

15
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:38,119
obviously very complex the generation of

16
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:40,039
form of three-dimensional structures but

17
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:42,709
the idea that we can tease is afar by

18
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:44,299
finding individual genes that controlled

19
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,590
specific aspects of development is

20
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:47,179
something that that I find very

21
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,520
attractive because I want to know how

22
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:52,070
things work ever since I was a kid I

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,420
would be taking toys apart and breaking

24
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,520
them you know and finding out how do you

25
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,200
know how machines work so I want to know

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,290
how plants work and specifically how the

27
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,480
how the morphology is generated and you

28
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:04,578
know potentially we could use that to

29
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,519
improve crops I don't know maybe I'm

30
00:01:04,578 --> 00:01:09,019
very naive but you know I think you know

31
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,939
we we should always think about a

32
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:14,869
potential applications for work

33
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:16,579
so what very much like Mike's lab we

34
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:19,990
study the meristems the shrewdest

35
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:21,920
meristems and I always I always sort of

36
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:23,420
assumed that everybody knows what a

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,879
meristem is that I know most people

38
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:28,340
don't but anyway the meristem in maize

39
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:30,289
which is when I'll talk about today is

40
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,969
found right at the base of the seedling

41
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,470
not up here which is where most people

42
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:35,150
guess it will be also people think it's

43
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:37,819
here but it's actually right at the base

44
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:40,030
but if you're very patient and dissect

45
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:42,919
away all the leaf primordia down here

46
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,960
then you're rewarded by this amazing

47
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,240
structure that the shoot meristem which

48
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,509
I I think is beautiful and it's this

49
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:52,280
dome of cells themselves that throughout

50
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:54,590
the life of the plant generate all the

51
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,570
organs that are required for it fruit

52
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,189
for growth and development so that's a

53
00:01:56,569 --> 00:02:00,469
scanning eeehm because the meristem is

54
00:01:58,188 --> 00:02:02,839
pretty tiny spider a tenth of a

55
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:04,969
millimeter in diameter but this

56
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,439
structure obviously is critical for fun

57
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:08,628
development because it makes all the

58
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:11,150
structures of the shoot including the

59
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:15,379
leaves the axillary meristems which make

60
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:16,810
the inflorescences the ears and also the

61
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:18,459
tassel so

62
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,789
critical structure and it's something we

63
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:25,509
can analyze and understand using

64
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:27,789
genetics actually 25 years ago when Mike

65
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:29,439
and I are in Berkeley I remember Ian's

66
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:32,139
Sussex told me that the meristem was a

67
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:34,359
black box it was a killer project but a

68
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:36,039
postdoc on that because you couldn't you

69
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,170
couldn't understand it it was so it's so

70
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:40,959
mysterious but you know he didn't

71
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:43,809
although he wrote the book on meristem

72
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,759
Steve's on Sussex he didn't use a lot of

73
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,009
genetics in his lab I think he came

74
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,189
before the era of genetics so genetics

75
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:54,669
is the key really to understanding this

76
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:56,139
ok so what you should also realize is

77
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:57,699
the meristem does not also make leaves

78
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:59,859
but it of course after transition to

79
00:02:57,699 --> 00:03:01,780
flowering it produces the reproductive

80
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,330
organs reproductive structures and so

81
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:07,030
these are also shooting meristems and so

82
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,099
you have the axillary shoot marathons

83
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:13,030
makes the ear primordia to make the ears

84
00:03:09,098 --> 00:03:16,000
and the apical shoot meristem produces

85
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,500
the terminal tassel that is similar it's

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,239
similar in structure to the ears except

87
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,609
it has branches of course the tassel is

88
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,409
branched in maize but these are all Mary

89
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:26,980
senses are all meristem structures and

90
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:28,150
we can study genes that affect you know

91
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:30,429
all of these different stages of

92
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,349
development but we tend to focus on the

93
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,180
ear just because that's where the

94
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:36,579
phenotypes that we work on them or

95
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,950
dramatic so we look a lot of ear

96
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:42,099
primordia and these things that we

97
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:44,229
affectionately call baby ears right so

98
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:46,329
that as sometimes guess is in trouble

99
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:49,629
with FedEx when we shoot packages

100
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:53,260
labeled baby ears strange reactions but

101
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:56,109
anyway yeah yeah so you're all familiar

102
00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:58,629
with the ear of corn of course you've

103
00:03:56,109 --> 00:04:00,370
eaten this and everybody loves it I hope

104
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:02,439
but we look at the ears when they're

105
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,109
about this stage this is 2 millimeters

106
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:06,789
by the thickness of a quarter and at

107
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:09,549
this stage already

108
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:11,828
most of the morphogenesis the initiation

109
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:15,069
of all the structures has occurred and

110
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:16,780
on the flanks of the apical meristem you

111
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:18,939
have all these primordia forming these

112
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:20,619
are called spikelet pairs and they form

113
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:23,168
spikelets and then florets and this is

114
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,389
what produces the seeds so the meristem

115
00:04:23,168 --> 00:04:27,339
at this very early stage is already

116
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:29,539
making this very regular rows of

117
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:33,689
primordia that will make the rig

118
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:36,450
the morphology is set up very early so

119
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:38,730
there it is again and these are all

120
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:40,199
scanning Ian's by the way and they look

121
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:43,230
impressive but these are really easy to

122
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,389
take so there's this just live tissue we

123
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,430
put it in this SEM and two minutes later

124
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:49,909
we have anything which like this you

125
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,930
should play around with that so we've

126
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:54,210
characterized a lot of the genes that

127
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,340
are involved in your development and

128
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:57,449
I'll just give you an outline as some of

129
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:59,939
them I mean there are a lot of different

130
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:00,750
things going on here so they'd be in the

131
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:03,120
inflorescence

132
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,500
there are leaves that are produced but

133
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,810
they're actually suppressed their growth

134
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,089
is suppressed to promote growth of the

135
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,519
meristems and that's a class of genes

136
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:13,019
called tassel sheath which when Whipple

137
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,759
is now focusing on he's calling the

138
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:16,919
first one of those in my lab but yet has

139
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,259
his own group now working those the

140
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,330
axillary meristems are initiated and

141
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,939
that's a lot of the genes involved in

142
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:26,370
that process of Austin sequence as we

143
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:28,500
know also from Arabidopsis and work from

144
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,300
Impala Max Dean and Andrea gala body has

145
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,699
weight one on these genes

146
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:36,030
we've worked we work and continue to

147
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:38,729
work on genes that impose determinacy so

148
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:40,469
this is really a branching series of

149
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:42,060
branching events actually three rounds

150
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,730
of branching producer florets

151
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,550
but then that indeterminacy has to be

152
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:51,020
turned off so determinacy has to be fair

153
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:53,009
it has to be imposed and that is

154
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:55,289
characterized by a class of genes called

155
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:57,870
the remote genes and we're working those

156
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,590
two but for today's seminar because I

157
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,810
know it's lunchtime

158
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:02,759
everybody's gonna get hungry I'm gonna

159
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,889
focus just on one group of genes and

160
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,750
those are the one that's involved in

161
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:09,329
maintaining the stem cells right at the

162
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:11,639
tip and these are the very famous genes

163
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:13,050
known from our our daughters from the

164
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,509
work of Elliot Meyerowitz many other

165
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,310
groups the Callado genes and the whistle

166
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:20,699
genes so that's what I will focus on

167
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:24,629
today now we've known for a really long

168
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:26,729
time actually since 1920s and before

169
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:29,370
that the meristem has some kind of

170
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,810
program for controlling its size so this

171
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,120
is you know the meristem is a structure

172
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,860
of proliferating cells but the cells are

173
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,990
not proliferating out of control of

174
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:41,310
course it's very carefully controlled

175
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:43,090
and Mary Pilkington did these very nice

176
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:47,168
experiments in in the

177
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:49,060
1920s where she would remove over leaf

178
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:52,389
primordia from meristems I think this is

179
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:54,550
in in B and then bisect the meristem

180
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:57,370
with a razor blade and then each half

181
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,199
will regrow regenerate and produce new

182
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,090
meristems that are the same size as the

183
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,350
original meristem also so that the

184
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:05,829
meristem has some kind of internal

185
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:07,900
program to control its size and we know

186
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:10,029
now from a lot of work mostly in

187
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:13,089
Arabidopsis actually almost exclusive in

188
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:15,219
Arabidopsis that this this mechanism for

189
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:17,589
controlling size is through this

190
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:21,040
classical cavada willed feedback pathway

191
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:23,109
and work on that has told us that there

192
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,840
are two really important groups of stem

193
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:28,150
cells in the meristem right at the tip

194
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:31,269
you have the true initials the stem

195
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:32,978
cells that we know from clonal analysis

196
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:35,319
these these are the true progenitor

197
00:07:32,978 --> 00:07:37,538
cells of the shoot and then below that

198
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:39,728
there's a group of cells in purple here

199
00:07:37,538 --> 00:07:41,949
which is called the organizing center

200
00:07:39,728 --> 00:07:43,659
and basically to understand how the

201
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:45,939
meristem is is maintained you have to

202
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,530
understand that there's a a crosstalk or

203
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:51,519
a feedback between these two groups of

204
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:53,978
cells so the the the organizing Center

205
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,769
sends a positive signal to the stem

206
00:07:53,978 --> 00:07:58,149
cells to tell it to divide okay so that

207
00:07:56,769 --> 00:08:00,459
you need to promote stem cell

208
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:02,620
differentiation let's maintain the shoot

209
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:04,168
but to maintain this as an ordered

210
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,728
structure this has to be kept in balance

211
00:08:04,168 --> 00:08:09,459
and it's kept in balance by a negative

212
00:08:06,728 --> 00:08:11,439
signal central as themselves back to the

213
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:13,870
organizing Center okay so so

214
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,379
mechanistically that's how it how it

215
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,389
works

216
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:19,029
and what are the genes involved well in

217
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:22,509
the stem cells you have the Claddagh

218
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:23,829
genes as I mentioned and up to now most

219
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:26,889
of the work has been done by a couple of

220
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:30,699
news feed receptors called clavata one

221
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:34,240
and Claddagh two and their ligand which

222
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:36,580
is a small secreted peptide encoded by a

223
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,099
gene called cavada 3 so this this gene

224
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:42,190
makes a pre peptide of about 100 amino

225
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:44,620
acids there's cleaved in 12 amino acids

226
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:47,470
signal is secreted and it binds to

227
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:51,039
cavada 1 and activate signaling from

228
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:53,649
this kinase and then that organizing

229
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:55,480
Center is characterized by this famous

230
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:56,860
homie domain transcription factor were

231
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,080
show which is expressed

232
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:02,409
down here in those cells so we shall

233
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:06,759
promote stem cell fade clavata genes

234
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:08,980
repress stem cell fate okay and we know

235
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:12,700
this is important because in nature in

236
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:15,250
in the in the wild and in our Gardens we

237
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,590
see plants where we've lost this

238
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:20,230
negative feedback and I call this stem

239
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:22,690
cells under control the botanical term

240
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:25,180
for that is face iation and in that case

241
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:27,910
the stem cells over proliferate and you

242
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:30,849
get these amazing convoluted shoots or

243
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:34,179
inflorescences or or flowers or fruits

244
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,860
okay so tomato for example work from

245
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:37,929
this equipment and a nest abundant

246
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,889
efficient at a closeout of you is what

247
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:46,329
gives rise to this beefsteak tomato okay

248
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:48,730
so had to show this being a cornell but

249
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:51,940
also this is a very famous picture from

250
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:53,320
Ithaca 1929 actually I just realized it

251
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,510
this is the same year that I've nursed

252
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:58,390
him by section experiment was done so

253
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:59,980
1929 was it a good year for for plant

254
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,629
biology but anyway this is Barbara

255
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,850
McClintock who discovered transposons

256
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:06,730
and later of course went to Cold Spring

257
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,950
Harbor what why do we study this in

258
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,420
maize because as I said most of the

259
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:13,030
foundational work has been done in

260
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:15,759
Arabidopsis or a blob this is a fast

261
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:18,009
cycling planet this small genome maze is

262
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:20,559
a slow cyclic plant with a huge genome

263
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:22,899
but still I think we can find new things

264
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,369
in maize and one of the one of the great

265
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:27,009
things about maize is we have a huge

266
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:29,649
mutant collection right that is

267
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:32,289
generated in part by the scientists who

268
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:34,539
developed these transposon lines and so

269
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:36,819
in maize we have a lot of Levada type

270
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:38,019
mutants which is the foundation of the

271
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,270
word for that I'm going to tell you

272
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:42,730
about so we call we don't leave we don't

273
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:45,850
call these cavada we call them face dat

274
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:47,529
ear so face hated again is the botanical

275
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,860
term for these massively expanded

276
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:53,439
stemless and these mutants and this is

277
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,389
just five I'm showing we have another 20

278
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,570
that we haven't characterized yet but I

279
00:10:55,389 --> 00:11:00,189
thought I would keep it focused some of

280
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,500
these mutants is you would expect we

281
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,090
clone them and they're awful lots of the

282
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:08,049
Clamato genes right this is not

283
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:10,620
surprising so td1 is cavada one is lr

284
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:12,659
receptor PHA two is cavada two

285
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,310
and then others that we've cloned have

286
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:16,769
been different so we have found new

287
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:19,739
things in maize that were not discovered

288
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:23,460
in Arabidopsis so they three is a new

289
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:25,169
type of lrl receptor that is functions

290
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,030
in some how in the Claddagh feedback but

291
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:28,500
was not characterized in a rubber topsis

292
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:31,049
but it does function in Arabidopsis

293
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,269
faith four is a transcription factor and

294
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:35,699
I'll talk a little bit about ct2 that's

295
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:37,610
a G protein that we think is involved in

296
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,480
signaling downstream of these receptors

297
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:42,629
okay so we have a large collection

298
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,399
mutants and it's really really great

299
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:46,950
material to work with to discover the

300
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,799
genes to control this meristem feedback

301
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:52,050
now another thing I'll talk about today

302
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:55,049
and this is more recent work is the idea

303
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:57,509
that we these genes may be useful for

304
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:59,879
controlling yield rates so in maize

305
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:03,179
there's some you know breeders measure

306
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:06,480
yield traits such as you know obviously

307
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:08,189
total massive corn that's harvested but

308
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,649
they also use more quantitative traits

309
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,990
such as this one kernel row number which

310
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:14,879
is a number of kernel rows around the

311
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,649
circumference of the ear so if you break

312
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,899
the ear in half you you can just

313
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:21,350
currently so this one has 12 rows it's

314
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:24,840
wrong if you count quickly it has 22 and

315
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:27,930
we have this idea that by controlling

316
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:30,810
size of the meristem you could control

317
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:33,750
the number of of rows because you see

318
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:36,000
this is this is now looking down from

319
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:38,309
the top of the ear ear primordium and

320
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,529
this is the mat the apical meristem and

321
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:42,929
then all these primordia are the ones

322
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:45,569
that are making the rows of seeds so you

323
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:48,149
know naively you could save well if we

324
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:49,860
can make this meristem bigger then we

325
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:53,490
could make more rows of seeds right so

326
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,360
that's what we want to do so the other

327
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,129
thing that's really interesting about

328
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,029
kernel row number of course is that

329
00:12:56,129 --> 00:13:02,700
maize itself is a manmade crop it's

330
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:05,579
genetically modified by humans over the

331
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:08,129
past 10,000 years and it's derived as

332
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,350
you know work from john doe billion at

333
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:13,169
Butler and others has shown that maize

334
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:15,629
is derived from teosinte which had only

335
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:17,309
a single row of seeds and human

336
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:20,039
selection over the course of thousands

337
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:22,529
of years gave rise to the amazing ear of

338
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:24,089
corn that we have today we know this is

339
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:27,059
genetic right so

340
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:29,190
number is acute acts as a cutie else

341
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:31,529
it's heritable and you can map loose

342
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:35,010
either control it and we also know this

343
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:37,799
was a gradual process so primitive carbs

344
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:40,080
of maize found in high altitude caves in

345
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:42,629
Mexico you know look like this or this

346
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,550
they may have a dros or twelve rows and

347
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:48,750
of course more modern varieties that we

348
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:50,639
eat or cows eat have 1820 alright so it

349
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,070
said it was a trade that was gradually

350
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:58,889
selected over the course of the last ten

351
00:13:53,070 --> 00:14:00,420
thousand years okay so our mutants may

352
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:03,269
have something to do with this that's

353
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:06,449
what we want to find out but you know

354
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:09,329
our face Yeti mutants have a lot more

355
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:12,270
rows but you see the rows are really

356
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:14,370
disorganized and the yield of these

357
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:16,710
mutants is very low like a farmer would

358
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,210
never want to grow this but you know

359
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:20,670
they're basically they make too many

360
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,750
primordia so it's almost like a cancer

361
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:25,500
the meristems are proliferating

362
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:27,240
proliferating and in the end it's making

363
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,309
hundreds of primordial here but none of

364
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,570
them are productive they just abort

365
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:33,239
because there's too many of them

366
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:35,610
and they're fighting for resources right

367
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,620
so we want to try and control that so

368
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:40,080
the model are sort of thinking is like

369
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:43,110
this so if we if we knock out one of

370
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:45,389
these faced headed genes completely so

371
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:48,629
zero activity we have a massive of

372
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:51,360
obliteration hi Colonel rose but very

373
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:53,009
low yield but if we could make an allele

374
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,320
of a gene like this that had reduce

375
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:57,419
activity like a hyper morphic allele

376
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,560
maybe we could make the meristem a

377
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:01,620
little bit bigger but it's still

378
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,929
organized and make more rows of seeds

379
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:07,259
around this bigger meristem and somehow

380
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:09,779
optimize yield at least Colonel row

381
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:12,090
number so that's what we'll get to it

382
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:14,939
towards the end okay so we call this

383
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:17,550
like the Goldilocks principle or the

384
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,350
sweet spot right - too hard or too cold

385
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:21,149
is not good that you want to be right in

386
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:23,070
the middle and at the right right

387
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:26,519
temperature or right level of gene

388
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:28,650
expression okay so I want to go through

389
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:33,929
one example of a mutant we've cloned

390
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:38,179
just to give it yeah just give you an

391
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:40,289
dear that the process we go through in

392
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:42,000
finding the genes and characterizing

393
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:45,120
these mutations so this is one in the

394
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,610
one mutant and this this mutant is

395
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,278
called compact one two so this gets

396
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:52,620
confusing it this should be called fated

397
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:54,958
ear or something but this mutant was

398
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:58,610
discovered in 1960s before I was born so

399
00:15:54,958 --> 00:16:01,949
I didn't get to name this and I'm I

400
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:03,450
respect old matron ethicists so I don't

401
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,700
want to change the name so I keep this

402
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:08,220
name Kampf I plan to and as its name

403
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:11,580
suggests the mutants are very compact

404
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:13,379
they're dwarfs but I don't care about

405
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:16,620
that so much what I care about is they

406
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:20,278
have faded years this is I'm really

407
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:22,799
interested in okay so we cloned this

408
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:24,509
gene and it was probably three years of

409
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:27,599
work but like most people I just show it

410
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:31,169
in a single slide and we found that

411
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,000
encodes a protein called G alpha or it

412
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:36,870
which is the alpha subunit of a trimeric

413
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,500
g protein so these these jeans are super

414
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:43,440
famous in mammalian systems because

415
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:46,528
they're that they G alpha is a signaling

416
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,080
protein as gtp a's that interacts with a

417
00:16:46,528 --> 00:16:51,208
class of receptors that are called not

418
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:54,959
surprisingly GPCRs results with

419
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:59,539
g-protein coupled receptors and GPCRs in

420
00:16:54,958 --> 00:17:02,429
yeast and in humans are these seven pass

421
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:04,369
transmembrane proteins and these are

422
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:07,049
targets for about a half of all

423
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:09,419
pharmaceutical drugs that have developed

424
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:11,759
first for humans so so that's you know

425
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:14,970
very very important pharmaceutical

426
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:17,308
industry so so G alpha is the signaling

427
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:20,400
protein that when these receptors are

428
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:24,240
activated this protein is a gtp a is it

429
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:27,329
will be activated by transferring gdp to

430
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,240
GTP becomes activated dissociates from

431
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:32,970
its subunits later in gamma and those

432
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:37,920
dissociated subunits go away and start

433
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:40,558
signaling cascades so because these

434
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:43,440
proteins were so famous in mammalian

435
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:46,220
systems people started working on them

436
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,380
in Arabidopsis and made mutants in them

437
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,759
and found that they did all sorts of

438
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,130
different things so basically anybody

439
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:54,079
who screen them for phenotype would find

440
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:56,150
their favorite phenotypes of if you were

441
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:58,099
looking on cell proliferation on home

442
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:01,100
different hormones or sugar signaling or

443
00:17:58,099 --> 00:18:02,558
defense responses people found a lot of

444
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:04,699
phenotypes but there was nothing

445
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:07,158
specifically up to now to do with

446
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,750
meristems or development so we thought

447
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:11,720
we had a unique angle here because we'd

448
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:16,669
shown that this mutant in G alpha had a

449
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:19,279
very clear meristem size phenotype okay

450
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:20,840
so then what we do or what we do all

451
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,418
along with these mutants is we try to

452
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:26,058
put the genes into pathways and we do

453
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:28,280
that by epistasis analysis and so we

454
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:30,980
make double mutants and here we made it

455
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:33,889
a double mutant between CT to us through

456
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,089
our G alpha mutant and Fae to which if

457
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,730
you remember is one of the Clamato

458
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:40,129
receptors one of these feedback stem

459
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:42,140
cell receptors and we found that the

460
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,630
double mutants and here we're measuring

461
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,460
we did this by measuring meristem size

462
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:48,860
but we can also do it in a more easy way

463
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,319
by Counting spinal density in the

464
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:53,178
tassels we found that double mutants

465
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:55,490
look like the single mutants in terms of

466
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:57,830
cycle density and so this is what we

467
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:00,339
would call egg stasis and suggest

468
00:18:57,829 --> 00:19:02,509
they're in a pathway now we did a

469
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:04,548
something that serves as a control

470
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:06,980
experiment a double mutant with TD 1

471
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:10,220
which is amazed the different maze about

472
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:12,620
a receptor maze cavada one here we see

473
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,750
an additive phenotype and this suggests

474
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:20,599
that seats two and td1 are in different

475
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:24,400
pathways and in parallel okay

476
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:27,379
so we had epistasis with Fay two

477
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,110
suggesting these proteins may be acting

478
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:33,740
together so we wanted to look further at

479
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:37,579
that and so we made a GFP or yfp fusion

480
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:40,788
of CT 2 and infused it in frame with the

481
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:43,579
native promoter with the CT 2 coding

482
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:45,379
region we could image it and it's on the

483
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:48,668
membrane which is what is predicted from

484
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:51,409
all the work in in in mammals and

485
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:54,020
fortunately as we hoped and expected we

486
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:56,659
saw high expression in meristem so it is

487
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:57,950
expressed in the meristem and has some

488
00:19:56,659 --> 00:19:59,900
interesting patterns I don't really have

489
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:02,630
time to go through that

490
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:05,000
but you know so these you know reporters

491
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,200
as Mike said can be very useful for just

492
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,730
looking at where things are expressed

493
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,130
but they're also really useful for more

494
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:13,490
functional assays and so we had a

495
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:16,280
hypothesis that CT 2 might interact with

496
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:18,019
this Clamato receptor and using the GFP

497
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:20,539
is a tag we could use that for IP

498
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:25,250
experiments you know precipitation and

499
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:27,440
so we pull down CT 2 with with a GFP

500
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,359
antibody in an immuno precipitation

501
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,190
experiment and we actually had a we

502
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,589
already had an antibody to detect fate

503
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:35,570
to that shown here the specific antibody

504
00:20:33,589 --> 00:20:38,299
that detects his fatal receptor in the

505
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:43,309
membrane fraction and we showed that if

506
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:46,039
we IP CT 2 we pull down PHA to receptor

507
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:48,230
so pulling down the g-protein also pulls

508
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:50,299
down the receptor and we did controls

509
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:52,759
within a different membrane protein

510
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:54,619
because these membrane IPs are actually

511
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:56,150
very tricky and you can get a lot of

512
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:59,659
background but we did a different memory

513
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:01,190
protein pin one when we agreed that one

514
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,190
we don't pull down the receptor so we

515
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:06,799
think it's specific

516
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:10,309
so our model now is that this g-protein

517
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:13,970
is signaling from the Claddagh receptor

518
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:15,649
from play to right so if that's true we

519
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,960
should be able to see some other kind of

520
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:19,880
Clamato phenotypes you know a mutant

521
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,829
well we saw it has big meristems but you

522
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,520
can get big meristems for a lot of

523
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:24,079
different reasons

524
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:27,200
so to see if it's really in the club on

525
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:29,659
a pathway does it really need si again

526
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,240
first developed in Arabidopsis where you

527
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,960
can actually synthesize about a three

528
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,450
head type

529
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,610
so remember Claddagh 3 is the ligand for

530
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:40,580
these receptors it's a 12 we know as a

531
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:42,619
peptide so you can just you know ask gen

532
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:44,960
script to make it and a week later you

533
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:48,319
have the peptide if you add that to

534
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,539
plans it will inhibit meristem

535
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:53,869
operations right so mutants in these

536
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:56,710
genes the meristem is over cliff rate if

537
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:59,089
you are add back the peptide in excess

538
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,710
you get the negative phenotype which is

539
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:04,309
the opposite phenotype which is you

540
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:07,039
suppress meristem growth so basically we

541
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:09,589
do this experiments with embryos because

542
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,690
in maize embryos they're big enough that

543
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:13,669
we can detect dissect them and culture

544
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:16,160
them and the meristem is expo

545
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:16,850
so we can easily access them with a

546
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,070
peptide

547
00:22:16,849 --> 00:22:23,569
so we culture the member after embryos

548
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:25,189
on media with colada 3 or a control with

549
00:22:23,569 --> 00:22:27,109
a scrambled peptide so it's the same

550
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:29,480
sequence but just that the order of the

551
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:32,000
amino acids is scrambled so it shouldn't

552
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,970
have any effect and when we do that we

553
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,200
find that with a scramble of peptide we

554
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,329
don't see any difference between the

555
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,539
mutant and the wild-type but when we

556
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:43,970
treat these with cavada 3 the wild-type

557
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:48,259
meristems their growth is inhibited as

558
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:50,558
we predicted the G alpha mutants CT 2

559
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:52,849
they're also inhibited but much less

560
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:55,460
than the wild-type so we say they're

561
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:59,240
partially insensitive to to this peptide

562
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:01,240
and to us this says that CT 2 is somehow

563
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,849
involved in transmitting this signal

564
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:09,798
from the peptide to the meristem

565
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:14,119
proliferation pathway ok so to summarize

566
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:17,119
this part what we think is happening now

567
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:20,269
is that you know in in animals and in

568
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:23,329
yeast this hedge trimeric g protein

569
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:26,569
complex interacts with these 7 pass

570
00:23:23,329 --> 00:23:29,089
receptors is GPCRs but implanted seems

571
00:23:26,569 --> 00:23:31,609
to be very different as there are GPCRs

572
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:33,639
implants or at least proteins predicted

573
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:35,869
to be GPCRs but they haven't been

574
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,730
convinced link shown to interact with G

575
00:23:35,869 --> 00:23:40,250
alpha but we found that G alpha

576
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:43,069
interacts with a Clamato receptor they -

577
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:45,619
and so we published that a few years ago

578
00:23:43,069 --> 00:23:46,909
and I I was kind of nervous about

579
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:48,619
publishing something that's so

580
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:50,330
dramatically different between animals

581
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:52,939
and plants but since then they've been

582
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:55,730
several other papers showing that indeed

583
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:58,279
G proteins do interact with lrr

584
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:02,169
receptors in plants so this is both in

585
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:02,168
development and also in defense signal

586
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:09,830
so now we wanted to look at you know is

587
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:11,600
this just an effect of G alpha or is

588
00:24:09,829 --> 00:24:14,509
this whole heterotrimeric complex

589
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:17,689
involved so as I said it's a three

590
00:24:14,509 --> 00:24:20,419
protein complexes G alpha G beta and G

591
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:22,640
gamma and we actually went after G G

592
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:24,919
beta next for the obvious example a

593
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,009
reason that it's a single copy gene so

594
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:30,580
mutants should have a phenotype

595
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:33,308
so and the other reason was that work in

596
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:35,500
Arabidopsis published very soon after

597
00:24:33,308 --> 00:24:38,918
our work in mais actually showed that in

598
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:42,099
Arabidopsis G beta controls meristem

599
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:44,440
size so we had G alpha controlling

600
00:24:42,099 --> 00:24:47,289
meristem size in our mutants in an

601
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,450
Arabidopsis is G beta right so it's a G

602
00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:52,960
beta mutants in Arabidopsis have big

603
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:55,870
meristems and this group in Japan found

604
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,808
that G beta interacts with our PK 2

605
00:24:55,869 --> 00:25:00,459
which is not not a classic Levada

606
00:24:58,808 --> 00:25:02,619
receptor but is a Colorado related

607
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:05,440
receptor that also functions in the

608
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:07,689
meristem so it seems this precedent that

609
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,429
these G proteins probably the whole

610
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:12,700
complex is functioning in meristem ik

611
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:15,280
controls ok so this was our first CRISPR

612
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:17,230
experiment we did this with Nene at Iowa

613
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,910
State and we were super excited this

614
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,019
about three years ago we thought we

615
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:22,058
going to get these plants back and

616
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:24,460
they'll have big meristems and we got

617
00:25:22,058 --> 00:25:27,789
them and we were very disappointed that

618
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,169
they were dead right so this for

619
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:32,548
development biologists this is not a

620
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:34,929
very satisfying in type so basically

621
00:25:32,548 --> 00:25:36,910
well we could recover these because we

622
00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:38,980
got events like they were heterozygous

623
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:41,259
but when we solved them the home ago

624
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:43,058
homozygous G beta mutants they

625
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:45,910
germinated and then within three days

626
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:47,589
they just dead right this is in stark

627
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,630
contrast to Herbert OPS's remember I

628
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:52,209
told you you're obnoxious mutants have

629
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:54,640
big marathons but you know the plants

630
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:57,400
themselves look pretty normal so we were

631
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,750
really surprised so we looked a little

632
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,960
bit more closely at this and what we

633
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:04,569
realized is that the plants were not

634
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,779
dying we're not just arresting but they

635
00:26:04,569 --> 00:26:09,700
were actually becoming very necrotic and

636
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:12,519
we saw that cells were dying the tissue

637
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:15,250
was turning brown very quickly and so we

638
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:18,700
stayed we did some assays for hydrogen

639
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:21,400
peroxide and for elite cell viability

640
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:23,470
and we quickly realize that yeah these

641
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,120
mutants were actually undergoing some

642
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,220
kind of autoimmune response by they're

643
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:28,899
actually killing themselves we also had

644
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:31,990
looked at pathogenesis related gene

645
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:35,019
expression so we think this is some kind

646
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:36,880
of autoimmune response and it kind of

647
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:40,819
well it makes sense based on what else

648
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:45,000
I'll tell you next but yeah with some

649
00:26:40,819 --> 00:26:47,220
we also grew we grew their ceilings or

650
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,200
seeds under sterile conditions and they

651
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,940
still die so it's not a pathogen thing

652
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,730
it's there they're just killing

653
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,919
themselves okay so this sort of makes

654
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:58,259
sense based on worth in Arabidopsis

655
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,900
groups have looked at the g-protein

656
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:03,329
mutants in a red abscess and G beta

657
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:06,288
mutants actually are more susceptible to

658
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:09,389
various pathogens so this is a mock

659
00:27:06,288 --> 00:27:12,390
inoculation of wild-type Columbia and

660
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:14,460
then the AG b1 the arrival of Co beta

661
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:17,788
mutants are much more susceptible to

662
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:20,880
arrange different diseases so it seems

663
00:27:17,788 --> 00:27:22,169
that as I alluded to earlier these G

664
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,659
proteins are probably involved in

665
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:26,549
signaling from defense receptors as well

666
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:28,740
as from the Claddagh development

667
00:27:26,548 --> 00:27:31,740
receptors and in fact a really nice

668
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:34,759
story came out last year from jamming

669
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:38,099
Joe's group actually showed that G beta

670
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:41,129
interacts with FL s 2 so FL s 2 is an

671
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:43,349
immune receptor in Rabbid Oxus that's

672
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:48,299
involved in the innate immune signaling

673
00:27:43,349 --> 00:27:50,250
and G beta interacts with F s 2 and that

674
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:52,168
explains the phenotypes and it actually

675
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:54,359
seems to function as a positive

676
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:55,470
regulator of immunity but through its

677
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:58,379
interaction with life flies through but

678
00:27:55,470 --> 00:28:00,839
also by stabilizing a dime string kinase

679
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,870
of F flies to called big one so G beta

680
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:06,168
functions in immunity in Arabidopsis and

681
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:09,449
the mutants are more susceptible to

682
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:12,419
diseases but this really doesn't still

683
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:15,140
doesn't understand explain why our maze

684
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:17,159
mutants are much more severe right

685
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:20,940
amazements are not more susceptible

686
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:24,179
they're just dead even in the object so

687
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:27,058
we we figure this out by thinking about

688
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:28,919
how you know how again how immunity

689
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:30,928
signaling works in plants so you

690
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:34,020
probably or much more familiar with this

691
00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:36,570
than I am but as you know plants are

692
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:40,349
constantly bombarded by pathogens and

693
00:28:36,569 --> 00:28:42,898
pathogens secrete effectors into the

694
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:44,969
plant cell that tried to suppress that

695
00:28:42,898 --> 00:28:45,898
the cellular immune signaling pathways

696
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:50,000
or

697
00:28:45,898 --> 00:28:52,229
defense pathways and in the case of a

698
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,920
viable infection where there's no

699
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:57,480
resistance then

700
00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:01,210
the plant is susceptible and will be

701
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:03,579
affected by the pathogen now plants have

702
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:06,640
evolved these are proteins resistance

703
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:08,769
proteins that can either interact

704
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,380
directly with the with the bacterial

705
00:29:08,769 --> 00:29:13,990
effectors a pathogen factor but more

706
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:16,480
frequently is thought that these are

707
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:18,910
proteins interact with another host

708
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,920
protein another con protein that is

709
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:23,830
targeted by the effector and they're

710
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:26,350
actually guarding on surveying that host

711
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:27,519
protein to see if it's under attack by a

712
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:28,959
pathogen effector

713
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:31,480
right so this is called the god

714
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,880
hypothesis and these cellular these

715
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,890
plant proteins that are by the are

716
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,200
proteins are called guardians they're

717
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:39,009
being guarded so that when the plant is

718
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,750
under attack

719
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:43,390
I have been an effector it it knows it

720
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:46,509
right and it's known that if you if you

721
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:48,759
mutate these guard ease then the plant

722
00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:50,650
again thinks is being attacked and you

723
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:52,690
get an autoimmune phenotype so that's

724
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:55,150
what we think is happening with G beta

725
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:57,789
that we think G beta is guarded by an

726
00:29:55,150 --> 00:30:00,100
our protein or an R gene and when we

727
00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:02,680
mutated the punt think it's is being

728
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:06,250
attacked by pathogens and it kills eggs

729
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:08,620
every cell now we can test that one way

730
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:10,720
accessor is that our genes are very

731
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:14,919
polymorphic between different eco types

732
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,480
and so we took our G beta mutant as a as

733
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,789
a head obviously we can't cross the

734
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,700
homozygotes but we cross the head to all

735
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:24,490
of the NAM maize diversity lines and

736
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,660
made f2s and we found that for most of

737
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,970
them we still got the same phenotype

738
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:30,490
that the mutants were lethal but we have

739
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:32,890
a few lines where now the phenotype is

740
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:35,799
suppressed and we get plants back

741
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:38,290
they're not completely wild-type but

742
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:39,909
they're not dead obviously they grow

743
00:30:38,289 --> 00:30:43,509
they're making fluorescence is so we

744
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:46,509
think these suppressors are lines

745
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:48,940
types that no longer contain the our

746
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:50,379
gene and in fact we've we've mapped one

747
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,480
of these and it Maps in a region we

748
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,800
don't know the exact geniu but it maps

749
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,680
in the region where there is a predicted

750
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:58,599
RG so this was a bit of an aside for us

751
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,070
but it could actually get us through a

752
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:01,869
new arginine maize which will be cool

753
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:05,589
actually very few our genes have been

754
00:31:01,869 --> 00:31:07,419
cloned in maize up to now okay but

755
00:31:05,589 --> 00:31:10,079
anyway we were excited to have these

756
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:12,940
and because now we say this is now the

757
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,470
developmental phenotype of Chi beta and

758
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,509
it actually looks very similar to G

759
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:18,400
alpha that CT 2 phenotype

760
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:21,789
now we've suppressed the defense

761
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:24,100
responses and they have so we call these

762
00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:27,940
G beta suppressed they have big

763
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:29,919
meristems and we think this is

764
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:32,860
significant and actually coming back to

765
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:35,279
the concept I I brought up earlier G

766
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:37,539
beta in maize in G wasps analysis

767
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,519
associates with Colonel Rohl number the

768
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:41,680
trade that I I mentioned that we think

769
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,809
is associative marathon site so so we're

770
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,700
still working on this but we think at

771
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:50,019
least up to now we've think that G beta

772
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:53,710
is also functioning in them in meristem

773
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:55,809
signaling okay so now we have a

774
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:58,390
situation where Fei to this club our doe

775
00:31:55,809 --> 00:32:01,269
receptor is probably signaling through G

776
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:03,300
alpha and G beta this probably G gamma

777
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:07,839
also but we haven't done that yet

778
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:11,369
now there's work in Arabidopsis that the

779
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:14,709
awful log of FEI to which is cavada two

780
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:16,989
signals through a different protein and

781
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:19,809
that protein is called korean a korean a

782
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:22,269
is a kind well it was when it was first

783
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:24,129
clone it was published to be a kinase

784
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:25,930
that it's actually a pseudo pilot's so

785
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:28,260
it's a protein that has homology to

786
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:30,720
Karnazes but has no kinase activity

787
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:33,549
probably acting as some kind of scaffold

788
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,950
so you know i'm always interested in

789
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:37,869
this question about how meristem has

790
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:40,390
evolved and whether the same pathways at

791
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:44,859
present in maize or I say monocots and

792
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:47,080
dicots or whether they evolve or evolve

793
00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:48,879
separately or evolve to be different

794
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:51,339
right so we have here we have one

795
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,230
receptor Fei to and it's all gonna

796
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:54,369
Robert offices right so presumably doing

797
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:56,650
the same thing they have the same

798
00:32:54,369 --> 00:32:58,239
phenotype but that up to now the

799
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:00,580
genetics suggests that this one goes

800
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,349
through G proteins and this one goes

801
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:05,169
through Carinae so we really wanted to

802
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:09,969
know is this a trans pcs difference or

803
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:13,360
is our both systems operating in both

804
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:16,150
monocots and dicots right so we were

805
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:18,549
fortunate to get a mutant of coronae in

806
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:20,630
maize we got this from bob Miglia

807
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:22,579
pioneer from their transposon

808
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:25,270
collection and we also got another

809
00:33:22,579 --> 00:33:27,319
allele from the amazing populations

810
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:29,950
developed by Jerry new for the EMS

811
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:33,319
populations and we found that coronae

812
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:35,900
indeed also is face eiated so big

813
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:38,779
meristems and their face iation in the

814
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:41,480
ear so seems that both korean a and g

815
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:46,789
are functioning maize in in meristem

816
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:50,360
signal now again we use double mutants

817
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:51,950
and so we have I should have had a

818
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:54,379
summary here but we have Fae to the

819
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:57,049
receptor and then two possible

820
00:33:54,380 --> 00:34:00,950
downstream signaling components G alpha

821
00:33:57,049 --> 00:34:03,980
and Corrine a if we make double mutants

822
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:06,049
between G alpha and Corrine a third

823
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:08,119
they're additive or synergistic so we

824
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:10,668
get these crazy face iation it's much

825
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:12,109
more severe than the single mutants so

826
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:22,480
this suggests their different pathways

827
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:27,500
okay now however what's a bit of a lag

828
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:30,110
yeah when we make double mutants between

829
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:33,559
the receptor and coronae so between FA 2

830
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:35,149
and current a here we see epistasis so

831
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:37,460
the double mutants look like the single

832
00:34:35,148 --> 00:34:39,799
mutants rights that's in Maitreya

833
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:43,128
meristems or just looking at them they

834
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:46,070
kind of look not that much different so

835
00:34:43,128 --> 00:34:49,279
so PHA - and Karina are in the same

836
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:51,679
pathway renee and CT tour and different

837
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,179
pathways and our earlier published work

838
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,220
has shown that fate U and C teetering

839
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:56,510
different pathways so this is gonna be

840
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:58,819
on the test I know it's getting very

841
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:01,010
complicated but I'll have a summary ok

842
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:05,960
so what we think is the receptor has two

843
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:07,880
different outputs Karen a and G alpha it

844
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,130
turns out and this is from some early

845
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,559
work that we publish that I'm not going

846
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:14,059
to talk much about that there are two

847
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:16,279
different Claddagh three related

848
00:35:14,059 --> 00:35:19,279
proteins in maze that affect meristems

849
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,860
one of them is called CLE 7 which we

850
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,040
think is the carotid 3 over log the

851
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:27,829
other one is called FC P 1 and we Chris

852
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:29,369
perd both of these to get phenotypes and

853
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:32,429
we have

854
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:34,730
vacation in both cases but what we find

855
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:37,588
and this is the important result is that

856
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:40,469
again we do these peptide sensitivity

857
00:35:37,588 --> 00:35:43,349
assays where if a gene is involved in

858
00:35:40,469 --> 00:35:47,548
possession of a peptide the mutant

859
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:52,200
should be insensitive right and we found

860
00:35:47,548 --> 00:35:53,699
that G alpha or CT 2 is sensitive to one

861
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:58,259
of the two peptides but not the other

862
00:35:53,699 --> 00:36:00,929
and Carinae is sensitive to the other

863
00:35:58,259 --> 00:36:03,449
peptide and not the first one so yeah so

864
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:05,098
basically this is our model I know it's

865
00:36:03,449 --> 00:36:07,288
a lot of data and it's even I get

866
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:09,240
confused by this but our model is that

867
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:11,940
we have two different signals going

868
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:14,429
through the same receptor different

869
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:18,389
peptides one is Cle 7 which is the maze

870
00:36:14,429 --> 00:36:20,159
version of Callado 3 and one is FC p1

871
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:23,009
which is different about a three related

872
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:25,048
peptide two different signals go through

873
00:36:23,009 --> 00:36:28,469
the same receptor and they come out of

874
00:36:25,048 --> 00:36:31,318
different outputs now you can ask me

875
00:36:28,469 --> 00:36:34,078
later how this works and it's it's not

876
00:36:31,318 --> 00:36:35,639
that confusing because we think that

877
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,380
these receptors do not work by

878
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:39,929
themselves when they work in complexes

879
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:43,048
so we think that they - probably is a

880
00:36:39,929 --> 00:36:45,868
scaffold for other receptors which give

881
00:36:43,048 --> 00:36:48,929
the specificity so maybe one receptor

882
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:51,838
complex binds Claddagh 3 and another

883
00:36:48,929 --> 00:36:53,038
receptor complex I am sexy p1 and we'd

884
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:55,400
really like to know what those are but

885
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:56,880
we're not there yet but at least

886
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,139
phenomenologically I think this is

887
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,690
interesting because it shows how you can

888
00:36:58,139 --> 00:37:02,969
get different signal inputs and outputs

889
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:10,710
going through its common receptor so I

890
00:37:02,969 --> 00:37:17,598
think it's quite interesting I'm

891
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:20,190
actually going to skip that anyway ok so

892
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,778
there's another area we are very

893
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:24,179
interested in which is looking at

894
00:37:21,778 --> 00:37:26,429
natural variation and some of this is

895
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:28,230
actually what inspired by work from Ed

896
00:37:26,429 --> 00:37:31,469
buckler and Mike Lee and others where

897
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:33,210
they've shown that we can map qtls for a

898
00:37:31,469 --> 00:37:34,578
kernel row number which is the trait we

899
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:37,548
eventually want to get to so there is

900
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:40,140
natural genetic variation in maize for

901
00:37:37,548 --> 00:37:42,989
we think for meristem size certainly

902
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:46,109
fir'd for seed seed number and the

903
00:37:42,989 --> 00:37:48,359
is me in our summer field last year this

904
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:50,610
is actually a real calm plant I didn't

905
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:53,730
glue these together not I'm the scale by

906
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:56,280
answer it's huge this is a land Mexican

907
00:37:53,730 --> 00:38:01,079
land race from simit that the maize and

908
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:03,450
wheat Research Centre in Mexico and I

909
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:06,420
ordered these seeds or seeds of this

910
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:09,449
line because they're annotated as being

911
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:11,820
faced here I see I did and they are and

912
00:38:09,449 --> 00:38:13,710
this is really amazing this is a land

913
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:16,530
race that people grow and eat in Mexico

914
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:18,269
and it's it's amazing and I had my I

915
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:21,090
asked my undergrads to shoot back these

916
00:38:18,269 --> 00:38:22,440
plants and they were like Jaime on the

917
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,510
inch of their shoulders and bringing

918
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,579
ladders and then I told me you can just

919
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:29,220
bend them over because they have dogs

920
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:32,579
like about six inches thick so they're

921
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:36,659
really strong but it was fun okay

922
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:39,029
so we are trying to map this but we're

923
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:40,769
not there yet we're close but another

924
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:42,510
approach we've taken is to use the noun

925
00:38:40,769 --> 00:38:45,809
population which is this amazing

926
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:47,700
resource in maize natural variation

927
00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:50,070
resource generated by a major Goodman

928
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:52,769
and made famous by adviser and many

929
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:55,320
other people here so this is a diversity

930
00:38:52,769 --> 00:38:57,929
population with diverse 25 diverse

931
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:00,150
founder lines so we want to find natural

932
00:38:57,929 --> 00:39:02,730
variation in our trade of interest which

933
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:06,150
is faced iation so we take one of our

934
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:08,099
mutants like Faye - and we cross it -

935
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:10,920
all of the diversity parents and then

936
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:12,690
make F twos and score the phenotypes so

937
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,269
we're looking for modified as genetic

938
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:16,619
modifiers and it's a lot of work but

939
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:19,108
it's kind of fun to just walk through

940
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:20,519
the field and get up and in ten thousand

941
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:22,799
years it's one of my favourite

942
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:24,780
activities but not for everybody but

943
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:31,400
anyway when we did this we found that

944
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:34,380
one of these lines which is NC 350

945
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:38,039
strongly enhanced the Fae - phenotype

946
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:40,740
right so NC 350 by itself is not face

947
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:45,179
eiated right these are just natural for

948
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:48,389
i inbred varieties but when we cross NC

949
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:49,858
350 with say - and make an F - we go

950
00:39:48,389 --> 00:39:51,690
from a pretty strong face iation

951
00:39:49,858 --> 00:39:53,940
phenotype looks like this so that

952
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:56,400
meristem is really flattened and that

953
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,940
ear is flattened and then we get

954
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,608
something like

955
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:01,650
this which is just completely crazy just

956
00:39:59,608 --> 00:40:04,920
really faced it kind of looks like a

957
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:06,329
brain and I get my neuro your biologist

958
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,630
colleagues interested in this till I

959
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:11,250
realized yeah so it's so it's really

960
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:15,180
strongly an end so we want to know you

961
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:18,449
know there's some locus in NC 350 that's

962
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:20,159
doing this it's in in wild-type NC 350

963
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:22,679
it's not doing anything to the meristem

964
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:24,779
but when we put it in an immutable on

965
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:26,399
which we think sensitize is that the

966
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:28,470
plan then we see this really strong

967
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:32,130
enhancement

968
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:33,419
so we mapped this in actually this was

969
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:35,099
originally really difficult to map

970
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:36,690
because there's a lot of things

971
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:38,640
segregating here and it's probably not

972
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:41,880
just one major locus but we'd so we do

973
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:43,500
several back crosses and make an f2 and

974
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:47,010
we found a major locus on chromosome

975
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:50,309
five that the maps to this trait and we

976
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:52,859
map this and right in the middle is one

977
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:55,289
of our favorite genes they have a really

978
00:40:52,858 --> 00:40:58,380
talked about you at TD 1 which is amazed

979
00:40:55,289 --> 00:41:00,358
cavada one about a one receptor if FA 2

980
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:02,550
is clever tattoo and TD one is Claddagh

981
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:04,259
one so it makes perfect sense a little

982
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:06,420
bit disappointing is nothing new but I

983
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,089
think it's interesting that within this

984
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:10,889
line we found in this natural variation

985
00:41:08,088 --> 00:41:13,650
in T V 1 which can enhance this trade

986
00:41:10,889 --> 00:41:16,170
and we've shown we've confirmed this by

987
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:17,789
mutants and also I said I don't have it

988
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:21,269
here in the slide but there is a

989
00:41:17,789 --> 00:41:24,300
difference in expression in TD 1 in NC

990
00:41:21,269 --> 00:41:26,818
350 compared to be 73 which was our

991
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:29,039
starting line so it's it's interesting

992
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:31,400
and I think this is a an extra resource

993
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:34,500
we can hopefully use to uncover new

994
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:37,309
alpha in the future new loci also that

995
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,309
control these traits

996
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:46,219
okay so last part of the talk I want to

997
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:49,019
just come back to this idea again about

998
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:53,098
increasing yield or at least increasing

999
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:55,619
kernel number so again the idea is these

1000
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:58,800
mutants make massive disorganized

1001
00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:02,250
meristems the yield is very low but if

1002
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,440
we can control this gene I a weak allele

1003
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:07,289
we could make a little bit bigger sense

1004
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:10,500
and more rows ok so originally we did

1005
00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:10,869
this together with a tilling facility in

1006
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,369
May

1007
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:17,289
set up by cliff while Purdue and

1008
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:20,230
whee-hee-hee screen for us in EMS

1009
00:42:17,289 --> 00:42:22,750
populations for alleles of Fae - that

1010
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:25,210
had on mute ations generated by EMS just

1011
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:28,539
by by sequencing we had four of these

1012
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:30,789
and they're predicted to give single

1013
00:42:28,539 --> 00:42:34,119
amino acid changes presumably weak

1014
00:42:30,789 --> 00:42:35,920
alleles and for one of these at least

1015
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:38,529
two two of them but one was more

1016
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:42,130
dramatic we actually found that indeed

1017
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:45,070
in these mutants these weak alleles of

1018
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:47,710
Fae - we do get an increase in Colonel

1019
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:49,240
rose from an average of about 16 to

1020
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:52,570
Navarrete about 20 which is quite

1021
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:54,069
dramatic a lot more kernels per ear and

1022
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,330
everybody was excited about this I

1023
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:57,580
wasn't really excited about this I was

1024
00:42:55,329 --> 00:42:58,809
really excited about this which is when

1025
00:42:57,579 --> 00:43:01,690
we look at these in the scanning

1026
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:04,329
eeehm we see that indeed these weak

1027
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:05,769
alleles if they to the meristems do

1028
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:09,309
indeed get a bit bigger but they're

1029
00:43:05,769 --> 00:43:11,679
still organized still this nice dome

1030
00:43:09,309 --> 00:43:14,259
shape they're not satiated splittings

1031
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:16,480
right so I was really happy about this

1032
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:19,780
okay so we're making more kernels do we

1033
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:22,990
make more yield well the answer is no

1034
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:24,880
right so as I was discussing we Bob this

1035
00:43:22,989 --> 00:43:26,079
morning you know plants are pretty smart

1036
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,849
you know you try and trick it into

1037
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,309
making more rows of seats and they say

1038
00:43:27,849 --> 00:43:32,139
well you know I'm just gonna make the

1039
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:34,299
seeds smaller so that that's what the

1040
00:43:32,139 --> 00:43:36,849
plant did so there was no increase in

1041
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:39,370
yield in this background which is not

1042
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:42,130
you know what farmers grow this is w22

1043
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:44,230
so it's not even in a hybrid which is

1044
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:47,019
what we normally grow but you know we've

1045
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:49,059
been giving these lines out Greta's here

1046
00:43:47,019 --> 00:43:51,190
and there and actually a former postdoc

1047
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:53,590
in my lab is now a maize breeder in

1048
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:55,750
vietnam and he put this into one it into

1049
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:59,440
their breeding lines that they actually

1050
00:43:55,750 --> 00:44:01,960
grow the farmers grow and they again saw

1051
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,970
an increase in kernel row number and in

1052
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:06,010
their yield trials is his real breeders

1053
00:44:03,969 --> 00:44:08,409
yield trials this is not our crappy

1054
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:10,660
field in in Long Island they saw up to a

1055
00:44:08,409 --> 00:44:12,909
20% increase in yield so that's pretty

1056
00:44:10,659 --> 00:44:16,000
encouraging it needs to be reproduced

1057
00:44:12,909 --> 00:44:20,679
but I think in some backgrounds this may

1058
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,360
really have an effect we did this with

1059
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:24,129
another gene that we were done called

1060
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,660
Fay 3 I haven't really talked about this

1061
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:30,059
today

1062
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:32,759
in this example we had weak alleles see

1063
00:44:30,059 --> 00:44:34,559
they're still mildly face eiated but not

1064
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:38,760
nothing like the null mutant again

1065
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:42,809
there's a EMS weak alleles in this case

1066
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,410
even in our you know old inbreds and

1067
00:44:42,809 --> 00:44:45,809
hybrids

1068
00:44:43,409 --> 00:44:48,420
it's just b7 3w 22 we see a pretty

1069
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:50,219
significant increase in yield again this

1070
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:53,970
is not elite varieties of course but

1071
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:56,669
encouraging that we may do this so maybe

1072
00:44:53,969 --> 00:44:59,819
these marathon pathways are interacting

1073
00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:01,769
somehow in pathways a controlled sync

1074
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:03,990
strength right so the plant only has a

1075
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:06,179
limited amount of resources but what it

1076
00:45:03,989 --> 00:45:08,669
does without resources I think is a

1077
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:11,129
mystery how that's did how that's

1078
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:14,099
decided so there may be some interaction

1079
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:16,860
okay so we want to do this large-scale

1080
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:19,110
and I think with the EMS alleles we were

1081
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:21,329
really lucky to get alleles that had the

1082
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:24,120
desired effect so we want to make a more

1083
00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:27,000
generalizable approach to make weak

1084
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:28,859
alleles in plants right and targeting

1085
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,199
the protein sequence is a little risky

1086
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:32,789
because you might you know you could not

1087
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:34,259
have the whole protein you don't really

1088
00:45:32,789 --> 00:45:36,690
know what you're gonna get and EMS is

1089
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,980
kind of messy and slow and so now of

1090
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:40,530
course we have CRISPR which is just

1091
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,300
amazing new tool so to make weak alleles

1092
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:44,519
we don't want to tug in the coding

1093
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:46,860
sequence but maybe we thought maybe we

1094
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:48,840
can target the promoters so again this

1095
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:52,590
is with our with our clean mutants in

1096
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:55,710
maze what we do is we take the predicted

1097
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:57,630
promoter region and we don't care about

1098
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:59,460
promoter elements everybody asks like

1099
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,110
how did you predict which promoter

1100
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,820
element is important blah blah blah I

1101
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:05,160
don't care I just want to get a

1102
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:08,460
phenotype right so we just we take the

1103
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:11,879
upstream once 2 KB of promoter and just

1104
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:14,250
tile it with 8 or 9 guide RNAs then we

1105
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:17,700
transform this into maze and what we get

1106
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:20,130
out is plants that have all sorts of

1107
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:22,529
different phenotype genotype so so

1108
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:24,599
basically we have small in Dells which

1109
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:26,310
is very common with CRISPR but if you do

1110
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:28,170
CRISPR with multiple guide RNAs you also

1111
00:46:26,309 --> 00:46:30,690
often get large deletions so we get

1112
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:32,460
different promoted deletions so this is

1113
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:34,409
like in vivo promoter botchey I mean

1114
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,490
when I was a graduate student everybody

1115
00:46:34,409 --> 00:46:37,349
was doing promoter botchey

1116
00:46:35,489 --> 00:46:38,189
it was I thought it was really boring

1117
00:46:37,349 --> 00:46:39,538
but

1118
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:43,108
quite excited about this because it's in

1119
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:45,599
vivo in the native genomic context and I

1120
00:46:43,108 --> 00:46:48,000
wish I had a lot of results from this

1121
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,559
you may have seen a paper published a

1122
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,179
few months ago from Zack Lippmann so

1123
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:52,859
we're doing this together with Lippmann

1124
00:46:51,179 --> 00:46:55,190
laughs using a tomato and tomato as much

1125
00:46:52,858 --> 00:47:01,230
faster than maize and they already have

1126
00:46:55,190 --> 00:47:02,789
amazing allelic variation in tomato the

1127
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:05,338
only thing I can show in maize which is

1128
00:47:02,789 --> 00:47:07,380
not very satisfying is that we do have

1129
00:47:05,338 --> 00:47:07,769
some weak phenotypes and weak face

1130
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:10,200
iation

1131
00:47:07,769 --> 00:47:13,259
but no no yield idea but that's coming

1132
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:15,358
next so I think it can work there's no

1133
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:21,299
reason it shouldn't work I think it's

1134
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:24,420
pretty exciting so where are we so I

1135
00:47:21,298 --> 00:47:26,909
think I've hopefully convinced you or

1136
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:30,510
confused you that the Claddagh Network

1137
00:47:26,909 --> 00:47:32,670
is very confusing and complex you know

1138
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:35,819
and CRISPR is just beginning so it's

1139
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:38,338
gonna get a lot worse you know we used

1140
00:47:35,818 --> 00:47:40,318
to be in this great situation where we

1141
00:47:38,338 --> 00:47:42,269
had okhla vada three binds cavada one

1142
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:44,849
that regulates which one is feedback but

1143
00:47:42,269 --> 00:47:47,130
we now know that there are many more

1144
00:47:44,849 --> 00:47:49,170
receptors the function in meristem

1145
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:51,660
control and then always downstream

1146
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:54,389
signaling components and there are a lot

1147
00:47:51,659 --> 00:47:55,889
more that paper I just reviewed has four

1148
00:47:54,389 --> 00:47:57,719
more over here that will be coming out

1149
00:47:55,889 --> 00:48:00,690
soon so yeah there's a lot more stuff

1150
00:47:57,719 --> 00:48:03,179
coming so it is very confusing but in a

1151
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:04,289
way that's biology and it's satisfying I

1152
00:48:03,179 --> 00:48:05,219
mean it's interesting to think about why

1153
00:48:04,289 --> 00:48:08,339
it's so complicated

1154
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:11,750
we could discuss that later but yeah it

1155
00:48:08,338 --> 00:48:16,440
is complicated but we're making headway

1156
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:18,630
and then there's the please so clavata

1157
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:21,510
three is this as I said is is Cle it's a

1158
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:24,500
peptide it's a member of a big gene

1159
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:28,859
family they're actually 49 in maize and

1160
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:30,568
I didn't dare ask my postdoc to knock

1161
00:48:28,858 --> 00:48:32,519
out all of them but he's actually done

1162
00:48:30,568 --> 00:48:35,219
about 20 of them already so this is a

1163
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:37,139
amazing not all in the same plant right

1164
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:39,449
so they ought because together but the

1165
00:48:37,139 --> 00:48:41,038
amazing power of CRISPR you know we we

1166
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:43,108
now gently knocking out four genes at

1167
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:45,510
once and we could go tomorrow I'm sure

1168
00:48:43,108 --> 00:48:47,009
so it's really things are going to

1169
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:50,250
change very quickly so it so we're

1170
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:51,278
focusing on only about 30 so I decided

1171
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:53,498
to be more modest in

1172
00:48:51,278 --> 00:48:55,150
my expectations but the ones are the

1173
00:48:53,498 --> 00:48:56,889
most highly expressing inflorescence

1174
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:58,539
ofcourse and I'm sure there'll be lots

1175
00:48:56,889 --> 00:49:00,009
of interesting phenotypes coming out of

1176
00:48:58,539 --> 00:49:02,319
this probably more than we can ever ever

1177
00:49:00,009 --> 00:49:04,329
study but but I think it's it's very

1178
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:06,759
powerful now to think about you know

1179
00:49:04,329 --> 00:49:08,289
know looking at single genes because we

1180
00:49:06,759 --> 00:49:10,630
know that redundancy is very prevalent

1181
00:49:08,289 --> 00:49:12,789
in plants and so we need to think about

1182
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:17,409
knocking out whole gene families to find

1183
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:20,829
the phenotypes okay and then so how

1184
00:49:17,409 --> 00:49:23,469
complicated is it very and then

1185
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:25,689
something I think about a lot also is to

1186
00:49:23,469 --> 00:49:27,729
what extent is yield to crop yields

1187
00:49:25,688 --> 00:49:30,788
limits by sync and when I talk about

1188
00:49:27,728 --> 00:49:33,129
this a lot of people say well yield is

1189
00:49:30,789 --> 00:49:35,549
sauce limited right the plant only makes

1190
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:38,499
a certain amount of force in fade and

1191
00:49:35,548 --> 00:49:40,329
all that goes to the ear and then you

1192
00:49:38,498 --> 00:49:42,068
can't make more by making the ear bigger

1193
00:49:40,329 --> 00:49:45,278
because you only have a certain amount

1194
00:49:42,068 --> 00:49:47,438
of resources but I don't know if that's

1195
00:49:45,278 --> 00:49:49,599
true and in some of our works yes it may

1196
00:49:47,438 --> 00:49:51,699
not be true right I mean the resources

1197
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,949
may be some of the resources are kept in

1198
00:49:51,699 --> 00:49:55,989
the roots or or you know kept in the

1199
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:57,938
leaves and weird funneling more of that

1200
00:49:55,989 --> 00:49:59,380
into the ear and whether that's good

1201
00:49:57,938 --> 00:50:01,088
enough for sustainability I don't know

1202
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:02,979
but it's interesting to think about

1203
00:50:01,088 --> 00:50:06,099
whether this can be used to enhance

1204
00:50:02,978 --> 00:50:08,948
yield maybe this has already been

1205
00:50:06,099 --> 00:50:10,869
optimized in Kahn belt maze because

1206
00:50:08,949 --> 00:50:13,358
freed has been breeding maize for you

1207
00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:14,949
know almost 100 years but probably not

1208
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:17,498
in all environments as I showed you with

1209
00:50:14,949 --> 00:50:18,608
the lines from Vietnam and certainly

1210
00:50:17,498 --> 00:50:21,399
there's a lot of interest now in

1211
00:50:18,608 --> 00:50:23,558
developing new crops right often often

1212
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,778
crops improving them and they think

1213
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:29,469
these pathways could be very useful in

1214
00:50:25,778 --> 00:50:35,679
improving yield in in crops that are not

1215
00:50:29,469 --> 00:50:37,208
commonly row crops now okay so yeah I

1216
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:39,519
just want to acknowledge people who did

1217
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:41,678
this these are in greener that people

1218
00:50:39,518 --> 00:50:43,778
involve in cavada related projects the

1219
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:45,278
other people doing different things a

1220
00:50:43,778 --> 00:50:48,608
lot of the work Justin by a very

1221
00:50:45,278 --> 00:50:51,159
talented postdoc young Lu just got a job

1222
00:50:48,608 --> 00:50:52,869
back in Korea and also Peter bomb it is

1223
00:50:51,159 --> 00:50:54,429
back in Germany and then we have a great

1224
00:50:52,869 --> 00:50:58,689
group of collaborators and funding

1225
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:59,990
agencies and etc okay and thanks very

1226
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:06,170
much

1227
00:50:59,989 --> 00:51:06,169
[Applause]

1228
00:51:15,309 --> 00:51:24,679
yeah the translate well that depends on

1229
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:27,230
how these things do at high density

1230
00:51:24,679 --> 00:51:31,659
which we have not measured yet so that's

1231
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:31,659
but they with its it's ongoing but yeah

1232
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:41,960
signatures of selection yeah I mean they

1233
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:44,300
yeah I didn't go into this but a lot of

1234
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:47,869
these genes come up in QTL scans or in G

1235
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:50,060
wasps studies so yeah so there is um

1236
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:52,780
there's variation that's associated with

1237
00:51:50,059 --> 00:51:57,199
yield traits all-weather selected yeah

1238
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:58,910
yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah it's an

1239
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:01,039
interesting question so these genes did

1240
00:51:58,909 --> 00:52:03,679
not come out in the doble screen right

1241
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:06,108
so doubly crossed ancient maize and

1242
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:08,569
teosinte and found major cutie ELLs five

1243
00:52:06,108 --> 00:52:11,088
major QTL so these genes are not in

1244
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:13,700
those there is one interesting gene in

1245
00:52:11,088 --> 00:52:16,130
there actually fee the maize leafy

1246
00:52:13,699 --> 00:52:18,259
homologue which he showed may be also

1247
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:20,869
involved in controlling row numbers yeah

1248
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:22,760
so I think of these genes is not in the

1249
00:52:20,869 --> 00:52:24,710
image original domestication events the

1250
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:30,320
more in improvement events the more

1251
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:33,019
recent so they they well they do not

1252
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:36,890
come up in the early data said they td1

1253
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:38,269
actually came out of work the paper

1254
00:52:36,889 --> 00:52:40,250
published last year I think in Current

1255
00:52:38,269 --> 00:52:43,460
Biology that Jeff Ross Navarro is on

1256
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:45,108
where they sequence ancient leis from

1257
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,730
these five thousand year old cobs and

1258
00:52:45,108 --> 00:52:49,429
they found that td1 was already in the

1259
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:50,869
selection notes yeah I think it's that

1260
00:52:49,429 --> 00:53:04,029
but we haven't looked to deeply

1261
00:52:50,869 --> 00:53:08,059
understand proxy for meristem size any

1262
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:12,760
examples where you see essentially more

1263
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:16,358
colonel ropes but the meristem looks

1264
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:18,970
yeah I dad yeah so we actually it

1265
00:53:16,358 --> 00:53:20,710
happens and of see Colonel size can vary

1266
00:53:18,969 --> 00:53:23,379
so you can get more rows by having

1267
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:25,809
smaller criminals we originally we

1268
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:27,550
looked at all the num founder lines and

1269
00:53:25,809 --> 00:53:30,130
tried to correlate Colonel row number

1270
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:32,500
with wearisome size and I think meristem

1271
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:34,150
size variation explained about sixty

1272
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:37,019
percent of the difference in final run

1273
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:56,608
of it so it's not it's not all of it

1274
00:53:37,019 --> 00:53:56,608
essential part of it so the Association

1275
00:53:57,059 --> 00:54:09,549
it's not you're right right yeah yeah

1276
00:54:06,909 --> 00:54:11,889
yeah yeah so the question is about this

1277
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:14,589
sort of branching receptor pathway and

1278
00:54:11,889 --> 00:54:17,828
whether the receptor interacts directly

1279
00:54:14,588 --> 00:54:21,578
with G officer so we published that

1280
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:25,170
paper in 2013 that you know the receptor

1281
00:54:21,579 --> 00:54:28,150
interacts with G alpha and then you know

1282
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:29,769
he went off and got his job and you know

1283
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:32,108
he left a lab and then another post I

1284
00:54:29,769 --> 00:54:33,250
joined and could not repeat it cuz I was

1285
00:54:32,108 --> 00:54:35,529
really would never throw a while but

1286
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:38,500
eventually come the conditions right in

1287
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:41,710
it he repeated it so it is true but we

1288
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:45,309
detect the interaction by colloid P but

1289
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:47,740
not by fret or B or C so we think

1290
00:54:45,309 --> 00:54:49,299
there's a another protein that breaches

1291
00:54:47,739 --> 00:54:51,848
that interaction and we think that is a

1292
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:53,380
receptor that we haven't yeah we haven't

1293
00:54:51,849 --> 00:55:10,869
been able to purify it yet we have a

1294
00:54:53,380 --> 00:55:13,660
kind of database um so I think maze is

1295
00:55:10,869 --> 00:55:16,480
somehow more sensitized so I think we

1296
00:55:13,659 --> 00:55:18,578
find well so we found a lot of things in

1297
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,588
a rabid OPS's that's right a maze that

1298
00:55:18,579 --> 00:55:24,440
have not been found in robots it's like

1299
00:55:20,588 --> 00:55:27,920
faithful G alpha

1300
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:29,630
they three then when we've gone back and

1301
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,579
looked more carefully in Arabidopsis we

1302
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:34,550
found the phenotypes either by making

1303
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:36,679
double mutant or yes I we haven't seen

1304
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:38,090
anything that's really obvious and I'm

1305
00:55:36,679 --> 00:55:40,549
kind of happy about this you know I I

1306
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:42,559
have this sort of friendly back and

1307
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:47,930
forth with Elliot Meyerowitz that cos

1308
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:50,809
you know he he's a bit he's not he has a

1309
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:53,059
bit of an ego I'd say so so I he'll just

1310
00:55:50,809 --> 00:55:55,579
if we find something in maze that hasn't

1311
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:57,199
been found in Arabidopsis he'll just say

1312
00:55:55,579 --> 00:55:59,539
oh well you just show that things are

1313
00:55:57,199 --> 00:56:09,349
weird inmates but but I don't think it

1314
00:55:59,539 --> 00:56:11,119
is I think they're the same this has

1315
00:56:09,349 --> 00:56:16,869
been a production of Cornell University

1316
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:16,869
on the web at Cornell edu
