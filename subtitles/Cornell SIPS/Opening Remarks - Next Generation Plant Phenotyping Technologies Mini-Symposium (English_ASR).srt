1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,309
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,309
University

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,190
so welcome my name for those of you who

4
00:00:10,548 --> 00:00:14,928
don't know me is Chris smart and I'm the

5
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:16,669
interim director of the school of

6
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:20,170
integrative plant science here at

7
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:24,080
Cornell I'm really excited to be able to

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:26,929
have everyone here today for sips first

9
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:29,329
mini symposium I hope that we can do

10
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:32,238
more of these it's really nice at this

11
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:37,909
mini symposium actually came from the

12
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:41,419
faculty Alena Adam got a Munya I tried I

13
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:43,640
had it actually went to a meeting and

14
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:47,478
came back really inspired about

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,789
high-throughput genotyping and she sort

16
00:00:47,478 --> 00:00:51,829
of started sending emails out and I

17
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:55,010
think by the time I was copied on an

18
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:58,639
email the thread had about 45 messages

19
00:00:55,009 --> 00:01:00,768
in it of faculty in ships that were all

20
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:03,970
enthusiastic about high throughput

21
00:01:00,768 --> 00:01:05,989
phenotyping and the many

22
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:09,109
multidisciplinary activities that could

23
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:11,479
come from it and and I got copied in

24
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:12,230
because someone said well you know what

25
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:18,079
can we do

26
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:21,079
and can we get funding and and so from

27
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:24,079
that this mini symposium was developed

28
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:25,730
and also a white paper that we will use

29
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,920
to try to advance high-throughput

30
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,600
phenotyping here at Cornell one of the

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,019
reasons I'm so excited about it is

32
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:34,759
because of the multidisciplinary aspect

33
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:37,340
the coolest thing to me about sips is

34
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,920
the breadth of research that we do from

35
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,840
the most basic to the most applied and I

36
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,359
think that the excitement of

37
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,880
high-throughput phenotyping really spans

38
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:49,039
all of those disciplines you know we

39
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,599
have today someone from the soil and

40
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,250
crop science section and also plant

41
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:56,299
breeding and genetics and certainly our

42
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:58,189
breeders our folks in agronomy our

43
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:00,679
driving forces for high-throughput

44
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:02,689
phenotyping but as a plant pathologist I

45
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,850
can say that you know we want better

46
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:08,840
stronger and faster ways to identify the

47
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:13,519
amount or lack of disease on plants so

48
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:16,938
it's not it's not exclusive to to those

49
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:20,400
that don't work on diseases so the other

50
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:23,009
thing that I wanted to say this morning

51
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,750
was that I'm hoping that from the talks

52
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,340
that we hear today and from the visitors

53
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,289
that we have was so excited to have you

54
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,390
here that many of us will be inspired

55
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:32,548
and will be able to continue to have

56
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:34,589
this multidisciplinary dialogue and

57
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:36,989
we've moved plant science at Cornell

58
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,930
forward but also be able to translate

59
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:42,840
what we learn here in high throughput

60
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,849
phenotyping into agriculture agriculture

61
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,250
here in New York across the country and

62
00:02:44,848 --> 00:02:48,869
around the world there are lots of lots

63
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,090
of ways that we need to support our

64
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,400
agricultural industry and I think that

65
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,769
this is a really good place to start so

66
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,639
with that I would like to introduce Mike

67
00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:01,980
Gore who is an associate professor of

68
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:04,379
plant breeding and genetics and he is

69
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:06,919
going to kick off our morning first

70
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:06,919
session

71
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:17,120
this has been a production of Cornell

72
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:17,120
University on the web at Cornell edu
