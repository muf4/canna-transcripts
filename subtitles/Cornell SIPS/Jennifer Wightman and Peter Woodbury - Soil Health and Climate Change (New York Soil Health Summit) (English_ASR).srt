00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,490
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:07,640
University

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,879
thanks Dave um Donny

4
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:14,138
Peter Woodbury and I are just

5
00:00:09,878 --> 00:00:17,359
researchers and I wanna just say um

6
00:00:14,138 --> 00:00:19,698
thanks to Dave wolf and eigen markets

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,120
for squirting us so that just the

8
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:25,760
researchers just the farmers just the

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,310
policymakers just the educators can meet

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:34,010
in a room together and come up with a

11
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:36,500
just plan um and you know climate change

12
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:39,769
I've been doing it for a while and I I

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,409
went through a period of despair and I

14
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,780
no longer have that sense there because

15
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:47,509
it is one gigantic puzzle and it's

16
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:50,989
providing us an opportunity to join

17
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:55,250
forces because soil health water quality

18
00:00:50,988 --> 00:00:58,250
and air quality are all connected to our

19
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,579
great lunches that we on that day like

20
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:07,310
today

21
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:10,400
um so theorem okay so just to frame the

22
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:13,219
talk for how far as landowners and

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,780
citizens can remote resilience thank you

24
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:19,039
the soil I'm going to give you one

25
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:21,170
example right with climate change we

26
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,860
have a longer growing season so we have

27
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,299
an opportunity for double cropping which

28
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:28,579
increases the sequestration and slows

29
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:31,280
the rate of climate change it increases

30
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:34,310
the resilience resiliency by reducing

31
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,530
erosion it reduces the impact from

32
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:39,590
extreme weather events by being able to

33
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,689
absorb extreme precipitation and it

34
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,990
increases productivity because we're

35
00:01:41,688 --> 00:01:46,728
working to which results in local and

36
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:48,798
global sustainability increasing

37
00:01:46,728 --> 00:01:52,099
knowledge and maximizing impacts for

38
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,820
future generations right this is equal

39
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:58,449
and we can see

40
00:01:54,819 --> 00:02:01,389
so just to give some context Cuomo has

41
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:04,329
an executive order 166 which has a goal

42
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,489
of 40 by 30 which is a 40 percent

43
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:09,909
reduction in 1990 levels of greenhouse

44
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:12,849
gases by 2030 and 80 by 50

45
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:16,750
that's an 80 percent reduction by 2050

46
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:20,280
all sectors right this is a huge group

47
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:24,370
effort and there's tons of program on

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,960
that there are out there to support

49
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,879
these agendas and if you haven't seen

50
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,709
some of these names look for them

51
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:32,709
because there are opportunities on the

52
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:34,810
list in there now when we talk about

53
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:37,569
greenhouse gases most people think about

54
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,789
co2 because indeed most of our

55
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:42,879
greenhouse gases conference po2 that's

56
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:44,859
the big piece of that pie but two

57
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,079
smaller pieces are methane and nitrous

58
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,090
oxide and the reason I say this is

59
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,670
because in agriculture we need to think

60
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:54,759
beyond carbon dioxide we must also

61
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:56,229
consider methane and nitrous oxide today

62
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:58,810
I will be talking a little bit about

63
00:02:56,229 --> 00:03:01,389
nitrous oxide related to nitrogen

64
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:06,879
fertilizer in the soil but methane

65
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:08,319
applies to other act practices so the

66
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,479
reason why it's important to talk about

67
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,889
these other greenhouse gases is that

68
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,250
they have different global warming

69
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:17,199
potentials and these different gases

70
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:21,039
have different impacts on the Earth's

71
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:24,849
warming and in order to compare them or

72
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:27,849
think about them we have this equation

73
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:30,129
so if co2 by definition is a global

74
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:32,979
warming potential of one and you need to

75
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:35,859
notice is that nitrous oxide is 300

76
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:41,679
times more potent of a greenhouse gas

77
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:44,230
and co2 my point being here is managing

78
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,299
nitrogen on your shield is incredibly

79
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:48,229
important right because it has that

80
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:50,360
factorial

81
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:53,359
so how do we avoid emitting greenhouse

82
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,640
gases some examples involving carbon

83
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,650
dioxide and nitrous oxide but we can

84
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:00,559
avoid producing carbon-based greenhouse

85
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,209
gases we reduce tractor passes we reduce

86
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,729
tillage we reduce synthetic nitrogen

87
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:07,370
purchase bright synthetic nitrogen is a

88
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:08,899
really energy intensive process so

89
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,390
you're reducing the fuel used at that

90
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:14,269
stage or you can avoid the greenhouse

91
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:16,310
gas impact for nitrogen processes they

92
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:18,410
reduce your synthetic nitrogen use to

93
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:21,410
reduce the field nitrous oxide emissions

94
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:25,300
and you manage your manure to also

95
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,300
reduce nitrous oxide

96
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:30,959
some ways that we can mitigate or reduce

97
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,569
greenhouse gasses that the soil is

98
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,269
sequestering the carbon dioxide in soils

99
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:39,360
in food products or other products root

100
00:04:36,269 --> 00:04:41,149
systems wood or wood products we can do

101
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,430
this through promoting vegetative cover

102
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:46,620
perennials cover crops improve faster

103
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,780
and grazing add biochars or other

104
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,629
amendments to soil increased yield by

105
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:53,818
dropping like rows of trees buffer

106
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:56,370
strips and we forest marginal lands and

107
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:58,830
manager with lakhs to increase the

108
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:01,050
carbon in both the trees and in this

109
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:02,609
plan

110
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,288
one of the important things though when

111
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,240
thinking about carbon sequestration

112
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:08,579
particularly with soils is this concept

113
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,228
of permanence for carbon sequestration

114
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:12,449
to have a meaningful impact on the

115
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:14,550
atmosphere it's necessary to ensure that

116
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:17,970
the carbon and millions equestrians not

117
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,829
released to the atmosphere though years

118
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:22,379
of carbon buildup thanks was can be

119
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:26,158
released back to the atmosphere and the

120
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:28,199
very short period of time so the point

121
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:31,259
here is some strategies are permanent

122
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,580
and others are not so much but all of

123
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,830
the soil health strategies we've been

124
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:38,370
talking about today are important for

125
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:41,579
productivity right so we're just some

126
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,199
things are better and applicable to

127
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:46,529
mitigating climate change and others in

128
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,680
the right

129
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:51,839
so just to summarize conserve or improve

130
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,400
vegetative covers so we can protect

131
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:57,329
agriculture and forest lands from

132
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:59,069
development defense we move toward slow

133
00:05:57,329 --> 00:06:00,509
sequestration mechanisms including

134
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:03,269
perennials double crops

135
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:05,789
cover crops reduced tillage biochar and

136
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:09,509
improved reasoning why do we do that

137
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:11,520
these practices sequester kerbin they

138
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:15,288
improve productivity they reduce erosion

139
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:18,408
improve water quality and improve swing

140
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:20,509
improve nutrient management we reduce

141
00:06:18,408 --> 00:06:22,728
the synthetic nitrogen consumption to

142
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:24,919
reduce the upstream emissions from

143
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:26,418
producing that and this is both for

144
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:30,649
agriculture lands but also for

145
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:33,258
landscapers right yards mmm management

146
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:35,619
or and synthetic nitrogen on the field

147
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:38,689
to reduce field nitrous oxide emissions

148
00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:40,490
why do we do this they remove emissions

149
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:43,069
from fertilizer manufacturing they

150
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:47,468
improve profitability they improve water

151
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:47,468
quality improve air quality and improve

152
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:54,168
improve forest management so more than

153
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:59,660
60% of our state soil is forested and

154
00:06:54,168 --> 00:07:03,409
30% is on AG land 30% of a ground is

155
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:07,370
wooded so Farms can manage their wood

156
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:09,860
Lots on why these practices sequester

157
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,629
carbon in tree trunks soil profitable

158
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:16,509
long-lived wood products reduce erosion

159
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:18,860
improve water quality air quality so

160
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:22,819
improve soil health reduces greenhouse

161
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:25,340
gases so as farms increased soil carbon

162
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:27,319
that increase creases the soil health

163
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:29,719
the crop productivity the water

164
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:32,930
infiltration and retention and can also

165
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,630
sequester's carbon in the soil and being

166
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,840
the products that we want to feel these

167
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:41,529
mechanisms include tillage practices

168
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:44,719
amendments annual vs. perennial crops

169
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:46,929
cover crops double crepes and this one

170
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,660
marginal ends

171
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:52,030
now how do we do it I'm just going to

172
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,860
say that there are lots of opportunities

173
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:55,689
out there and we need to start

174
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,650
leveraging these opportunities for these

175
00:07:55,689 --> 00:08:01,990
multiple benefits so there are climate

176
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:05,620
smart community grants that are due July

177
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:07,569
27th for municipalities and the projects

178
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,090
include but are not limited to reduction

179
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:12,219
of future flood risks so for

180
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:15,179
implementation of municipal food waste

181
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,800
and composting programs right so there's

182
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,740
some work there there's trees for

183
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,939
tributaries this is a application that's

184
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:28,910
due in September for planting trees

185
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:33,299
along waterways as buffer strips - for

186
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:36,320
nutrient benefit but also it has a time

187
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,319
and change mitigating

188
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:41,919
in February of 2018 and possibly in have

189
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:45,129
year of 2019 the climate-resilient

190
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:49,419
farming allocates two million dollars

191
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:52,149
available and it covers 75% of the cost

192
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:54,459
and his money is for agricultural waste

193
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:56,559
storage cover entire systems riparian

194
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:59,530
buffer system stream corridor gene

195
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:03,219
control rotational grazing and soil

196
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:05,860
conservation systems and on the horizon

197
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:09,730
the climate action reserve which is a

198
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:12,850
carbon trading reserve is revising their

199
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:15,879
nitrogen management credits I and those

200
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:20,279
should be coming out student has another

201
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:22,409
way to fund nitrogen management on your

202
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:25,178
bakery

203
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:26,738
future needs we need assessments to

204
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:30,639
better quantify the financial

205
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:32,920
environmental benefits and costs we need

206
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,959
to promote the best management practices

207
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:37,838
that we're already doing but also

208
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,789
include greenhouse gas mitigation for

209
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,119
climate change adaptation and long-term

210
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:45,188
resiliency and we need to create some

211
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:47,739
policies to provide science-based

212
00:09:45,188 --> 00:09:50,849
information to policymakers as they

213
00:09:47,739 --> 00:09:54,009
negotiate a multitude of societal needs

214
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:56,319
and I guess what I would like to do is

215
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:59,048
open it up for questions or comments

216
00:09:56,318 --> 00:10:01,448
particularly on how we can think about

217
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:05,249
taking climate change into the next

218
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:05,248
generation of our work

219
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:20,780
this has been a production of Cornell

220
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:20,779
University on the web at Cornell edu
