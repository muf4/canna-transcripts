1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,919
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:05,918
university

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,559
hi all right i'm setting my timer for 30

4
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,839
minutes so that i'm

5
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:17,039
sure that i have enough time for us to

6
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:20,399
to chat afterwards and we'll see

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,920
how how quickly i flow through so

8
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:25,598
um when i sat back to think about what

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,519
we would talk about today

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,359
um i realized that the past five years

11
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,280
have been

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,800
sort of a stream of consciousness we

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,399
keep trying new things

14
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:42,078
and spreading out and branching and

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,039
um my my goal for the day

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,558
is to take you on this journey uh with

17
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,200
us that we've gone on

18
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,479
and at any point if you have a question

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,480
feel free to

20
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,159
throw it in the chat so that you don't

21
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,799
forget it and then maybe we can

22
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,000
talk about it at the end but if um if

23
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:59,839
you need clarification

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,039
if i'm going too fast if i'm using an

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,600
acronym that

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,558
um isn't familiar to everybody then by

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,920
all means

28
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:11,759
um feel free to shout out and

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,680
and stop me as i'm going um

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,040
this is essentially going to be

31
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,439
storytelling time for

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,680
uh for all intensive purposes i'm going

33
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:25,118
to throw a whole lot of pictures at you

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,960
and just uh describe what we've learned

35
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:30,799
as we went along i haven't

36
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,118
been involved with a lot of the

37
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,920
horticultural production until

38
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:38,078
really i would say this past year um

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,280
that's more my colleague kelly hennigan

40
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,798
but we

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,799
work as a team and so um

42
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,240
i'll let you know a bit about what we've

43
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,280
done and and

44
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:52,798
where we've come so uh

45
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,159
let's begin all right let's see if my

46
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,719
computer is gonna

47
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,000
cooperate with us there we go when i

48
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:01,599
first went to write

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,759
this uh presentation i set up the slides

50
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,919
for each of the years and i realized

51
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,800
about 15 minutes into it that i was off

52
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,479
by 20 years that i had written 199

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,080
1996 1997 98 99 and 2000

54
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:17,919
so apparently i'm stuck in the 1990s but

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,879
then i fixed it and realized oh no we

56
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:23,839
started growing in 2016 not 1996.

57
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,318
so that was our inaugural hemp crop and

58
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,598
um

59
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,318
we were partners with jd farm and at

60
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,839
their

61
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:35,199
farm we grew 30 acres so our our

62
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,039
goal was really we thought that brain

63
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,479
was going to be the low-hanging fruit so

64
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:39,759
we were going to focus on grain

65
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,759
production

66
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,959
that we don't really know so much about

67
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,759
grain production

68
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,519
when it comes to an organic farm and jd

69
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:51,039
farm is an organic farm

70
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,200
so our research focus was looking at

71
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,799
can we meet the nutrient requirements

72
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:58,000
for this crop

73
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,879
using different combinations of manures

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,280
and we figured we would just compare

75
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:07,039
yield between them as our first go

76
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,039
and see how we did um

77
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,318
that it was the craziest year for

78
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,239
importing

79
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,158
seed it was the first time around we had

80
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,439
no idea what we were doing

81
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,878
getting the seed took way longer than we

82
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,800
thought it was going to

83
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,399
the shipping company when they figured

84
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,360
out what they were shipping

85
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,319
um so they they we ordered our seed from

86
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,159
canada

87
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,919
and um it almost made it to us it made

88
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,759
it to syracuse and then the shipping

89
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,598
company realized what they were shipping

90
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,878
and wouldn't take it

91
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:44,399
a foot further and so i had a drive

92
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:47,518
to syracuse with police escort

93
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,400
um to pick up the seed sign for it

94
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,000
and and drive it back and then we had to

95
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,519
have

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,840
police watch um the seed

97
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,200
so that none of it was stolen between

98
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,920
the time when

99
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,438
we perched or received it until the time

100
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:07,839
it got in the ground

101
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:09,919
um and so that was crazy

102
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,280
so we didn't get planted until july 4th

103
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,518
so year one was

104
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,079
what we thought was a late start we

105
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,120
didn't get planted until july 4th

106
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,560
and we hired a local grain farmer to

107
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,478
custom harvest for us

108
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,478
we had no idea what we were doing it was

109
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,159
a really steep learning curve they had

110
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,719
no idea what they were doing

111
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,000
so we figured let's all learn together

112
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,680
um

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,600
and um being the the first

114
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,519
crop everybody wanted to get in on

115
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,960
pictures so even though we planted

116
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:42,959
with uh um let's get a

117
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:50,319
as you can see here um this is

118
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:53,439
uh dan dolgen and mark just

119
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,120
from jd farm they and we were all

120
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,600
planted a few this is me and my kids

121
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,478
we all planted a few seeds by hand uh

122
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,039
this was the

123
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:01,839
the truck we had to go pick up the seat

124
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,120
on

125
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:08,560
uh and and the police escorted back

126
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,639
so it was quite an exciting time um and

127
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,839
even though our research question was

128
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,199
all about nutrients

129
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,599
we learned a little bit about pest

130
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,038
pressure in that first year we learned a

131
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,759
whole lot about

132
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,800
uh weeds and that although we were

133
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,560
hearing lots of

134
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,639
people in the surrounding communities

135
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,199
talk about

136
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,560
they were concerned that cannabis sativa

137
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,879
would become the next

138
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,319
major field crop weed what we were

139
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,879
learning was that

140
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,240
this plant cannot out-compete our wheat

141
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,879
species

142
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,240
we had heard horror stories from

143
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,719
kentucky about

144
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,000
how devastating japanese beetles could

145
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,520
be

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,360
um and so uh we were really nervous

147
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,279
when we started to see some japanese

148
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,240
beetles on our plants but what we

149
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,279
realized

150
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:59,439
was that they were mostly uh

151
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:02,318
hanging out on the male flowers and

152
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:04,319
a little bit the weed species in the

153
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,240
field were acting as trap crops because

154
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,919
they were preferring being on the

155
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,360
pigweed around the hemp than they were

156
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,478
on the hemp

157
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,000
um so that was sort of interesting we

158
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:14,639
started learning a little bit about seed

159
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,399
production

160
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,240
and we saw uh that

161
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,359
what it meant for this crop to be

162
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:27,199
indeterminate and the fact that we have

163
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,879
our seed maturing unevenly throughout

164
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,280
the plant

165
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,959
this first year we had so many people

166
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:36,559
want to come visit the fields

167
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:40,159
and take pictures i think everybody

168
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,399
uh we had horticultural classes we had

169
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,520
ag classes we had administrators

170
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:45,758
everyone wanted to come and take a

171
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,318
selfie in the hemp fields

172
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,280
um right and so here we can see the

173
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,439
unevenness

174
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,198
of grain production we're up the top

175
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,839
here you can see that seeds are

176
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,560
are brown and drying out and um and at

177
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,598
the bottom

178
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,199
right they're still green and the

179
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,319
thought the first year

180
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,680
was oh well

181
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,680
if we're going to treat this like other

182
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,519
grain crops when we harvest our other

183
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,199
grain crops we wait for the seed to dry

184
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,198
out so we were waiting for our seed to

185
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,598
dry before we came through and harvested

186
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,478
um and another piece of this picture you

187
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:18,879
can see

188
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,839
the lamb's quarter here along the side

189
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,279
and next to it

190
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,478
that is uh easily as tall as the hemp

191
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,198
plants that were

192
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:27,199
in this field

193
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,000
so uh so in year one we learned a lot

194
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,959
about crop

195
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,879
variability on the left hand side is a

196
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,399
picture of me standing up looking down

197
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,800
at the crop so that's probably about

198
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,159
up to my knee on the right hand side is

199
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,720
me stretching my arm

200
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,199
up to reach the the crop and so maybe

201
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,319
that's

202
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,598
i don't know i'm five foot three and a

203
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,879
half on a good day

204
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:55,038
so maybe that's almost five foot

205
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,080
ten right not quite a six foot crop

206
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,439
there

207
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,800
um but we saw a whole lot of variability

208
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:04,000
in terms of height

209
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,120
in terms of the size of the seed head um

210
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,240
and in terms of the thickness of our

211
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,000
stock

212
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:15,759
so what we learned in um this first year

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,519
had a lot to do with what we didn't know

214
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,280
and that's to be expected right it's the

215
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,918
first time we'd ever grown this crop

216
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:24,318
um it was really exciting to learn how

217
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,560
many things we didn't know because

218
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,080
from a research perspective that just

219
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,199
makes you say hey what can we ask

220
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,639
questions about and

221
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,959
we figure that means that we're going to

222
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,959
be busy for the next

223
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,079
couple of years right it gives us

224
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:40,718
something to work on

225
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:44,080
right so here this was a field that was

226
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:48,000
divided into quadrants a a

227
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:52,839
there were there was half that had

228
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:56,320
um big bedded pack half that had

229
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:59,680
um beef

230
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,320
bedded pack manure and then um

231
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:04,079
one side had poultry litter added it too

232
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,720
so we were looking at combinations of

233
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,080
manures there

234
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,720
um but really we couldn't compare the

235
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,680
data

236
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,080
in these quadrants the yields because

237
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,559
the

238
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,000
weed pressure was so great that any

239
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,759
differences that we saw

240
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,360
were mostly because of the differences

241
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,080
in types of weeds that we saw on the

242
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,320
field there

243
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,920
but it was it was a learning experience

244
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,920
and fun to harvest that way anyway

245
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:34,879
okay come on any second now there we go

246
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:36,399
so year two in year two we said okay

247
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:38,559
we're focusing on green

248
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,600
or maybe we can figure out a dual

249
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,278
purpose for

250
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:46,879
using the the fiber here um we wanted

251
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:49,039
to to dial in our our nitrogen rates

252
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,000
and so we were starting a small plot

253
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:51,599
study on campus

254
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,919
and when i say small it was like a

255
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,440
quarter of an acre a really small plot

256
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,519
study on campus to do

257
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,880
in collaboration with what we were doing

258
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,159
with jd farm we were sort of

259
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:06,159
creating our grows the state had now

260
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:10,078
allowed farms to have their own permits

261
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:12,719
but then in

262
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:13,199
late may early june the governor pushed

263
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,240
to

264
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,640
have even more acres in production and

265
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,200
so

266
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:24,159
we threw 40 acres in on campus

267
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,959
that wasn't our original intention and

268
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,000
so

269
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,838
this was our opportunity to try out a

270
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,278
couple of different varieties

271
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,440
and really just get it growing because

272
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:37,278
trying to get seed that late in the game

273
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,760
we ended up not planting until

274
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,519
somewhere around july 20th right if you

275
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,240
remember the first year we planted july

276
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,200
4th

277
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,639
um july 20th was when we got those extra

278
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,000
acres in the ground and so it was a

279
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,278
little bit crazy

280
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,839
um and we hired that same

281
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,559
local grain farmer to to custom harvest

282
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,120
for us

283
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,879
um other than the this small quarter

284
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,959
acre of plots which

285
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:05,200
um i like to say my my darling slave

286
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:08,159
labor otherwise known as my students

287
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,120
uh you know you get a good grade for

288
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,199
putting in some

289
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,720
blood sweat and tears and so they were

290
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,959
in charge of doing

291
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,720
all of the hand harvesting of my plots

292
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:20,239
and separating out the grain

293
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,399
from from those plots i love them dearly

294
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,799
for all their hard work

295
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,039
so things that we learned hemp doesn't

296
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,240
like poorly drained or excessively wet

297
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:32,240
soil that was

298
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,959
the banner uh description of year number

299
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,320
two

300
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:38,239
um if you have poorly drained soil you

301
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,879
have poorly established hemp

302
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,000
we tried over and over and over to

303
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:45,360
establish in

304
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,278
june of that year our uh small quarter

305
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,000
acre trials we had to plant it three

306
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:50,078
times

307
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,278
because of how wet it was this is a

308
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:53,199
field where

309
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,679
you can see where it dries out on this

310
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,879
line the entire field was planted

311
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:02,159
but all of the field in the wet area

312
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:04,799
did not emerge so um

313
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,519
and you can see here there's the uh sort

314
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:09,278
of a lake

315
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,320
in the middle of this field june 2018

316
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:14,320
was really

317
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:17,600
wet right so um hemp does not

318
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:21,440
like poorly drained or

319
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:24,879
excessively wet soil um

320
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,880
and these are the the the the quarter

321
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,159
acre trial plots you can see the flags

322
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,679
are this is this would have been the

323
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,439
plot

324
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,120
that we just had to keep trying and keep

325
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,480
trying and keep trying to establish

326
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,879
because there was

327
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:42,800
so much water that was sad

328
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:44,720
um and uh you got to see my

329
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,799
kids in the first year this is my son

330
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,399
the second year i like to

331
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,919
show them and you can see the

332
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,360
progression of how they've

333
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,199
they've grown along with the crops

334
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,879
growing right so this is

335
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,720
the field where we were supposed to be

336
00:12:54,879 --> 00:13:00,480
going through and counting emergence

337
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,000
and um instead we were just trying to

338
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,399
decide when we were going to try and

339
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,480
replant again because it was so

340
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:10,799
wet so um

341
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,079
july 7th was the third time that we

342
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:13,599
planted there and then

343
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:16,078
again two weeks later was when we

344
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,680
planted the rest of our fields on campus

345
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:19,039
which we decided it wasn't worth doing a

346
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:20,159
nitrogen rate trial because it was too

347
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:21,679
late we didn't even think we were going

348
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:24,240
to get a crop

349
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,599
um so some of the things that we learned

350
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,480
uh

351
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,680
this this year the second year was we

352
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,720
learned a bit about

353
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:36,479
a fusion we learned a bit about

354
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,720
white mold we saw that

355
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,480
there are definitely pests in our area

356
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,399
that are going to impact the crop

357
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:47,839
we saw that if hemp emerges

358
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,720
after a weed species that it can't

359
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,360
out-compete

360
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,680
but if the hemp emerges before a weed

361
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,399
species and is able to establish

362
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:58,319
then it does a whole lot better at

363
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,198
managing weed competition

364
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,160
um we saw lots more variability so these

365
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:05,679
two pictures

366
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:08,319
are the same field where

367
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,958
this student is about my height and the

368
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,600
crop

369
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:16,479
is uh up to her shoulders whereas

370
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,120
a hundred yards away in that same field

371
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,920
uh

372
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,120
the the crop is uh this student is a

373
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:25,039
little bit taller than me

374
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,039
but is up to her waist so um

375
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,078
we're seeing just so much variability

376
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,519
here and then this

377
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:33,198
is the field next to this one

378
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,959
and even though this picture is taken a

379
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:38,078
month later you're not getting

380
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:40,399
um much more growth after

381
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,599
uh flower establishment and so the fact

382
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,600
that this student is

383
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,720
six foot one so the fact that we have

384
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,519
this tremendous

385
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,440
growth here right it shows us how much

386
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,720
variability there is within the crop

387
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,680
it shows us how much um

388
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,879
breeding work there is to be done um to

389
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,039
pick out the traits that are going to

390
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,799
help us get

391
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,399
whether or not we want a shorter crop

392
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,679
for grain production or a taller crop

393
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,440
for fiber production

394
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:08,479
right that we we need to see what are

395
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,560
the ways that genetics can influence

396
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,320
crop production versus what are the

397
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:15,679
environmental influences of

398
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,720
of production so many questions to ask

399
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:20,559
right every every semester or every year

400
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,000
of a growing season we would just find

401
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,599
out so many more questions that we would

402
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,919
set out to answer one thing and then

403
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,360
find 15 more questions that were like oh

404
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,278
well before we can answer this we need

405
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,800
to know these things

406
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:36,480
um we we did a little bit of work

407
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:38,879
on um of indoor grows looking at

408
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,959
um microgreens it was sort of

409
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:43,360
interesting um

410
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:45,278
you know there there is this push for

411
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,560
extracts production but at the same time

412
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,879
we thought well

413
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,159
what are some other horticultural uh

414
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:54,559
ways of growing this crop

415
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:57,519
and um can a hemp micro green

416
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,559
compete in the micro greens market one

417
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,000
of the things that we

418
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:04,078
found was that while its taste and

419
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,198
palatability were really great

420
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:11,679
um we couldn't compete

421
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:13,838
with california right there's a reason

422
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,599
that the majority of microgreens are

423
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,600
grown in large-scale horticultural

424
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,480
production and not in small

425
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,278
boutique farms it's just too expensive

426
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,360
um

427
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,198
so we realized you know growing for

428
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,199
extracts is not the only horticultural

429
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:30,479
hemp crop growing from microgreens

430
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:33,838
was um really successful their

431
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,120
uh baby farms had a

432
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,680
a line of microgreens in

433
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,320
uh whole foods in the city for a while

434
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,879
um

435
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,399
i believe they've stopped doing that now

436
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:44,958
mostly because it's just too hard to

437
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,159
keep up

438
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:50,638
with the the cost of it

439
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:51,679
um okay that brings us to year three

440
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,959
2018.

441
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,399
in 2018 we grew a little bit and started

442
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,599
taking on partner

443
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:02,639
farms uh around the state and um

444
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,360
expanding our nitrogen trials so we

445
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,640
really were

446
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,318
focusing mainly on grain production with

447
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,240
a little bit of fiber in there but

448
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:14,558
mainly grain production

449
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:17,599
um and uh just nitrogen rates

450
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:19,279
um for answering the questions of

451
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,318
nutrient management we really weren't

452
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,078
trying to answer

453
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:23,438
questions for phosphorus and potassium

454
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:24,639
quite yet we're just focusing on

455
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,839
nitrogen

456
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,200
um there was a whole lot of drought in

457
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,558
june that year

458
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,720
and then it got really cold

459
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:36,079
and august through october were super

460
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,600
wet so the

461
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:39,439
combination of those things made the

462
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:43,038
growing season a little bit difficult

463
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,798
um we hired that same local uh grain

464
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,879
farmer to come harvest for us but that

465
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:50,000
was the last time that we did that

466
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,000
because we realized that um we were

467
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,720
trying to fit a square peg into a round

468
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,160
hole

469
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,759
you hear a lot of people talk about

470
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,759
horror stories about

471
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:04,879
harvesting uh hemp for grain

472
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:08,000
think the problem is more trying to use

473
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:12,080
something outfitted for soybeans

474
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:16,000
for hemp or something outfitted for

475
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:18,000
wheat for him if we took

476
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,679
something outfitted for soybeans and

477
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,319
tried to harvest corn

478
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,880
we'd destroy the machine it would be

479
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:24,558
awful

480
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,080
right nothing good would come of that

481
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:28,558
and it's the same thing

482
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,599
that the issue isn't the crop the issue

483
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,879
is that we don't

484
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:36,558
have the equipment specified

485
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,240
to the crop that we're trying to harvest

486
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,160
now over the years we've gotten better

487
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,160
at that and what we found was that this

488
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,120
farmer that was harvesting for us wasn't

489
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,720
willing to

490
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:46,558
sort of learn from the things that we

491
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,200
were learning and

492
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,639
um if you always do what you've always

493
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,319
done you'll always get what you always

494
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,960
got and so he was getting

495
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,960
angrier and angrier at the hemp harvest

496
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,679
and we were getting angrier and angrier

497
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,880
that

498
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,919
uh we that what we were learning wasn't

499
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,080
being implemented

500
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,080
and so putting those two things together

501
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,558
we said it is time for us to get

502
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,279
our own combine because we need to show

503
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:13,519
folks

504
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:14,558
that um this isn't as horrible as it

505
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,200
sounds

506
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,720
one of the biggest problems with the

507
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,160
hemp industry

508
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,360
i'll say in new york state but it

509
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,480
probably applies elsewhere

510
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:28,879
is lack of good information

511
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,640
and more than lack of good information

512
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,400
um

513
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,960
prevalence of bad information

514
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,320
so you have all these people telling

515
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,160
stories about terrible things that

516
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,798
happened and scaring folks off who say

517
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,320
well i don't

518
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,480
i have enough problems i don't need that

519
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,319
on my plate instead of saying oh no no

520
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,759
look we're learning how to do this

521
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,038
better and since we're learning how to

522
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:50,400
do this better look now is the time to

523
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:53,679
get involved so

524
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,240
we need to counteract the storyline of

525
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,880
hemp is nothing but a problem child

526
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,359
right but in 2018 that was our last year

527
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,440
of

528
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,199
of working with that out of the farmer

529
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,080
um these are some of the nitrogen rates

530
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,519
that we set up

531
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,240
we were looking to see um how does

532
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,279
nitrogen

533
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,000
impact growth and what is

534
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:16,079
the the best nitrogen rate for this crop

535
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,119
um

536
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:22,879
one of the things that we found was

537
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:25,918
with poor uh nutrient

538
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:29,200
availability um and this

539
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,080
i guess makes perfect sense uh our crop

540
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,279
isn't able

541
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:35,519
to combat weeds and so in our zero

542
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,359
nitrogen rates and in our 50 pound

543
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,359
nitrogen rates although not so much in

544
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:41,519
this field because

545
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:42,479
there is leaching from the strips around

546
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:46,158
it but

547
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,319
certainly over here um we saw horrible

548
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,559
weed pressure that we just didn't see in

549
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:54,000
the rest of the field and so

550
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:57,440
the balance of ensuring proper

551
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,919
uh fertility will make sure that our

552
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,480
crop

553
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:03,280
can then out-compete the the species the

554
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,640
weed species that are there

555
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:09,359
we started dabbling in ndvi imaging

556
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,720
and it was really interesting for us our

557
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:15,359
goal was to see

558
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:18,880
if ndvi imaging could be used for

559
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,000
determining if nitrogen applications are

560
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,039
necessary

561
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,919
um and so here after looking at that

562
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,440
previous map

563
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:30,159
you can see our our low rates right our

564
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,080
lower rates here and our low rates here

565
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,840
and then our high rates in between right

566
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,720
the more green the more foliage there is

567
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:38,879
the more red

568
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:42,240
the more brown or um

569
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,880
uh uh soil is being reflected black

570
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,159
back excuse me so here this is at the

571
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,679
end of july

572
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,919
now here we're looking at october 5th

573
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,919
um

574
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:00,400
ndvi is normalized a

575
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:03,678
different vegetative index

576
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,679
and what it means is you're taking an

577
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:09,200
infrared image

578
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:11,919
and that the amount

579
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,720
of of infrared light that's reflected

580
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,200
back

581
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,558
so this is essentially a scale that

582
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,159
shows you how much

583
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:23,599
is being reflected back um if

584
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,679
there's a lot of

585
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:27,279
light being reflected back in me that's

586
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,280
not being absorbed

587
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,558
so that means that there's no plant

588
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:34,720
material there

589
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:37,038
and so that those redder areas are the

590
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,240
lots as being reflected that black

591
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,038
reflected

592
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,159
back the green areas is lots more

593
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:45,119
absorption

594
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,280
and the yellow is the scale in between

595
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:50,158
the green and the red

596
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:51,119
um so what was really interesting for us

597
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,919
is that

598
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,678
is the difference between the july image

599
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,200
and the october image

600
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,480
right you sort of you can still see

601
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,679
those strips a little bit but you've

602
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,919
sort of lost it

603
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,360
and the reason you've lost it is because

604
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,320
as the

605
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,599
seeds mature they're brown and so

606
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,480
they're going to be reflecting that

607
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,079
light back

608
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,240
but then we started thinking oh well

609
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,960
maybe this imaging isn't just

610
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,279
useful for nutrient management maybe

611
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,440
this

612
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:18,399
imaging might be useful for harvest

613
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,759
readiness

614
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,400
this was a a thought we had there right

615
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:24,558
again

616
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,360
every time we try and set out to answer

617
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:30,079
a question we get six more new ones

618
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:30,959
um and the other thing that was really

619
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,399
interesting

620
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,200
was uh in this field the left side of

621
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,080
the field

622
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,120
was one variety and the right side of

623
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:42,639
the field was

624
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:45,678
the other variety so um i actually

625
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,278
wrote it backwards this is the felina 32

626
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,798
side and this is the

627
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:52,640
uh anka side and so at the

628
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:53,918
end of june there was very little that

629
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,400
was established

630
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,400
um by the end of july we really see a

631
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,159
strong difference between these

632
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:05,038
these two um

633
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,720
varieties and then in the october image

634
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:08,879
again we can't see it anymore as we're

635
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,480
ready for the harvest readiness

636
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,278
um this field didn't get harvested there

637
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,839
was

638
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:21,440
so much moisture in the

639
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:22,879
um the later part of the summer and

640
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,400
early part of the fall

641
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:30,320
that um coordinating with

642
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:32,960
our uh person to come harvest

643
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:34,399
um we were sort of the end of the

644
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,919
importance list

645
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:41,278
um i'm being very diplomatic about this

646
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:44,559
and uh and therefore our crop

647
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:48,079
didn't get harvested on time um

648
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:50,960
and at the end of september

649
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:51,918
there was let's see if that's gonna let

650
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,759
me

651
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:57,919
i think i need to get back to my pointer

652
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:59,119
to be able there we go so at the end of

653
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,759
september

654
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,719
there was this horrible windstorm and

655
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:06,879
the crop was

656
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,880
more than ready to be harvested

657
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:14,558
so all of that shaking and all of that

658
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:16,558
wind

659
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,960
essentially put all of our seed on the

660
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,960
ground

661
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,319
so when um when

662
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:26,798
the farmer came to harvest this field

663
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:29,918
and

664
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,599
instead of getting between probably

665
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,840
seven and eight hundred pounds of grain

666
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:35,519
per acre in this field he was getting 80

667
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:37,918
pounds of grain per acre

668
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,599
he just gave up and said it's not worth

669
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,840
your time it's not worth my time i'm not

670
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:44,639
gonna do it

671
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:46,399
so um that field didn't end up getting

672
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,240
harvested and so we weren't able to

673
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,679
compare the yield results between those

674
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,798
two varieties which would have been

675
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,080
really lovely

676
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:56,240
but what we did see was the importance

677
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:57,278
of harvesting on time and we learned

678
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,038
that the harvest

679
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:04,159
window for hemp is really narrow um

680
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:06,558
once that seed starts to dry out it

681
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:10,080
really falls off really quickly

682
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:11,839
and so um harvest readiness

683
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,918
is an incredibly important

684
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:16,480
characteristic to pay attention to

685
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,000
when we're dealing with grain when we're

686
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,440
dealing with fiber as well i guess when

687
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
we're dealing with extract as well

688
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,679
by knowing that window is really

689
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,759
important

690
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:30,960
okay so um we we harvested the fiber

691
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:34,558
with a sickle bar mower and

692
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:38,079
um as you can see here

693
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:41,519
uh we were on the slope a little bit

694
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:42,079
and there was wind and the the fiber was

695
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,278
falling

696
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:47,119
into the standing crop there so my job

697
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:49,919
was to follow the sickle bar and take

698
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:52,719
arm fulls of the fiber and toss it

699
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,360
so that um we can come through and get

700
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,720
the

701
00:26:53,359 --> 00:27:00,879
the next um

702
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,880
big swath cut um

703
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,239
that was more exercise than i think i've

704
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,600
ever gotten in my life

705
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,960
and at the very end of it when there was

706
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:12,000
just one armful

707
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,440
left um there was a surprise waiting for

708
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,079
us in the field there was

709
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,798
a skunk who had just walked out of its

710
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,199
little hole

711
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,079
and you know surprise saw us turn around

712
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,759
lifted its

713
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:23,519
tail and so i had just been throwing

714
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:27,119
these huge piles

715
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:28,079
of uh hemp so that we can come through

716
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,879
and cut and

717
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,839
um if nothing else that was a study on

718
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,240
the

719
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:35,918
benefit of adrenaline because i sprinted

720
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,200
across that field faster than i've ever

721
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,240
run in my life

722
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,038
um and the uh skunk

723
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,120
got the sickle bar but nothing else and

724
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:47,119
the skunk's tail is in that field and

725
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:48,239
i've been told that that tail was then

726
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,398
collected

727
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,319
and preserved but i still haven't seen

728
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:55,038
it um

729
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:57,038
so this was our first year of actually

730
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:59,759
harvesting for fiber though

731
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:00,480
and and we were learning a little bit

732
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:02,079
about it

733
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,839
one of the things that we did after that

734
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:05,759
was add this little

735
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,359
triangle to the end of the sickle bar to

736
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:09,038
make sure the fiber tips in the right

737
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:12,398
direction and doesn't fall

738
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:14,000
on the crop before it right so all of

739
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:16,000
this had to be

740
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
um picked up and thrown so that we can

741
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,278
continue to go through the field

742
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,759
um and then we let it rhett in the field

743
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:25,359
and raked it with a rotary rake and then

744
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:30,720
came through and round baled it

745
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:34,158
and we were looking for um dumbness

746
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,960
so totally different uh focus than with

747
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,480
our

748
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,798
our grain here we want to see the

749
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,000
bass fibers starting to pull away from

750
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,158
the herd

751
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,679
and we want an evenness in color we

752
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,720
don't want too much

753
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:52,080
of um this

754
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,480
dark black here with this light

755
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:56,158
here right we want that it to be much

756
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,399
more even there but this was our first

757
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,360
year and our first go-round at it

758
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:02,639
um our first trial of writing in the

759
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,599
field

760
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,720
so in 2019 we were set to do that better

761
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:08,480
um

762
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,839
and decided that we were really going to

763
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,640
split our acres

764
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,359
of half grain and half fiber and then

765
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,520
we've also

766
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:18,479
um been hearing a lot about can we do a

767
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,839
dual purpose

768
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,120
with extracts right do we have to do

769
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:25,278
our extracts production in a

770
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,719
horticultural style or can we do it in

771
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:29,200
the field crop style which is sort of

772
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,640
how they do it more commonly in europe

773
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,880
we tried uh a study of that um

774
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,679
and our horticulture department did our

775
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,880
our first

776
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:42,080
outdoor uh grow for

777
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,440
um our high cbd varieties

778
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:45,519
so we're again focusing on those

779
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,720
nitrogen rate trials focusing on

780
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:52,798
organic versus inorganic amendments

781
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,798
um and uh

782
00:29:53,038 --> 00:30:00,240
oops that was 2018's drought for 20 so

783
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:02,798
what happened to 2019 weather-wise

784
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,359
thick 2019 was an okay growing season i

785
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:06,720
all i

786
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:07,038
i don't remember right now how can that

787
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,839
be

788
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:09,839
20 minutes already

789
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,879
all right now i know i have 10 minutes

790
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,798
left um

791
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:23,840
and so uh that year we found ourselves

792
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:23,839
a uh 1970

793
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,960
international combine and uh it took us

794
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:30,639
a little while to get it on hand so we

795
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,440
harvested a little bit later than we

796
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
wanted to

797
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,558
um so we ended up doing a bit of

798
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,600
harvesting by hand just to be able to

799
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:39,519
compare our nitrogen rate trials it was

800
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:42,558
really exciting for us to have

801
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:43,679
a combine of our own and be able to show

802
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:47,839
that

803
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:51,519
um this was going to be

804
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:54,240
a successful crop um and so

805
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:54,798
we did a a little bit different this

806
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,558
year

807
00:30:54,798 --> 00:31:00,879
we had fewer uh nitrogen rates

808
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:02,798
that we did in strips in one field and

809
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,919
then in the field across from it

810
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:08,720
um all four quadrants

811
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,000
uh received manure in the winter and

812
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,120
early spring

813
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,119
and then a and b were

814
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:20,398
top dressed at our medium rate

815
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:22,398
as our inorganic field across the the

816
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:24,398
way from it was to see if that

817
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:25,599
combination of organic and inorganic

818
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:27,599
amendments was

819
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:28,719
uh better than just the organic

820
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:32,398
amendments

821
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:36,159
um and so

822
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:38,239
we also had a and d were

823
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,200
one variety and b and c were another

824
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,278
variety

825
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,360
because we're seeing really large

826
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:46,798
differences between varieties

827
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:48,959
um and so that this is the the way that

828
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:50,720
that map was was set up there so i'm

829
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,000
going to show you a couple of ndvi

830
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,079
images now of that

831
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,720
um we also um

832
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:00,558
we we do reduce tillage not really

833
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,360
no-till we run an airway through some of

834
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:03,440
our fields

835
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:05,038
and so there's lots of cover on the

836
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,080
ground and

837
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:10,798
um what we were finding was that if

838
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:11,519
there's far too much cover on the ground

839
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:15,119
you get

840
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:17,759
really poor emergence but with just

841
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:19,599
a a moderate amount of cover on the

842
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:20,879
ground our emergence was no different

843
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:24,798
than if our

844
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,880
um than if our field was there

845
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:28,480
so that was sort of fun for us to learn

846
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,440
and we also saw this is a field

847
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,399
after uh that was conventionally tilled

848
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,240
and then there was

849
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:35,839
the so it was conventionally tilled and

850
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,359
they planted and that same night they

851
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:38,798
had a huge rainstorm

852
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:40,719
so after that huge rainstorm you get

853
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:42,798
this surface crusting and you'll see the

854
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,278
only places where the hemp actually came

855
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:47,759
up are in cracks within that surface

856
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:49,919
so we really saw the importance of

857
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,879
planning of planting time

858
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,519
particularly in a conventionally tilled

859
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,919
soil

860
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,519
where you can get these surface crusts

861
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,559
so we were just learning left and right

862
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,079
everything we did was

863
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:04,240
was uh we were learning more so here

864
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:07,199
this is the image of september 3rd

865
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,960
um and we're comparing this image is

866
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,159
just your regular rgb

867
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,120
your regular uh picture that you could

868
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,440
take with your phone

869
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:16,639
um as opposed to a picture that you can

870
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,679
take with

871
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:23,038
um the infrared camera

872
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,720
um and to the naked eye you can see the

873
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:25,679
difference between what was top dressed

874
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,600
and what wasn't

875
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,600
which is sort of interesting but it's

876
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:31,519
really not as easy to see the difference

877
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:32,558
between the varieties as you can see

878
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,440
here

879
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:37,278
right here this showed us that this

880
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,399
field was too small for our strips

881
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:41,679
because there was

882
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:44,879
uh leaching in between our uh

883
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:47,600
different nitrogen rates except for this

884
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,360
back area here right that area with the

885
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:50,879
low nitrogen rate you can really see the

886
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:53,839
difference with the naked eye

887
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,240
do you need a infrared camera for that

888
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:55,918
no

889
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,640
right but you can see a little bit more

890
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:01,600
detail with that infrared camera

891
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,880
we also did a study um partnering with a

892
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:04,639
private company

893
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,880
to test their product to see if their

894
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:10,240
metabolism booster could take

895
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,398
a european cbd variety which means that

896
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:16,078
in europe if a crop produces

897
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:20,319
3 cbd it's considered a cbd variety

898
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:23,119
um so we took a european cbd variety and

899
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,240
sprayed it with their um i think this is

900
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,679
another one of them getting

901
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:30,398
my students a year ago getting the

902
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,918
sprayer ready um so we sprayed it with

903
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:35,519
this metabolism booster

904
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:38,878
to see uh how that would do we had some

905
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:41,599
issues that year with um

906
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:42,159
well this special variety that we bought

907
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,720
took

908
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,878
an extra month to get here so we planted

909
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:49,358
late and because we planted late the

910
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:50,799
weeds came back after killing what was

911
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:51,440
in that field with ground up it was a

912
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,560
mess

913
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,559
um so we didn't get the research results

914
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:59,119
that we wanted to from that field so we

915
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:00,480
redid it this year in the green house

916
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,519
right we got the harvest with our own

917
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,280
combine

918
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:04,639
we did the modifications to this combine

919
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,240
so this was a really great learning

920
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,000
experience for us to see what has to be

921
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:11,199
modified and what doesn't

922
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,320
um we only had one small fire

923
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:15,439
uh and that was easily uh doused so that

924
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,440
was lovely

925
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,880
um and this is a student walking behind

926
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,639
the combine just checking to make sure

927
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,320
that everything is flowing out of it

928
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:29,598
smoothly and our fiber harvest

929
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:33,359
um this is the the

930
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:37,519
video that folks growing for

931
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:41,279
extracts hate to see because

932
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:43,920
as that fiber falls right you can see

933
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,839
the clouds of pollen coming out of it

934
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,119
the appropriate time to harvest for

935
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:51,199
fiber is before the females have been

936
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,640
pollinated right we don't want the male

937
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:54,159
plants to die yet

938
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:56,000
because the male plants will die after

939
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:58,000
they release the pollen

940
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
um otherwise you lose half of your fiber

941
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,480
crop if you let the male plants die

942
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,358
and the female plants once they're

943
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,920
pollinated

944
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:07,039
the fiber quality changes so this is the

945
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,400
right time

946
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:11,920
to harvest which means there was a lot

947
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,599
of wind that day there was a lot of

948
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,200
pollen moving but

949
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,039
as you can see this is not a flat

950
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:20,319
landscape um how far

951
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,759
that pollen will travel i believe that

952
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,599
cornell's doing a really good job of

953
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,960
answering that question

954
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:30,160
but truly not as far as

955
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,838
folks worry i think um but you can see

956
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:34,399
that's a whole lot of pollen coming out

957
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:34,400
of that crop

958
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,239
but also the crop was falling straight

959
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:40,799
the way that it needed to

960
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,598
uh because we have that little triangle

961
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,280
on the end

962
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:48,559
of that's not what i want sorry

963
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:52,079
yeah there we go so again

964
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:53,440
we uh read in the field we did much

965
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,240
better in the second year of reading

966
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,358
getting a much

967
00:36:54,239 --> 00:37:00,799
more even rent um and and we

968
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:02,078
bale that fiber um and in our first year

969
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,599
we had a little trouble with the round

970
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,000
baler in our second year

971
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,359
we learned that we needed to just do a

972
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,039
little bit of

973
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:12,719
protecting here of the wires that go

974
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:13,199
from the tractor to the baler and once

975
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:14,879
those

976
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:16,319
are protected everything else went

977
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,280
smoothly and so this was a really good

978
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,359
example

979
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:25,599
of where um

980
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:26,960
you have these terrible stories of doing

981
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,200
thousands of dollars of damage to

982
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,039
equipment but then you were like oh well

983
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:32,960
this wasn't hard to fix and then now

984
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:36,480
it's not a problem anymore

985
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,320
um so in 2020 oh we didn't grow for

986
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,079
grain because it's 20 20.

987
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,519
we uh who knew what was going to happen

988
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,320
and so i didn't want to set up grain

989
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,920
trials

990
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,838
um i knew i had two student interns

991
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,039
but i wasn't exactly positive if i was

992
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:50,000
going to be able to have them for the

993
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:54,079
whole summer

994
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,760
and um so we went through the easy route

995
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,640
we decided that fiber was the easy way

996
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,000
to go

997
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:02,159
um we were focusing instead of

998
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,358
on different nitrogen rates we were

999
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:05,440
focusing on

1000
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:07,440
could we see a difference in using a

1001
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,358
leguminous cover crop and so we looked

1002
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,920
at cow peas and we looked at alfalfa

1003
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:13,679
or sorry cover crop interpret we also

1004
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,720
partnered with beacon skiff

1005
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:17,519
and they were doing a large cbd grow

1006
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:20,639
this year

1007
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:22,079
and let us come in and take soil samples

1008
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:23,039
and take plant samples throughout the

1009
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,039
growing season

1010
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,079
to see if we can track accumulation of

1011
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:29,519
heavy metals

1012
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,160
um there's been a lot of talk of hemp as

1013
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:33,838
a

1014
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:36,000
heavy metal uh produce or

1015
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:37,199
a hyper accumulator there we go those

1016
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,639
are the words i'm looking for

1017
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:42,399
um and so that was our opportunity to to

1018
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:42,879
get into that space and see if that's

1019
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,960
true

1020
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,800
um for two reasons one because if you're

1021
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,599
producing an extract right would that

1022
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,119
extract

1023
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,720
with heavy metals in it then become

1024
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,720
problematic or and

1025
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:54,559
two to prove whether or not it really

1026
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:57,519
does hyper accumulate heavy metals and

1027
00:38:54,559 --> 00:39:01,199
couldn't be used for phytoremediation

1028
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:04,320
um man there was a lot of drought this

1029
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:07,439
uh june so even though we planted

1030
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,838
on time uh maybe a week late

1031
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,760
our crop didn't emerge until july

1032
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:15,199
because there was just no rain

1033
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,160
um and so we went through and hand

1034
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:18,960
harvested

1035
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:21,118
the our plots that we wanted to but

1036
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,559
really we just sickle barred and let the

1037
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:26,079
crop lay in the field because there just

1038
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:27,440
wasn't enough it was too dry a year

1039
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,560
you can see how big my kid's gotten

1040
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,559
isn't cute um

1041
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,519
field uh their their cbd grow looked

1042
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,760
really beautiful they did a great job

1043
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:41,358
um and this is our fiber field on the

1044
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,119
day it was being harvested

1045
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:44,639
and this is probably the best part of

1046
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,358
the field where

1047
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:47,759
uh where my laser pointer is it's about

1048
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:49,358
uh

1049
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,119
between five and six foot tall but this

1050
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:54,880
right here is only three foot tall

1051
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:58,559
so it was quite a mess um we also

1052
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,559
uh did a repeat of the metabolism

1053
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:04,318
booster study but we did it in

1054
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:06,480
um in the greenhouse and so

1055
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,400
here you can see a major pest problem

1056
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,599
that we saw and what we're waiting to

1057
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,639
get our data back about

1058
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,039
extracts because we noted that there

1059
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:16,639
were

1060
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:18,559
plants that were infested and there were

1061
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:20,000
a couple of hundred plants right on top

1062
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:23,039
of each other and they weren't

1063
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,760
all infested and so we wanted to see if

1064
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:26,400
whether the amount of cannabinoids being

1065
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,319
produced

1066
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,400
has something to do with whether or not

1067
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:31,519
the plants were covered and so this is

1068
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,720
going to be another

1069
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:37,280
one of our questions of um does

1070
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:39,679
uh extract concentration has something

1071
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,599
to do with resistance to pest pressure

1072
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:44,000
who knows um and then this was just

1073
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,800
today in lab we had students doing

1074
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,599
an uh olive oil extraction process just

1075
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,519
to see

1076
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,838
that there are quite a few different

1077
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:54,800
ways of

1078
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:57,920
extracting um uh

1079
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:01,760
cannabinoids and terpenes from our

1080
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,318
uh our plants and uh will then go

1081
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,440
through

1082
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:06,159
a distillation process so what have we

1083
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,559
learned

1084
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:09,199
uh we've learned about weed management

1085
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:11,199
we've

1086
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:12,559
learned that we need breeding so thank

1087
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:13,759
you cornell for all the work you're

1088
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:15,279
doing and breeding because

1089
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,440
man are there a lot of traits that we're

1090
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,960
not sure what's being controlled by

1091
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,559
genetics what's being controlled by

1092
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,000
environmental factors and how do those

1093
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:24,639
two come together

1094
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
um we know that getting nutrient

1095
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:30,960
management correct

1096
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,960
is vital not just for yield but also for

1097
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:34,880
competitiveness but it's really hard

1098
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,799
because

1099
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,920
as so far each growing season we've had

1100
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,039
a but

1101
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,200
because the weather has really

1102
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:44,719
interfered uh

1103
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:48,239
pest pressure has really uh

1104
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:48,639
been all over the place um but i think

1105
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,559
what's

1106
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:52,159
most important to me and the biggest

1107
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:55,440
take-home message for me

1108
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:57,199
is that um there is so much variability

1109
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,119
here and if you're growing for extracts

1110
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:02,000
you also have a fiber crop

1111
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,720
and if you're growing for a fiber crop

1112
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,800
um

1113
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:06,078
maybe that there's also extract

1114
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,200
potential and if you're growing for

1115
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,480
grain what are you going to

1116
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:14,239
do with that leftover fiber and so um

1117
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,440
we need to know what is your focus for

1118
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:18,959
your crop

1119
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:21,119
and then um where is your crop gonna go

1120
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,720
and before a seed or a clone goes in the

1121
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,599
ground we need to know where that's

1122
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,318
gonna go to

1123
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,960
because our supply chain needs work

1124
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:29,039
right

1125
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,720
um and there are a lot of shysters in

1126
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:32,719
the extract world and so you got to be

1127
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:34,639
careful with who you're dealing with

1128
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:35,759
um and there's no such thing as a waste

1129
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:39,358
product that

1130
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,839
um if we can develop this supply chain

1131
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:45,598
better there is so much potential

1132
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:49,119
for for a usable portions of this crop

1133
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:52,079
um but there is still a lot of

1134
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:54,400
bad information out there and the the

1135
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,560
community at large needs to understand

1136
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,680
that this is a crop just like any other

1137
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:00,719
crop

1138
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:02,960
so my funding sources

1139
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:03,759
have have been sort of all across the

1140
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,039
board

1141
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:10,839
uh throughout the past five years and um

1142
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:13,838
with that um i'm happy to take any

1143
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,838
questions

1144
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,280
um i'll start with the question jen and

1145
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:22,318
first of all thank you for a fascinating

1146
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:27,280
seminar and so glad that you were able

1147
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:29,039
to outrun that skunk

1148
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,480
probably one of my favorite stories so

1149
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:33,358
far yes

1150
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,519
amazing how fast we can run when

1151
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:38,719
necessary

1152
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:40,159
so my question for you is anytime you're

1153
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:43,679
growing a cannabis

1154
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:47,118
crop there are security issues

1155
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:50,399
um and on a college campus

1156
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:54,240
how does one alert the public

1157
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,760
that what you are growing is a crop that

1158
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:59,358
does not have

1159
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:02,800
thc potential

1160
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:06,480
well i started uh with signs

1161
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:09,359
and then i went to all of

1162
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,079
the professors who taught first-year

1163
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:13,279
experience

1164
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:16,400
courses so that all the freshmen

1165
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,200
would hear the this is hemp for grain

1166
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,000
and fiber

1167
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:20,399
not uh anything that's going to get you

1168
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,719
high

1169
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:27,920
talk and then i went to the student

1170
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:30,078
uh senate and talked to them

1171
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,760
and i mean it really is a lot of word of

1172
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,800
mouth and because there are a lot of ag

1173
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,800
students on campus

1174
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,640
they were able to do some of the

1175
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,720
smacking upside down for me

1176
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:40,559
but there were definitely students who

1177
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:41,759
went into the field our first two years

1178
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:45,119
and grabbed samples

1179
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:49,119
and tried to sell them that was always

1180
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:50,559
fun um but you know i can do as much

1181
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,240
education as i can

1182
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:56,318
and then they just have to learn on

1183
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:58,719
their own that they're being found

1184
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:00,639
great it was all about using my

1185
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:03,519
resources on campus though

1186
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:04,719
yeah sounds like you were very thorough

1187
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:07,679
i would love to see

1188
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:08,078
if larry smart has a question given the

1189
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:11,679
work

1190
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:14,079
that he's doing on cannabis

1191
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:14,078
larry

1192
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,240
hi jen thanks very much for giving that

1193
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:24,079
excellent seminar

1194
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:25,118
uh yeah i'm curious about your

1195
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:29,680
modification

1196
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:31,440
on the sickle bar mower uh

1197
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:33,118
we've made some modifications to our

1198
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,119
sickle bar more but

1199
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,640
we don't have a baler so we haven't done

1200
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:40,720
that large scale

1201
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:40,719
fiber production that you have

1202
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,599
so can you describe that a little bit

1203
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:49,199
more yeah

1204
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:52,400
larry it is so simple it's literally a

1205
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:54,159
wooden triangle that is so if this is

1206
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,720
the sickle bar the triangle

1207
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:57,598
and and my tractors over here the

1208
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:01,039
triangle comes

1209
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,800
out a little bit and so it angles uh

1210
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:04,318
so instead of being like this it's

1211
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:08,079
angled like that

1212
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:10,000
so as the sickle bar pushes through

1213
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,680
the crop it's pulling the crop back

1214
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,480
towards the tractor to fall

1215
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:16,719
instead of falling back into the crop it

1216
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,920
was it was just the simplest addition

1217
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:20,879
there and it did an

1218
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,639
amazing job um that second year our crop

1219
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,838
was also a little bit smaller and so we

1220
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:26,159
don't know if that was part of the

1221
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:29,599
reason that it fell so nicely also

1222
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:31,279
um but it seemed uh and this year i

1223
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,640
don't know anyone talk about our field

1224
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,640
this year they were so sad

1225
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:38,078
um and so i i want to see next year if

1226
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:41,118
it works as well again

1227
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,839
but it was a really simple change all

1228
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,200
right

1229
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:45,199
thank you thank you

1230
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:49,199
other questions for jen

1231
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,599
yeah and i know this isn't exactly up

1232
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,960
the alley of most of the horticulture

1233
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:58,318
program where you're focused more

1234
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:01,679
on the indoor grows but

1235
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:04,159
i really think there is a lot of overlap

1236
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:07,519
and a lot of collaboration between the

1237
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:07,519
different styles of production

1238
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,838
don maybe just uh one more quick

1239
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:14,719
question jen you

1240
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:15,679
said you grew some new crosses this year

1241
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:17,919
can you

1242
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:19,118
can you describe those a little bit more

1243
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,880
sure so

1244
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:26,559
um last year they grew

1245
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,000
uh berry blossom and and lena 32 and

1246
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:31,519
they crossed them

1247
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,800
so that um we had a berry blossom

1248
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:37,119
salina 32 cross so instead of being

1249
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,480
tree style it was much more erect and

1250
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:42,318
upright

1251
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,838
um and so i actually just sent those out

1252
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:47,358
for cannabinoid analysis

1253
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:50,639
yesterday and we're we're curious

1254
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:53,358
if that stays upward of

1255
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:54,799
you know seven or eight percent if that

1256
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:58,159
becomes a way

1257
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:00,400
of being able to grow um

1258
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:02,239
field crop production style instead of

1259
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:06,079
horticultural production style

1260
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:09,679
because that could be um cut with

1261
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:13,359
a combine and and separate it out um

1262
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:15,759
as opposed to uh some of the

1263
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:17,358
more labor-intensive hand ways or you

1264
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,960
know the ways that we're doing it under

1265
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:23,519
a plastic

1266
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:26,480
so but you got that from kailyn and dan

1267
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:29,920
no we did it ourselves oh okay yeah yeah

1268
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,920
no we did it ourselves last year

1269
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:35,838
yeah so um that that

1270
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,200
we had a student last year whose family

1271
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:39,838
donated

1272
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:42,078
about a hundred seats us of a bunch of

1273
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:44,639
different varieties and so that's where

1274
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,440
we got the high cbd varieties from to

1275
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:47,440
start with

1276
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,039
and then we crop we did you know our

1277
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,159
horde department has been teaching a lot

1278
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:53,519
about propagation

1279
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:56,879
and um um reading

1280
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:58,318
and so they did that cross and then grew

1281
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,160
it out in the field this year to see how

1282
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:03,759
it would do

1283
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:06,960
structure wise great thank you

1284
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,680
that should be fun uh any final

1285
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,280
questions

1286
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:14,719
for jen before we finish up thomas

1287
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,000
yeah nice talk so your final point there

1288
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:18,959
with uh

1289
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,599
growers need to know who's buying what

1290
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,240
they're

1291
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:24,079
growing before they even plant it so

1292
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:27,039
that's sort of a common

1293
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,680
problem when field crop growers get into

1294
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:30,000
any

1295
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:30,799
horticultural crop and this one's more

1296
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,119
challenging

1297
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,960
and i'm curious what what the sense was

1298
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:35,838
among the growers that you are working

1299
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,358
with

1300
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:41,519
um how you know

1301
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:43,519
did they have some sense of who was

1302
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:44,880
going to be buying it did they figure it

1303
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:47,119
would work itself

1304
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,039
out in the meantime or were there

1305
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:52,079
already buyers that they just show up

1306
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:54,318
like you do to a green elevator

1307
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:56,079
so i had a couple of growers that were

1308
00:49:54,318 --> 00:49:56,719
planning on processing themselves that

1309
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:00,160
had

1310
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:02,239
ideas about producing their own hemp oil

1311
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:03,679
and so harvesting the grain to press for

1312
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:06,239
oil um

1313
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:07,519
that that was the most common oh i don't

1314
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:08,639
need to worry about a fire because i'm

1315
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:12,639
gonna do this

1316
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:15,920
um but it is such a different

1317
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:17,519
way of thinking that you don't ever

1318
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,800
worry about being able to sell corn or

1319
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:20,800
soy beans or oats or wheat

1320
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,559
like that's that's not a problem you may

1321
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,720
not make money at it but you can always

1322
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,720
sell

1323
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:28,400
i think that it this is a two-sided

1324
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:31,358
problem right one

1325
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,800
is that there is the field crop

1326
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:35,440
producers who aren't used to that

1327
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,240
and two is the other side of hemp

1328
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,000
production

1329
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:39,598
there are a whole lot of people who have

1330
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,519
never grown up in their life

1331
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,760
who all of a sudden were like i'm gonna

1332
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:46,880
be a farmer because hemp is legal

1333
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,839
right so it's not that our fruit and veg

1334
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,880
farmers

1335
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:52,880
are all jumping on board because they

1336
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,640
you're right that is part of that

1337
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,838
production model where you have to know

1338
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:58,799
where it's going

1339
00:50:55,838 --> 00:50:58,799
um this was more

1340
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:05,280
different yeah yeah no so that

1341
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:06,400
so you did get both at least both of

1342
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,440
those audience

1343
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,200
yes the new farm the not

1344
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,280
experienced enough farmer and the way to

1345
