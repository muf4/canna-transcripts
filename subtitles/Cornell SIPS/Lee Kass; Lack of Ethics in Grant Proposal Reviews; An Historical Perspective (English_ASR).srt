change um this is a a Pres presentation

9
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:38,519
that stems from work that I started many

10
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:41,878
many years ago and I'd like to uh give

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,760
you a perspective on that

12
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,479
work um the background for my story

13
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:48,799
began in

14
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:51,038
1985 while I was searching for

15
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,000
Publications to document my first

16
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,960
edition of the plants of San Salvador

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,280
island in the Bahamas the picture of our

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,079
cover of our first edition is on the

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,838
right side of the screen

20
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:08,960
I um was invited to the Bahamas in the

21
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:12,679
early 1980s to actually teach a class

22
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:15,118
on um the botney marine

23
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,000
botney and I had a little bit of

24
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:21,560
background on picology and so I started

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,599
to do that while we were down there my

26
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,159
students kept asking me what's this

27
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:29,078
plant what's that plant on the

28
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:31,560
terrestrial land and I didn't know and

29
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:34,199
uh so I thoughted to try to find

30
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,879
Publications to try to help them and

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,920
myself and from that the director of The

32
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,920
Field Station asked us to write a common

33
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,000
plants guide with illustrations because

34
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,960
there wasn't anything available at the

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,478
time for the non botanist so the class

36
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:52,280
was a general education course for non

37
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:55,799
botanists and uh from that uh we began

38
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:58,039
looking for published papers to include

39
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,960
in our common plants guide which was

40
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:02,840
actually illustrated by one of my

41
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:06,559
students uh Tony

42
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,800
Kowalski uh in 1995 while I was waiting

43
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,280
to board the plane to attend the first

44
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,480
Symposium on the botney of the Bahamas

45
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,159
on San Salvador Island which is

46
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:20,759
currently called the natural history of

47
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:22,239
the Bahamas um I met Dr Hardy Esa and

48
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:24,039
here's a picture of Hardy on the right

49
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,120
that I took many years

50
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:30,159
later uh so who is this guy and why is

51
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,439
he so important to my story uh party was

52
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:35,719
a cornelian and an Indiana University

53
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,598
PHD who later became interested in the

54
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:40,519
Bahama

55
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:42,399
Flora uh at the at this 1985 Bahamas

56
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:44,879
conference that we were going to he

57
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,400
presented an unpublished distribution

58
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:51,199
map for plants that were compiled by

59
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,599
William Thomas Gillis that he had

60
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,199
actually found in the herbarium at

61
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,439
Michigan State

62
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,799
University now on the right hand side of

63
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:04,439
the screen you can see this distribution

64
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:07,360
map one of many hundreds that were uh

65
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,598
that are currently in the Michigan State

66
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,200
University

67
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:14,439
herbarium and what Gillis did is he

68
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:16,798
began looking and became interested in

69
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:19,680
the Bahama Flora in the early 70s

70
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:22,080
actually the late 80s and he began uh

71
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,200
documenting the distribution of all the

72
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,040
plants at the Bahamas on these

73
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:29,399
distribution maps and each one of the

74
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:31,519
little dots there represents a plant

75
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,400
that had either collected or he had

76
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,879
found in the literature or he came

77
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,760
across in a herbarium so this really

78
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:40,079
helped us figure out well what were the

79
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:43,679
plants that were on St Salvador by

80
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,680
looking at gillis's

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,318
Maps so during this time we as I said we

82
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,840
were looking for to P to find

83
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,839
Publications and we came across this big

84
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,200
book that had just recently been

85
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,239
published by Carell and Carell called

86
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:04,078
the Flora of the Bahama archipelago

87
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,360
and this book was basically for uh

88
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:10,000
taxonomists it was not a book for the

89
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:15,879
general public it had descriptions in

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:19,319
Latin and um we got a copy of it and

91
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:21,560
slept it in our backpacks down to San

92
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:24,360
Salvador on a regular basis while trying

93
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,680
to uh to describe the plants of the

94
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,800
Bahamas for our

95
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,280
book and um what we noticed was in the

96
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,280
preface to this book was an

97
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:36,959
acknowledgement to the National Science

98
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:39,359
Foundation for for funding the

99
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:42,599
publication of the book and the other

100
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:49,360
thing we noticed was that there were no

101
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:53,039
or very few references to Dr gillis's

102
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,280
Publications so I said to Hardy why was

103
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:58,560
gillis's work ignored in the Corral's

104
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:01,559
recently published Flora of the Bahama

105
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
archipelago

106
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:10,038
well party oh where am

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,038
I sorry going the wrong

108
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,918
direction there we go so hardy suggested

109
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:20,919
that I contact Associates who might know

110
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:23,599
the answers to my question and one of

111
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:26,560
the people that actually worked with

112
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,000
Gillis on his um interest in the Bahama

113
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,079
Flora was Richard Howard of the Harvard

114
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
University

115
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:35,918
herbaria and he provided many leads to

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,759
finding the answers to my question so I

117
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:43,318
drove up to Boston and a Cambridge

118
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,199
actually and I interviewed dick Howard

119
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,439
in

120
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:50,000
1993 at the Harvard University herbaria

121
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:53,519
to try to get some answers and

122
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,519
documentation on what was going

123
00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:00,038
on so the search to solve my question

124
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,319
precipitated finding documents revealing

125
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:06,038
a lack of Ethics in Grant proposal

126
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:09,039
reviews and a story of to my to our

127
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:12,478
horror dishonor which is the subject of

128
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:16,120
this seminar now Hardy and I have

129
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:18,478
published are have written a manuscript

130
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:22,439
that was submitted and accepted for

131
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:24,240
publication that gives the absolute

132
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:27,240
background of the whole story and I'm

133
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,120
just going to give you a brief review of

134
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:33,079
that the the publication should be out

135
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,519
in the we will promis that it would be

136
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:39,159
out in the spring of 2024 in Huna the

137
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:42,120
Journal of the ban of Botanical

138
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,680
history so let's talk about or let's see

139
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:48,879
what we found the National Science

140
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:52,639
Foundation had um conflicts of interest

141
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:55,959
problems with grants to short-term

142
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,800
employees um these short-term employees

143
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:00,239
are known as

144
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,560
rotators and in

145
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,840
1979 the United States General

146
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,399
Accounting Office which is currently

147
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:11,478
called the US general Accounting Office

148
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:14,120
began a review of the National Science

149
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:16,959
foundation's policies and procedures for

150
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:20,038
precluding conflicts of interests in its

151
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:23,198
Grant award process specifically when

152
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:26,360
NSF former short-term Rotator employees

153
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,520
were involved the review was

154
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,400
precipitated by a request from

155
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:35,680
congressman Carl D purcel a republican

156
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:39,758
from Michigan who he who had submitted

157
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,759
this request in May of

158
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,879
1979 Congressman pcell had made a

159
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:48,279
request to the government office on

160
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:51,639
behalf of a constituent now I want you

161
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:53,198
to know that this proposal that or this

162
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:57,478
review that they

163
00:07:53,199 --> 00:08:01,478
made uh did not reveal any names so

164
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:03,878
please keep that in mind so he he um

165
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:05,959
made a request on behalf of his of a

166
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:09,080
constituent who unfortunately did not

167
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:13,799
live to see the outcome of their review

168
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:18,120
a draft of the GAO 1981 report included

00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,439
a proposal for identifying conflicts of

170
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,759
interest and the National Science

171
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:27,519
Foundation imple implemented that

172
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:30,038
proposal which concluded quote should

173
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:32,278
provide greater visibility to potential

174
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:35,360
conflict of interest situations

175
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:38,719
associated with grants involving

176
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:42,360
rotators and to resolve conflicts in

177
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,360
accordance with statutes and

178
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:49,679
regulations additional specifics of this

179
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:52,799
case that regarded Purcell's unnamed

180
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,679
constituent purcel had asked for review

181
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,240
of National Science Foundation policies

182
00:08:54,679 --> 00:09:00,599
and procedures for awarding Grants to

183
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,879
former National Science Foundation

184
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,399
employees he specifically requested

185
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:08,439
clarification whether these policies and

186
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,200
procedures including Provisions for

187
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,800
their

188
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,640
waiver adequate adequately prevented uh

189
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,399
prevented conflicts of interest and

190
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:20,519
whether NSF complies with them this is

191
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,839
actually published in that

192
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:25,639
report the

193
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:29,279
investigation as summarized

194
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:31,199
here pcel Purcell's interest in the case

195
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:34,360
was brought to his attention by a

196
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,959
researcher unnamed in the report from

197
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:40,200
his home District whose proposal NSF had

198
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:43,319
declined to fund although it later

199
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:46,879
funded a similar project proposed by a

200
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,879
former National Science Foundation

201
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,600
employee the government office

202
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:54,078
investigation focused on the special

203
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,240
problems of processing grants from

204
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:59,199
short-term employees the rotators who

205
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:04,000
work for National Science Foundation for

206
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:06,200
one or two years and to assess NSF Grant

207
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,799
award process as it relates to Awards

208
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,278
made to scientists who are being

209
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:14,120
considered for or are serving in or have

210

Grant activity for 24 past and current

214
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,879
short-term NSF appointees recall this

215
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:34,719
was the begin this uh investigation

216
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:38,958
began in 79 the report was done in '

217
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,800
81 23 individuals in the sample

218
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,599
including the National Science

219
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:46,879
Foundation appointee in the case

220
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,079
involving Congressman perel's

221
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,240
constituent contributing to the problem

222
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:55,439
were decisions on this grant activity

223
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:58,039
made by Associates to the NSF appointees

224
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,839
and often the relationships were between

225
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:01,838
supervisors and

226
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,079
subordinates additional specifics

227
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,519
questionable circumstances surrounded a

228
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:13,519
waiver of post-employment restrictions

229
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,000
and proposed

230
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,639
review Purcell's con constituent had

231
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,879
submitted a proposal that the National

232
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:25,440
Science Foundation declined but the

233
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:28,399
decision on which to judge whether the

234
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:32,040
constituent proposal was treated fairly

235
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:35,600
was limited did because all files

236
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:38,240
relating to it had been destroyed by the

237
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,680
time of the government's

238
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,519
review that's a quote now I'd like you

239
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:47,919
to please keep this statement in mind

240
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:51,278
especially what I state in the

241
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:54,479
highlighted dark brown

242
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:57,240
lettering I'll repeat it again all files

243
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,959
relating to it had been destroyed by the

244
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,959
time of the Government review

245
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,639
around the time the constituent's

246
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,200
proposal was rejected another researcher

247
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,480
began a two-year rotational appointment

248
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:15,120
at the National Science Foundation in

249
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:17,800
the program office that had rejected it

250
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,600
the NSF appointe applied for a waiver to

251
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:23,679
submit a proposal upon leaving

252
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:27,079
NSF after leaving NSF the appointe

253
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:30,879
submitted a proposal it was the same

254
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:30,879
subject as the

255
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,839
constituents what did they find they

256
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,199
found conflicts of interest the former

257
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,160
NSF employee submitted his proposal to

258
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:45,198
the program that he had

259
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:47,879
directed The Proposal review was

260
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:51,799
completed in three months according to

261
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:54,039
their findings it actually was six weeks

262
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:55,479
it usually took about five months to act

263
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:59,759
on the

264
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,039
proposals so it was reported but it was

265
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,919
actually eight months for the

266
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:06,958
constituent's proposal to get his review

267
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:09,719
back the National Science Foundation

268
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:12,518
program officer who made the award

269
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,278
recommended for the former NSF program

270
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:17,399
officer had earlier used the NSF

271
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,720
appointy as a reference on his own

272
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:23,159
application for his own employment at

273
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:26,639
the National Science Foundation and he

274
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:29,278
had also worked for the former employee

275
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,440
appointee these were the findings from

276
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:31,439
the

277
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:41,120
usgo now with the help of Richard Howard

278
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:45,639
among others we track down the grant

279
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:48,679
proposals the 1993 in 1993 myself and my

280
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:52,360
husband located all of Purcell's

281
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:54,278
constituents research files including

282
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,959
copies of both National Science

284
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:01,638

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,720
revealed that the NSF appointee was

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,880
Donathan Carell program director of

293
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,839

the 1982 Flora of the Bahama

295
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:40,759
archipelago and who they had funded

296
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:44,480
twice and which was in their preface to

297
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:47,480
their book Purcell's constituent was WT

298
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,039
Gillis the guy who did all those

299
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:54,440
distribution maps and was a former

300
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:57,519
Fairchild tropical garden employee and

301
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:00,680
the author of the original rejected

illustrated vascular Flora of the Bahama

306
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:13,758
Islands he submitted it from the

307
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:16,599
Fairchild tropical garden on October 1st

308
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,879
1973 two months after he had left the

309
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,519
National Science Foundation appointment

310
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,919
and it was approved six weeks later on

311
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:28,039
15 November

312
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:30,958
1973 much of the text was derived from

313
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:33,278
the grand proposal previously submitted

314
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:37,278
to the National Science Foundation by

315
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,278
Gillis from the same

316
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,799
institution here's the case as was

317
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,919
summarized by the

318
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:49,318
usgao in

319
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:51,639
1981 the National Science Foundation

320
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:52,639
awarded the former NSF appointee more

321
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:56,198
than

322
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,560
$90,000 over five years within the five

323
00:15:56,198 --> 00:16:00,799
years he requested and was granted an in

324
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,399
increase that brought the total award to

325
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,919
more than

326
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,600
$100,000 during the six years he was

327
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:10,240
awarded about $40,000 in additional

328
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:14,839
funds and the grant period was extended

329
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,839
to a total of more than S and a half

330
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:21,679
years one of the major arguments made by

331
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:24,079
reviewers of gillis's 1970 National

332
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,879
Science Foundation grants proposal which

333
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:28,719
we found at the Michigan State

334
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:30,838
University herbarium was to prepare a

335
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,720
manual and a flora of the Bahama

336
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:36,079
vascular

337
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,040
plants and the argument was that the

338
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:42,278
cost was too

339
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:45,759
high yet the usgao report revealed that

340
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:48,480
Carell received over 75% in funding for

341
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,199
one investigator himself and for fewer

342
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,360
years of support than Gillis had

343
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:56,159
originally requested for three

344
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:59,199
researchers himself Dr Howard and Dr

345
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:02,120
Proctor of The Institute of of research

346
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:04,558
in Jamaica who was also researching the

347
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,400
Flora of the

348
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:09,639
Bahamas well the question is is this

349
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,480
really a plagiarized Grant

350
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,919
proposal revising and submitting a

351
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,720
Bahama Flora Grant proposal might be

352
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:21,120
justified by assuming the project was

353
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,480
the purview of the institution where it

354
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,239
had been

355
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:30,079
initiated that's all well and good

356
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:33,440
except that the um argument doesn't

357
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:35,918
really fly because it wasn't the

358
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,320
institution that started this but it was

359
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,080
actually the researchers within that

360
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:46,038
institution whose idea it

361
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:49,119
was Carell's October 1973 Grant proposal

362
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:51,640
misrepresented what actually happened

363
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:54,519
they said gillis's involvement

364
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,919
initiating the project in 1968 at

365
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:59,440
Fairchild tropical garden they did not

366
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:01,640
include the fact that Gil 's involvement

367
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,600
initiating the project in 1968 at

368
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:07,759
Fairchild tropical garden they

369
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:10,359
misrepresented it as a institutional

370
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:13,960
proposal which it was not it was only

371
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:17,240
signed by the institution director but

372
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:20,000
his he had nothing to do with the grant

373
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,919
proposal Gillis and collaborators having

374
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,038
priority and partial funding for the

375
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,640
Bahama Flora Project was ignored they

376
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:31,000
did

377
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:34,520
not cite any of the previous or current

378
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,359
Publications that Gillis had done they

379
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:38,918
it was not part of the grant

380
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:40,599
proposal and they did not acknowledge

381
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:44,440
that there was priority that someone

382
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:47,000
else had started this project years

383
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:50,120
before what was the priority for writing

384
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,679
a Bahama Flora in 1970 Gillis began

385
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:53,798
collecting and published his first

386
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,320
report towards writing a new Bahama

387
00:18:53,798 --> 00:19:00,519
Flora the publication came out in 1970

388
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:04,879
and we C it in

389
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:07,319
1991 with Richard Howard and and uh dick

390
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,200
Proctor Gillis continued the project

391
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:14,200
until his he died his untimely death in

392
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:16,840
1979 he died on June 20th 19 in 1979

393
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:20,880
approximately two months after the

394
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:23,879
investigation began by the US

395
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,600
GAO picture on the right on the bottom

396

00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:35,519
Bahamas in the early or the mid

399
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:37,519
1970s the National Science

400
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,918
Foundation had

401
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:43,240
recognized that it has been less than

402
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,640
successful in addressing the unique

403
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:49,519
problems associated with the Rotator

404
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:53,320
program that's a quote the United

405
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:56,000
States government organization report

406
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:57,519
had sensitized NSF employees to

407
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,519
conflicts of interest problems in the

408
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:02,759
Rotator program program they reported

409
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:04,679
and accordingly the National Science

410
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:07,960
Foundation will take steps to address

411
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:07,960
new conflicts of interest

412
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:15,200
policies with respect to the case at

413
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:17,319
hand meaning the issue with the

414
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,000
constituent the National Science

415
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:25,439
Foundation planned to issue a directive

416
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,279
that all staff in grades gs12 and above

417
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,558
who are leaving the National Science

418
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,038
Foundation be especially counseled by

419
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:33,918
the ethics

420
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:36,960
counselor the ethics counselor is in the

421
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,000
office of the general council at NSF

422
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,440
about post-employment conflicts of

423
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,798
interest

424
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:46,519
restrictions further they report that a

425
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:48,359
former employee is precluded during

426
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:50,918
oneyear period after National Science

427
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:52,439
Foundation service from submitting a new

428
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:55,840
proposal to the National Science

429
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:58,279
Foundation as principal investigator and

430
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,918
from receiving compensation under any

431
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:03,720
NSF award other than one on which he or

432
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:07,759
she suspended work when coming to the

433
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,759
foundation that appears in their

434
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,000
appendic the final

435
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,759
conclusion I say yet the National

436
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,960
Science Foundation believed that none of

437
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,879
the basic rules that they used to guard

438
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,079
against conflicts of interest involving

439
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:31,200
rotators was violated in any of the

440
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:35,319
cases s Ed in the draft report that's in

441
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,319
appendix 3 so NSF is still denying that

442
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:40,918
they did anything

443
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:43,319
wrong the usgao believed that their

444
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,960
final recommendations to the director of

445
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:47,639
the National Science Foundation if what

446
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,038
if it if they were

447
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,559
implemented would resolve conflicts of

448
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:53,919
interest questions for the National

449
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:53,918
Science

450
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:59,158
Foundation the

451
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:02,000
enforcement of the National Science

452
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:04,760
Foundation policies might have reassured

453
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,038
Bill Gillis that a case such as his

454
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:08,720
would not be

455
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:12,200
repeated as I said unfortunately he

456
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,120
didn't see this decision because he died

457
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,919
in

458
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:19,879
1979

459
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:23,919
nevertheless our findings revealed that

460
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:26,760
basic rules from the NSF had been used

461
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,320
to guard against conflicts of interest

462
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:30,759
involving rotators

463
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:33,639
were

464
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:34,798
violate so when we did our research when

465
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,799
we found the

466
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:41,918
documentation it was clear to us that

467
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:44,480
these interests were definitely violated

468
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:49,000
although NSF denied

469
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:52,000
it so our conclusion within keeping

470
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,720
within historical perspective we may

471
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,400
recall the words of the Roman historian

472
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,759
tacitus the principal office of History

473
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:03,278
I take to be be this to prevent virtuous

474
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:05,440
actions from being forgotten and that

475
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:09,400
evil words and deeds should fear an

476
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:13,240
Infinite infamous reputation with

477
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:16,159
posterity now this is an interesting

478
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:19,839
conclusion only if

479
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:22,320
one can get the information out that

480
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:25,359
proves that there was a

481
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:29,439
problem Hardy and I have been trying to

482
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:33,719
get this paper published for 20 20 years

483
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:36,759
and no one would publish it until last

484
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,880
year acknowledgements I would these are

485
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:42,240
all the places that we visited talk to

486
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:46,640
zillions of people to get the

487
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,640
documentation for our

488
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:53,200
story The End thank

489
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,038
you I would like to entertain questions

490
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,600
if you have

491
00:23:55,038 --> 00:24:01,480
them hold on do you have a question Judy

492
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:05,199
question it has less to do with ethics

493
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:09,240
and more to do with the biodiversity of

494
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:12,200
Bahamas Judy can you hear

495
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:15,359
me me to come up can you hear Judy yeah

496
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,519
I can hear her okay good biodiversity of

497
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:20,759
the Bahamas you said something about

498
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:24,319
concerned with hurricanes slamming the

499
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:26,798
the Caribbean that there are some FL

500
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:29,158
that may be at

501
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:32,398
risk

502
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:34,080
what's the question question was are you

503
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:38,158
concerned about H

504
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:43,558
hurricanes um hitting the Bahamas and

505
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:47,640
and wiping out species oh absolutely um

506
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:53,359
yes um we we lost uh we lost a lot of

507
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:56,360
plants uh during Hurricane Dorian um and

508
00:24:53,359 --> 00:25:00,719
uh one of the things that's important

509
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:03,038
for the herbarium is to document the

510
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,360
plants that were there and what and any

511
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:08,359
that might have been lost so right now

512
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:10,000
we're in the process of doing that and

513
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:14,839
Ethan freed and the Bahamas National

514
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:17,278
Trust is working on uh that project um I

515
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:18,678
haven't been directly to the Bahamas in

516
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:21,798
a while but but I have colleagues who

517
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:24,600
are working on S Salvador and uh

518
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:26,440
fortunately the the hurricanes on S

519
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:30,639
Salvador haven't been as devastating as

520
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:34,360
ones in uh the uh the more the more

521
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,640
Western Islands but uh sure we we are

522
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:38,959
definitely concerned about the that and

523
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,240
I've written a recent article on the

524
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,519
Bahama

525
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,759
endemics uh as has Ethan freed and um

526
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:48,558
we've published the importance of the

527
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:51,558
endemics On and On which Islands they

528
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:53,798
are and the one we the publication that

529
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:56,158
we recently wrote was uh about the

530
00:25:53,798 --> 00:26:00,480
endemics that we found on S Salvador

531
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:03,240
which are fortunately still safe um but

532
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,679
I just learned recently that the Duke

533
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:09,919
University herbarium was is being closed

534
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:14,759
and that is such a shame because um how

535
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:17,480
are we going to document loss of of uh

536
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:21,839
diversity if the herbaria are not being

537
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:24,399
kept kept up so um yeah it's it it is

538
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:27,319
definitely a concern uh but uh but the

539
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:31,000
other thing that's important is to plant

540
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:33,918
uh trees like uh or not not definitely

541
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,599
necessarily trees but but mangrove trees

542
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:40,880
uh specifically along the coast so that

543
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:45,000
they can protect the Inland Coastline uh

544
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:48,840
and when the when the mangroves get

545
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:53,839
destroyed or are cut down uh that causes

546
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:57,918
uh a big problem uh so we've we've um

547
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:59,879
advocated for replanting Bahamian

548
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,440
species of mangroves that have been

549
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:06,640
destroy taken out and they are doing

550
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,720
that um in many places right now so I

551
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,278
don't know if that answers your question

552
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,798
or not but those are my comments yeah

553
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:14,159
she says it answered your question I

554
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:16,079
have a question as well are there any

555
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:19,320
invasive species that are causing

556
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:23,079
problems in in the Bahamas oh absolutely

557
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:25,439
yeah we have a list of invasives and um

558
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:27,158
there's really not a lot that we can do

559
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,960
about it I mean you know it's just like

560
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,840
in haw they've been going through places

561
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,798
and pulling them out and um you know we

562
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:36,480
do that on St Salvador too fortunately

563
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:38,759
St Salvador is like way out there and

564
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,960
and so we don't have as many invasives

565
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:43,480
as some of the other Islands if I go

566
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,919
back to this uh

567
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:50,200
picture do you see my screen or not I

568
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:53,278
need to share again oh never mind okay

569
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:56,319
so anyway Sans Salvador is way out there

570
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:57,640
um and and is one of the islands that

571
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:59,359
actually I don't know if you know the

572
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,399
are familiar with San Salvador Island

573
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:05,278
but it was the first one that Columbus

574
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:09,518
landed on when he came to the New World

575
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:12,200
um and um there's if you go to his log

576
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:14,359
you can see all the trees and plants

577
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,720
that were on S Salvador when Columbus

578
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:19,479
first landed and we we now know how many

579
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,159
of those have been destroyed uh you know

580
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:25,278
because uh because what happened in in

581
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:29,080
the 1700s is that people from the United

582
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:33,119
States came to the Bahamas to establish

583
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:35,839
plantations and um they took out a lot

584
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:37,798
of the trees and shrubs and when they

585
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:41,319
did that all the top soil ended up in

586
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:44,519
the ocean so the plants that are

587
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:50,359
left um are ones that can survive in a

588
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:52,919
zerotic environment and also um can uh

589
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:54,798
have an an association mostly lots of

590
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:58,320
legumes because they have an association

591
00:28:54,798 --> 00:29:03,119
with the fungus um that can provide

592
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:08,720
nutrients so um that's what I can tell

593
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:10,079
you we have several questions um Sam hey

594
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,360
Lee thanks for a great talk I hope you

595
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:15,439
can hear me okay but I'm curious if

596
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:17,519
you've seen ethical issues in funding

597
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,919
from other organizations other than NSF

598
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,839
maybe like Public Funding through the

599
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:25,240
USDA or private funding to The Gates

600
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:27,798
Foundation or something like that I have

601
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,720
not uh looked elsewhere one of the

602
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:34,918
things I can tell you is that NSF now

603
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,159
has a requirement that all rotators take

604
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:39,759
a

605
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:44,600
class on conflicts of interest they have

606
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:47,599
to take one there NSF offers a class

607
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:50,918
monthly and rotators have to take at

608
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:52,798
least one every I forget what the exact

609
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:56,840
number is every every couple of months

610
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:58,679
or at least once a year to uh uh

611
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:00,759
understand conflicts of interest and if

612
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:04,080
you find a conflict of interest or if

613
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:08,720
you think there is one you can report it

614
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:10,558
to the uh counselor um and um so they

615
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,159
have they have ways to do that now and

616
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:15,158
all that stems from this paper from this

617
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:19,039
investigation back in

618
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:21,840
1979 that um that Gillis brought to his

619
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:24,440
congressman and said look you know this

620
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:26,240
grant was stolen from me and and I want

621
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,120
you to investigate

622
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,599
it

623
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:33,639
um

624
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:36,278
yes um I was just curious if you think

625
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:40,240
uh the current conflict of interest

626
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:42,480
policy is sufficient or do we still have

627
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,038
ways to go and and what your suggestions

628
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,640
would be to improve the policies around

629
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:49,679
conflicts of

630
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:53,679
interest yeah I

631
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,278
mean I personally have not I personally

632
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,519
have not

633
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:59,558
um been involved with an National

634
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,319
Science Foundation as a ma matter of

635
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:04,678
fact I have to tell you that that when

636
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:07,480
when Hardy and I first started this

637
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:10,679
project and we wanted to get we did get

638
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,839
one paper published uh in rodora about

639
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:15,720
this guy's gillis's contributions to the

640
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:18,558
Bahama flora and we wanted to say

641
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,880
something about what we found with the

642
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:24,200
conflict of interest and the editor of

643
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,360
RoR said you can't do that you can't

644
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,278
publish it you have to cryptically you

645
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:30,759
have to cryptically write it so that

646
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:32,798
it's not obvious so we modified the

647
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:34,919
paper and he published it but the other

648
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:37,079
thing he said was if you publish this

649
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:39,320
paper you will never ever get an NSF

650
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:41,319
Grant that's what he told us the editor

651
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:42,759
of rodor told us that now that I mean

652
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:45,439
that didn't happen because I do have

653
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:49,000
have gotten NSF grants but we were

654
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:52,080
warned um that if we publish anything

655
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,079
about this we would not be granted

656
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:56,678
funding in the future and it's been over

657
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:59,240
20 years we've been trying to get this

658
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:01,960
paper public published and we couldn't

659
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,679
get it published until very recently

660
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,679
when the people at the hunt Institute

661
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,679
said yeah we'll publish

662
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,480
it so I don't know what I mean I can't

663
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,880
answer your question uh I do not know uh

664
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,159
if there have been recent conflicts of

665
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,720
interests in Grant proposal

666
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:24,880
reviews

667
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:28,038
um but if there have been

668
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:31,278
then people have now have recourse to

669
00:32:28,038 --> 00:32:34,679
report them where they didn't have that

670
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:38,079
before does that answer your question

671
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:40,440
yes thank you yeah a question over here

672
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:45,720
can I uh can I just jump in here this is

673
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:48,679
Larry smart hi Larry uh so I was a copi

674
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:52,319
on an NSF project that was led by Matt

675
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:55,200
Olsen uh at Texas Tech this was in the

676
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:58,918
dimensions of biodiversity

677
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:01,919
program uh it included Matt as a pi

678
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:05,440
myself Steve defasio at w know Steve

679
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:09,440
yeah and

680
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,880
uh uh another colleague at University of

681
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,519
Wisconsin and the original four-year

682
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,519
Grant I thought was very successful I

683
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:19,880
thought we published a ton of papers it

684
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:22,240
was in the US China program so our

685
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:25,960
Chinese collaborators also published a

686
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:30,120
lot and then when we went to renew the

687
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:31,639
project and continue it Matt decided to

688
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:35,319
rotate at

689
00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:37,959
NSF and then Steve decided to rotate at

690
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:40,798
NSF so neither one of them could be

691
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:45,159
listed as pis

692
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:48,599
on uh and even beyond that when it went

693
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:50,600
for review it had to go to a different I

694
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:53,480
think even a different

695
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:56,319
division uh for the decision because

696
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,839
Steve was rotating in that Division and

697
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:02,000
it couldn't they couldn't make a

698
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:06,480
decision uh within that division because

699
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:10,559
he was there uh and in the end it wasn't

700
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:14,838
renewed uh and I partially blame those

701
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:16,759
guys for rotating at NSF because uh they

702
00:34:14,838 --> 00:34:19,320
could not be listed as copi on the

703
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:22,960
renewal proposal uh even though I

704
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:26,240
thought it was a fantastic project but

705
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,000
you know that's life these things happen

706
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,078
but well now has some background on why

707
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,239
that

708
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:33,399
happened and now you know it's Steve is

709
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:35,239
still at NSF so oh yeah yeah yeah I know

710
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:36,799
he he was in he was in the biology

711
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:40,598
Department in at West Virginia

712
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:44,159
University and now he's at NSF yeah

713
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:47,559
yeah thank you for your talk oh you're

714
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,960
welcome your question it's related to

715
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:54,199
the previous questions already but um

716
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:58,000
just curious how you count your case

717
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:59,559
from 1981 in temporary time and how we

718
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,199
should be especially as early

719
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:04,400
researchers be looking out for these

720
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:07,439
conflicts of interest in the NSF and

721
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,440
other granting agencies and yeah just

722
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:13,039
like the stealing of ideas

723
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,800
Etc I I didn't quite hear the whole

724
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:18,000
question I'm sorry it's about early

725
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,280
career um

726
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,838
researchers uh how sh how how should you

727
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:26,000
be concerned about uh conflicts of

728
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:28,799
interest is that yeah how how this case

729
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,880
from 198 one can be situated in

730
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,320
contemporary time oh well yeah okay so I

731
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,920
teach a graduate genetics seminar here

732
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:42,800
at at West Virginia University I co- te

733
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:46,599
it and we um actually presented

734
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:50,160
this this uh story to my class uh as a

735
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:53,119
practice seminar uh a couple weeks ago

736
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:55,358
and um they were they were very

737
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,559
concerned they said that that they these

738
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:59,838
are graduate students so they said they

739
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:02,000
really wanted they were very happy to

740
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:05,000
hear the story and were very interested

741
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,960
in knowing about how to preclude

742
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,519
conflicts of interest uh in in proposals

743
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:15,079
and reviews and not only that but in in

744
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:17,199
reviewing papers as well so I think that

745
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:20,519
the thing to do is use it as a lesson in

746
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:24,480
a graduate seminar maybe um to teach

747
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:26,759
graduate students as we're doing here um

748
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,880
about the possibilities to prevent

749
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,880
conflicts of

750
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,039
interest does that answer the question

751
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:36,039
or

752
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:38,480
not yeah she says yeah okay thank you

753
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:41,599
thank you very much Lee can you hear me

754
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,559
yeah okay yeah when you first wanted to

755
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:47,920
present I didn't realize oh my goodness

756
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:50,279
uh historian can present something

757
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,880
fascinating at least for me I don't know

758
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,680
for all of you online I felt you're not

759
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,599
only a historian almost like a

760
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:00,719
detective

761
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:03,160
I almost felt can be used as a script to

762
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:06,399
make a movie I won't be

763
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:08,639
surprised thank you well if if you think

764
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,800
this is an interesting story you should

765
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,679
uh look forward to reading my book about

766
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,560
Barbara mlto where I've uncovered a

767
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:17,519
whole bunch of documentation that

768
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:19,078
reverses a lot of Mythology so that

769
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:21,719
should be out in June I'm just giving

770
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:24,720
you a little bit of

771
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:28,078
a a warning a

772
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:31,439
warning related to that I felt 20 years

773
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:35,760
you have been so uh devoted to this

774
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:38,639
publication almost on a mission so yeah

775
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,079
go ahead yeah so I'm wondering when you

776
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:44,239
origin asked that question that was

777
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:47,680
completely without any uh background is

778
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:51,279
just uh just a question you already have

779
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:53,440
some uh hint some information so you

780
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:57,079
were no I did I didn't have any hint at

781
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,800
all all I knew is that I was looking for

782
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:01,760
Publications to include in my book from

783
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:07,400
that which was published in

784
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:09,599
1991 and um uh in order to document the

785
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,160
the uh Publications that had been

786
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,480
already

787
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:17,118
uh done for the island of San Salvador

788
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,039
uh I wanted to make sure I found

789
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,119
everything that I could include in my in

790
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:23,039
my

791
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:24,559
bibliography um for my students so that

792
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:27,039
they could go to the primary papers

793
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:28,960
because from at one of the things loved

794
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:31,039
about learning at Cornell is that

795
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,358
Cornell always required when I was

796
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:37,039
taking classes required us to read

797
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:38,960
primary papers rather than reviews uh

798
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:42,639
and and every class that I took we' get

799
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:46,519
a handout with primary papers to read

800
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:49,759
and and so I took that as a as a a way

801
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:52,318
of teaching and and and whenever I write

802
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,160
a paper or you know wrote my books I

803
00:38:52,318 --> 00:38:57,000
always tried to find the primary papers

804
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:59,559
and so I was looking for the primary

805
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,599
papers and they weren't listed in this

806
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:05,358
book and and so I said to Hardy how come

807
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:09,400
they're not listed why were they

808
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:11,960
ignored and uh the answer is that uh you

809
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,358
know this guy the Corrals didn't want

810
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,880
any part of Gillis they didn't want him

811
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:18,799
involved in in their project at all it

812
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,079
was a coverup I

813
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:25,200
think so that's you know like I I sort

814
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:28,119
of this project it just fell into my lap

815
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:30,239
and Hardy was wonderful in collaborating

816
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:33,079
with me as a matter of fact the first

817
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:35,559
paper that I tried to publish on his on

818
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:38,920
the contributions of Bill Gillis when I

819
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:41,719
sent it to the rodora the editor did not

820
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:44,200
want to publish it at all as I mentioned

821
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:46,318
and so I called Hardy on the phone and I

822
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:48,598
said he at the time I think he was the

823
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:50,358
president of the Botanical society and

824
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:51,800
so he picked up the phone and he called

825
00:39:50,358 --> 00:39:53,400
the editor and he goes what is the

826
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,800
matter with you why don't you want to

827
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,519
publish this and he was afraid to

828
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:01,200
publish it because of what we had found

829
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:03,440
and so um I said to the editor well what

830
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:07,199
if I put Hardy's name on the paper and

831
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,760
he goes well that might help so har I I

832
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:10,078
said to Hardy well if you if I'm going

833
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,560
to put your if your name is going to be

834
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,280
on the paper then you have to do

835
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:15,199
something you have to write part of this

836
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,040
paper or it's unethical for me to just

837
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:19,598
stick your name on the paper so he went

838
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:21,639
back and looked through his files and

839
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:26,039
then he added some stuff to the paper

840
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:28,078
and then the paper came out in uh 1993 I

841
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:31,039
think it was uh contributions of Bill

842
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:34,400
Gillis to the floor of the Bahamas and

843
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:34,400
it it's by kassen

844
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:41,159
esba any other questions those of us

845
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:44,279
that have worked with Lee know for for

846
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:48,719
sure that Lee is one persistent person

847
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:51,400
and so um just keep that in mind uh lee

848
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:52,559
I just recently read Daniel Stones book

849
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:56,480

it's a a beautiful a beautiful garden

858
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,079
there it's an incredible place and as a

859
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,519
matter of fact there's a living Bahama

860
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:24,359
collection there uh that the director at

861
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:26,838
the time when Bill Gillis was working

862
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:30,318
there uh had put together this living

863
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:32,880
Bahama collection which uh he was

864
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:34,679
collecting Horticultural varieties that

865
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,800
were zeroic that you know that could

866
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:41,118
survive in a in a Florida

867
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:44,280
environment and um so he wanted to plant

868
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,519
these uh these Horticultural varieties

869
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,079
in the Bah uh in in Florida which he did

870
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:51,119
and if you go there you can find them

871
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:54,079
you can see them um and and that's the

872
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:56,519
only connection that uh the director at

873
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:58,519
the time had to the Flora of of the

874
00:41:56,519 --> 00:42:00,119
Bahamas as a matter of fact Bill Gillis

875
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:02,358
was so upset with him because every time

876
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:04,838
he would collect a specimen and put it

877
00:42:02,358 --> 00:42:06,679
in the herbarium he wouldn't make a

878
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:08,519
label for it to say where it was

879
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:11,318
collected when it was collected you know

880
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:14,079
all that stuff that a taxonomist does

881
00:42:11,318 --> 00:42:16,599
when a taxonomist collects uh plants and

882
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,519
makes a label for the herbarium he never

883
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:21,160
did that he just was interested in what

884
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:25,039
color the plants were and so when Bill

885
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:27,118
Gillis established or the the Bahama uh

886
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:30,400
the I'm sorry the um herbarium for the

887
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:33,960
BAH for the Fairchild tropical garden um

888
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:38,400
in 1968 when he was hired there he be he

889
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:40,280
started the herbarium and um and um and

890
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,680
then decided that he wanted to do a Flor

891
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:45,400
of the Bahamas and the the director

892
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:48,358
whose name I'm not mentioning uh of the

893
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,920
of the uh project uh said you know

894
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:53,119
whatever you want to do it's up to you

895
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,960
you're the you're the researcher and he

896
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,039
said I want to do a floor of the Bahamas

897
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,240
and he said okay fine

898
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:01,318
and and Dick Howard said well you should

899
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:03,558
put a uh you should put a recommendation

900
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:05,960
in a proposal into National Science

901
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:08,519
Foundation and so they submitted it in

902
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,119
1970 and and the director's name was not

903
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:13,599
on it except the cover letter which said

904
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:16,760
yes he's working at my institution and

905
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:19,200
it's okay for him to to submit this

906
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:21,040
proposal uh but years later then he says

907
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:22,318
no it belong the The Proposal belonged

908
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:25,039
to the

909
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:26,679
institution so questions for Lee we're

910
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:29,400
getting close to

911
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:30,838
running out of time there's one CH

912
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,838
there's one in the

913
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:34,358
chat okay you want to read it to me

914
00:43:32,838 --> 00:43:35,199
please because I'm not doing very well

915
00:43:34,358 --> 00:43:37,639
with

916
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:39,719
this what's the

917
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:41,639
question anything known about

918
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:44,558
professional relationship between Gillis

919
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:48,480
and Carell strong Mutual dislike

920
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:51,240
preceding the uh NSF proposal what is so

921
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:54,199
striking to me Beyond plagiarism is the

922
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:58,078
subsequent ignoring of gillis's work in

923
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:58,078
Carell's book and this is from

924
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:04,079
okay so I I can answer that um all right

925
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:06,239
so Gillis was working at the at

926
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:08,480
Fairchild tropical garden and he was

927
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:10,000
fired he was fired because he didn't get

928
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,800
along with the

929
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,639
director and the director uh fired him

930
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,640
and then he went to Harvard to continue

931
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:22,960
the project of the Bahama Flora at

932
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:27,679
Harvard and um the director of the

933
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:30,838
Fairchild tropical garden then

934
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:34,239
contacted Carell who was at the time

935
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:36,599
program director at NSF and while he was

936
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:38,919
program director he and his wife went to

937
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:42,039
the Fairchild tropical garden and had a

938
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:44,599
meeting and it's all documented that

939
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:48,199
they met and said we're going to write a

940
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:49,480
Bahama flora and so then the director

941
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:54,719
took the grant

942
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:56,679
proposal and uh rewrote it along with

943
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:58,919
Carell and his wife

944
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:02,399
and when gilis found out that they were

945
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:06,079
going to redo or submit the grant

946
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:10,039
proposal and had gotten it he said he

947
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,680
wrote letters to Carell zillions of well

948
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:14,440
a couple dozen letters to Carell and he

949
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:17,000
kept saying I'm here to help you I'm

950
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,838
here to help you what do you need and he

951
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,880
and every time he published a paper he

952
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:24,880
would send the paper to Carell and I've

953
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:26,880
got a stack of papers that was signed by

954
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,039
Bill Gillis that was sent to Fairchild

955
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,880
tropical garden to Carell saying here

956
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:33,800
are the papers I'm writing about the

957
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,000
Bahama Flora none of them are cited in

958
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,000
his

959
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:41,598
