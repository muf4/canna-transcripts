1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,960
University you'll excuse me I'm still a

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:16,719
little numb from uh my walk uh across

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,160
campus I parked quite far from here and

5
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:23,079
I've just gotten off a 4-Hour uh road

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,359
trip to arrive but it's a pleasure to be

7
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:28,639
here thank you to Martina and Hol for in

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:31,759
inviting me and to our Horticulture

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,480
colleagues for donating the lot uh it's

10
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:37,320
appreciated um Martina mentioned about

11
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:40,078
25 years i' I've actually been at this

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,320
for over 40 years in different settings

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,878
I I started out as a Us Peace Corps

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,759
volunteer working around water and

15
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,280
agriculture irrigation issues in the

16
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,599
very early

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:56,520
1980s uh in East Africa Kenya and

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,800
Tanzania and um in that time I was

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,199
working with small farmers in a variety

20
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,878
of different settings dealing with a a

21
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:06,280
challenging environment at the time

22
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:09,438
there was very serious drought extended

23
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,960
prolonged drought leading to a lot of uh

24
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:14,359
famine a lot of

25
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:16,599
insecurity issues around uh water

26
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:18,640
scarcity that I was I was dealing with

27
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:21,879
then which intrigued me enough to want

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,960
to go back and do my PhD in the same

29
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:27,759
reason on Farmer managed irrigation and

30
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,919
I almost did the PHD here at

31
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,560
Cornell uh the only reason I didn't is

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,840
because the colleague the people I

33
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,040
wanted to work with were going

34
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,960
on extended

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,200
sabatical and weren't going to be

36
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:45,438
available for me for about a year or

37
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,640
possibly even longer so I'm sure it was

38
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,559
my loss in many respects not to come to

39
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,718
Cornell to study here but I was

40
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,840
certainly inspired in my own research at

41
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:57,399
that time uh from the work that was

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,359
being done and have continued to be so

43
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,000
over uh many years

44
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:06,159
but it was a few years later that I was

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,679
doing my PhD research in in the same

46
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,840
region looking at uh farmer managed

47
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:13,800
irrigation systems and we were I was

48
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,080
part of a a program that was managed by

49
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,480
the World Resources Institute and

50
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,280
Washington called from the ground up and

51
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,039
it was looking at community-based

52
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,959
natural resource management and a whole

53
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:28,400
set of different practices of local

54
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:32,280
Innovation around uh

55
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,319
nrm um and we had a survey instrument

56
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,878
that we were implementing in a number of

57
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:40,799
different communities that was extremely

58
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:43,679
long very laborious for the researchers

59
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,879
to carry out and to analyze and of

60
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,319
course it was rather a boring and and

61
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:51,840
difficult process for the for the local

62
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:54,318
people who were responding to this

63
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,878
partway through the process of doing

64
00:02:54,318 --> 00:03:00,479
that we were we had a visit from uh two

65
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:03,280
colleagues from the UK a gentleman named

66
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,878
Robert Chambers and the other Gordon

67
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,318
Conway the first was someone who' worked

68
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:10,679
for many years around rural development

69
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:13,439
policy and practice the other around

70
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,959
Agro agroecosystems analysis they were

71
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,158
dear friends and collaborators and they

72
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:21,280
were early Pioneers in what was called

73
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:24,079
rapid rural appraisal and agroecosystem

74
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,560
Analysis so they came to a room like

75
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,879
this in Nairobi I happened to attend

76
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,438
with several colleagues and they

77
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:34,679
introduced those approaches those tools

78
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:38,639
and methods in that and talked about

79
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:41,760
surve survey slavery the overuse of of

80
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,039
surveys in in social science research

81
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:47,199
and the need to really think differently

82
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:50,079
about how we engage with local people in

83
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,959
our research processes and we were

84
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,799
grappling with this many of the same

85
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,640
questions that they were engaging with

86
00:03:53,799 --> 00:04:00,840
in places like uh Thailand and India

87
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:03,119
Indonesia and but nobody had really

88
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,920
encountered some of these ideas at that

89
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:10,280
point and and and had them presented in

90
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:12,479
such clear and concise ways that got us

91
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,959
very excited and we said let's try it

92
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,439
here and we actually scrapped some of

93
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,798
the survey work we were doing we started

94
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:23,319
testing these ideas this was the early

95
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:27,159
80s 87 80 or late 80s

96
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:29,439
8788 and we developed and adapted the

97
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,840
approach to call it participatory rural

98
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:35,000
approach or

99
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:38,000
p uh during that time Robert invited me

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,279
to come to IDs still a great as a

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,639
graduate student to present some of

102
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:44,119
those results and some of our initial

103
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,639
thinking about

104
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,519
that and at that time there was a a set

105
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:53,000
of discussions going on about how do we

106
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:55,918
put Farmers first in the agricultural

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,199
research and development process to put

108
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:01,478
the more Center center stage in this as

109
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,240
active Partners what I'm going to take

110
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:07,680
you through is is the uh history of that

111
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,439
from the point of view of three books

112
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,199
and some inspiring insights and ideas

113
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:15,519
that Martina and Hal have kind of

114
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,960
instigated a further thinking about how

115
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:20,318
we can take some of these ideas for

116
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:22,198
forward by looking back at what we've

117
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,280
learned and what we've achieved but also

118
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:28,400
what we didn't and where we might go in

119
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:31,559
future so that that's it in a nutshell

120
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:35,279
so I'm going to we are so I'll provide

121
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,879
an overview of three farmer first books

122
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:41,198
covering a period of about 20

123
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:43,600
years describing how we were engaging in

124
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,160
different debates over that period

125
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,600
around these ideas of farmer

126
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,639
participatory research then I'll I'll go

127
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,840
through and compare and contrast some of

128
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,240
the the different views and approaches

129
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:58,439
to putting Farmers first how those have

130
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,840
evolved in that period and then take

131
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:03,719
stock of some of the the current

132
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,599
political economic institutional uh

133
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,080
context in which agricultural research

134
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,199
and development is taking place today

135
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:13,038
then talk a little bit about the project

136
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,598
that Hol and Martina and I with some

137
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,318
other colleagues are embarking on now

138
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:19,879
try to examine some of these

139
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:22,400
participatory research and extension

140
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:25,000
ideas and in National systems in

141
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:27,560
different parts of the world be happy to

142
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,079
take questions after

143
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,680
that so as I said we we there were three

144
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:37,038
books produced over a period that

145
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,400
covered from the the late 80s to the end

146
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:42,560
of the the uh nautis and it was

147
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:45,598
essentially 20 years where we were

148
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,360
engaging across the the world really

149
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:51,519
both North and South with Partners in

150
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,038
many uh different contexts those working

151
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,439
within the consultative group on

152
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:58,639
International agricultural research the

153
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:01,240
national systems but also a lot of NOS

154
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,759
University colleagues people in many

155
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,960
many different settings the First Farmer

156
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,720
first second what we called Beyond

157
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:12,918
farmer first and then farmer first

158
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,560
Revisited and the three of them together

159
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:18,159
as as Martina mentioned kind of

160
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,639
elaborated this the philosophical

161
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,599
underpinnings some of the methodological

162
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,720
dimensions of what we've called The

163
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:28,000
Farmer first approach or Paradigm these

164
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,680
were linked to three international

165
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,639
workshops that were hosted at IDs at at

166
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,918
different points and brought together

167
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:39,960
over a hundred uh Scholars practitioners

168
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:42,719
um in different uh from different parts

169
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:44,839
of the world so the first was farmer

170
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,120
first on Farmer Innovation and

171
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:50,079
agricultural research I mentioned my

172
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,840
colleague Robert Chambers now in his 90s

173
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:57,038
as of about a month ago he said I'm no

174
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:59,758
longer uh responding to email uh but he

175
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:02,199
actually produced a book last year so he

176
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,280
he's been quite prolific in his his

177
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:07,840
working life and has been in my uh

178
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:12,198
opinion highly influential in the area

179
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:15,239
of rural development uh research and and

180
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:19,038
planning but he worked with a couple of

181
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:22,478
other colleagues Arnold pacy lauan thr

182
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:24,759
who um together edited all the

183
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:27,158
proceedings from the First Farmer first

184
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:29,960
conference and really the focus was on

185
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:32,319
challenging this notion of a linear View

186
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:35,799
of transfer of Technology from the

187
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,760
scient scientists as experts to the

188
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:41,439
farmers as beneficiaries as clients as

189
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:43,120
recipients of their knowledge wisdom

190
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,760
insights and

191
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,000
Innovations and the argument was we've

192
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,559
got to move away from that top- down

193
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,839
science-led approach think much more

194
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,559
about what we're missing from all the

195
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,760
far local knowledge and and practice and

196
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:00,119
Innovation how can we bring that

197
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:02,679
together in a more meaningful way to

198
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,720
respect those knowledges those practices

199
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:06,958
those experiences of those rural

200
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,240
producers who of course live in those

201
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,039
places and know their context better

202
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,959
than

203
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:14,799
anyone one of the key areas and this is

204
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:17,759
an area that I've focused much of my

205
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:20,199
working career on partly respons uh

206
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:23,399
inspired by Robert and and the farmer

207
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,959
first work is what we call broadly the

208
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,839
complex diverse risk-prone environments

209
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:31,439
the Arid semi-arid lands the places the

210
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:33,240
sloping lands that are much harder to

211
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,240
manage where you have a lot of

212
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,480
challenges with soil water nutrient

213
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,839
management where you have problems with

214
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,600
productivity because of low fertility

215
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,440
where you have problems of getting

216
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,800
access to markets access to advisory

217
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,880
Services because of their remoteness in

218
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:52,799
many cases but where a lot of poor

219
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:54,759
people live and continue to rely on

220
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,240
agriculture for their

221
00:09:54,759 --> 00:10:00,278
livelihoods uh and I continue to work in

222
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,720
tropical drylands around the world

223
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:05,278
and so they were a asking for can we

224
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,000
have a much more adaptive integrated

225
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:10,639
approach to agricultural research and

226
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,078
extension in those

227
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:16,759
places so that focus on putting Farmers

228
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:19,479
first became that that Central lesson

229
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:21,559
that Central focus and it was picked up

230
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,959
some of these insights from this book

231
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:26,479
and others like it there was parallel

232
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:29,518
work going on with colleagues in in

233
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,360
other parts of the world in Asia in uh

234
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,959
places like the Philippines and India

235
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,278
very Innovative work in in Europe in the

236
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:39,078
Netherlands and and Germany and

237
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:41,720
Elsewhere on things like participatory

238
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:44,479
technology development was called and

239
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,040
participatory uh uh farmer Innovation

240
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,920
the whole set of different approaches

241
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:53,360
that were all very complimentary drawing

242
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:55,159
on many of the same principles even if

243
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:00,560
they were using somewhat different

244
00:10:55,159 --> 00:11:02,759
methods and and and tools in in the work

245
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:05,359
and there was this whole proliferation

246
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:09,480
it was probably the most exciting time

247
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:12,440
of my career and and very uh honestly

248
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,959
the most exhausting because we didn't

249
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,560
stop for a period of about five or six

250
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:20,359
years there was this explosion of work

251
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:22,719
that was going on around uh farmer-led

252
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,480
breeding participatory crop trials

253
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,800

256
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,919
gred nutrient management all of these

257
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,440
things were bubbling up in different

258
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,958
quarters people were experimenting

259
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:42,279
everywhere but always with this notion

260
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:44,759
of that farmers are active Partners in

261
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:47,759
that research and development process

262
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:50,200
that they were Central to innovation in

263
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:53,720
in those settings so this is I'm talking

264
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,600
a period of the the 1990s now and that's

265
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,480
when a lot of exciting work was

266
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,200
happening now one of the things that

267
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,440
farmer first was stressing was that this

268
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,278
is not a an argument against

269
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,920
Agricultural Science or scientists we

270
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:10,838
need those University uh uh researchers

271
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:12,479
we need those people in the the

272
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:14,880
international agricultural research

273
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,879
system but we need to think differently

274
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,159
about the relationship between science

275
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,838
and Farmers what we're talking about is

276
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:24,278
reversing some of those power relations

277
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,199
and changing some of those hierarchies

278
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:30,198
that were quite evident in in earlier

279
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:30,198
periods

280
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:39,439
now I was not involved in that first

281
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:41,519
book but uh I was on the wave and was

282
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,360
working with Robert working with many of

283
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,399
the other colleagues who were had

284
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,919
convened that first conference in uh in

285
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,278
a variety of settings and with my

286
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:52,679
colleague Ian scons we were both then at

287
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:56,198
the international institute for

288
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:58,679
environment development IID in London we

289
00:12:56,198 --> 00:13:02,519
said this is fantastic we were involved

290
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:05,679
in this work but we also saw that there

291
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:08,039
were some concerns about power and

292
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:10,799
politics the political economy of

293
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:12,480
agricultural research and extension that

294
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,879
we didn't feel were really being

295
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,920
addressed and this comes back to some of

296
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:20,360
those reversing of hierarchies that just

297
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:23,159
because we're promoting some of these

298
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,159
participatory approaches it doesn't mean

299
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:27,319
that we're seeing a real change in the

300
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:30,159
principles and in the attitudes and

301
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:33,879
behavior or in the instit tional

302
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:36,719
structures that of agencies uh

303
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:40,278
universities and others still being very

304
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,360
vertically oriented very top down very

305
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:44,879
hierarchical and we needed to think

306
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,600
about how we changed some of that to

307
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,958
really make this work so our point is if

308
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,278
we're going to do that we've got to get

309
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:54,638
the grips with the politics of knowledge

310
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:56,439
in these different settings so we were

311
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,839
asking questions about whose knowledge

312
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,399
counts how is knowledge constructed and

313
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:03,839
in these encounters between farmers

314
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,720
researchers and extensionists in in

315
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,600
different

316
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,320
settings and so the book was was an

317
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,480
attempt to extend the work of farmer

318
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,759
first but it was also a challenge to

319
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,959
many of the proponents of the farmer

320
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:21,278
first thinking because we viewed some of

321
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,679
the the participatory work as somewhat

322
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:26,799
naive that just because people were

323
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:29,159
using these new methods and tools and

324
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:32,000
and in a variety of settings that we

325
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:33,879
were going to see those reversals and we

326
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
were saying no it's not that simple

327
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:38,679
there are structural constraints that

328
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,320
are very real that need to be addressed

329
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:43,638
and these are fundamental if we're

330
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,560
really going to see those those flips so

331
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:50,360
that was that was a a challenge to our

332
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:53,838
participatory proponents as well as more

333
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,199
mainstream uh agricultural research and

334
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,320
development so the Central Central

335
00:14:56,198 --> 00:15:00,599
themes were drawn from the sociology of

336
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,800
knowledge and iological political

337
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,879
ecological insights into Notions about

338
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:09,958
agricultural uh knowledge and practice

339
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:12,278
and the argument was for a more nuanced

340
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:15,879
more sophisticated stance in

341
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:18,838
understanding uh these these uh

342
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:21,078
relationships and also the arrangements

343
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,560
the institutional and policy

344
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:27,719
Arrangements around

345
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:29,638
them and again we said uh this required

346
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,800
understanding rural knowledge is on

347
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:35,120
their own terms not something that was

348
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,439
people were always so comfortable with

349
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,679
and seeking dialogue rather than simply

350
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,560
trying to document what farmers are

351
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:44,399
already doing in their everyday

352
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:47,439
practices and Notions of indigenous

353
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:51,000
technical knowledge were very itk uh

354
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,959
rural people's knowledge very widely uh

355
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,318
uh being discussed and described then

356
00:15:53,958 --> 00:16:00,119
but still ultimately a very externally

357
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:02,399
driven technocratic pro project that we

358
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:06,600
were observing even if it was dressed up

359
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,600
in that language of participatory

360
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:15,120
research um some years later Ian and I

361
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,839
moved on from IID we still work with our

362
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,560
colleagues there in London but for a

363
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:22,639
variety of reasons we we moved to the

364
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:24,638
south coast of England to Brighton where

365
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,278
at the University of Sussex the The

366
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,198
Institute of development studies is

367
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:32,278
based he went some years before me I I

368
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:35,359
followed as Martina said

369
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:37,600
2006 and when I arrived I said to Ian

370
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,199
you know we're looking back at 20 years

371
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,319
nearly of all this work on Farmer

372
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:45,078
participatory research wouldn't it be

373
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:46,759
interesting to take stock to look at

374
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:51,359
what's happened over this period what

375
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:54,240
worked and what didn't and why and so we

376
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,919
uh Robert also was still there with us

377
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,318
although in a more of an ameritus role

378
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:01,958
then um so we organized a conference

379
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:04,519
Martina mentioned the farmer uh the

380
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:07,078
future agricultures Consortium that's a

381
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:09,439
partnership with colleagues in about a

382
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:11,000
dozen subsaharan African countries we've

383
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,880
been working with on the political

384
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,919
economy of agricultural policy in Africa

385
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:23,039
for the last uh 20 years and our ESR

386
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:25,480
esrc step Center which stands for social

387
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:27,798
technological and environmental Pathways

388
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,798
to sustainability and that's really

389
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:33,440
looking at Pathways to transformative

390
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:36,160
sustainability processes not just in

391
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,880
food and agriculture but in a variety of

392
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:42,600
domains as we call them health and

393
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:45,520
disease energy and and others and so we

394
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:48,119
used resources and our networks from

395
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,119
from steps and and future agricultures

396
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:53,159
to

397
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:55,959
convene the third event and at that time

398
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,880
things had moved on in the debate to

399
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,200
focus a lot more on Innovation systems

400
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,720
in agriculture the World Bank had been

401
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,640
picking up on these Notions some of the

402
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:09,839
development agencies had done so and it

403
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,240
was decentering in some ways the the

404
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:15,359
role of farmers it was taking this

405
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:18,599
systems perspective to understand all

406
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:21,918
these linkages relationships the flow of

407
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:24,279
of products knowledge uh resources in

408
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:27,559
different forms through that that

409
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:31,839
agricultural system and that included

410
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:34,440
research uh insights and and so on so

411
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:36,839
this is now the late uh 2000s when this

412
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,600
was all going on we used it as an

413
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:41,119
opportunity to revisit some of those

414
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:44,158
older debates about farmer participatory

415
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:47,319
research but also explore that wider

416
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:49,760
context of a Innovation both from a

417
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:51,759
systems perspective and as I say from

418
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:55,919
that political economy perspective the

419
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:58,440
more critical uh social science angle to

420
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:02,799
uh interrogate some of the the thinking

421
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:05,200
of that time and we not only were

422
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:07,558
examining some of the state-led R&amp;D

423
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,960
efforts but these wider networks because

424
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:13,038
the other thing that had evolved was it

425
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,240
not just the role of the state in

426
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:17,599
providing Agricultural Extension

427
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,519
research support in in different

428
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:23,359
quarters but also private sector actors

429
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:25,440
there was a huge proliferation then of

430
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:28,719
of that and that lots of talk about

431
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:32,360
public private Partnerships including in

432
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:35,279
in the agricultural uh sector and so we

433
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:37,639
wanted to examine that as part of that

434
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,879
discussion as well so the focus was on

435
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,200
the politics of innovation and the way

436
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:45,679
the farmers were included or as we saw

437
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,319
often excluded from that as I said

438
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,559
they've been decentered they're no

439
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:51,759
longer that focal point because the

440
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:54,839
interest was less about what was

441
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:58,200
happening on the farm but beyond the

442
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:59,199
farm gate and looking at Value chains

443
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,679
and

444
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,720
networks and all these other linkages

445
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,280
and all these other actors which is fine

446
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,319
but what about the role of the The

447
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:12,240
Producers

448
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:14,359
themselves so I'm going to leave these

449
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,480
slides with you I don't know if Martina

450
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:18,359
and you've already shared these but

451
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,360
please feel free to do so I'm not going

452
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:23,439
to go through all of this in detail I'll

453
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,678
just try to touch on some highlights

454
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,759
because this is a couple an extended

455
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:32,038
table that was initially generated at

456
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:35,519
the end of our our work in Farmer first

457
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:37,720
uh Revisited and it was an attempt to to

458
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:41,440
describe some of those different eras

459
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:44,000
from the 60s through the 70s and 80s 90s

460
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,558
and up bringing it up to the present at

461
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,519
that time in the late

462
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:51,038
2000s so just to focus on the the first

463
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:53,000
one we were looking at the mental models

464
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:55,158
of some of these activities and going

465
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,919
back to the beginning it was very much

466
00:20:55,159 --> 00:21:00,559
that Supply through a a particular uh

467
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,840
technological pipeline there was a lot

468
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:05,440
of in farming systems research the

469
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:08,279
surveys I described and that that

470
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,159
overuse I should I would say of of the

471
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:14,038
different sorts of farm surveys and and

472
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:16,000
household surveys through the farmer

473
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:18,919
first area this promotion of

474
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,200
collaborative research seeing Farmers as

475
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:24,759
partners and following our discussion

476
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,840
all around that system bringing systems

477
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:29,798
perspectives together with all of this

478
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:32,918
seeing these innovation work centered

479
00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:35,599
around co-development around involving

480
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:38,559
multi-stakeholder processes often some

481
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:41,599
messy Partnerships in

482
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:44,599
there and then looking at farmers and

483
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,918
their roles in this farmers seen by the

484
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:49,119
scientists themselves in the early days

485
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,320
it was seeing them as there were they

486
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:53,719
would be described in terms of well we

487
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:56,480
have these Progressive farmers who adopt

488
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,600
our ideas and and Technologies they're

489
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,759
they're often the innovators the

490
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:02,759
adopters but then they're the laggards

491
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:04,798
you know and they have various reasons

492
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:07,519
why they won't adopt these new

493
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:10,519
Innovations these new practices and

494
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:13,480
Technologies um and we need to Enlighten

495
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:16,359
them to inform them to show them the way

496
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:19,278
and that we have our uh a better

497
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:21,918
approach and then you have those who in

498
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:24,798
the farming systems era was seen as

499
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,960
objects of study but also sources of

500
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:29,839
information through the farmer first

501
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,120
areas eras I said an attempt to really

502
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,720
see them as Co colleagues and

503
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:37,319
collaborators and that continued through

504
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,880
this people- centered Innovation process

505
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:42,879
a lot more focus on organized groups and

506
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,799
Collective action issues and thinking

507
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,919
about that and exert and the politics of

508
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:51,918
demand we were calling it of having them

509
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:54,720
articulate what they need the scientists

510
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,799
to be working on not just to be having

511
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,159
the scientists do the research and then

512
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:02,000
generate that information even if it's

513
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:02,000
done with

514
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:07,278
them and then the scientists from the

515
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,440
farmer point of view well back in the

516
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:11,400
transfer of Technology day they saw

517
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,759
extension workers they never saw the a

518
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:17,720
scientists who were often developing the

519
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:20,519
new technologies and practice on station

520
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,360
not on the farm so they weren't very

521
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:25,759
visible and the farming system era they

522
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:27,798
used our land that the the scientists

523
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:29,960
would come and do experiments but they

524
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:33,000
would essentially managed them and then

525
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,960
they'd ask some questions of the farmers

526
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,919
and during that farmer first

527
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,360
participatory era they were sometimes

528
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:41,080
seen as uh the scientists I'm talking

529
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,839
about from the farmer point of view

530
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:47,119
friendly consumers of our time very nice

531
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:49,240
to have a visit but I've got to get on

532
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:51,959
with other things you know I've got the

533
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,159
the goats or the cows or the the the

534
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:58,919
crops to look

535
00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:00,400
after and then by this era more about

536
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:02,799
there are multiple sources of

537
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,720
information the scientists being one of

538
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:07,519
many that we're we're getting and that

539
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,880
has continued to this day this kind of

540
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:13,400
fracturing of of of information and and

541
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,360
multiple sources available the challenge

542
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,919
is how do you weigh up all that

543
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:20,678
information how do you make use of that

544
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:23,720
and and who can you trust to provide you

545
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:26,640
with the information and insights you

546
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,798
need when it came to knowledge and and

547
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,200
and disciplines all often in the

548
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:34,398
transfer of Technology Days it was very

549
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,840
much a uh a single disciplinary uh

550
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:39,558
approach often related to crop plant

551
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:42,359
breeding in those days by the farming

552
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:45,278
systems era was an attempt to be be more

553
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:48,319
interdisciplinary and bring in uh even

554
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:51,398
some social sciences like economics and

555
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:57,038
sociology the interdisciplinary era

556
00:24:51,398 --> 00:24:59,798
followed more uh about uh seeing Farmers

557
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:02,720
as experts in in that in that

558
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:06,558
environment and then as we were seeing

559
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:10,000
it possibly more transdisciplinary work

560
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:11,839
more uh holistic more uh bringing

561
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,720
together different culturally rooted

562
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:16,759
knowledges and understandings and and

563
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,399
trying to meld those together in a

564
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:21,879
variety of

565
00:25:18,398 --> 00:25:24,079
ways and then farmer roles in the early

566
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,200
days it was very much about adopting

567
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:28,879
those those transferred Technologies

568
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,720
conforming to conven conventional

569
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:35,240
practice that Green Revolution package

570
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:37,079
approach to things then moving on to be

571
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,798
uh providing information back to the

572
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:43,798
scientists would they then use that in

573
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:47,038
modifying their their uh on Farm trials

574
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:49,839
and so on then during the farmer first

575
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:51,720
year it was very much about working to

576
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:54,879
support Farmers to do their own

577
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,679
diagnosis to do much more experimenting

578
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,880
and testing and adapting to their

579
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,960
context

580
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,480
and and giving them the wherewithal to

581
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:07,720
to allow that to happen and then further

582
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,079
extending that to what we were thinking

583
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,919
hopefully was going to be happening of

584
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:15,960
empowered co- generators of knowledge

585
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:17,960
and really involved as innovators and

586
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,120
negotiators as I said thinking about

587
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,319
that politics of

588
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:24,879
demand I'm not going to go through all

589
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:27,918
of these uh in more detail I've got a

590
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,760
few more yellow arrows here but just I

591
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,120
think I've already covered this to some

592
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:36,000
extent of moving from productivity the

593
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:39,319
farm and then beyond the farm

594
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,319
gate and then moving here as well as

595
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:44,480
I've described from those technology

596
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:46,759
packages all the way through to networks

597
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,440
of innovators uh working together

598
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:53,599
collaboratively learning changing

599
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:56,320
demanding uh support the drivers of of

600
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:59,719
uh some of these uh processes moving

601
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:02,519
from that Supply push to demand pull as

602
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:05,679
we move in this

603
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:07,000
direction and then lastly just to

604
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,080
highlight one other thing and that's

605
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,558
about the central role of Institutions

606
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:15,558
and politics of moving away from that

607
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:17,240
early period of transfer of technology

608
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:21,038
is

609
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:23,519
uh assum that was uh assumed away

610
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:26,679
thinking a lot of the politics was kind

611
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:28,839
of ignored here in the the farmer

612
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:30,399
farming systems era where it was like

613
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:33,720
just kind of a black box it was

614
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:35,959
recognized but not really examined or or

615
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,919
understood during that farmer first

616
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,919
yeara and particularly as we were

617
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,480
getting into the Beyond farmer first

618
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,600
debates and so on it was M making it

619
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,960
much more uh recognized but there was

620
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:51,240
still that concerned about that naive

621
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:54,360
populism and then what we were arguing

622
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,759
in the the farmer first Revisited period

623
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:58,599
that it was much more Central to

624
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:01,398
concerns that if we're really serious

625
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:03,639
about change and transformation then

626
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:07,639
we've got to get to grips with these

627
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:10,640
institutional and political uh

628
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:13,320
questions now at the end of farmer first

629
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:17,159
Revisited this is 2009 that the book

630
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:20,720
came out uh Robert we asked him to write

631
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:24,039
the forward for the book and he always

632
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,679
had uh uh I always found him to be very

633
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:29,599
insightful and a had away with words and

634
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:33,480
a good way of capturing some very

635
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:36,319
complex ex often extended debates and so

636
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:39,480
he wrote in the opening of farmer first

637
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:42,639
Revisited in 20 years more or less where

638
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,919
we have arrived at today if there's

639
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,399
another farmer first Workshop will they

640
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:50,038
say in the latter two of the latter

641
00:28:47,398 --> 00:28:51,798
2000s by then we could see the problems

642
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:54,919
and opportunities and the directions

643
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:57,038
needed for change or will they struggle

644
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:59,278
to imagine themselves trapped in the

645
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:02,558
mindsets methods misunderstandings and

646
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:02,558
Mis misprescribing

647
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:14,360
point a watershed and he went on to say

648
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:16,240
neither is likely in full what happens

649
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:18,240
next will depend not least on getting

650
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,798
the grips with power politics

651
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,679
relationships and

652
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:24,278
reflexivity these have not been

653
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,880
traditional concerns of most funders are

654
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:28,440
those professionally engaged with

655
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,600
agriculture they're outside their normal

656
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,080
interests and comfort zones yet they're

657
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:36,439
crucial for the Transformations needed

658
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:38,839
now and he concluded we was find new

659
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,960
ways to engage in constructive dialogue

660
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:43,240
around these themes and to map new

661
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,440
directions for agricultural research

662
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:49,240
education and

663
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:53,278
development so that's

664
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:55,798
2009 now 15 years later wasn't quite 20

665
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:59,038
but we can take stock now and see how

666
00:29:55,798 --> 00:30:01,918
preent many of those words in the the

667
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:04,558
Robert's preface were we know that a

668
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,399
great deal has changed new shocks and

669
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:09,599
stresses that have been observed from

670
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:11,798
climate change to covid pandemic have

671
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:15,278
big implications for farming livelihoods

672
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:18,879
for agriculture or R&amp;D New Economic

673
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:21,558
relationships and con uh uh connections

674
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,519
Lots related to the market and trade

675
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:27,480
increasingly globalized patterns of of

676
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:29,759
exchange but also fragmented linkages as

677
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,200
well that create all sorts of of

678
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:35,398
problems for producers trying to sell

679
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,960
into different markets in different

680
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:39,959
settings new patterns of urbanization

681
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,798
and industrialization which affects the

682
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:45,798
role of agriculture in in different ways

683
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:48,480
as part of a a wider economic and and

684
00:30:45,798 --> 00:30:50,879
political process and when people talk

685
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,880
about structural transformation of

686
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,559
economies that sometimes agriculture

687
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,440
despite its importance which I'll come

688
00:30:55,558 --> 00:31:01,240
back to is somewhat ignored

689
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,519
even in places where it has been the

690
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:06,440
foundation of much of that

691
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:09,079
economy new agricultural Technologies of

692
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,639
course over this period GMOs lots of

693
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:15,558
climate smart climate resilient crops

694
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:17,879
being uh uh bred all over the world both

695
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:21,200
creating new opportunities but new risks

696
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:24,840
as we know uh in terms of of issues

697
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:27,720
around um the environment around

698
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:30,798
people's control of different products

699
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:33,000
and and their use access of those

700
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:35,038
Technologies we know is an increasing

701
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,480
concern as I mentioned patterns of

702
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:39,158
ownership that shift towards the private

703
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:42,558
sector and we've seen increasing

704
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:45,880
concentration and consolidation of those

705
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:48,599
those large Agra businesses that

706
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:52,799
basically are setting the terms of trade

707
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:56,959
and put a push risk back down the chain

708
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:59,720
towards the producers who uh uh have to

709
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,639
uh bear some of those costs and also in

710
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,399
relation to the provision of global

711
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:06,638
public goods we we know that during the

712
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:09,759
height of the Green Revolution there was

713
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:11,839
huge investment by the state by

714
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:14,638
philanthropic organizations like Ford

715
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:17,240
Foundation Rockefeller Foundation that

716
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:20,359
actually mobilized huge amounts of

717
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:23,558
public support to generate Global public

718
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:26,319
goods to deliver the Green Revolution

719
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:28,278
the first Green Revolution since then as

720
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:31,558
I say there's been this fragment this

721
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:34,638
fracturing this capturing by private

722
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:37,918
actors and and interests of large parts

723
00:32:34,638 --> 00:32:39,798
of the food system meaning that it's

724
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,840
much harder to generate those public

725
00:32:39,798 --> 00:32:46,679
goods and get them out to large numbers

726
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:50,359
of of producers in in different

727
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:53,200
ways so we've got a complex uncertain

728
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:55,000
set of multiscale processes lots of

729
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,558
interactions taking place this

730
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,759
intertwining of the socio Technical and

731
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:02,879
AG eological Dynamics at different

732
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:04,720
scales the emergence of and tensions and

733
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,039
tradeoffs between those different

734
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,720
Pathways uh to food system

735
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:13,038
transformation uh yet a lot Remains the

736
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,960
Same when we really study it hard and

737
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:17,038
look at what's going on particularly

738
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,360
again in those complex diverse

739
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:21,839
risk-prone environments that I mentioned

740
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:24,038
earlier that that farmer first

741
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:26,000
approaches were really concentrating on

742
00:33:24,038 --> 00:33:28,558
to begin with they're the ones most

743
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,558
affected by all that climate uh

744
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:35,839
variability and uncertainty oh I better

745
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:38,839
move on here uh and also uh agriculture

746
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:41,759
Remains the Mainstay of livelihoods in

747
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:44,439
in many places for many rural people

748
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:46,119
it's also a driver of sustained

749
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:50,120
employment-based

750
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:53,599
uh Economic Development so against this

751
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:55,359
backdrop we see that the R&amp;D Community

752
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,038
continues to struggle with the narrow

753
00:33:55,359 --> 00:34:00,558
mindsets restricted methods r

754
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:03,200
organizational structures lots of

755
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:05,000
misunderstandings and Mis prescriptions

756
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,399
as Robert called them about the

757
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,639
capabilities and livelihood aspirations

758
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:13,000
of of rural people in many ways these

759
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,000
reinforc dominant patterns of of

760
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,599
knowledge creation and

761
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,639
application and they exacerbate patterns

762
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,079
of inequity and exclusion in the pursuit

763
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,119
of often those Silver Bullet Solutions

764
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:27,960
those techn fixes that we see in in

765
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:30,919
different places that require more more

766
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:34,320
nuanced often more gender sensitive more

767
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:38,838
context specific

768
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:41,838
Solutions so farmer first again we've

769
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:44,000
had three of them is there a role for

770
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:45,799
some thinking about that the good news

771
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,280
was we know that we've learned a lot

772
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,760
from a lot of the bad practice that

773
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,919
often uh issues about push the push to

774
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,639
go to scale quickly with different

775
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:57,679
Technologies Innovations can lead to all

776
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:00,960
sorts of problems Robert called them

777
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:02,919
rushed and wrong and that can be a real

778
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,280
issue yes we need to scale we need

779
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:08,200
scalable Technologies Innovations

780
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,400
practices but we can get into problems

781
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:13,159
there's the the constant tensions

782
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,519
between participatory approaches driven

783
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:19,279
from below and those top- down drivers

784
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:21,759
practices institutional

785
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,920
Arrangements we also know that there are

786
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,240
these entrenched systemic obstacles to

787
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,480
really farmer centered Innovation

788
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:31,679
related to those institutional cultures

789
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:35,240
and practices but the individual

790
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:38,559
mindsets as well so seeing how these

791
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:39,879
interlock can help us to clarify what we

792
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:42,960
need to

793
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:45,720
change so that brings us to 35 years

794
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,400
after farmer first and the the reason

795
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:51,318
I'm really here with Hal and Martina is

796
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:55,119
to talk about this we've been in uh

797
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:57,759
invited to uh submit a paper to the 50th

798
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:00,838
anniversary of the uh food policy

799
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,240
journal and our focus is really taking

800
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:07,039
stock of what we've leared through those

801
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:10,879
F that farmer first era and draw

802
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:13,880
together insights around all of

803
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,880
that we've got a lot of uh experience

804
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,640
that we're asking these questions what

805
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,680
do we know about the role of farmers in

806
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:22,279
setting research priorities and shaping

807
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:24,399
food policy and to what extent have

808
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,960
National systems and strategies

809
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,280
institutionalized meaningful farmer

810
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,760
participation

811
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,760
in agriculture research and food policy

812
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,680
processes incorporating the principle of

813
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:39,520
including Farmers as co-researchers as

814
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:41,598
joint decision makers in those

815
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:44,440
processes here's the team you'll

816
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:47,000
recognize a few of those names uh I was

817
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,760
Ju Just had the pleasure of being at the

818
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,960
International Food policy Research

819
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,440
Institute in Washington uh with David

820
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,240
Spielman who's part of our team and some

821
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,639
of you may know the name Jacqueline

822
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:59,879
Ashby Jackie is one of the most

823
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:02,318
influential people in this world of

824
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,480
farmer participatory research over the

825
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:07,000
last 40 40 years I would put her up

826
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,920
there with Robert as as someone who's

827
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,440
contributed immensely to the field we

828
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,960
have the the great honor of having her

829
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:17,240
as part of our team to draw on her

830
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:19,280
wisdom and experience so our objective

831
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:20,719
is identify and assess the extent to

832
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,880
which different governance and

833
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:25,239
institutional Arrangements have

834
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,400
successfully helped to construct an

835
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:32,239
enabling policy environment for farmers

836
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:34,440
to then shape and influence public R&amp;D

837
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:36,358
uh agendas in different settings we're

838
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:39,280
doing this as a comparative

839
00:37:36,358 --> 00:37:41,639
multi-regional uh study we're trying to

840
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,640
uh draw together available documents so

841
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:47,000
secondary literature uh combine that

842
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:49,759
with some interviews of key informants

843
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,159
and do uh a narrative analysis of the

844
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,079
changing donor landscape of how donors

845
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:59,440
have framed and responded to these

846
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:59,440
issues over this last four decades

847
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:05,399
a so we want to map the policies and

848
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:08,279
processes and and look at this in in

849
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,200
different uh countries as I mentioned

850
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,920
across these four dimensions and this

851
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:15,559
was uh a contribution that Jackie made

852
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:19,159
to our farmer first Revisited uh

853
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:21,318
Workshop in 2007 looking at inclusion

854
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:23,239
empowerment of farmer organizations I

855
00:38:21,318 --> 00:38:25,920
not just individual Farmers but the

856
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:29,159
organizations that represent them and

857
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,680
may be able to articulate that demand to

858
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:33,799
negotiate with those different actors

859
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:36,919
I'm running short of time strengthening

860
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:39,359
the demand side of innovation uh systems

861
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,880
incorporating the accountability to

862
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:44,039
Farmer priorities for me this is a big

863
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,800
thing that's still missing in many

864
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:49,440
situation decentralization and what she

865
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,599
was describing as flexibilization of

866
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,559
farmer research and extension to

867
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,880
accommodate that local spe locally

868
00:38:54,559 --> 00:39:00,759
specific Focus so that's that top down

869
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:03,599
bottom up tension and and the mix and

870
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:06,440
then transformation of University and

871
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,400
college uh teaching curricula an area

872
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,760
that we picked up quite a lot in the

873
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,680
third volume of farmer first which we

874
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,119
think is really important because the

875
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:16,759
next generation of researchers and

876
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,240
extensionists are being trained in

877
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:22,640
universities worldwide are they being

878
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:26,719
informed about these ideas and

879
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:30,838
approaches or is it still the original

880
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:33,559
kind of conven shall we say uh ideas and

881
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:35,559
insights so we anticipate we'll help

882
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:39,400
make a contribution to the literature I

883
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:41,599
won't belabor this uh and then to think

884
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:44,240
a little bit more about how we can

885
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,480
critically link farmer first principles

886
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:48,679
to now this emerging Food Systems

887
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,800
transformation agenda so things have

888
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:52,960
moved on from agricultural Innovation

889
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,480
systems that I described in the late

890
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,838
2000s and now the focus is very much

891
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,800
about food system transformation

892
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:03,639
and how that can go forward uh there

893
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:05,440
isn't a 35 years after book yet uh but

894
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:07,519
just to give you a sense we think that

895
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,679
this will be among the first that will

896
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:13,480
make a contribution in the area outlined

897
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:16,318
I won't go into all the details and

898
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:18,639
we're so asking are we still putting

899
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:20,000
Farmers first and if so where and under

900
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:22,598
what

901
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,079
conditions uh the first three volumes

902
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:27,760
are available through these links if

903
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:30,039
this gets circulated to people uh it's

904
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,160
now open access the three books so

905
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:35,358
you're more than welcome to download

906
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:38,000
them and as I say this is yet to come as

907
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:39,480
it's more of an idea and I'll stop there

908
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,920
thank you very

909
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:45,880
much uh we have 10 minutes for questions

910
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,880
I

911
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:52,400
yes thanks very much and it's great to

912
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:55,880
hear this overview BR me back to my

913
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:59,318
undergrad Years farmor first work with

914
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:02,358
still very fresh

915
00:40:59,318 --> 00:41:07,079
um and uh Jackie ashp's work really

916
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:10,598
influenced my own early uh work uh in

917
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:13,440
phory research but I'm wondering John

918
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:17,240
why the emphasis in your kind of

919
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:19,960
followup paper on the national systems

920
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:22,959
because we know that agricultural

921
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:26,519
research oh

922
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:28,639
okay round two that's really loud I

923
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:31,199
heard all of it myself but there's

924
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:34,598
people online yeah there's okay my

925
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:36,399
question is why the focus on National

926
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:38,960
systems because we know that

927
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:43,480
agricultural research has really changed

928
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:46,079
so much and the funding in place for

929
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:51,000
National agricultural research is so

930
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:55,000
minuscule compared to um foundation and

931
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,358
international um organizations who fund

932
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,400
uh even if it's a national research

933
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:01,199
they're getting funds from outside of

934
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,599
the national system so that seems like

935
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:08,879
the wrong um place to look for the

936
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:10,318
influence or not of um a kind of farmer

937
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,519
first

938
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:14,480
agenda shall I answer this or do you

939
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:17,358
want to take a few questions first how

940
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,679
do you want to do uh let me answer this

941
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:21,920
one because it's a really important

942
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:24,639
question and it is it's a fair one the

943
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,159
the issue of course is that ultimately

944
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:30,558
it's farmer uh it's National system

945
00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:34,639
systems and national government that has

946
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:37,519
a a huge uh role to play in engaging

947
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:39,639
Farmers on the ground of involving

948
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:41,280
farmers in those processes the

949
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:44,159
international agricultural research

950
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,839
system the CGR and all they work in

951
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:50,440
small places in here and there uh but in

952
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:53,279
terms of ongoing engagement with

953
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:55,639
producers it's National governments that

954
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:59,480
have that responsibility so that that's

955
00:42:55,639 --> 00:43:02,318
one factor uh we recognize that things

956
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,519
are minuscule but the the they also

957
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:08,558
National governments are creating the

958
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:10,920
the enabling environment or not of other

959
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:13,720
actors coming in and working with

960
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:17,119
Farmers so we've seen over the last 25

961
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:19,838
years or so the role of NOS many of them

962
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,760
that we we can go down the list of many

963
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:24,480
different groups that are working and

964
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,200
supporting farmers in those places uh

965
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,318
but they can't operate independently

966
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:33,399
they have to work Under the Umbrella of

967
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:35,838
the state and increasingly that's become

968
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:38,760
more restrictive to some extent in in

969
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:41,880
different countries uh some NOS actually

970
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:45,400
are no longer able to work in in some

971
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:47,680
some places but so it it's that that

972
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:50,280
enabling environment understanding the

973
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:52,279
role of the state in creating that

974
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,760
context that and that includes

975
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:57,319
International actors coming in and

976
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,440
working with Farmers there we're not not

977
00:43:57,318 --> 00:44:01,800
excluding the the look at the

978
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,039
international and there elements that's

979
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,800
why we have David Spielman from ifpri

980
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:09,159
involved that's why we're looking at the

981
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:11,760
donor debate and how that's influenced

982
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:14,118
and changed things over time so we're

983
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,920
looking at that higher level but our

984
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:18,960
focus is understanding well where the

985
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,838
rubber hits the road where things are

986
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,720
supposed to be operationalized at at

987
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:27,078
scale are we seeing it happening in

988
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:31,759
different places is it being instit

989
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:31,760
tionalized embedded in policy and

990
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:38,279
practice uh thanks John wonderful

991
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:40,639
presentation my name is Ed maaya um a

992
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,680
economist I really like the way you

993
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:45,759
integrated you know almost imp passing

994
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:48,199
that the new focus on systems wide

995
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:52,359
thinking that is especially in the light

996
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:54,118
of uh external such as covid and climate

997
00:44:52,358 --> 00:44:55,799
change there a growing thinking there

998
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:59,240
that we need to think beyond the farm

999
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:01,280
gate I'm I'm wondering what uh this

1000
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:03,439
looks like this farmer firstest approach

1001
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,359
what that looks like in this system wide

1002
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,960
lenss where with saying there's much

1003
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:09,960
more activity before the farm gate after

1004
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,720
the farm gate the consumer the all these

1005
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,119
other different players is this

1006
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:15,838
something that we should be replicating

1007
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:17,720
at other nods or should we still you

1008
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:20,358
know there's still a merit to be stayed

1009
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:21,759
about really looking at the farm as kind

1010
00:45:20,358 --> 00:45:23,799
of the ground zero where these things

1011
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,440
meet I was wondering if you'd comment on

1012
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:28,280
how this will evolve in light of this

1013
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:30,400
system

1014
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:33,040
thinking good question and I think there

1015
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,480
are real tensions there as I said there

1016
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:38,199
even under the AIS that agricultural

1017
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:41,199
Innovation systems thinking when that

1018
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:44,118
really took off it was explicitly stated

1019
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:46,159
in in number of the the big strategy

1020
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:49,280
documents that it was about moving

1021
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:51,920
beyond the farm gate and and decentering

1022
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,440
or moving the farmer out of the the

1023
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,880
focus the problem is ultimately

1024
00:45:54,440 --> 00:46:00,480
somebody's producing our food somewhere

1025
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,400
and while everything else all the value

1026
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,559
addition and all the the system

1027
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,599
transformation and ex can be happening

1028
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:09,839
in those other places uh and we need to

1029
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:13,160
examine all of that and understand some

1030
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:15,358
of those institutional and and uh uh

1031
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:18,440
governance dimensions of those Food

1032
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:22,279
Systems at the same time we cannot

1033
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:23,920
ignore or completely neglect producers

1034
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,760
and broadly when I'm talking about

1035
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,720
producers I'm not only thinking about

1036
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:31,720
crop producers but livestock herders and

1037
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:36,879
Farm Workers and people who actually

1038
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:39,480
grow our our produce worldwide and so

1039
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,559
there is certainly a need to look at the

1040
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:43,639
rest of that system and understand the

1041
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:48,240
Dynamics of change what are those

1042
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:50,400
drivers that are binging about either uh

1043
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:53,118
uh system transformation that is

1044
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:57,240
sustainable and Equitable and and so on

1045
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:59,599
or is actually creating more problems in

1046
00:46:57,239 --> 00:47:02,759
externalities and the rest all of that

1047
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:06,240
needs to be done there's no question but

1048
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:10,480
the the concern is that the role of the

1049
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:13,199
producer broadly uh defined is being

1050
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:16,838
neglected to some extent in some of

1051
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:19,558
these debates and it as with the AIS

1052
00:47:16,838 --> 00:47:22,440
discussion it once you get into that

1053
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:24,839
systems analysis it can become somewhat

1054
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:27,920
sterile and you can get into a lot of

1055
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:32,159
modeling a lot of uh very good technical

1056
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:35,079
work but you miss people and you miss

1057
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:37,159
the role of different forms of knowledge

1058
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:40,000
as we described in those earlier farmer

1059
00:47:37,159 --> 00:47:42,519
first discussions the role of of how

1060
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,679
that can come together effectively to

1061
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:49,280
produce food that is sustainable in a

1062
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:52,799
context which is Equitable and just a

1063
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:56,079
and so forth so um we're not it's not

1064
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:59,720
either or but our argument is let's not

1065
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,559
forget about the roots of all of this

1066
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:05,318
thank

1067
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:10,440
you hi thank you for your talk um my

1068
00:48:05,318 --> 00:48:13,759
question is just on how much of the

1069
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:19,000
metrics on how effective either one of

1070
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:23,520
your programs is or was comes from

1071
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,519
Farmers uh data generated by

1072
00:48:24,519 --> 00:48:28,880
Farmers an excellent in this particular

1073
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:30,078
study that we're proposing now is that

1074
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,838
what you're

1075
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:37,079
asking um at this point not a lot but

1076
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:40,199
one of the reasons I'm here is to talk

1077
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:43,039
with these guys about the possibility of

1078
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:45,318
a larger more ambitious project where

1079
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:49,480
that farmer engagement could be part of

1080
00:48:45,318 --> 00:48:52,639
a a a really interesting multi- uh

1081
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:54,519
country study this one is kind of a

1082
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:56,480
rapid piece because we're drawing

1083
00:48:54,519 --> 00:48:58,440
largely on the secondary literature as I

1084
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,240
Des Des cribed because it's got to be

1085
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:03,798
produced for a journal and there's a

1086
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:08,118
deadline it it's relatively short so it

1087
00:49:03,798 --> 00:49:10,880
it is uh a rapid review Taking stock but

1088
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:14,519
also I would hope that it will generate

1089
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:17,480
questions and it point to issues that we

1090
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:20,599
can then take to the field and work with

1091
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:23,798
our partners there and their farmer

1092
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:25,400
colleagues to explore those issues

1093
00:49:23,798 --> 00:49:27,519
that's where I would like to take this

1094
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:29,838
ultimately

1095
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:32,838
there's one question

1096
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:32,838
online

1097
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:38,838
um uh Mani says very exciting talk thank

1098
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:42,000
you so much would you be able to give

1099
00:49:38,838 --> 00:49:46,440
one example of scale too quickly technno

1100
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:50,358
fails and one case study from uh the us

1101
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:51,960
if you have it case from the US not sure

1102
00:49:50,358 --> 00:49:56,039
I'll have to think about the latter on

1103
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:56,039
that same issue I guess

1104
00:49:56,838 --> 00:50:06,599
oh no a use case oh use Cas use case

1105
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:10,519
um let's see yes I can give you uh an

1106
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:14,079
example I hope my dear colleague doesn't

1107
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:18,039
get upset by this um years some years

1108
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:19,760
ago um I had been working across

1109
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:22,079
subsaharan Africa with some of the

1110
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:24,000
international agriculture research uh

1111
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,359
institutions The International Institute

1112
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:30,318
of tropical agriculture what was then

1113
00:50:26,358 --> 00:50:33,639
called icraft the world Agro forestry uh

1114
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:36,759
Center and a variety of uh National

1115
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:39,400
systems around Agro forestry

1116
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:42,040
participatory AGR forestry issues and

1117
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:45,358
what was called alley farming and Alley

1118
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:48,798
farming was a big deal for a while in

1119
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:51,159
the cgir is being promoted widely and

1120
00:50:48,798 --> 00:50:54,239
the idea was to have what they called

1121
00:50:51,159 --> 00:50:57,199
multi-purpose tree species and these

1122
00:50:54,239 --> 00:51:00,239
were Wonder trees that were developed

1123
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:04,199
and tested on Farm I mean on Tru on the

1124
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:05,959
Stations of IA and and several other uh

1125
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:08,879
research centers in different parts of

1126
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:10,798
the world and they did exactly what the

1127
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,920
scientists thought they would do they

1128
00:51:10,798 --> 00:51:16,960
were very rapidly growing they were able

1129
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:21,559
to uh produce

1130
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:24,240
um uh green manure green fertilizer they

1131
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:27,040
they could grow poles and fuelwood they

1132
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:30,358
were used for animal fder they did all

1133
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:33,000
sorts of fantastic things and we were

1134
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:36,519
involved in supporting a whole partic

1135
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:39,318
farmer participatory engagement process

1136
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:41,199
but it beca when we did the training

1137
00:51:39,318 --> 00:51:44,440
with the scientists we said we really

1138
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:47,078
need to consult with the farmers to see

1139
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:49,798
is this something you want and need

1140
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:51,760
would work for you and let's hear more

1141
00:51:49,798 --> 00:51:53,880
about what you're already doing through

1142
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,119
this process to be fair to the

1143
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:58,559
colleagues who were were promoting this

1144
00:51:56,119 --> 00:52:00,798
from the farmer side they got what we

1145
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:03,160
were talking about the scientists who

1146
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:05,318
were promoting the trees and developing

1147
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:07,480
the different varieties they were just

1148
00:52:05,318 --> 00:52:09,400
Keen to get these out to as many

1149
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:12,760
producers as

1150
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:15,559
possible the thing came to a head in

1151
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:17,599
Nigeria where we did a Regional training

1152
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:20,960
we brought a group of anglophone and

1153
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:23,680
frankophone Farmers together uh across

1154
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:26,599
from across the region for a two-e

1155
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:28,798
training and there was a lot of concern

1156
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:31,039
about this push to get these

1157
00:52:28,798 --> 00:52:33,400
multi-purpose tree species out because

1158
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:36,599
they'd heard some concerns from the

1159
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:39,160
farmers that they were not exact not

1160
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:41,640
what they needed and they were very

1161
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:44,039
difficult to manage that they actually

1162
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:46,279
create they took over Farms they grew so

1163
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:49,318
quickly that farmers didn't have the

1164
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:52,760
labor to manage the crops and manage

1165
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:53,719
these trees and so they became pests in

1166
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,520
those

1167
00:52:53,719 --> 00:52:58,598
fields now there but there was a big

1168
00:52:56,519 --> 00:53:02,079
debate at that time and resistance from

1169
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:04,960
some of the scientists until we took a

1170
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:07,880
group of of uh Benin colleagues from

1171
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:11,159
Benin who also were euroba speakers and

1172
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:14,440
we were iata is in the southwest of of

1173
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:16,679
Nigeria which is eura land and we went

1174
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:20,318
out to speak with a group of of local

1175
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:23,679
farmers in those those environments and

1176
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:27,639
we met the gentleman who was the the

1177
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:31,519
star uh alley farmer he was on the cover

1178
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:35,078
of the annual report of iita he's had

1179
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:36,759
the most perfect uh alleys that were

1180
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:39,240
right along the roadside and they would

1181
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:41,799
bring dignitaries from around the world

1182
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:45,439
to see his perfectly managed

1183
00:53:41,798 --> 00:53:46,719
farm and the the Benning colleagues got

1184
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,920
there and they were talking and

1185
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:53,480
interviewing him his neighbor was there

1186
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:56,000
and they're saying um tell us more about

1187
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:58,000
this and this man was just waxing just

1188
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,358
enthus eastic of these are the most

1189
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,599
wonderful trees they do everything that

1190
00:54:00,358 --> 00:54:05,838
the scientists claim and his neighbor

1191
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:08,960
said to him in his local language there

1192
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:11,279
you're full of nonsense you know your

1193
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:14,440
real farm looks nothing like these

1194
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:18,280
alleys and our colleagues from Benin

1195
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:20,920
overheard this they went into the bush

1196
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:22,559
more and actually looked at where he was

1197
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,680
growing most of his produce and it

1198
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:27,359
looked like every other West African

1199
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,399
Farm there was in a straight line

1200
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:32,519
everywhere anywhere it was all mixed

1201
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:35,400
cropping he was doing all the usual

1202
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:38,000
practices there and he had his trees in

1203
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:41,119
different locations that he could manage

1204
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,719
but this is 10 years of work this push

1205
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:46,920
to get these uh these multi-purpose tree

1206
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:50,078
species out there and that was I'm not

1207
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:53,079
saying there's alley farming is wrong

1208
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:56,519
I'm saying this push to go to scale was

1209
00:54:53,079 --> 00:55:00,079
the problem and it then led to a real

1210
00:54:56,519 --> 00:55:02,199
traction and a ultimately a defunding of

1211
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:05,280
that program but it was a simple

1212
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:08,279
salutory lesson of talking with a

1213
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:11,319
gentleman who wanted to you know be in

1214
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:13,798
the good books of iita and and keep all

1215
00:55:11,318 --> 00:55:15,960
those scientists happy but the reality

1216
00:55:13,798 --> 00:55:18,838
was he wasn't practicing what they were

1217
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:20,920
preaching because nobody engaged with

1218
00:55:18,838 --> 00:55:23,679
him to ask him about his knowledge and

1219
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:26,599
his real practices and real

1220
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:29,239
priorities yeah oh thanks we are are

1221
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:31,480
slightly over time so thanks very much

1222
00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:31,479
you're
