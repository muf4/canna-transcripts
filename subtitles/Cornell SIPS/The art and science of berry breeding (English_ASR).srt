1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,360
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,360
university

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,360
such an intimate setting for all of this

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,880
as well i

5
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:14,879
most of my settings i talk a lot with

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,800
growers so they can all fit right here

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,400
in front of me they don't normally sit

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,080
way in the back

9
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:22,320
because i generally bring

10
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,000
things that people like to eat

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,480
now in deference to all the signs in

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
here these are visual aids today

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,679
and

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,198
later in the afternoon when or during

15
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,039
the poster session they'll be out and

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,880
you'll get a chance to taste some of

17
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:38,079
these visual aids and see see what i'm

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,840
talking about when it comes to

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,719
breeding and berry

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,960
so i work in berry crops small fruits

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,800
really is what we call it

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,239
raspberry black raspberry which is

23
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,078
native to this region strawberry

24
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,679
blackberries these are things people eat

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,039
every day people are very familiar with

26
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,519
them and of course none of them are

27
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,160
berries if you remember your

28
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,160
freshman biology class plant biology

29
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,839
none of these are in actual berries as

30
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,158
fruits but

31
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,760
horticulturally and

32
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,520
commercially of course are considered

33
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,880
berries

34
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:13,280
it's a very complex group of plants

35
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:16,239
they are all in the rosaceas family and

36
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,920
the ploidy levels are all over the place

37
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,280
so from the breeding standpoint it

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,280
provides us

39
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,439
an opportunity

40
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,439
to experiment with many different

41
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,959
systems of breeding so if raspberries

42
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,319
are the simplest being a diploid plant

43
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,919
which is very nice

44
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,319
it's the crop we've also done most of

45
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,040
our genomic work on because the genome

46
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,879
is fairly simple and fairly small

47
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,600
strawberry is the most

48
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,679
is very complex it's an interspecific

49
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,839
auto allo octoploid

50
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,920
two wild species that were accidentally

51
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,200
introduced at some point in the 1700s

52
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,439
so most of the genome work there has

53
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,560
been done on a related diploid species

54
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:56,078
that is not used in breeding and then

55
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,799
the blackberries all over the place in

56
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:01,039
the wild you see 2n equals 2x but you

57
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,520
see odd ploidies

58
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,600
boysenberry is a 7x it's a very

59
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,118
common berry that people have heard of

60
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,639
people are like how does it produce

61
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,878
fruit well it does because there's

62
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,199
apomixis pseudogammy all sorts of

63
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,799
strange things in blackberry so the

64
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,560
genome work in these and some of the

65
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,480
other

66
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,759
genera are a little

67
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,759
behind because they are so complex

68
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:29,598
so my program is research and extension

69
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,520
extension is very applied

70
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,518
aspect of my research my research is

71
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,080
also very applied towards the grower

72
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,759
towards the actual consumer

73
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,840
we have collaborators all the way from

74
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:42,159
home gardeners i have an 85 year old

75
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,560
woman in washington who helps me test

76
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,000
some of my varieties she's very happy to

77
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,280
tell her neighbors she's the first one

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,840
to ever test

79
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,360
a new variety in the state of washington

80
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,439
and she sends me nice letters about how

81
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,720
it grows in her backyard

82
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,120
and then we have multinational

83
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,840
corporations as well that work with us

84
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,840
and

85
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,239
we'll plant

86
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,080
varieties on a large scale for

87
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,000
commercial markets for shipping all over

88
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,599
the uh in this case in europe and in

89
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,280
north america

90
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:13,759
retail nurseries commercial nurseries

91
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,519
really in the in the berry world we

92
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,158
we work with all of these people because

93
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,800
there are different audiences

94
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,719
almost everybody likes berries at least

95
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,480
one or one of them

96
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,639
and people like to eat them every day

97
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,158
there's growing consumption in the us

98
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,839
they're considered to be very good for

99
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:31,439
you so all of these things drive

100
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,840
consumption and drive interest in

101
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,840
berries

102
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,639
we have domestic

103
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,919
direct domestic collaboration here in

104
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,759
the state of new york the new york state

105
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,919
berry growers association has an

106
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,239
agreement with cornell they test my new

107
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,079
material pre-commercialization so that

108
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,039
growers can see it ahead of time and get

109
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,360
a look

110
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,039
at these varieties and give me feedback

111
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,200
on them and then we have international

112
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,280
collaborators as well in canada in the

113
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,518
european union mexico

114
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,840
japan has recently signed on for one of

115
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,400
our varieties so we see interest in

116
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,959
berries growing all over the world

117
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,200
our extension is much on the variety

118
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,560
trials not only my own program but from

119
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,839
other programs around the country and

120
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,759
around the world and also technology new

121
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,478
technologies that make berry

122
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,399
growing much more feasible for new york

123
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,079
you see these high tunnels

124
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,638
we've been picking high berries in that

125
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,720
high tunnel since mid-june

126
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,079
this tray was picked yesterday we'll

127
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,560
still be picking for another couple of

128
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,560
weeks it provides a crop in the in new

129
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,639
york that you can pick for months at a

130
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,040
time it provides them the opportunity to

131
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,879
get into markets for a very long time as

132
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,639
well

133
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,839
new york growers are very close to their

134
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,759
consumers

135
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:45,758
they often are marketing their fruit

136
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,600
within a day or two of when it's picked

137
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,919
so consumers are much more aware of the

138
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,120
quality standards and this type of

139
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:55,680
technology really increases the quality

140
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,840
we hold grower trials or field days

141
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,000
where growers actually come to the farms

142
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,719
in geneva we lay out the fruit they get

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
to taste it they talk to me directly

144
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,600
they get to see

145
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,199
exactly how to grow it and what's

146
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,879
available

147
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,280
and this really brings a lot of

148
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,759
excitement to um

149
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,519
to the industry it's really it's for me

150
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,199
it's very satisfying to

151
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,918
to interact with the growers and have

152
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,759
them

153
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,439
tell me you know my variety is doing

154
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,879
well that's what i like to hear

155
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,120
sometimes they tell me they don't like

156
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:28,639
my varieties that's good to hear too

157
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,639
although not as fun to hear

158
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,360
sometimes the extension work is not as

159
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,639
simple as it seems

160
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,479
this happened

161
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,400
two days three days after we got it set

162
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:39,758
up we had the eye of a hurricane pass

163
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,279
over the top

164
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,038
kind of turned it into a mangled mess

165
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,918
that was a monday morning picture it was

166
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:47,918
a good week

167
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,680
so the science behind it so the breeding

168
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,319
is fairly traditional in in berries

169
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,240
recurrent selection

170
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,759
we're looking at each generation picking

171
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,639
out the best ones from each generation

172
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,919
recombinating recombin recombining those

173
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,918
to try and improve the next generation

174
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,839
it's fairly straightforward

175
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,839
but easier said than done

176
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,599
as most genetic theory since everything

177
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,198
goes back to the midparent

178
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,039
which we're trying to get everything

179
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,560
that's better than the parents and

180
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,240
that's a very difficult thing to do

181
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,959
sometimes

182
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,519
they are generally out crossing

183
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,198
they're all self-pollinated crops

184
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:30,478
but they all suffer from inbreeding

185
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,360
depression

186
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:33,839
so

187
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,000
you need outcrossing you need genetic

188
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,839
diversity in order to make improvement

189
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
which then gives you things that you

190
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,079
don't necessarily expect

191
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,839
black raspberry is a little bit on the

192
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,318
outlier because it

193
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,399
my theory is that it had a genetic

194
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,080
bottleneck during the ice ages

195
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,719
it is localized in the northeastern

196
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:55,279
united states and southeastern canada

197
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,120
and it's very very inbred as a species

198
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,119
so there's not a whole lot of diversity

199
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,038
and they do we do mix up the species

200
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,478
especially in rubus

201
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,478
you can cross red raspberry black

202
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:07,120
raspberry you can cross raspberry with

203
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,719
blackberry if deployed is right

204
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,079
and there are some other wild species

205
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,759
that are used for some interesting

206
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,359
trades

207
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,120
molecular techniques we started

208
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,598
certainly with genetic mapping there was

209
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,879
no map when i started here at cornell

210
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:22,879
we we published maps um

211
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,199
with disease resistance on them for

212
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,199
phytophthora especially we've moved into

213
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,120
some rna-seq work looking at disease

214
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,598
resistance as well phytophthora work

215
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,680
looking at the differences between

216
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,639
resistant and and

217
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,478
susceptible phenotypes so in raspberry

218
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,400
on the plus side to work with they're

219
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:43,120
clonal so when you have a plant you can

220
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,799
reproduce that same exact genetic plant

221
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,120
as many times as you want and so it

222
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,598
makes it very nice as a model for for

223
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,478
working in in this type of

224
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:51,918
field

225
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:53,519
that then branched into genome

226
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,519
sequencing there was no genome for

227
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:58,079
raspberry there was no genome for

228
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:00,159
any small fruit at that time

229
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,959
that genome then is is finished but not

230
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,879
published yet and uh we're working on

231
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,120
getting that paper out so we'll have

232
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,560
more tools as we move forward

233
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,079
the potential for marker assisted

234
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,319
selection certainly we are looking for

235
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,918
ways to speed things up putting things

236
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,160
out in the field watching them grow for

237
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,240
two or three years is a very slow way to

238
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,919
do it especially when you have new york

239
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,598
where you get a 20-minute hail storm

240
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,359
come across your field in july which

241
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,199
happened this year all the fruit for

242
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,280
about three weeks was damaged

243
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,360
there's not a whole lot of evaluation

244
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:32,079
you can do when that happens

245
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,360
so we want to be able to reduce that

246
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,360
number of plants that are in the field

247
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,399
make sure the ones that we are observing

248
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,599
actually have the treats that we're

249
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,879
interested

250
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,240
in

251
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,080
so one of my students came up with this

252
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,158
hydroponic system phytophthora and

253
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,639
raspberry is a root disease

254
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,639
it's very hard to observe the roots in a

255
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,639
system like that

256
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,799
so we came up with this hydroponic

257
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,799
system you can see on the left

258
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,399
your left

259
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,559
plants really like growing in the system

260
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,120
when you introduce the phytophthora the

261
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,639
susceptible ones die and we can look at

262
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,560
the difference in

263
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,720
expression of genes

264
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,719
from these same plants before they are

265
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,320
infected and after the infected

266
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,320
then we can also look at

267
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,080
clonally

268
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,920
individual varieties that have

269
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,000
resistance and ones that don't the

270
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:19,759
resistance in the species has been very

271
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,519
very durable there's a variety that's

272
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,439
known for it been released it was

273
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,039
released in 1908

274
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,279
it's a very durable resistance and we're

275
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,599
very interested in figuring out how that

276
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:29,600
works

277
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,600
so the genetic mapping showed there were

278
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:37,359
two genes involved two major gene

279
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,040
covering somewhere between

280
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,600
50

281
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,958
50 55 percent of the genetic variation

282
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,639
between these two traits and no matter

283
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,439
how we measured it we measured it just

284
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,919
on a one to five scale we measured the

285
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,320
stem lesions we measured how much of the

286
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:54,639
petioles got lesions we measured just

287
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,720
the root score just how dead were the

288
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:57,519
roots anywhere from a little bit of life

289
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,519
to

290
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,120
no effect whatsoever no matter how we

291
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,799
measured it those two spots in the

292
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,560
genome popped up again and again in the

293
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,719
mapping so we're pretty confident that

294
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,759
there's some serious

295
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,959
genes involved two major genes involved

296
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,838
of course there's

297
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,199
when you're looking at disease

298
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,040
resistance and you're looking at root

299
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,800
traits there's certainly a lot of other

300
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:20,399
things that go and go along with that

301
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:21,838
some of the work we've done so the rna

302
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,078
seq work

303
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,720
we took those two when we we compared

304
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:29,039
the rna expression before infection

305
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,040
after infection in a resistant variety

306
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,879
and a susceptible variety

307
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,799
we've narrowed it down to

308
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,639
a few dozen genes involved that were

309
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,240
very highly up regulated during the

310
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,199
process there were some others that were

311
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,120
very highly down regulated and were

312
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,720
wading through all of that data it seems

313
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,759
that data overload is what we have at

314
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,959
this point trying to figure out

315
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:53,120
our next target to look at

316
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:55,439
in black raspberry we have a prop a

317
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,039
multi multi-state program right now

318
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,959
working at black raspberry with a very

319
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,559
very minor crop

320
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,559
but one people are very interested in

321
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,719
because antioxidant levels are off

322
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:07,439
through the roof on black raspberry it's

323
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,959
high in fiber and vitamin b and vitamin

324
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,880
c and all these good things and it

325
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,639
tastes good too which is even better you

326
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,879
know most of these new berries the new

327
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,958
superfruits you know the kai berry and

328
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,039
these they don't really taste very good

329
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,719
you know aronia you have to mix them

330
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,879
with something that tastes good to take

331
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,040
them and so to have a super fruit that

332
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,720
actually tastes good

333
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,159
would be a boon i think for the industry

334
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,839
there's some very interesting work done

335
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:33,039
at ohio state as well on black

336
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,959
raspberries direct freeze-dried powders

337
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,799
on pre-cancerous lesions in the mouth

338
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:40,319
and oral cavity

339
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:40,319
reversing some of these lesions

340
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,919
lesions in the esophagus which is

341
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:48,159
esophageal cancer is one of the worst

342
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:50,559
cancers for fatality for mortality

343
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,319
taking powders of direct powders of

344
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,679
black raspberries reversing some of

345
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,839
these lesions so people are very

346
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:59,439
interested in this crop but it's a very

347
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:02,399
difficult crop to produce in any volume

348
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,160
and so this we're looking at

349
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,759
uh we're looking at the genetics of it

350
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,759
in multiple locations we're also looking

351
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,120
at consumer preferences and chemical

352
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,958
analysis of the fruit to see what

353
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,639
how we can make improvements in this

354
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:18,239
crop it really has

355
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,399
barely been scratched as far as breeding

356
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,079
i did a study a few years ago all the

357
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,600
commercial varieties the farthest one

358
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,239
away from a wild

359
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,759
parent was two generations

360
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,159
some of the varieties were actually

361
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,759
plants people found in ditches

362
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:33,278
and they named them and that's

363
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:35,679
considered a commercial variety that's

364
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:38,320
how new this crop is to breeding so we

365
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:40,559
think we can make some really

366
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,920
great progress in a crop like this

367
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,518
and that's where kind of the art comes

368
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,759
into this since we don't have a lot of

369
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,799
information on a lot of these things we

370
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:49,759
have anecdotal evidence we have

371
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,319
direct

372
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,919
interaction with growers and we use this

373
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,240
information to

374
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,919
to try to figure out what the consumer

375
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,759
wants to try and figure out what the

376
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:02,000
grower wants and try to merge those two

377
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,439
things in new varieties

378
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,159
you talk to people they always say they

379
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,079
want flavor

380
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:11,600
the flavor is kind of a tough thing in

381
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,799
in berries and in fruit crops in general

382
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,440
so

383
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:17,199
what is flavor so i assume everybody

384
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,120
here has had an apple at some point in

385
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,639
their life

386
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,919
and you know what an apple tastes like

387
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,000
right

388
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,919
so which one's an apple

389
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
this tastes like an apple right

390
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,519
granny smith of course this tastes like

391
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,120
an apple too

392
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,799
it's an empire this one tastes like an

393
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,799
apple it's a gala but they don't taste

394
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,039
like each other

395
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,479
so which one's the apple

396
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:41,120
well they all are and they not none of

397
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,320
them are there is no apple flavor

398
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,240
there's

399
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,360
all different flavors that all remind

400
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,560
you of what

401
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,278
everybody has in their mind what an

402
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,879
apple should be

403
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,399
but they have the luxury of naming them

404
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,159
and people can say well this one i like

405
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,799
granny smith apples i like gala

406
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,879
strawberries don't have that advantage

407
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:01,599
there are no named varieties in the

408
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,360
supermarket in this country the european

409
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,959
market is moving to having all the

410
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,919
varieties on the containers and

411
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:12,078
retailers here well producers here

412
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,479
are not for it

413
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,319
companies like driscoll's nature ripe

414
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,360
they worked very hard to get their names

415
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,199
on those

416
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,039
on those uh containers and they don't

417
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,399
really want to

418
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:24,480
sorry i've been pushing buttons haven't

419
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,480
i

420
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,839
so we work with this with with so what

421
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,838
what does the producer want well this

422
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,000
producer wants big berries big berries

423
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,760
pick easy they fill containers quickly

424
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,039
the biggest cost in berry production is

425
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,039
labor it's all hand-picked

426
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,519
they want shelf life they want to be

427
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,198
able to ship that sucker from california

428
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,198
in four days to new york city and it

429
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:52,319
looks good still

430
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:55,679
if it tastes good oh that's that's good

431
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,040
but it is not the top priority

432
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,479
my wife was talking about this last

433
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,480
night with my wife she's like you know

434
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,480
when you need strawberries for the

435
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,399
fruit salad you can buy any strawberries

436
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,759
at the supermarket you know it doesn't

437
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,078
matter you're mixing them they're going

438
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,319
to buy them people do buy strawberries

439
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:13,359
we do see though in new york

440
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,800
in strawberry season the driscoll sales

441
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,959
go down

442
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:19,120
because people do want good strawberries

443
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,479
and they will go out and find local

444
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,839
strawberries

445
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,560
and they will stop buying them from the

446
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,480
supermarket when they can

447
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,799
so there's a lot of room a lot of

448
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,959
potential for innovation new categories

449
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,719
new colors flavor shapes these things

450
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,799
are all available that are not been

451
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,560
marketed in the supermarket right now

452
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,559
the category for raspberries is big and

453
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,399
red and the category for strawberries

454
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:43,359
it's big and red

455
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,039
and that's pretty much where we're at

456
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,759
and there's so much more in the berry

457
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:50,078
world that's available

458
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:55,000
the industry can move very very quickly

459
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:55,000
as well but it can also stand still

460
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:58,399
so when you look in a catalog this is

461
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,639
from norse farms one of our biggest

462
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,919
nurseries in this region they grow

463
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,759
a lot of different varieties they sell

464
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,198
them all over the country just in

465
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,000
raspberry strawberries and blackberries

466
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:09,439
they have 64 varieties available because

467
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,600
that's a lot of information for growers

468
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,279
to take in it's an astounding amount of

469
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,278
information for a consumer to take in

470
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,759
they're from all over the world

471
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,278
different states different countries

472
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,120
seven of the strawberry varieties were

473
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:24,639
more than 20 years old

474
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,360
one of the raspberry varieties the one i

475
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,639
was telling you about released in 1908

476
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,639
still sold commercially

477
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,720
so on the one hand we have

478
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,000
people willing to try new things and on

479
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,839
the other hand we have people who will

480
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,839
never try new things

481
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,720
they've been growing this variety for 42

482
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,959
years

483
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,720
it works for them they're making money

484
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:47,919
i'm not going to argue with that

485
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,920
but there's a lot of opportunity

486
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:52,319
so of course this is what we'd like to

487
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,078
see even for me i'm still like to have a

488
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,839
nice commercially successful variety we

489
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:57,599
want one with big red berries people

490
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,680
like big red berries

491
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,440
they taste good it's even better if we

492
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,799
can get a good tasting big red berry

493
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,078
into the new york market for local

494
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,838
growers that's a very good thing

495
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:09,759
this is crimson giant one of our our

496
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:12,000
raspberry releases this is an example of

497
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:14,400
what can happen at lightning speed so i

498
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,480
was approached in 2007 by a company in

499
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,480
spain who wanted to get into berry

500
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,640
production they'd gotten out of

501
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,240
asparagus because the peruvians had

502
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,000
driven them out of the market and they

503
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,199
were down to one product stone fruit

504
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,240
peaches

505
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:32,558
and they needed to diversify

506
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:35,440
so that was 2007 and 2014 they have

507
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:37,678
about thirteen hundred acres of berries

508
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,080
all of it under undercover so there's

509
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,160
thirteen hundred acres of tunnels

510
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,918
stretching as far as you can see it's a

511
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,919
pretty impressive thing so in seven

512
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,320
years they've gone from nothing no sales

513
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:51,038
at all to that level

514
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:54,000
this variety we sent that 25 plants to

515
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,839
them in 2008 to test

516
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,038
by 2009 they said they wanted to go to

517
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:00,159
commercial

518
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:02,240
in 2010 they ordered 400 thousand plants

519
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,679
to plant a hundred acres

520
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,359
which would produce somewhere between a

521
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,840
million and a million and a half pounds

522
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:10,240
of raspberries or three to three to

523
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:12,079
three to a half million units

524
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,919
unit of raspberry the little

525
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:15,119
half pint and they were going to market

526
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,600
those

527
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,599
over a four month period

528
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,599
things would go really really fast

529
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,719
by 2014 they decided they didn't like

530
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,038
the variety anymore and they're done

531
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,400
with it they move on to a new variety

532
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:29,119
because they can plant the variety in

533
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,720
april by october they have fruit by the

534
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:33,439
next april they don't like it they

535
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,279
change varieties or on to the next one

536
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,759
things can happen really really fast in

537
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:39,200
the in the berry world

538
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,879
consumers change their preferences of

539
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,200
course in europe too there's there's

540
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,720
variety name on every container so they

541
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,720
get very direct feedback from the

542
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,000
consumer saying i like this variety i

543
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,440
don't like this variety and they can

544
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,640
actually tell them which variety it is

545
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,558
and that's

546
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,280
it's a double-edged sword you know if

547
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:57,200
you're

548
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,200
that's the only variety you have

549
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,720
you're kind of stuck

550
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,720
but if you have the ability to change

551
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,558
varieties very quickly you can maybe

552
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,919
address those consumer concerns or if

553
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:07,839
you have a variety that no one else has

554
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,200
that they really like your sales can go

555
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,279
through the roof

556
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,038
this company sells tremendous amount of

557
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:14,480
fruit to norway in the winter time and

558
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:16,000
they have one variety that norwegians

559
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,160
really like

560
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,038
when that variety hits the market sales

561
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,120
double

562
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,359
overnight because the people are looking

563
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,519
for it they're waiting for it

564
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:28,240
that's the kind of thing that can happen

565
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:30,319
if the marketing and the production

566
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,200
all goes the way you want it

567
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:36,159
a new one we're coming along again big

568
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,600
red berries we were still growers

569
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,360
even new york growers like big red

570
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,439
berries too but there's a lot of things

571
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:42,959
besides big red berries so we have a

572
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,480
purple raspberry

573
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,558
our strawberry that we put out a couple

574
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,000
of years ago named walker it's being

575
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:51,359
marketed as a purple wonder by burpee

576
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,558
you see their

577
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:55,199
their page

578
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:57,839
they're selling it for 10.95

579
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,840
per plant

580
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,839
so they don't have to sell very many

581
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:06,480
um to give you an idea a commercial

582
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,959
nursery sells plants by the thousand and

583
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,038
a thousand bare root plants costs about

584
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,640
110 dollars

585
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:13,519
so for the same price you can get 10 of

586
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,200
these

587
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:16,798
or you can get a thousand commercial

588
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,840
ones

589
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,440
so

590
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:21,359
and people are buying they can't they

591
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,200
can't produce enough plants people love

592
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,519
them because

593
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,319
home gardeners it's the biggest biggest

594
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:27,918
uh

595
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:29,038
hobby in the united states is home

596
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,120
gardening

597
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,839
and people love new stuff people love

598
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,359
stuff they can't get in the supermarket

599
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:37,918
we have some new raspberry varieties

600
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:40,639
becoming very popular local markets this

601
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,880
nice apricot color you see here

602
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,400
it helps it tastes great but it also

603
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,320
catches the eye

604
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,000
a dark berry

605
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,399
so that's not red in the in the

606
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,798
supermarket that's over ripe

607
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,400
but on a farmer's market stand

608
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,720
it really stands out people really like

609
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,320
to taste it

610
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,839
that's the thing in new york growers a

611
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:01,599
lot of them are

612
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:04,158
directly interacting with their

613
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:06,158
consumers people are tasting the product

614
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,080
before they get to the car sometimes

615
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,320
sometimes before they actually get to

616
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:11,599
the counter to sell it or to buy it and

617
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,119
so

618
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,279
if it doesn't taste good for new york

619
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:17,038
growers it's a big deal you know berries

620
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:19,519
is the third leading fruit crop in new

621
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:20,558
york and people don't really think of it

622
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:22,558
much but

623
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:24,079
every place you have a

624
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:25,759
concentration of people in new york you

625
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:28,319
have a concentration of berry growers

626
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:31,200
around that area around rochester around

627
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:33,359
ithaca around buffalo around albany

628
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,200
because people want fresh berries and

629
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,959
they want local berries

630
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,120
we have some nice bright yellow lemon

631
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,880
yellow type berries

632
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,000
they really stand out they taste good

633
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,919
they taste like

634
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,440
they taste like raspberries

635
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,600
we certainly want ones that taste really

636
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,519
good

637
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,038
purple ones too

638
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:52,319
so when you cross a red raspberry in a

639
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:53,839
black raspberry you get purple

640
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,519
raspberries

641
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:57,519
that's a category that doesn't exist in

642
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:59,839
the supermarket so

643
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:00,879
as we get things that are different

644
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:02,639
if you're working with the right

645
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,520
companies we can suddenly get a new

646
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,520
category get new shelf space and people

647
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,359
can look for new things

648
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,119
and it's really i mean from my point of

649
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,719
view it's very exciting we make some of

650
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,558
these crosses we don't know exactly what

651
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,240
the fruit is going to look like

652
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,079
and it can be a lot of fun

653
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,440
to try

654
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:22,079
see what we can get of course the

655
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,120
mythical blue raspberry flavor

656
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:25,119
thankfully

657
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,359
there are no such things raspberries

658
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:28,959
that color uh

659
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:30,719
there's there's been pictures going

660
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,319
around the internet every so often

661
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,919
claiming these are gmo raspberries

662
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,119
there's gmo strawberries are that same

663
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,520
color

664
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:40,319
they don't exist

665
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:42,000
so it's all it's all urban legend they

666
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:43,519
could i guess

667
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,880
genetic transformation strawberries and

668
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,839
raspberries is

669
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,240
simple

670
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:50,639
well characterized well worked out

671
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,720
and not of any interest to the consumer

672
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,400
at this time so

673
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,120
most of the traits that have been done

674
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,080
disease resistance roundup ready

675
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:02,479
growers would like it consumers have

676
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:04,960
not wanted it the industry has been

677
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,038
terrified of it because of negative

678
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,720
connotations their markets often

679
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:10,158
overseas

680
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,839
especially the frozen and they don't

681
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,679
want anything to do with it

682
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,359
so there's a bright future i think in

683
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,360
berry sorry for the pun

684
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:19,599
but uh

685
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:21,199
you know in 2002 raspberry production

686
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:23,439
fresh raspberries the only place they

687
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,279
took stats was in california

688
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,200
it was around 40 million

689
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:30,000
10 years before that it was around 25

690
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,640
million that was kind of growth by 2009

691
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,400
in california alone it hit 350 million

692
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,960
just for raspberries

693
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,480
it could grow really really fast things

694
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,480
really happen it's backed off a little

695
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,120
bit now as labor problems in in

696
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,200
california and land use issues

697
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,599
productions moved down to mexico

698
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,120
same companies same varieties free trade

699
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:50,959
trucks come right in

700
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:52,399
so a lot of the production has moved to

701
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,240
mexico but there's still over 250

702
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,159
million dollars in fresh raspberries

703
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,079
produced in california each year

704
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,159
strawberries from year to year are right

705
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,639
there with apples as far as production

706
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:06,080
in in the us you know third leading

707
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,520
fruit crop in the u.s behind citrus and

708
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:09,359
grapes

709
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:11,038
third lady fruit crop in new york behind

710
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:12,399
apples and grapes

711
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:13,679
people like strawberries they eat them

712
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,200
all the time

713
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,559
about two and a half billion dollars in

714
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,759
strawberries were produced in the u.s

715
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:22,158
last year and we import more from mexico

716
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:24,240
and canada

717
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,400
the local food movement too really is

718
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,240
driving some of this demand for new

719
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,200
varieties they want choices they want

720
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,319
quality

721
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,720
anybody can go to the supermarket and

722
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:34,879
get big red berries

723
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,079
and we can get big red berries every day

724
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,440
of the year

725
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,199
but when you want something special you

726
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,798
want something different

727
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,400
you go to the farmer's market you go to

728
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:43,918
the local market and there's a lot of a

729
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,720
lot of choices and a lot of things

730
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,960
available now that weren't available

731
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,798
even five years ago so

732
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,000
with that i'll close i will have the

733
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:56,720
berries out they'll become food aids

734
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,558
after no longer visual aids during the

735
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,839
during the poster session you can

736
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:01,839
take a taste

737
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:10,879
well earliness is a tricky

738
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,759
thing

739
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:17,600
because there's multiple seasons

740
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:19,200
so earliness in the spring is

741
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,480
we've pretty much reached the limit of

742
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,720
where we can get on earliness in

743
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,880
raspberry any earlier and the flowers

744
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,558
get continually get killed so until we

745
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,200
go into completely into protective

746
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:31,119
culture for breeding as well it's very

747
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,038
difficult to get earlier where we're

748
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:35,199
moving earlier is in the fall crop in

749
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:37,519
the in the varieties that produce fruit

750
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,080
on their first year's growth

751
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:42,000
we've moved into late late july early

752
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,558
august so we can have fruit from that

753
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,919
time until november

754
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:47,759
if we could move that another couple

755
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,440
weeks earlier

756
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,359
we could even you know we can expand

757
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,440
that season and that's the season that's

758
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,439
the type of plants being grown in mexico

759
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,120
in california

760
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,038
you plant a plant and

761
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,199
four months later it's flowering and

762
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:02,879
producing fruit and so if you can move

763
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,880
that forward you can expand your season

764
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,200
there

765
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,559
there is very much so there's been quite

766
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,000
a bit of work on

767
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:11,839
chemical composition certainly it

768
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,119
berries and

769
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:16,639
correlation to what flavor is

770
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,319
it often comes down to the same two

771
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,799
things sugar and acid in the ratio

772
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,798
between the two

773
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:25,278
but yet there are always those varieties

774
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,960
that everybody recognizes as being

775
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,240
superior

776
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,840
and they don't seem to have a different

777
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,159
sugar acid ratio

778
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:34,480
from most of the other varieties so

779
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,240
there's a lot of we a proposal that

780
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,440
unfortunately was not funded had a big

781
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,558
aspect of that in it

782
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,038
you know when you work with specialty

783
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:45,519
crops sometimes the resources involved

784
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:47,278
to do that is are are limited but

785
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,119
there's a lot of interest in that and

786
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:50,319
what flavor is

787
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:52,239
and the combination of flavor and

788
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:54,000
firmness

789
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,278
everybody's had a strawberry probably

790
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,400
they've bitten into and it kind of

791
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:58,880
crunched

792
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,200
so we there is no limit to how firm you

793
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,880
can make a strawberry you can make it so

794
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,798
it will not ripen

795
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,919
so that it will stay firm you can ship

796
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:07,918
it all the way around the world but

797
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:11,120
nobody wants to eat it so where's that

798
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,200
balance of how firm is too firm and

799
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:15,038
where does the flavor come from

800
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,798
in that combination because our

801
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:18,879
varieties are so firm you don't want to

802
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,879
eat it but their sugar levels are off

803
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,720
off the chart so if we could back off on

804
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,360
the firmness the flavor would probably

805
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,038
be outstanding

806
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:29,278
but so there is a lot of interest but

807
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:32,919
not a lot of work unfortunately

808
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:32,919
okay thank you

809
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:43,158
this has been a production of cornell
