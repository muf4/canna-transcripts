1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,719
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:12,798
University so uh Dr Amar dunsil is the

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,480
biocontrol specialist with the New York

4
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:17,118
State integrated Pest Management program

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,359
uh which is part of Cornell's College of

6
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:21,518
agricultural Agriculture and Life

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,359
Sciences uh in this position she

8
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:25,759
supports the effective use of biological

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,679
control solutions for pests in all

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,000
agricultural Commodities as well as

11
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:32,640
pests encountered by all New Yorkers

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,920
where they live work Play and Learn when

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,799
she's not at work she's enjoying she's

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,439
she enjoys watching all the beneficial

15
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,759
insects attracted to her flow all right

16
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,959
thanks

17
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:45,878
Mar all right so I like to let folks

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,759
know when I start my talk that I'm

19
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:50,479
consider myself to be someone who is

20
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,640
experting in BIO control I spend a lot

21
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,640
of time thinking about bio control

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,359
engaging with bio control and reading

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,320
about bi control and making the

24
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:59,640
scientific literature and biome control

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,960
but I don't know everything years know

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,160
about

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,359
and also because I cover all of the

28
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:09,519
Agricultural Commodities I not an expert

29
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:11,079
in um it's not it's not something I work

30
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,560
in exclusively the way some of the other

31
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:15,239
folks have here today do uh so I'm

32
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,519
expecting them to learn something from H

33
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:20,000
today as

34
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,319
well so I want to start off with a

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,319
question and my question for you is are

36
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,679
you using bio controls now and the

37
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:30,679
options in a moment I'm going to ask you

38
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:32,640
to raise your hand options are yes no no

39
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,840
or I'm not sure and I'm not sure it's a

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,359
perfectly reasonable answer because my

41
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,079
title was bio controls bio bio St oh my

42
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:41,599
what do these terms even mean so if you

43
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,478
don't know that's okay so how many

44
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,478
people are already using

45
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,000
B um how many feel like Noe I'm not

46
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,399
using B

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,399
controls how many are not sure if you're

48
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,239
using B

49
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,599
controls a lot of folks just W out

50
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:00,438
that's okay too um it's it's late in the

51
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:04,280
day

52
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:05,199
been a gr month year um all right so

53
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,439
here's what we're going to talk about

54
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,118
today we're going to start by going over

55
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,400
these terms the three big bio terms what

56
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:14,159
do they need um we're going to chat a

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,120
little bit about ways you might be using

58
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,680
the even if you're not sure this you are

59
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,159
uh and we're going to set up with a

60
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,879
little bit of information about

61
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,039
stimulant I know some folks mentioned

62
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:26,239
them already today please do ask

63
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:28,039
questions I'm happy to be interrupted if

64
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,400
you raise your hand that's probably

65
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:33,318
better than just shouting out that's

66
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,879
um and I will U ask you to participate a

67
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:38,639
little bit as

68
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:41,439
well all right so these bio terms bio

69
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,479
control biop bio stimulant what's the

70
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,800
difference what do all these mean and

71
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:48,679
why do you care or maybe you don't

72
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,239
care um before we get into that I'd like

73
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,400
to define a few terms I am not trained

74
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,599
as an entomologist and if there's any

75
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,959
entomologist out you know that insects

76
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:00,039
are not the same as mice right but I'll

77
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,439
use the word insect very broadly here

78
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:05,000
all includes some things that aren't

79
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,680
technically insects like mice that are R

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,479
I also use the word micro which just

81
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,920
means bacteria fungi viruses or

82
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,919
microorganism pathogens are microbes

83
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:16,518
that cause disease on Plants we're not

84
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:19,238
talking about human pathogens today I

85
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:21,439
have no expertise there uh and then I'll

86
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,640
use the term pest to refer to both

87
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:26,598
insects and plant pathogens that are

88
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:29,039
causing damage to our

89
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:31,199
crops so bio control is just using

90
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,359
something living or something that a

91
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,438
living thing produces to control pests

92
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,159
and Lady Beatles and apids are a really

93
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:40,519
acceptable example that most people are

94
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,919
familiar with so the lady Beetle or the

95
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:46,158
ladybug it's the natural enemy or the

96
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:48,318
bio control agent it needs the past for

97
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,878
but bio control is a whole lot more than

98
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:53,639
just insects doing biological control or

99
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:56,199
insects being controlled by

100
00:03:53,639 --> 00:04:00,719
biologics so that's where biopesticides

101
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:02,679
come in um biopesticides are tesz and

102
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,318
their active ingredients can be plant

103
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:10,079
extracts they can be microbes or they

104
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:10,078
can be Biogen something like potassium

105
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,879
bicarbonate L regular pesticides they

106
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,439
control best and this is going to be

107
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:23,600
important in a moment so in contrast to

108
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:25,839
biopesticides which control pests bio

109
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,240
simulants grow healthy plants so they

110
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:31,239
may contain similar things biostimulants

111
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,079
are often made from plants C extracts

112
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,240
microorganisms and some natural

113
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:37,279
compounds so the active ingredients may

114
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,879
be very similar but they have dis

115
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:41,119
purposes biopesticides are for

116
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,800
controlling pests bio stimulants are for

117
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,600
growing healthier plants bio stimulants

118
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,759
are not currently registered with the

119
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,680
EPA or near State DEC that might change

120
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:54,000
in the future we don't know um we don't

121
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,160
even have a a firm established

122
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,319
definition for

123
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,280
biopesticides yet um there's some

124
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:02,159
definitions that are are being promoted

125
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,159
and and out

126
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:07,359
there here's an example because it does

127
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:09,560
get a little bit complicated with

128
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,639
biopesticides and biostimulants so

129
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:16,120
fighter is a a product that contains the

130
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,439
fungus the fungus is on the stacus Rosia

131
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,800
um so fungus microorganism could be a

132
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:22,478
biopesticide could be a bio stimulant I

133
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,400
was reading some information about this

134
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:27,399
product online and I felt confused so I

135
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:29,918
have a lot of quotes here from the

136
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:32,359
website describing the product says a

137
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,359
beneficial microf fungus it enhances

138
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,680
plant health and productivity sounds

139
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,560
like a bio stimulant it offers

140
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,720
protection against a variety of fungal

141
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,038
pathogens and it actively blocks the

142
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,759
enter of those pathogens sounds like a

143
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,639
biopesticide controlling pest um it

144
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,240
lists some diseases against which it's

145
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,240
particularly

146
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,000
effective um even in the absence of

147
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,319
these diseases it'll stimulate the

148
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,399
plant's natural resistance mechanisms or

149
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,759
suppresses those diseases and stimulates

150
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,519
the plant's um resistance mechanisms and

151
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,600
then it explicitly says it's a bio

152
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:06,000
stimulant and it will Aid your crops

153
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,479
even if there's no

154
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,598
disease now I looked at the nice pad

155
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,240
which is a go-to place for is the

156
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:14,560
pesticide registered for the use in New

157
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,720
York state um it's not listed there

158
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,680
which either means it's a pesticide is

159
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,639
not registered in New York or it's not a

160
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,079
pesticide uh there is a strain of this

161
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,519
fungus that's registered with or at

162
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:30,598
least was back in

163
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:32,598
2019 um so this this is confusing right

164
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:34,240
and this is not the only product out

165
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:36,560
there that is confusing that has kind of

166
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,360
mixed messages about is it making

167
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,000
healthier plants is it controlling

168
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,720
disease so I just want to acknowledge

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,279
that there is some complexity there also

170
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,319
have this disclaimer because I'm Corel

171
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,478
University employ have to make sure that

172
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:51,039
I tell you um that if you're using a

173
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:54,038
product is not

174
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,918
labeled um and registered as a pesticide

175
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,399
and in New York state not labeled and

176
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,359
registered on the propop and for the

177
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:02,198
pest that's an off pesticide application

178
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,919
I will never recommend off Lael

179
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:06,639
pesticide applications if you are not

180
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:08,959
already familiar with the Cornell

181
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,598
pesticide safety education program which

182
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,519
is a part of the New York State I

183
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:14,639
program they are a great resource if you

184
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:16,439
have questions if you find a product

185
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,960
you're interested in trying it and you

186
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:21,360
confused um is it a pesticide is it not

187
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,560
a pesticide what are the impation my

188
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,800
farm they're not regulatory they're

189
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,160
great answering questions they can pass

190
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,879
questions on anonymously to your state

191
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,240
DC um so I'm happy to connect you with

192
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,439
them if you would like to uh get some

193
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,439
more

194
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,360
information so if you're looking your

195
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,560
product and wondering is it a

196
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,800
biopesticide Clues first of all Pest

197
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,000
Control if it's purpose of pest control

198
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,000
the clue is a biopesticide as opposed to

199
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,519
a bio

200
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,800
stimulant when we think about the active

201
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:54,519
ingredients that are in biopesticides

202
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,280
the microorganisms and the plant names

203
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:58,758
are pretty easy to recognize I can't

204
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,079
always tell when I look at the name of

205
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:04,400
the chemical it's a natural biochemical

206
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:07,719
or not um there is an official list with

207
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:10,679
EPA which things are considered

208
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,360
bioz um but the microbes plant extracts

209
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,280
are pretty easy to recognize uh the EPA

210
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,439
registration number is another really

211
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,119
important clue because if it's pde it'll

212
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:23,240
have a registration

213
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:26,158
number with one exception which is why

214
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,639
there uh so minimum risk pesticides

215
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:30,759
don't have EPA registration numbers so

216
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,440
there's a specific list of active

217
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:36,399
ingredients that are permitted in theous

218
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,760
pesticide uh some of a lot of these are

219
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,200
also PL extracts which is confusing too

220
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:42,080
right because sometimes PL extracts are

221
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,519
registered as pesticides sometimes

222
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,759
they're minimum risk pesticides uh time

223
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:50,278
oil citric acid two examples they are

224
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,639
not currently registered with EPA or

225
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:55,000
Interstate DEC so they won't have an EPA

226
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,399
registration number um and they because

227
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,720
they're not registered they haven't gone

228
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,919
through that same process of evaluation

229
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,680
sometimes the label will have a

230
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:06,120
statement like you see up here that says

231
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:08,719
they're exempt under section 25b of ifra

232
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,720
so some people call them 25v products

233
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,600
but the label doesn't have to say that

234
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,759
so it's confusing um there is a great

235
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,159
page about rousi to New York State IPM

236
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,360
and I sent Kristen a list of links that

237
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,439
she'll share with folks afterwards um

238
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,399
where you can read more about this I'll

239
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,320
mention this at the end too but um if

240
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,919
there's anyone here who needs hard

241
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,278
copies instead of access something

242
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,199
online I'll sh my office phone number at

243
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:35,639
the end or come to me I'll give you my

244
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,480
business card I'm happy to make sure you

245
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:38,480
get C Properties

246
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,079
too here's an important question should

247
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,079
you care if it's a biopesticide or not

248
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:47,919
this is a reasonable question uh in

249
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:50,278
terms of whether it's a biopesticide or

250
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:52,240
a bio stimulant I think this is really

251
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:54,120
relevant in terms of laws about

252
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,720
pesticide use um and they may be

253
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,078
different in different states right Ohio

254
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,800
versus New York in terms of whether it's

255
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:04,239
a biop pesticide versus if it's um an

256
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:06,199
organic approved but not biopesticide

257
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,680
that may not be as important to you

258
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,959
whether it's approved for use an organic

259
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,879
production maybe a more important

260
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:13,319
question so just want to acknowledge

261
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:15,879
that um some of this is semantics but

262
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,480
but people want to know what is the bi

263
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:21,639
this this is what it

264
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:25,600
is all right questions before we move on

265
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:27,399
about bio controls bio

266
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,040
bi

267
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:32,440
okay how you might be using using bio

268
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:35,599
controls already and we're going to talk

269
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:38,079
about three areas um conserving

270
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,959
releasing and spraying I know we don't

271
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,879
talk about much in organic but it might

272
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:44,518
be something doing that's

273
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:46,039
okay uh so if you think you are using

274
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,720
bio contr control currently and I did

275
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:49,719
see a few hands what are you

276
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,440
doing well I raised

277
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:02,480
tic apples and so I'm using the whole

278
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:06,200
round of these things um everything

279
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,200
from carbonate

280
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,399
to bi

281
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:18,278
series there's just a whole mess of and

282
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,519
in fact one things I was say the big

283
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:23,439
problem is

284
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:25,078
that uh I don't often times believe that

285
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,360
lab says or what the what the

286
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:30,159
manufacturer says on their website about

287
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,839
EP and the more we can out about whether

288
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:37,838
some of these things really work or not

289
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,120
better yeah so in didn't hear um sharing

290
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,079
that these a lot different bile

291
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,839
pesticides in organic Capital production

292
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:44,919
and also the importance of knowing

293
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,160
whether these bile pesticides work and

294
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:49,599
my 100% agree we're going to address

295
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:52,559
that a little bit probably not as much

296
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,920
as you want I have not done and have not

297
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:57,479
read as many trials as I wish were out

298
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:59,679
there in field but I'll tell you what I

299
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,320
know

300
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,319
anyone else want to

301
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,278
share works pretty

302
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:17,958
good so in

303
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,879
beans

304
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:23,198
okay yeah serving

305
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,519
habitat serving habitat yeah we're going

306
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:27,198
to talk about

307
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:29,919
that okay

308
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:32,679
yeah and first we talk about so

309
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,599
conserving insect natural enemies by

310
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:37,078
creating habitat for them or just

311
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,360
protecting them so insects insect

312
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:39,919
natural enemies that are going to help

313
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,519
you with Pest Control need the same

314
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,519
things that every living thing needs

315
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,000
they need food they need shelter and

316
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,240
they need protection from harm I think a

317
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,039
great opportunity for conservation bio

318
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,159
control in an organic setting is you're

319
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:55,399
already not using a lot of the chemicals

320
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:57,039
that conventional farmers are using that

321
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:00,159
are killing some of their natural

322
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,439
enemies and so um contributing to pest

323
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,919
problem so I think that's a great

324
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,519
opportunity in organic production um it

325
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:09,599
can fit well in the system in that you

326
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:12,278
are the organic P pesticides that are

327
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,680
approved for use in organic agriculture

328
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:17,240
are often going to have lower impacts on

329
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:19,838
the insect natural en that going be

330
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,639
hethy at least in the past there has

331
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,440
also been some funding available through

332
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:26,440
your local nrcs offices to help you

333
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,120
establish for example grinding of wild

334
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,839
flowers that will feed um insects that

335
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,720
that help you with pass control I have

336
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,199
no idea if that is going to continue to

337
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,480
be available in the future butc to reach

338
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:40,679
out to your local nrcs office about

339
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:43,480
something that's of interest to you

340
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:45,638
there are some challenges um and this I

341
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:49,759
think is the challenge really across Ed

342
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:52,440
culture is um wanting to have a formula

343
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:55,799
I want to you know tell me which flowers

344
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,440
to plan what area how close to my crop

345
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:59,159
so that I will control my Pest and

346
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,360
there's very few situations where we

347
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:03,559
have a good formula of this is exactly

348
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,440
how you need to provide habitat for

349
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:07,559
insect natural enemies in order to get

350
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,800
past there's a few examples but not too

351
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:12,078
many of them and then the other thing I

352
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:14,559
wanted to point out was that um just

353
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:17,078
because something is organic approved

354
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:19,319
does not mean it's going to not kill any

355
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:22,239
or and you're probably aware of that

356
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,240
already but just wanted to mention that

357
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,079
we can have a whole talk about

358
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,720
conservation bio control not today there

359
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:31,559
will be some more resources and the

360
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,560
links going

361
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:37,958
up here's one example oh question this

362
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:41,240
is specifically about what you were just

363
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:44,399
talking about but I just thought of um a

364
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:48,440
phone trap we use phone traps to capture

365
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:53,600
Indian me mod where does that fit in

366
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:56,600
your is that a bio control where you fit

367
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:01,000
Inon so according to the EPA phones are

368
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,560
bopes bopes yes so the fairon itself

369
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,839
doesn't kill

370
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:07,799
the the insect pulling the insect into

371
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,480
get it C on

372
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:16,039
a yes yeah and it has to do with the

373
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:19,759
definition of a pesi um and you know for

374
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:21,319
example um repellant also pesticides

375
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:25,480
right they're not killing the

376
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:29,240
insect but but Fones are bio

377
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:31,120
classified yeah uh they so

378
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,839
I have a ven diagram that I didn't show

379
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:38,078
here today um the so bio controls would

380
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:43,160
include insects and NEOS that kill pests

381
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:45,519
and microbes that kill pests the um

382
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:48,360
Regulators have decided that if it's a

383
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,560
micro a plant extract or a biochemical

384
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,159
it's a biopesticide insects and

385
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,559
nematodes are exempt from being

386
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:57,278
regulated

387
00:15:54,559 --> 00:16:01,679
under even though they also

388
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,679
have it's some mantics

389
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,599
right uh so here's an example of a bio

390
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:10,198
control agent you might be conserving

391
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,639
that's rant and field cross um this is a

392
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:15,120
tiny parasitoid wasp that attachs zal

393
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,318
leaf fetal it was introduced to the US

394
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,919
quite a while ago it can be found in New

395
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:21,240
York but I'm told that it can be a

396
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:24,278
little bit sporadic in its populations

397
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,240
you cannot buy it commercially right now

398
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:29,439
um an interesting thing about the WASP

399
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,839
is that it's going to its activity

400
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,040
in this season 2025 is going to impact

401
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,920
the serial LEF Beetle population in 2026

402
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:39,120
so it's a situation which I think is

403
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:41,879
pretty a pretty common thing in organic

404
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,198
production where you are thinking about

405
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:46,000
the future you know you're doing things

406
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:49,078
this year that are going to impact years

407
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,078
down the road your past population um

408
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:53,159
and one of the ways uh you can conserve

409
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:54,758
it is through reducing pesticide use and

410
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:57,039
creating sweetberries in the farm where

411
00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:01,440
not using pesticides which again I think

412
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,439
is a great opport opportunity get

413
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:07,279
FR all right so we talked about

414
00:17:03,918 --> 00:17:10,279
conserving uh releasing live bio control

415
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:12,678
agents so there's three these again

416
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:15,838
these would be live bio control agents

417
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:18,240
that are not biopesticides so we have

418
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,759
predators an insect eating another

419
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,160
insect um I have a lady needle picture

420
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:23,798
here but just for the record I want to

421
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,679
say I don't encourage releasing lady

422
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:29,079
beetles out in the field conserving them

423
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:31,679
bringing them in from other places we

424
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:33,960
have parasitoids like that tiny wasp I

425
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,720
just showed you they're laying eggs in

426
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,079
or on the pest that will then eat the

427
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,720
pest from the inside out and then we

428
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:44,038
have enop pathogenic nematodes so some

429
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,360
nematodes are p on Plants others eat

430
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:48,720
insects so these tiny nematodes

431
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:50,879
collaborate with the bacteria that's

432
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,240
inside the nematode they invade the

433
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,799
insect together with the bacteria they

434
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:59,558
kill the insect reproduce the insect

435
00:17:55,798 --> 00:18:02,119
gets full of more tiny nitos and then

436
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:05,038
they go out into the soil and find more

437
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:05,038
ins e

438
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:11,480
Prett an example of releasing body

439
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,038
control agents would be antipathic nemat

440
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,360
for control of alal M Beetle this is

441
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:17,119
something that I know has been used

442
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,199
extensively at least in Northern New

443
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,519
York um and they had really good luck

444
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,759
controlling alus and outf this way

445
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:26,879
especially because it turns out that you

446
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:30,679
can apply this mixture of nematodes that

447
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,640
were first isolated from soils by El

448
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:35,360
Shields that Corel um and then they will

449
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,880
persist in the soil you make one

450
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:41,119
application and you're good to go which

451
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,039
is pretty unusual for Bio controls there

452
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:45,079
is some evidence that these nematodes

453
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,839
can also feed on other soil dwell and

454
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:49,038
insects and there's ongoing research

455
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:50,879
that figure that out um for example

456
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:52,759
there's some evidence that this can help

457
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,559
you with corn root worms but we don't

458
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:56,440
know as much about um those P yet as we

459
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:59,319
do

460
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,320
about and there will be again the Link

461
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:02,678
in the resources that you're getting

462
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:05,240
after the meeting if you want to read

463
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:05,240
more about

464
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:13,279
this in the um realm of releasing vales

465
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,000
I want to mention a resource from the

466
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,158
New York State inte as man program so we

467
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,960
are collecting a growing list of

468
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:24,080
profiles and bi control agents this is a

469
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:27,360
picture of the page that's about t je

470
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:29,038
the um seral parasitoid the goal with

471
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,798
these profiles is to try to get

472
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:33,400
practical information distill into small

473
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:35,879
chunks so you get quick answers to the

474
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:39,360
questions does it work where do I use it

475
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,120
can I buy it SS of things um so QR code

476
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:44,558
here but there's also a link that'll be

477
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,558
coming out resources as

478
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:49,640
well so we talked about conserving we

479
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:51,639
talked about releasing and we're going

480
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,480
to talk about spraying um I'm glad

481
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,840
somebody mentioned using some of the

482
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,440
biopesticides and fruit CRS at least um

483
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:00,959
so spraying biopesticides

484
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,120
um can sometimes feel a little bit like

485
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,120
spraying regular pafy you can use

486
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:08,158
sprayer but there's some nuances uh to

487
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:11,079
it as

488
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,080
well so as we discussed before

489
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:16,119
biopesticides we we can use AC

490
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:18,918
ingredients plant extracts microbes and

491
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:21,558
biochemicals they are still pesticides

492
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:23,000
which means that um all of these things

493
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:26,000
that you might think about if you're

494
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,240
using non biopesticide apply to them as

495
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,558
well um so reading the labels really in

496
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,880
they all have restricted entry intervals

497
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:35,599
they are often shorter than a

498
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,000
non-biological or conventional pesticide

499
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,839
um but they they'll be on the label many

500
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,679
of them are approved for use or

501
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,639
production but not all of them are so

502
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,000
that's an important thing to check they

503
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,679
will have information on the label about

504
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,200
PPE that you have to wear when you're

505
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,480
applying them and then at the bottom of

506
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:57,600
the slide I wanted to point out that not

507
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,440
all biopesticides are um completely safe

508
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:02,359
for all insects so this is from a

509
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,600
biopesticide label and it notes that if

510
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:07,399
you have direct contact between the

511
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:09,719
biopesticide and bees you can harm bees

512
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,278
so it tells you not to spray this when

513
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,000
bees are part problem so again really

514
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:16,440
important to read the label just because

515
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,599
it has bio in the name doesn't mean it's

516
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,600
zero risk in it

517
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,880
har any of the biopesticides are there

518
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,879
any of them like restricted use where

519
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,159
they would require you know DC SP

520
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,720
license

521
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:37,440
am not aware of any biopesticides that

522
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:37,440
are restricted use in agriculture

523
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:44,919
please the example I'm thinking of is um

524
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:46,759
there's a B for that you might need a

525
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:50,159
license to be able to buy the product

526
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:50,158
that's not to

527
00:21:51,599 --> 00:22:00,000
yeah you do okay thank you I appreciate

528
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
that um

529
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:07,319
yeah it's because because B are such a

530
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,919
big group um you would want to look at

531
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:11,519
the product you're using and and what

532
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:11,520
the requirs

533
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,960
are of action so some of the bopes

534
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,278
moments of action are very similar to a

535
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:23,200
non biop pesi you're just poisoning the

536
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:25,278
pest um whether it's something extracted

537
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,600
from a plant or something produced by a

538
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:29,720
microb or the microb itself you spray it

539
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,839
on the insect you spray on the pathogen

540
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,640
you're killing it um and we're pretty

541
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,278
familiar with pze working that way um

542
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,159
the picture on the right with the two

543
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:39,960
yellow moths and No Love Is in the Air

544
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,600
this is an example this is my depiction

545
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,600
of a pheromone right because that's how

546
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:47,798
pheromones work they're mimicking the um

547
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:49,439
chemical that insects produce to find B

548
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:51,119
um and so you're disrupting that when

549
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,440
you're using

550
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:57,000
pheromones some of the insect

551
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,679
bioinsecticide modes of action um are

552
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,519
also similar to some of the

553
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:04,159
nonbiological insecticide moov action so

554
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:06,079
for example you can have bioinsecticides

555
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,520
that are going to stop insects from

556
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,558
growing is that grow Regulators that's a

557
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:14,038
thing that is um available in

558
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:17,079
nonbiological pdes as well we have

559
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:20,240
repellant um and then some bcise will

560
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:22,319
stop the insect from feeding um days

561
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,359
before the insect actually dies and this

562
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,359
is something that you'll see in

563
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:33,960
and then there's some modes of action

564
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:35,759
that are maybe um different from more

565
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,519
different from the non-biological

566
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,960
pesticides so I like to call this one a

567
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:44,079
here or eat where a fungus is eating an

568
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,880
insect or eating another fungus um if

569
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:49,599
you have ever heard of using contans or

570
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,640
it might name now um it's a fungus that

571
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:54,639
eats the scleria of white mold so you

572
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,360
have one fungus that's eating another

573
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,080
fungus some biop pesticides are

574
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:02,119
formulated with living microorganisms

575
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:04,079
that grow over the surface of the plant

576
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:06,519
whether it's leaf or root or fruit or

577
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:08,839
flowers and they take up so much space

578
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:11,918
on the plant tissue that the pathogens

579
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:14,759
can't find a place to land and start

580
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:17,600
grow and then there's some bioptic and

581
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:19,640
some nonbiological PS too that will

582
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:21,519
activate the plants defenses which is

583
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,440
what I have attempted to show here with

584
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,798
lightning bols coming out of the plant

585
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,558
so you're priming the plant by exposing

586
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:31,319
it to the biopesticide and turning on

587
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:35,000
defenses early so when the pest shows up

588
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:35,000
um the plant is better able to defend

589
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,919
as and then this Mo action is

590
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,880
complicated because we talked before

591
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:45,000
about how bio stimulants grow healthy

592
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:47,720
plants and biopesticides neutral pests

593
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,440
but some biopesticides work by growing

594
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,519
stronger and healthier plants so the

595
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,960
label will actually say this

596
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:55,918
biopesticide controls this pest because

597
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,000
it grows a stronger plant and that's

598
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,720
confusing right because bio stimulus

599
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,839
also grower plants it really just comes

600
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:07,480
down to the stated purpose on the label

601
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:09,639
and how the manufacturer has chosen to

602
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,360
register or not register that product

603
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,200
and the claims

604
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:17,240
that there are more resources available

605
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,679
on bies M action so I have two blog

606
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,240
posts one that focuses on biopesticides

607
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:25,080
for plant diseases one that focuses on

608
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,120
BI pdes or insect test and those links

609
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:28,918
will be in the resources as well and I'm

610
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,119
happy to share hard copies if anyone

611
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:31,120
like

612
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:36,200
some why do you care about the active

613
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,360
ingredient of a bopes or the motive

614
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,798
action um there's really important

615
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:43,038
implications for how these products work

616
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:45,398
so for example when you might want to

617
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:47,398
use it if you were trying to stimulate

618
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:49,719
your plan defenses and that's how the

619
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:52,558
biopesticide works you have to get it on

620
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,960
in enough time before the pest shows up

621
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:57,359
that you can have that defense

622
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,919
activation also it's important because

623
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:02,119
as patients what success looks like so

624
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,480
for example if a biopesticide is going

625
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:07,519
to stop insect heating but the insects

626
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,519
might not die for 3 to seven days if you

627
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:11,639
go out into the field two days later and

628
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:13,639
your insects Aren't Dead did it work or

629
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,240
did it not work right so knowing how a

630
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,960
product works can tell you how to use it

631
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,278
so that you're most likely to see

632
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,840
results and also what success is going

633
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:24,240
to look

634
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,519
like and then knowing whether the active

635
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,319
ingredient in a biopesticide is alive is

636
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:30,240
really important because there's some

637
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,599
important implications for how long it's

638
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,359
going to last so how much product are

639
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:35,759
you buying how long can you keep it

640
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:38,479
before it's going to start losing

641
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:40,359
efficacy how you should store it there

642
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,399
are some bile pesticides that are

643
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:45,278
actually supposed to be stored either in

644
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:47,959
a refrigerator or a freezer um which is

645
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:50,599
an important thing to keep in mind um

646
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:53,720
and you you

647
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:55,000
know sure this happens but technically

648
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,640
if it's stored in refrigerator or

649
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,880
freezer it should be a refrigerator or

650
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,320
freezer that's only used for PD right

651
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,799
because you're not scoring pesticides

652
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:04,519
with other things how often does that

653
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:05,679
happen right so just being aware you

654
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:08,278
know you don't want to spend a lot of

655
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,640
money on a product store in properly and

656
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:12,919
have so knowing that ahead of time is

657
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,799
important yeah make sure on shipping

658
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:17,840
they when ship still under those

659
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:20,038
conditions has yes absolutely checking

660
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:23,480
the shipping as well um I know when

661
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:25,759
folks um so releasing insect Biol agents

662
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,360
is really common Greenhouse production

663
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:29,480
and it's often recommended when you're

664
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:32,158
live insects to check the temperature of

665
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,558
the box right to make sure that it

666
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,278
didn't go out of range and

667
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:39,398
Sh um and then also with the live

668
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:41,159
microbes there's some implications for

669
00:27:39,398 --> 00:27:44,239
the optimal conditions when you're doing

670
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:48,200
application as well whether it's pH tank

671
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,200
um or the time of day or things like

672
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,319
that I wish I had more of these made I

673
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:57,320
only have 11 so far um I started putting

674
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:59,119
together these biopesticide profiles

675
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:00,918
because there are a lot of details about

676
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:02,839
B pesticides that can make a big

677
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:05,278
difference um if you're thinking about

678
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:07,678
using the product things like it shelf

679
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:11,319
life how you should store it how it

680
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,798
works um is it how does it do a UV right

681
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:16,000
how long is it going to be able to

682
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:18,158
withstand sunlight outside um is there

683
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,319
an optimal temperature range to use it

684
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,320
these are not meant to replace a label

685
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:24,000
obviously but the goal was to get some

686
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,038
of that practical information in one

687
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,119
place so that you as a grower aren't

688
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:30,240
tracking down EPA registration do

689
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:32,398
documents and brochures from the

690
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,759
manufacturer and the product label when

691
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:36,558
you're trying to figure out how to do

692
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:38,839
something um so there'll be uh links to

693
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:40,918
these as well in emails coming through

694
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:43,158
pron and I can get you part copies if

695
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,159
You'

696
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:51,759
like all right and this what you really

697
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:53,558
want to know do biases work and I don't

698
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,679
have a great answer for you I wish I had

699
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:57,798
really I wish had a much better answer

700
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,240
for you um and I'm going to explain to

701
00:28:57,798 --> 00:29:02,798
you why I don't have a better answer for

702
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,960
you why it's complicated uh so something

703
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:09,038
that I spent a lot of time on is I look

704
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:12,399
through replicated research trials to

705
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:14,359
collect efficacy data on biopesticides I

706
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:16,038
try to rotate through all the crops

707
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:18,879
which means at the moment the field

708
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:21,919
crops spreadsheet is a couple years old

709
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:24,600
it's on the list for this year um I did

710
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:27,000
do a quick search to see what I could

711
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:30,119
find about some things like f arean

712
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,359
headlight or potentially um c p pass and

713
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:35,079
corn and soybeans I will say I don't

714
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:37,558
have there was nothing that jumped out

715
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:39,519
to me that's like wow this 100% works

716
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:41,720
you should definitely try this product

717
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:44,159
but I am collecting this information so

718
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,880
that it is more available and easier to

719
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,960
find later these are on our website

720
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,880
we'll be L to them as well I said this

721
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,640
is a few years out of date um but I work

722
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,799
on keeping them updated there are not

723
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:58,880
nearly as many trials and fill props or

724
00:29:55,798 --> 00:30:01,918
bi slides as there are in vegetables um

725
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,919
and that is

726
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,159
unfortunate I did find this article

727
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:10,759
which was interesting so this is a meta

728
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:13,640
analysis of 56 studies focusing on

729
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:16,158
ferium headlight and leat and they were

730
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,799
um the studies were all looking at

731
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:21,519
microbial biocontrol agents so things

732
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:23,558
that could be in biopesticides however I

733
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,319
will say none of these studies were

734
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:27,158
actually looking at formulated

735
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:29,119
biopesticides so there's a big

736
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:31,480
difference sometimes between a

737
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:34,079
researcher mixes up a microb and applies

738
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:36,278
it in a crop and gets a result versus

739
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:38,278
what happens if that microb actually

740
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:42,359
makes it to be formulated and

741
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:45,679
commercially available um the other

742
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:48,519
thing this um paper the goal was to look

743
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,798
at overall patterns and efficacy of all

744
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:53,480
of these microbial CL controls so if

745
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:55,720
there wasn't like a this microbial bio

746
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,159
control agent definitely works um and in

747
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,399
looking through the list of microbes

748
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:01,159
they looked at very few of the ones they

749
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:03,319
looked at are commercially available

750
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:06,880
right now as far as I know which is

751
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:08,879
unfortunate and a challenge enough the

752
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,559
pie of science slow

753
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,360
sometimes but there were some

754
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:16,879
interesting patterns in this um review

755
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:19,439
so um if you look at this chart here

756
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,720
this middle line is no different from

757
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,240
doing nothing at

758
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:27,399
all and in general overall the bio

759
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,519
control agents did tend to reduce

760
00:31:27,398 --> 00:31:32,199
disease you looked at all the studies

761
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,679
together they maybe had a slight impact

762
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,399
on yield and I know there were several

763
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,320
other studies here today that showed

764
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:39,638
some changes in pest pressure or some

765
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:44,319
changes in um pest numbers but not

766
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:47,319
necessarily yield a lot of them also um

767
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:51,798
R uh toxins mostly what they looked at

768
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:51,798
was non toxins in um these

769
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,679
studies but it was also really

770
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,320
complicated and this is the thing that

771
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,519
happens a lot when we talk about bio

772
00:31:57,319 --> 00:32:01,240
controls and

773
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:04,919
biopesticides um so for example they

774
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:07,278
looked at studies that compared

775
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:10,159
um wheat cultivars that were very

776
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:12,079
susceptible to fite and wheat cultivars

777
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,440
that were less susceptible and they

778
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:17,359
found that the bio control agents the

779
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:20,159
biop active ingredients um reduce

780
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:23,479
disease and increased yield more in the

781
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:28,440
highly susceptable varieties but you got

782
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:31,038
better um nontoxin reduction in the less

783
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,519
varities so that's confusing and

784
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:35,759
complicated um it's that's what they

785
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:38,440
found they also found some interesting

786
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:41,319
differences and again it's complicated

787
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:43,679
in terms of when you apply the microbial

788
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:45,079
bio control agent um and each microbial

789
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,038
bio control agent is going to do

790
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:49,240
different things right so each one you

791
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:52,720
know maybe it is better applied to seed

792
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:55,200
or maybe it is better applied um to the

793
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,240
actual wheat head um they found that in

794
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,200
general when you make the application at

795
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,839
thesis compared to a seed treatment you

796
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:05,000
boosted yield however if you apply to

797
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:07,158
seeds or kernels you are more likely to

798
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,398
reduce Dawn

799
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:13,639
um than um if you apply D thesis you

800
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:16,079
could still reduce the da production if

801
00:33:13,638 --> 00:33:18,199
you appli in thesis but the effect was

802
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:20,240
so the point is it's complicated I wish

803
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,480
it was less complicated I wish it was

804
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,798
more

805
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,919
straightforward um my bottom line of

806
00:33:23,798 --> 00:33:28,359
biopesticides is I do think that there's

807
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,440
a lot of promise to them um but I don't

808
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:32,079
know enough right now to confidently

809
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,038
tell you you should go out and buy this

810
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:37,240
product I think we definitely need more

811
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:39,558
research um and I think it is probably

812
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,359
also going to be a situation where

813
00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:43,359
you'll try some things out on your farm

814
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:46,319
and have experiences and see what you

815
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:48,278
like and what works well for you I am

816
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:50,720
always happy to talk about to talk more

817
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:52,240
about this um and to do some work in the

818
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,120
literature if you have some the

819
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,839
questions I'll share my time and

820
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:57,839
information at the end

821
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:02,518
I did want to mention too I think I

822
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,399
don't know if any of you have um heard

823
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:07,960
my colleague Ken wise speak about some

824
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:10,519
of the imun Alternatives research um

825
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,320
you're probably aware there's a lot of

826
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:14,398
information now and energy around

827
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,359
finding alternatives to un kinoid

828
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:18,199
insecticides and I think some of that

829
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:20,598
may be beneficial to the organic

830
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:22,598
Community as well um so as we're

831
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:25,159
investigating alternative sea treatments

832
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:27,200
or some cultural controls or models that

833
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:29,358
are going to predict when sea corn

834
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,398
maggot press going to be the highest I

835
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:33,358
think that'll all be useful we don't

836
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:35,039
have answers for yet we are working on

837
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:38,719
it and I'm hoping that um there'll be

838
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:38,719
some work good information coming out of

839
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:44,480
this want to wrap up with just a little

840
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,599
more information about

841
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,719
Biance um so this is the latest I could

842
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:52,599
find proposed definition but not

843
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:55,358
finalized so that's one of the challenge

844
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:57,280
bio stimulus there's not even an

845
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:59,119
official definition for them which means

846
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,720
they're not regulated and that can lead

847
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:05,480
to a lot of variability amongst products

848
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:08,279
or among amongst B of the same

849
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:10,920
product um I mentioned before Plant

850
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,119
seaweed extracts microbes and other

851
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,920
natural chemicals this is kind of a more

852
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,720
detailed list the um top four are the

853
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,119
kind of more common active ingredients

854
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:24,199
you'll see in BIO stimulants um so cvra

855
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:25,640
even in of itself is really Broad and

856
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:28,118
there can be a lot of variability

857
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:30,279
depending on where the CV was harvested

858
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:33,559
from or how it's

859
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:35,680
processed humid andic acids are the more

860
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:37,880
common carbon based acids that can be

861
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:40,719
biostimulants they're just byproducts of

862
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:43,200
organic material decomposing which you

863
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:45,838
may have already a lot on your F

864
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:47,679
anyway protein

865
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:49,519
hydrolysates really hard time saying

866
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:51,519
that word are just proteins broken into

867
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:54,759
pieces you can break them into pieces

868
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:56,679
with acids or bases or enzymes and also

869
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,920
the protein source that you're breaking

870
00:35:56,679 --> 00:36:00,199
up can very a lot and I'm told that

871
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,358
depending on what the source of the

872
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:04,639
protein is can determine whether it's

873
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:06,960
approved for organic production or not

874
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:08,879
so again just like with the biopet side

875
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,440
it's really important to check about the

876
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,440
product that you're using um microbes

877
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,679
and then also in addition to that plant

878
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,599
extracts enzymes tyos in carbohydrates

879
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:21,159
this is a big I think over time we're

880
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,000
going to continue to get more and more

881
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:26,039
information about biostimulant and how

882
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,719
we can be using them um just a couple

883
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:30,880
things to keep in mind is a lot of

884
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:33,318
variability um in terms of the source

885
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,200
materials you within those groups in

886
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:37,358
terms of the extraction methods and

887
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,519
between batches and all of those things

888
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:41,960
can impact how well the products work

889
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:44,719
and if they work on your farm I

890
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:46,519
mentioned already the organic approval

891
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:48,279
um if it's a live micro obviously you

892
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:50,519
want to think about storage and shelf

893
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,519
life and then this last point I think is

894
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:55,039
an interesting one because a lot of

895
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:57,079
these biostimulant work by increasing

896
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:59,400
the plant's ability to be resilient in

897
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:02,280
the face of stress if you use these

898
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,838
products in multiple years but some

899
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,839
years are more stressful for your plant

900
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:07,799
than others you might expect to see more

901
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:09,960
of an impact when the plant experiences

902
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,440
stress than when it doesn't so in some

903
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,318
ways it's a little bit of an insurance

904
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,800
because you can't always predict when

905
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:16,800
your plants are going to experience

906
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,760
stress um but just another complication

907
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,560
to be aware

908
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:23,640
of and I know it's late um but my

909
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:25,199
contact information is here including my

910
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:29,519
phone number in case you'd like to get

911
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,519
in touch and I appreciate your attention

912
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,720
have any questions

913
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:41,000
forar yes

914
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:45,319
yes with

915
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:49,679
the a little um so contents for

916
00:37:45,318 --> 00:37:51,838
sareia um I have heard that you that

917
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:55,039
some people have had success using it

918
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:57,719
for white and soybeans um but I've also

919
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:59,880
heard that it's a situation where it

920
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:01,598
probably works better if you apply it

921
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,440
year after year after year because

922
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:07,559
you're degrading spoa in the soil and so

923
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:10,358
you're reducing your um population of

924
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:12,599
the white pathogen in the soil over time

925
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:15,159
I've also heard it's pretty expensive

926
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:18,760
those are the things that know

927
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:21,318
about it also can be um I I do have one

928
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:23,560
of those bopes profiles about it I think

929
00:38:21,318 --> 00:38:25,838
that timing is tricky it's because it's

930
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:28,440
a live fungus and because you have to

931
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:30,799
get it in tou with those l the soil and

932
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,679
not dry out the time is a little bit

933
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,680
about getting into the

934
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:40,960
field yes I've also heard is suggested

935
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:43,960
to do a fall application so I think

936
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:46,280
that's potentially an option but um I'm

937
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:49,079
happy to get your contact information

938
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:51,720
and and remind myself of those details

939
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,720
number of years

940
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:59,318
ago yes yeah um I think Keith wal have

941
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,240
looked at that a little bit in field

942
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:05,800
crops and also Hiller has looked at in

943
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:08,358
vegetables for snap beans um yeah I

944
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,720
think it can work it can be a little FY

945
00:39:08,358 --> 00:39:10,719
and it's

946
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:18,239
expensive this has been a production of

947
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:21,239
Cornell University on the web at
