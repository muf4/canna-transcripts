00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:12,638
University thank you everyone for

3
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:16,118
joining the pppm Dei committee is lucky

4
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:18,039
today to host Theo newold a PhD student

5
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:21,079
from the Pennsylvania State

6
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:23,039
University their research focuses on the

7
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:24,799
influence of agricultural Management on

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,480
the composition of fungal Endo fidic

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,439
communities in maze co-advised by

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,039
doctors sharifa Crandle and Gretchen

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,679
cual

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,920
they are a fellow of the prestigious

13
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:37,238
foundation for food and agriculture

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,840
research program and the first student

15
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:43,679
to work towards a dual title microbiome

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,079
sciences and Plant Pathology PhD at Penn

17
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:49,159
State they have been spotlighted in

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,320
numerous Outlets including a nature

19
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:54,759
career feature article Theo is the

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,840
outgoing chair of the aps diversity

21
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:58,479
equity and inclusion committee and has

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,320
worked for social justice causes

23
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,799
throughout the various institutions they

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,759
have

25
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:05,719
attended through their background in

26
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,640
service they have been not only a

27
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:11,039
personal inspiration to me but to many

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,239
others I know in the Plant Pathology

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,479
Community today's talk is a bit of a

30
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:18,000
pivot from the typical ppmb seminars

31
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,798
since instead of discussing Theo's

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,280
research we are highlighting the

33
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,439
humanity behind the work and showcasing

34
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,359
the diverse lived experiences of members

35
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:30,879
of our community please welcome Theo

36
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:34,280
newold thank you so much Izzy I'm

37
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:36,879
incredibly humbled by by your by your

38
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,560
introduction and I want to apologize to

39
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,640
everybody it was my greatest intention

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,000
to be with you in person um my partner

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,040
was injured and so everyone was I really

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,799
appreciate you being able to Pivot um

43
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,200
and allow me the space on

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,640
Zoom so as Izzy said my name is Theo um

45
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,759
I'm a third-year PhD student in the

46
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,640
department of Plant Pathology and

47
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,079
environmental microbiology at Penn State

48
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,039
um I'm also a far fellow as she

49
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,319
mentioned and a microbiome dual title

50
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:07,280
student and now typically when we come

51
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,840
in to hear research talks often times

52
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,080
the recommendation that's given to us is

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,159
to use a personal

54
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,920
experience to bridge our audience with

55
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:18,799
our

56
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,479
research but today instead I'm going to

57
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,840
actually use my research as a bridge to

58
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:26,479
my journey and why I view the importance

59
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,759
of this kind of work talking about and

60
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,439
highlighting my mentors and work in

61
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:32,959
service

62
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:34,680
so my disseration work largely looks at

63
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,120
understanding how agronomic factors

64
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,800
shape the folar fungal endite community

65
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,200
of

66
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,800
maze now classic definitions of

67
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:43,439
endophytes typically say that these are

68
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,800
organisms that live asymptomatically

69
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,199
with implant tissue and that they either

70
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,280
have a positive or largely commensal

71
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:52,679
relationship with their host and this

72
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,840
often time ignores the cases or

73
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,480
situations in which parasitic um

74
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,039
organisms colonize that tissue as as

75
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:02,439
well excuse me um and so for for my

76
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:03,840
definition I'm focusing on organisms

77
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:05,840
specifically fungi that live

78
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,360
asymptomatically within a host for at

79
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,920
least part of their lifetime and that's

80
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,640
obviously building on previous

81
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:12,839
definitions and really why do we care

82
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:15,719
about

83
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,319
endites well fundamentally we're really

84
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:19,400
interested in them for Bio control um

85
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:21,039
and we're interested in them in the

86
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,158
context of their of their pathogenicity

87
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,639
and ability to cause disease now

88
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:26,798
traditionally when we think about end

89
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,399
ofy research specifically in maze we

90
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,640
think about most work that's been done

91
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,519
in Roots and seeds and this isn't

92
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,839
surprising right the relationship

93
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,120
between nutrient uptake and roots and

94
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,680
yield or seed Health are going to be

95
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,239
fundamental to our Growers who are more

96
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,400
most interested in the um yield outcome

97
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,759
of their crops um this work also

98
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,480
typically prioritizes beneficial

99
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:51,039
relationships um without um directly

100
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,438
talking about

101
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:56,199
pathogens but we really haven't looked

102
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:58,799
at what factors Drive these communities

103
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:01,238
in an above ground or for my work folar

104
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,200
context and why we might think about

105
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,360
this is in relationships to pathogens

106
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,560
and disease we know that these organisms

107
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,720
colonize full of your tissues and those

108
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,959
can serve as inoculum points um for

109
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,759
these pathogens we might also think

110
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,280
about the relationship between or the

111
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:20,159
success of um potential biological

112
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,039
control agents in um these systems and

113
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,800
the potential for existing microbial

114
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,720
communities to shape the success of

115
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,918
those agents and then thinking about the

116
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,240
ways in which climate change um May

117
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:34,639
reshape these communities and really

118
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:37,038
focusing in um on why this work is

119
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,280
important now what we're looking at are

120
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:42,159
a wide variety of large categories of

121
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:45,038
potential drivers of these communities

122
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,520
um we know um in a broad sense that

123
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:50,038
these drivers uh going to be largely um

124
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,478
interaction between abiotic and biotic

125
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:54,199
factors things like environmental stress

126
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,879
um anthropogenic

127
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:59,038
factors and my work focuses on five main

128
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,120
areas looking at neighboring vegetation

129
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:03,399
cover crop s looking at anthropogenic

130
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,519
factors such as management style um and

131
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:07,319
environmental stress and all of this

132
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,519
work in the context of the folar

133
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,599
environment the leaf is a really unique

134
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,758
plant organ that's going to be

135
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,280
continuously experiencing extremes

136
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,080
extreme cold or heat continuous UV

137
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:20,439
radiation direct impact with those

138
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,839
anthropogenic factors throughout the

139
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:25,120
season um and so this creates a very

140
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:27,198
unique space for

141
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,560
colonization some of my objectives I

142
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,280
have F five main objectives the first is

143
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,680
to look at these communities over the

144
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:36,959
developmental time of the plant

145
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,160
including the planted seed and harvested

146
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,680
seed and how these communities change

147
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,600
over developmental

148
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,120
time then looking at cover crops we know

149
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,560
that for both um conventional Management

150
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,038
Systems as well as organic systems that

151
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,000
the use of cover crops is increasing um

152
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,879
and we're really interested in how these

153
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,399
different leges are going to be

154
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,639
impacting these microbial

155
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:01,799
communities also thinking about very

156
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,478
broadly the use of organic versus con

157
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,600
conventional management practices and we

158
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:08,199
know that these regimes vary and they're

159
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,199
really more of a scale um between those

160
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:11,360
two different categories but thinking

161
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,079
about how those different practices

162
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,680
shape these communities and similarly

163
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,879
thinking about non-target fundas side

164
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,840
effects this conversation comes a comes

165
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:21,800
up a lot actually in Pennsylvania where

166
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,079
tarpot of corn is going to going to

167
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,038
likely become a bigger issue and Growers

168
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:27,038
who may not have been applying

169
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,879
fungicides prior may start to apply

170
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:30,598
fungicides and so thinking about how

171
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,079
those known non-target effects are going

172
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:34,038
to shape these

173
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,560
communities and then finally thinking

174
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:38,399
about stress I don't have to give you a

175
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,918
quantifiable measure of drought to tell

176
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:43,399
you you could walk out into a maze field

177
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:46,000
here in Pennsylvania in July or August

178
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:47,519
and you can feel it drought has been a A

179
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,839
continuing ongoing issue for the last

180
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,240
couple years and is likely to be

181
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,758
exacerbated as climate change impacts

182
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,840
are felt I'm not just here where I am in

183
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,960
Pennsylvania but also across the Globe

184
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,839
places like the global South so thinking

185
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,439
about how these stress events

186
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,959
specifically drought events are going to

187
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,478
be shaping these

188
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:09,198
communities all of this to say that it's

189
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,758
complex factors that bring these fungal

190
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,840
endites to their

191
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:16,319
host and I think very much in the

192
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:19,638
context of the agroecology

193
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:23,160
space in the context of the human or

194
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:26,519
socioecology space and how our lived

195
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:29,400
experiences bring us to where we are all

196
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:31,000
of us today in in this talk in some way

197
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,159
way or form are in the context of

198
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,478
Academia we all got here but had

199
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,160
different unique lived experiences that

200
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:39,758
brought us to where we

201
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,720
are I like to think of this as in the

202
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,960
context of

203
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,720
intersectionality and the context of the

204
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,719
experiences and identities that we bring

205
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,039
into a space and how that shapes our

206
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,159
interaction with that space say our

207
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:55,079
research for example intersectionality

208
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:57,680
comes from the field of specifically um

209
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:59,839
black feminism the word was first used

210
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,720
by crr Shaw in 1989

211
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,399
to talk about the intersection

212
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,639
intersectional relationship of race

213
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:09,198
class and gender and how those

214
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:11,439
specifically related to people's

215
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,680
experiences with discrimination and

216
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,800
disadvantage but we can think about it

217
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,759
here as the intersection of our

218
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,120
identities and today I have a very

219
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:23,800
unique

220
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:26,319
opportunity to take you along On my

221
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,400
journey and to highlight the mentors

222
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,199
that brought me to where I am and my

223
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,958
work in service

224
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:35,440
because humanizing people is very

225
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,319
important often times especially in the

226
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,519
academic space it's very easy to

227
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,879
dehumanize people especially when we're

228
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,839
under a lot of pressure we're able to

229
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:46,000
push off the realities of the world and

230
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,480
focus in on a specific objective I need

231
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,600
X or Y from a particular person and they

232
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,759
don't get that to me well that's on them

233
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,278
but when we humanize people we think

234
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,439
about their experiences what they're

235
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,958
dealing with on the day-to-day it makes

236
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,480
it easier to empathize and to connect

237
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:03,799
with them and so that's a big part of

238
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,200
what we're doing

239
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:08,838
today I want to come into this space and

240
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,079
recognize my identities I know realize

241
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,519
I'm not there in person but one of those

242
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:15,559
identities is that I'm white I'm a white

243
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,879
eff feminite person and so some of the

244
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:18,679
things I'll share with you today you

245
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,799
will perceive differently than if I was

246
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:22,958
a person of color or

247
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,719
male another one of my identities is

248
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,679
that I come from poverty which I'll talk

249
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,839
about in a little bit so the knowledge

250
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:29,719
that I come into this space with is

251
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,519
going to be different than some of you

252
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,879
who may not have experienced that I'm

253
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,399
also blind which means I'm entering the

254
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:39,799
space

255
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,600
disabled I'm also fat and I'm also

256
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:43,639
transgender and those are going to play

257
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,399
heavily into the experiences I've had

258
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:48,559
and how I enter this space

259
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,600
today when we talk about our lived

260
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:53,879
experiences oftentimes this imaginary

261
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,480
goal that we're going to inspire people

262
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:57,278
comes up and I tell you my goal is not

263
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,039
to inspire you for the love of God don't

264
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:05,720
tell me I inspired you my goals today

265
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:07,360
really are um really are simplified here

266
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,879
and the first off is I want you to take

267
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,560
away this idea that mentorship is a

268
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,559
critical element of success whether

269
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,759
that's academic success or professional

270
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,799
success whether you're a brand new

271
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:19,399
graduate student or you're someone who's

272
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:22,159
been in the field for 25 years mentors

273
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:23,720
are important I also want to highlight

274
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,639
the fact that mentorship does not have

275
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,600
to be complicated it can be as simple as

276
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,919
believing in somebody as trusting

277
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,200
somebody

278
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:35,199
and that prioritizing service and

279
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,959
Community actually will enrich our

280
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,600
graduate experience as well as a

281
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,879
professional careers

282
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,360
overall and I also really want to focus

283
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,799
on this idea that authenticity is

284
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,839
powerful when you show up in a space as

285
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:50,838
your authentic self people see that

286
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,120
people who may share similar identities

287
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:55,360
or experiences to you and they will feel

288
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,560
seen and included as if they belong in

289
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,560
that

290
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:01,519
space like all stories we're going to

291
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,000
start at the beginning in Huntsville

292
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,600
Alabama in

293
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,278
1992 I grew up in Rocket City USA about

294
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,920
until the age of five at the time this

295
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:12,480
was a very small place if you've been

296
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:14,319
there today you know it looks nothing

297
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,360
like this the biggest things of the time

298
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,000
were the Huntsville mall pictured here

299
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,879
and the rocket

300
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,720
center at the time it could be cut said

301
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,439
that I lived in a perfect white picket

302
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,399
fence home and family my father was a

303
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,040
computer engineer my mother a

304
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:31,000
stay-at-home Homemaker who took care of

305
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,439
me and my sister cooked beautiful

306
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,839
dinners and maintained our Iris

307
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:40,560
beds as a child I can remember this

308
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,399
picture up here is our old home used to

309
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,958
be a pine tree in front a pine tree in

310
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,600
back and I remember running through the

311
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:50,319
grass in hot summer day and smelling the

312
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,200
pine and it felt so comforting and

313
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,800
idealic but like things that often

314
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:58,480
appear idic they're often not and when I

315
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:00,000
was five about a year after this cute

316
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,399
picture of my sister and I were T was

317
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,200
taken my mother packed my sister and I

318
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,240
into a U-Haul with all of her belongings

319
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:10,040
less than $100 in her pocket and drove

320
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,039
across the United States to

321
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:15,679
California in California I grew up in

322
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,240
Altadena it's an interesting ju to

323
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,879
position because as you can see from the

324
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,000
picture it's beautiful with massive

325
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:25,639
sloping mountains lots of

326
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,919
green it's also famous for being in a

327
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:31,360
lot of movies for being where famous

328
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:34,000
cinematographers and artists live but

329
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,039
it's also a place of extreme poverty I

330
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,958
grew up in a largely redlined

331
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:40,519
area and without resources it meant that

332
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,359
my childhood was a little bit

333
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:44,519
complicated and this was further

334
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,240
Complicated by the fact that while we

335
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,278
lived with my grandmother at the time

336
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,680
who I am very generously compared to for

337
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,639
her strength and

338
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,679
passion she was dealing with a lot of

339
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,320
health problems one of those is

340
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,838
uncontrolled diabetes which made her

341
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,839
incredibly um abusive

342
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:04,198
and so I grew up in this environment

343
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,600
where we didn't have the resources

344
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:10,559
necessary and

345
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,519
abuse which made my academic

346
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:16,159
world fuzzy it meant that school became

347
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,919
a place to

348
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:21,439
escape but it also meant for me at least

349
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:24,919
this lack of resources that I struggled

350
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,880
heavily in school as a blind student who

351
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:30,198
didn't have uh updated glasses or didn't

352
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:33,159
get to see the my eye doctor frequently

353
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:36,120
enough I struggled to read to write and

354
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:37,719
to engage with the work that I was doing

355
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,919
and because I struggled and had poor

356
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,000
grades my mother who had never gone to

357
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,719
college made it very clear that I likely

358
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,039
would never go to college myself because

359
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,920
she couldn't afford it and because you

360
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:49,639
had to be a straight A student to get

361
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,000
scholarships she didn't know that you

362
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:54,278
could go into life altering debt to get

363
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,639
an education but at the time the

364
00:13:54,278 --> 00:14:00,000
accumulation of my home life my lack of

365
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:01,480
resources and my struggle in school

366
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,320
meant that I really didn't know I was

367
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:07,600
there and I really didn't

368
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,199
care it was up until I got to my 11th

369
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,639
year my second to last year of high

370
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:16,278
school I just transferred from a uh

371
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:18,079
local Charter School to the Blair IB

372
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:20,240
Magnet High School another in

373
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:23,319
interesting juxtaposition in my life

374
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,560
where while simultaneously being a very

375
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:29,680
well-recognized institution it was also

376
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:31,679
poorly funded sat along a um freeway and

377
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:35,719
across the street from us was a power

378
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,799
plant but this was a serious moment of

379
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,879
change for

380
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,519
me I remember day

381
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:44,360
one after we have the initial meeting

382
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:46,399
with with all of the all of the teachers

383
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,278
we got our books and our class schedules

384
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,799
everyone Milling around the campus

385
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:53,000
looking at all the different clubs and

386
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,838
things available to do and against one

387
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,639
of the far fences there was a rickety

388
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,279
brown table with huge three poster

389
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,360
display Boards of people people in

390
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:04,799
hospitals people setting up

391
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:10,000
beds everything in the medical field and

392
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:11,958
I ran over super excited it was a unique

393
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,198
opportunity I thought I want to be

394
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:15,879
involved in this and this little old

395
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:18,319
woman sitting at the table Miss Deborah

396
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:20,078
Hawks who's pictured here she saw my

397
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,040
enthusiasm and made sure I was able to

398
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,679
get

399
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:26,599
involved she didn't just see my

400
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:29,439
enthusiasm as an initial starting point

401
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,360
she saw it as my main driver she cared

402
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,240
more about my enthusiasm and excitement

403
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,360
throughout my entire program than she

404
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,159
did my

405
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,440
grades she gave me every opportunity in

406
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:42,278
a way that no one else had saw my

407
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,040
potential in a way no one else had and

408
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:45,919
most importantly she helped get me my

409
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:49,240
first research experience when I was in

410
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,639
high school it was 11th grade we were

411
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,440
working with graduate students from

412
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,839
Caltech on what's very politely called

413
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:58,800
the solar Army it's a huge NSF Grant to

414
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,639
support um interact research experience

415
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:03,278
es for for high school students focusing

416
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,000
on sustainable energy and the project we

417
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,838
worked on was identifying alternative

418
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,839
catalysts for solar

419
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:14,639
panels it was an incredible opportunity

420
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:17,040
not only did I feel seen in the lab seen

421
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,639
in this space my enthusiasm and

422
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:22,399
capabilities were beyond my grades I got

423
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,000
the experience to not only do research

424
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,399
but also present that research at one of

425
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,639
our

426
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,399
conferences and I knew at this point

427
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,318
that I wanted to go to college I wanted

428
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,720
to pursue

429
00:16:32,318 --> 00:16:36,120
science and at the time I participated

430
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,480
in a program that would have gotten me

431
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,759
into uh a Cal State

432
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,800
University but it was me and 40 other

433
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,199
people competing for that single spot in

434
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:48,639
the Cal State University system and

435
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:51,159
while I didn't make it I did get

436
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,560
accepted into University but the thought

437
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:57,278
of going into debt even at the time

438
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:59,599
which was only $20,000 a year was so

439
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:02,000
scary to me that I just decided to go to

440
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,038
our local community

441
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,679
college and for those of you who've gone

442
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:08,199
to City College or Community College you

443
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,000
know that often times this is a extreme

444
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:13,038
point in our lives of positives

445
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,078
negatives and a lot of growing

446
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:17,480
up for me it was so much so that I

447
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,720
really wasn't sure if I wanted to

448
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,798
continue with school by the time I

449
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,240
finished in

450
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:26,599
2015 I was ready to call it

451
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,359
quits but I was also really trying to

452
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:31,279
escape home and let me tell you there's

453
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:32,918
no better place to escape home than the

454
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,000
coast of

455
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:37,000
California I applied and got into

456
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,558
California State University Monteray Bay

457
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,640
where I did my bachelor's and this is

458
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:44,279
really where things

459
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,520
changed in my second to last spring

460
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:49,240
semester I took a plant physiology class

461
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:52,960
with the only guy on campus doing plant

462
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:55,359
work I was so excited I got to work with

463
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,720
Dr Timothy miles he was he was our our

464
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:02,038
professor for the

465
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:04,440
class and he saw just like Miss Hawks my

466
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:05,960
enthusiasm my enthusiasm mattered more

467
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,759
than my grades in this space the

468
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,960
constant questions and excitement about

469
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,200
the topics and at the end of the

470
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,759
semester when his graduate Stu or sorry

471
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,840
when his undergrads

472
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:19,240
graduated he offered me the opportunity

473
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:21,038
to come work in his lab funded research

474
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,839
mind you to work in his lab to the

475
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:25,640
undergraduate research Opportunity

476
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:28,519
Center and this was an incredible point

477
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,120
in my life I was so excited the work I

478
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:32,038
did focused on comparing molecular

479
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:34,479
diagnostic tools and optimizing DNA

480
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:36,599
extraction methods for pyop cinemoi and

481
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,599
blue blueberry and

482
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:40,639
avocado and while I also got the

483
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:43,678
opportunity to present at a local um

484
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:47,799
Symposium on campus I don't have any

485
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,159
pictures because I was so happy but Tim

486
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:51,879
also sent me to my first American

487
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:54,679
phytopathological society meeting it was

488
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:57,520
2017 San Antonio

489
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:59,280
Texas I was so nervous I couldn't even

490
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,440
say the name of my pathogen I think I

491
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:05,038
just called it

492
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,759
momy I was scared and excited I met so

493
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,000
many different people studying so many

494
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:12,119
different things that when I came back

495
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
to Tim I said Tim I have to be a plant

496
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:16,439
pathologist I have to do it this is what

497
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,599
I want to do with my life i' had such a

498
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,600
good time i' found passion and Tim goes

499
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:23,038
well I guess you're going to grad school

500
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:24,879
and well I didn't have a lot of context

501
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:27,919
for grad school Tim's connection to the

502
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,200
foler Pathology world did bring me to

503
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,159
organ State University where I worked on

504
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,038
my

505
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:36,400
masters and I worked on my masters with

506
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:39,000
Dr wal

507
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,600
mafy my research was really cool I got

508
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,038
to explore the um Fitness cost

509
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:44,759
associated with stul and fungicide

510
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:47,440
resistance in the great powdery mil

511
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:50,279
pathogen Aeros aater and the research

512
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,360
was great and I learned a ton but really

513
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:56,558
what Walt did was two things he trusted

514
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:59,399
me he trusted me way no one else had he

515
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:01,519
trusted me to fail and he trusted me to

516
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,640
succeed he was there to pick me up when

517
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:06,918
I failed and there to push me when I

518
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,720
succeeded he trusted me to come in at 5:

519
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:13,240
am which by the way would not recommend

520
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,640
um and get my research done but

521
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,359
something else he also did aside from

522
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,120
trust me was that he always came into a

523
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:19,279
space authentically now for him it was

524
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:22,158
largely because he didn't know any other

525
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:25,399
way to enter a space but he was always

526
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,919
100% himself from cargo shorts and

527
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:31,280
flipflops in

528
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:33,559
Winter to to the appreciation for

529
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,599
students with non-traditional

530
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:38,879
backgrounds while it was

531
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:42,279
something and his trust in me and his

532
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,600
authenticity really helped me see and

533
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:46,960
express my authentic

534
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:48,678
self part of this was exploring

535
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,600
exploring my gender identity and using

536
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:52,880
new pronouns part of this was bringing

537
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:54,558
my partner to campus events and talking

538
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,720
about my perspectives and Views and

539
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:59,119
needs in the context of social

540
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,759
situations but also got me involved in

541
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:04,839
supporting other students and regardless

542
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:07,759
of of how you feel about employee unions

543
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:10,119
they're a critical part of The Graduate

544
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,240
experience I so happened to serve not

545
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:13,678
only an executive Council of our

546
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,839
employee union the Coalition of graduate

547
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,759
employees at Oregon state but I also

548
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:19,119
served as a liaison between our

549
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:20,839
department and the union and this was a

550
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:23,199
transformative

551
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:24,558
experience at this time I also got the

552
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,919
opportunity to serve on several

553
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,440
diversity Equity inclusion committees

554
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:30,120
within the department of Bot imp Plant

555
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,120
Pathology at Oregon

556
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:35,599
State and in that time one of the main

557
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:38,599
things that I did was rather than

558
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:41,079
focusing on equality which at the time

559
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:43,639
was the main focus at the time I brought

560
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:45,960
in this idea of equity not only

561
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,200
including that in the name of our our

562
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,519
committee but also in the language that

563
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,960
we crafted in support of the

564
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:53,519
Department's efforts now when we think

565
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,079
about equality typically this is

566
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:58,079
everyone having exactly the same thing

567
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:59,558
the example you can see in this picture

568
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,759
we have three people watching a sporting

569
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:04,278
event one and each person has a single

570
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:06,839
box but one person at the end is already

571
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:09,440
very tall and with the Box they can

572
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:11,798
definitely see the show or the game but

573
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,080
they don't really need the box and the

574
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:15,759
person at the other end is a lot shorter

575
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:19,480
and even with the one box they still

576
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:21,240
can't see that's equality but Equity is

577
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,360
the redistribution of

578
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,798
resources and so in this example we see

579
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:27,399
the giving of the box from the person

580
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:29,960
who's very tall to the person who's very

581
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,798
short who now engaged with that game and

582
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,120
so I included language on Equity as a

583
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:35,798
reminder a reminder that we need to

584
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:38,359
actively be involved actively

585
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:40,158
redistribute our resources to support

586
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:42,479
underrepresented students coming into

587
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:45,120
the department and I'm very proud of

588
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,640
that during my time in Oregon State I

589
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:50,519
also had the Deep privilege to meet Dr

590
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:53,520
Brian klin who used to be who oress is

591
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:57,359
was was an alumni of of

592
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:59,278
Cornell she like me was also blind she

593
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:01,278
gave me a lot of advice and perspective

594
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:04,919
on her experience in building resources

595
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:07,119
and self- advocacy but she

596
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:09,919
also brought me into the diversity

597
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:12,759
Equity inclusion space on a much larger

598
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,440
level Brienne saw my unique experiences

599
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:16,519
as valuable and

600
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,919
important she said that people with

601
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:22,038
diverse experiences like mine need to be

602
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:24,640
in positions of power and authority and

603
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:25,879
so when the opportunity came to nominate

604
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,400
chairs for the diversity Equity

605
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:32,240
inclusion Committee of APs she nominated

606
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,519
me it was 2020 we were on Zoom I was

607
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,120
incredibly overwhelmed by this

608
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:38,839
opportunity but everyone voted for me

609
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:40,239
and I was brought in this was a

610
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:44,079
transformative

611
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,880
moment the cdii has become a home for me

612
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:47,918
I've had many mentors and people that

613
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,440
I've worked with over my time with them

614
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,240
and some people ask us why diversity why

615
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,600
is diversity important well here's the

616
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,159
answer from the website which talks

617
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,959
about how diversity is an integral part

618
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:02,400
of APs history and Mission and values as

619
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,919
a society for me I think about diversity

620
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,240
as an integral thing to think about

621
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,919
because when we're not centering

622
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:11,038
diversity it's very easy to exclude

623
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:14,038
people whether intentionally or

624
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:16,879
otherwise from the research

625
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:19,240
space and research is emboldened and

626
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,840
strengthened by the power of diverse

627
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,440
perspectives and ideas when everyone

628
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:25,119
thinks the same way we're never going to

629
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,759
think outside the

630
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:31,119
box one of the great problems of our day

631
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:34,038
is being able to address major Plant

632
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:35,719
Pathology challenges and without people

633
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:37,919
with diverse perspectives we can't do

634
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,919
that and the field doesn't move forward

635
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,000
and for me that's really why I care

636
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:46,120
about diversity in the context of of

637
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,679
APs I want to highlight some terminology

638
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:51,359
as we move forward thinking about

639
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:54,600
diversity and inclusion so diversity is

640
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:57,798
the summation of of identities right

641
00:24:54,599 --> 00:25:00,319
people's sexual orientation gender

642
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:02,599
expression race but all these other

643
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:05,599
identities as well such as citizenship

644
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:07,918
status that's diversity but

645
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,519
inclusion is where all of these

646
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,399
experiences all of these people have a

647
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:15,639
place at the table and a

648
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:18,439
voice and when we think about inclusion

649
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,960
one of the biggest biggest uh parts of

650
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,278
our work when like when I served with

651
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,558
with the diversity Equity inclusion

652
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:25,759
committee within um Oregon State's Plant

653
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:28,558
Pathology Department um and also within

654
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:30,398
EPS is we're not just trying to bring

655
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:33,918
people in we're trying to get them to

656
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:37,278
stay to want to stay and so to be

657
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:39,679
inclusive some ways that we can foster

658
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:41,240
retention are first by building trust

659
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,519
and the this is not an exhaustive list

660
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,038
by any any stretch of the imagination

661
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:47,200
these are just some examples of things

662
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:48,839
to think about so first is building

663
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,840
trust we can build trust through being

664
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:53,038
transparent about expectations and

665
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:54,720
policies in the University system we

666
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:56,558
might think about this as being really

667
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,720
transparent about our expectations as

668
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:01,558
advisers but also as advises what do we

669
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,240
plan or expect to get from the people

670
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:07,119
who who are leading us might also think

671
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,679
about this in the context of of APs so

672
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:10,759
what does the aps meeting look like what

673
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:13,960
are the expectations for people coming

674
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:16,519
into that space right and by being

675
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,159
transparent we actively build trust we

676
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:21,720
can also practice

677
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:24,159
allyship and being an ally is is not an

678
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,120
identity that you can can give yourself

679
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,440
it's an identity that you are given for

680
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:30,558
your work and practice of allies ship

681
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,120
for different communities and so when we

682
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:35,639
practice allyship this looks like um

683
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:37,839
using pronouns and chosen names so for

684
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,360
example my pronouns are they and them My

685
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:41,678
Chosen name is Theo even though my legal

686
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:43,240
name is Chelsea right and so actively

687
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,919
being supportive by using the correct

688
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,720
name and pronouns we can work to change

689
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,919
spaces when issues of accessibility or

690
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,960
safety are brought to our attention so

691
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:53,880
thinking about this in the context of

692
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,240
the University system if you have a

693
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,240
gender queer person who doesn't have

694
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,759
access to a gender neutral restroom what

695
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,919
are we ways in which you can support

696
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:03,759
access for that person and for the

697
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:06,080
community right and then listening to

698
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:08,079
people is really awesome it's great but

699
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:09,678
if you listen to people and you don't

700
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:12,398
respond you don't act on the things they

701
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,840
tell you that comes back to point one

702
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:16,239
where you're you don't actively build

703
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,558
trust so when we we also have to act

704
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,079
when we listen to people and then

705
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,359
creating a culture of honesty and

706
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:24,558
critical

707
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:28,038
self-evaluation authenticity as I said

708
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:30,639
is really important being honest is very

709
00:27:28,038 --> 00:27:33,599
important what does honesty look like in

710
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,759
this particular context it means coming

711
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:37,359
back to point one

712
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:39,319
transparency and then critical

713
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,119
self-evaluation isn't just you as an

714
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:43,000
individual person but it might be your

715
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:46,439
department it might be your college it

716
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,960
might even be your lab right lab group

717
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:53,919
thinking about um critical self-

718
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,319
evaluation so the cdii really focuses on

719
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,559
that connection between diversity and

720
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:59,398
inclusion to do this we actively provide

721
00:27:57,558 --> 00:28:02,319
training um and career developmental

722
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:05,798
resources for people within within the

723
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:07,480
um within APS we work to facilitate um

724
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:08,679
development of social contact right

725
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,319
interaction with people this is really

726
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:12,159
important especially coming out of the

727
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:13,639
the key parts of the shutdown thinking

728
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,278
about ways in which we can interact with

729
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,799
with each other um more um we act to

730
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:19,640
promote communication and interaction

731
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:21,359
among members with diverse backgrounds

732
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,799
that's a big part of that inclusion

733
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:25,359
portion um and then really inclusion

734
00:28:23,798 --> 00:28:28,599
comes down at the bottom this enabling

735
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:30,199
the integration of all underserved or

736
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:32,599
under represented groups these are kind

737
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,759
of the main the main goals of the

738
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:36,480
committee I was asked to talk about sort

739
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:38,158
of key things that came about while I

740
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,640
was working with the committee from 2020

741
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:44,039
to 2023 um the first thing um I did and

742
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,600
this happened around the same time I was

743
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:48,759
working with the Oregon State the Oregon

744
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:50,398
Oregon state folks was this inclusion of

745
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:51,480
the word Equity I realized when I was

746
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:53,839
putting this together I couldn't

747
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,960
remember the original name of the of the

748
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:57,959
cdii but I think it was the diversity

749
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,038
and quality and inclusion committee

750
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,600
but adding the word equity in there as a

751
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:05,319
call to us to remember to to um actively

752
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:07,480
redistribute resources and and promote

753
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:09,278
inclusion um I worked with our

754
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,000
accessibility subcommittee on crafting

755
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:12,599
an article and accessible presentations

756
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,038
that was for ismp PMI which I know has

757
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:16,959
been used in some of the courses here at

758
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:18,960
Cornell um and then comprehensive

759
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,200
recommendations for APS on accessible

760
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,919
meetings this is for both inperson um

761
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,519
and online meetings um and a big part of

762
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,519
this is that we update it every year and

763
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:30,519
resubmit it to leadership as

764
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:32,759
recommendations um we also work to

765
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:34,679
include pronouns and chosen names during

766
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:36,960
um annual event registration as well as

767
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,960
disclosure um an accessibility uh

768
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,278
request during registration the

769
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,640
accessibility request is a really big

770
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:44,679
one um we felt really strongly about

771
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,880
getting that through largely because

772
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:48,880
prior to this prior to open disclosure

773
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,240
people would have to email somebody to

774
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,320
ask for um support um and really what

775
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,519
this really ended up H resulting in is

776
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:57,918
that the person who was getting emailed

777
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:59,159
either lost the emails were too busy

778
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,320
um and we're trying to deal with

779
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:01,919
accessibility requests at the last

780
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:03,480
minute that often couldn't be put into

781
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,480
action so people weren't being able to

782
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,960
fully engage with our meetings we also

783
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,599
worked on developing The Hub which is an

784
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,640
APS diversities resource um website

785
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:15,639
through the aps website and this really

786
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,080
came about by work by Dr um Dr maram

787
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,600
Carter who headed the um black lives

788
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:21,918
matter task force and put together

789
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:26,119
anti-racism Resources with with her task

790
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,120
force back in um 2020 and

791
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,359
2021

792
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,159
what does some of these what does some

793
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:33,479
of this work look like so annually we

794
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:36,799
have an lgbtqi networking event at um

795
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,519
plant Health we also work to hold um

796
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:41,158
hold workshops such as our mentorship

797
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:42,798
Workshop in 2022 and then we work to

798
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:46,200
have panels both during the annual

799
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:48,839
meetings um and online throughout the

800
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,880
year um I'll note that these last two we

801
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:53,798
we put together um the beyond the land

802
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,840
acknowledgement any invis um envisioning

803
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:57,759
accessible science we put together but

804
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:59,959
due to Exterminating circumstances

805
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:01,319
really weren't able to come to fruition

806
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,200
but really we're we're incredibly

807
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:04,839
dedicated to this work and so even when

808
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,759
thing we're not able to host the events

809
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:10,759
we plan um moving forward and continuing

810
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:13,599
that work is is very

811
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:16,119
important thinking about why someone

812
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,918
might want to take on leadership uh

813
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:21,479
whether that's with the CDI or in the

814
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,960
context of of any other APS committee um

815
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,000
I was asked to talk a bit a bit about

816
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,240
sort of the outcomes or the benefits and

817
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,720
these are the three that I found I

818
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,519
really thought about I thought about

819
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:33,000
resume building right these are things

820
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:35,319
you can add to your CV you can also um

821
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,278
build leadership experience oftentimes

822
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:39,000
especially as grad students we don't get

823
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:40,440
the opportunity to practice leadership

824
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,200
in this sort of capacity and so this

825
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,200
gives you a really large platform for

826
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,960
doing that and then building your

827
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,360
mentorship network um these are some

828
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,759
people that I met out of this committee

829
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:54,439
work who serve as both professional and

830
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:56,519
academic and career mentors to me and I

831
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,320
am incredibly um I I think this is an

832
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:00,240
incredible as asset from my work with

833
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:02,519
the

834
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,798
committee um some other ways in which

835
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:07,638
you can be in service can also look like

836
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:10,158
um being authentic and showing up on

837
00:32:07,638 --> 00:32:13,240
social media for me um this has looked

838
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,840
like my work um my my specifically my ex

839
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,880
or Twitter page which I focus on

840
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:20,839
highlighting my identities including a

841
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,000
rainbow flag that I'm disabled and queer

842
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:24,519
um as ways to show to other people who

843
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,839
might see this profile who might also

844
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:26,839
share this identities and might be

845
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:29,079
thinking about whether or not they want

846
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:30,839
to stay in Plant Pathology or stay in

847
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:32,960
the sciences and where they want to go

848
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:34,158
that there's space for them um that they

849
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,480
can take up space and that they're

850
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:39,159
wanted wanted here in our

851
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,360
field also being visible um in your

852
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:42,278
discipline so I think in more of a

853
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:45,158
professional context for me I use

854
00:32:42,278 --> 00:32:47,159
LinkedIn pretty heavily um and I share a

855
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:49,960
lot of the um more professional side of

856
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:52,639
the work that I do um or I'm involved in

857
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,319
so for example involvement um recently

858
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:57,678
with The Graduate women in stem here in

859
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:59,079
their Empower conference um and really

860
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,880
highlighting more the professional side

861
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:03,119
of my identity in this space but also

862
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,840
thinking about taking opportunities to

863
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:06,278
share a lived experiences so like like

864
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:08,158
today with meet we coming in and talking

865
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:09,798
to you today even though we're over Zoom

866
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,360
right we recognizing this is a very

867
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:14,038
vulnerable

868
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:15,558
thing right but these are also great

869
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:16,919
opportunities to show people that

870
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:18,839
they're welcome in these spaces some

871
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:21,639
other examples I have a mini profile for

872
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:23,079
example with women in in science and as

873
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:25,079
Izzy mentioned earlier yes I was

874
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:27,558
interviewed for for nature careers

875
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:28,839
talking about sizeism um the scientific

876
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:30,879
workplace so these are great

877
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:32,079
opportunities for building visibility

878
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,679
and then the last one I want to touch on

879
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:35,119
very briefly is this breaking bonds of

880
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,080
shared trauma in your

881
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:41,479
profession um ways in which I do this is

882
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:43,158
promoting very actively um and

883
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,399
prioritizing mental health with the

884
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:47,000
undergrads I work with um when they're

885
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:48,119
having bad mental health days I really

886
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
don't want them in the lab I want them

887
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:52,839
to focus on themselves and that is a a

888
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,839
strong line that we we build together um

889
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:57,158
and I I urge you regardless of where you

890
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:59,480
are in your career where you are in the

891
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:02,240
context of of your field to think about

892
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,360
ways in which you break or build or

893
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,880
reinforce those bonds of trauma in in

894
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:08,319
your profession because this can be a

895
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,760
critical critical part of how we retain

896
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:14,480
people in our field going forward I've

897
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,480
actually uh taken a step back from my

898
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,918
work in social justice what happens when

899
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,159
you spend a lot of time talking uh you

900
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:23,440
don't actually get to spend a lot of

901
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:26,480
time listening and things are always

902
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,639
changing I think about the lgbtq queer

903
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,159
and trans space that I take up the

904
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,960
current situation

905
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:35,280
politically with what it looks like to

906
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,599
be Trans in the United States and the

907
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,639
fear that builds from

908
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,240
that and so part of this is really

909
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:44,159
stepping back and listing so that I can

910
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:48,078
go forward and do better work in the

911
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:51,720
future I'm also focusing on exploring my

912
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:54,000
needs um and exploring New

913
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:56,878
Opportunities so what this looks like is

914
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,719
I back in 2021 um I joined the

915
00:34:56,878 --> 00:34:59,239
Department of Plant Pathology

916
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:02,000
environmental microbiology here at Penn

917
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:04,719
State with Gretchen CAU and Sher crle um

918
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,800
I've taken more of a agroecological

919
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:09,679
research um opportunity with them um I'm

920
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,720
focusing more on family here we can see

921
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:13,799
a picture of of my partner Michael and I

922
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:16,279
but really this also includes focusing

923
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,280
on my mother who is who is aging and

924
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,440
dealing with health issues and really

925
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,960
thinking about what it looks like for me

926
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,838
to be involved in her life while also

927
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,440
doing grad school um I also um pursued

928
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:28,679
the far fellows program um as a major

929
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:31,519
point in in focusing Less on academic

930
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:33,879
career paths and more on industry I've

931
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:35,480
got involved with alternative um

932
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,838
leadership opportunities on campus such

933
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,079
as our graduate professional Student

934
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:40,279
Association got involved in other

935
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:42,519
professional societies such as the

936
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,160
ecological Society of America and have

937
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:46,519
continued my union work with the

938
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:49,039
Coalition of graduate employees here at

939
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,039
um Penn

940
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,480
State I wanted to very very briefly and

941
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,119
we can I can talk with the grad students

942
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,559
about this later mention the farf

943
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,640
program if you haven't heard about it

944
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,239
before it's through the foundation for

945
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:02,960
food and agriculture it's just one of

946
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:05,000
their many branches of the work that

947
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,400
they do but it really focuses on

948
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,880
professional development and career

949
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,318
guidance for this next generation of

950
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,240
agricultural and food scientists um and

951
00:36:11,318 --> 00:36:14,440
really what it does is it provides stien

952
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:16,199
um as well as professional development

953
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,679
funding and training um and formal

954
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:19,799
mentorship support to graduate students

955
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:22,279
specifically graduate students are

956
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:25,039
really interested in nonacademic track

957
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:28,040
um career paths and we can talk more

958
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:29,318
about that later if you're interested

959
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:31,679
I wanted to bring it back to those

960
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:31,679
initial

961
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:36,880
outcomes just to remind us that

962
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,559
mentorship is a critical element of our

963
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,160
success it's a critical element of My

964
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:44,199
Success I owe most of what I have to to

965
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,920
the mentors who have opened open roads

966
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:47,519
for

967
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,599
me the mentorship does not have to be

968
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,480
complicated right Walt just showed up as

969
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,800
himself Walt trusted me and that was

970
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,199
enough to give me strength and personal

971
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,800
and personal

972
00:36:55,199 --> 00:37:01,279
power and that prioritizing service in

973
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:03,760
community is an enriching part of our

974
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,240
careers whether it's graduate school or

975
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,079
professionally you I personally believe

976
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:11,439
that science is such an important

977
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:13,800
valuable thing to us as as fundamentally

978
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,760
to human beings that I want to bring

979
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,318
people in and keep them there and I

980
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,520
think that that's a big part of the work

981
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:22,039
that we we all should be doing in some

982
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:24,838
way in our career and then the power of

983
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:26,318
of authenticity showing up as yourself

984
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:28,199
shows other people that they can show up

985
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:33,239
at themselves and that's a critical

986
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:36,759
element element to to who we are as

987
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:38,598
people I wanted to thank the people who

988
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,440
fund me in my my graduate research I

989
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:42,440
want to thank the labs that supported me

990
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,280
provided uh feedback on on my

991
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,599
presentation and getting me to where I

992
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:50,119
am today and to remember and appreciate

993
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:51,920
the mentors who supported me in in my in

994
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:54,318
my

995
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,920
path um I'm more than happy to take

996
00:37:54,318 --> 00:37:57,599
questions and I would love to connect

997
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,079
with you I tried to separate these QR

998
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,480
codes out as much as I possibly could uh

999
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,640
so that if you wanted to scan them you

1000
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,800
can also my name if you just Google me

1001
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:08,759
typically shows up um shows up on on

1002
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,880
Google pretty pretty readily but I'm

1003
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:14,280
happy to take any questions you have

1004
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,838
now thanks so much Theo for that I

1005
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:19,519
really appreciate it um what questions

1006
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:19,519
do we have from the

1007
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:27,239
room oh yes sorry please go ahead should

1008
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:29,119
I or um I think if you yeah just talk

1009
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:32,318
real loud

1010
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:35,039
probably thank you so much Theo your

1011
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:38,838
presentation it resonated with me in a

1012
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:40,920
lot of different ways um I wanted to ask

1013
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:43,358
I mean I know it's like it's really

1014
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,760
important to focus on positive

1015
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:47,639
relationships and positive mentorships

1016
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,680
um yeah

1017
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:52,598
is could you talk a little bit about if

1018
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:54,879
there have been any barriers to

1019
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:59,599
understanding in your lived experience

1020
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:02,358
and like how you managed to overcome it

1021
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,838
um because I think like

1022
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:06,719
for I I don't know my lived experience

1023
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:09,519
like I have some invisible disabilities

1024
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:12,679
so like there's uh a lot of difficulty

1025
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:14,759
there with like um allowing people to

1026
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:18,078
like fully understand how things impact

1027
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:20,119
me and I'm wondering if you have any um

1028
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,400
any similar sort of experiences and how

1029
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:25,200
you went through that I think one of for

1030
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,280
me a big part is and I think I mentioned

1031
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:29,799
this early on the mar family didn't have

1032
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:32,119
a resources um part of that was that I

1033
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,039
essentially didn't know I was disabled

1034
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:36,599
until I was in

1035
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:38,400
college I didn't realize that I had

1036
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:40,200
struggled academically because I didn't

1037
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,720
have the things I needed right to

1038
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:44,358
succeed and I think often especially for

1039
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:46,639
like A5 folks who may get diagnosed with

1040
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:49,400
with other invis with with invisible

1041
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:51,199
disabilities later on uh that that could

1042
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,119
be a big part of it as well thinking

1043
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:57,559
about the resources we didn't have

1044
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:59,358
um going forward it's really been about

1045
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:01,039
discovering the resources that I need

1046
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:02,078
and making it very clear that those are

1047
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:04,800
what I

1048
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:07,880
need that doesn't mean I always get them

1049
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,760
right so like I may need support I may

1050
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,680
need like a support person to drive and

1051
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,079
there's obviously may not be funding to

1052
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:15,598
bring in a supp person to drive me

1053
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,318
around so it turns to you know who in

1054
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,880
the lab has time does my husband have

1055
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:20,679
time who can I find have time how can I

1056
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,680
shift my research project around right

1057
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:24,759
to meet the availability of people to

1058
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:27,279
drive me to go do sampling it might also

1059
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:30,240
look like me doing uh like what we I

1060
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,599
would say situational sampling right

1061
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:33,838
where it's close by readily available I

1062
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:35,079
don't have to do a lot of driving or

1063
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:38,199
going to a bunch of different um

1064
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:41,720
research sites largely because of of my

1065
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:43,759
disability um I think also it's hard to

1066
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:45,879
explain to people so when I say I'm

1067
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:49,359
blind right we know that blindness is a

1068
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:53,519
spectrum and so I am able to see and

1069
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:55,880
read a lot of things but can't always

1070
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:57,358
and so it's it ends up being about Nu on

1071
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,400
and how to communicate that Nuance

1072
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:01,318
nuance and often I can't and I end up

1073
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,680
just kind of giving up and walking away

1074
00:41:01,318 --> 00:41:05,318
because it feels weird to continuously

1075
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:08,879
have to like

1076
00:41:05,318 --> 00:41:10,119
validate my experience so that's sorry

1077
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,559
I'm I'm rambling at this point but

1078
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:13,559
that's that's what I can share on

1079
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:20,680
that I I agree thank

1080
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:23,480
you great talk thank

1081
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:24,919

room uh yes please oh I was going to say

1084
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:34,280
um I was curious if you could elaborate

1085
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:37,560
a little bit more on your like thought

1086
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:41,040
of recommendations as a Dei advocate for

1087
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:43,679
ways that inclusion be incre um I know

1088
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:43,679

about I'm sorry can can you repeat the

1090
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,960
question Izzy I think I only heard the

1091
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,440
first first like quarter of

1092
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:57,440
it sorry do you want to try talk Lou or

1094
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,079
elaborate expectations

1095
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,079
for

1096
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:07,679
disability around specifically

1097
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:07,679
disability

1098
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,719
inclusion is that is that the question

1099
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:14,400
sorry like I said it's hard for me to

1100
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:18,358
hear do you have for increasing

1101
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,119
inclusion um in Academia sorry like like

1102
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:20,920
like

1103
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,119
categorically uh sure like the one

1104
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:26,838
example that you gave of um including

1105
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:29,160
you know on in registrations like uh

1106
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:31,759
you know do you have do you have any

1107
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:33,719
like requests um you know for things

1108
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:37,599
that you need and how that was a a

1109
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:38,799
really um you know that was something

1110
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,400
you know it's kind of a game changer

1111
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,640
that's really uh any other

1112
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,079
recommendations like that I mean one of

1113
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:47,318
my biggest recommendations is actually

1114
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,880
at like a university level that um

1115
00:42:47,318 --> 00:42:50,759
specifically around I mean you were

1116
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,960
talking about like accessibility

1117
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,880
oftentimes we have offices right whether

1118
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,519
that's a diversity inclusion office

1119
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,240
whether that's a Ada office right that

1120
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:01,960
are most of the work that they do is

1121
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:03,639
geared towards undergraduate students

1122
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:06,559
and the work that they don't typically

1123
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:09,000
do is around graduate students or

1124
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:12,559
postdocs who may not fall under the the

1125
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,519
normal like HR Support and so I think

1126
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:18,559
first off is education in those spaces

1127
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:20,199
around Pro around what what's needed so

1128
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:24,920
like what are the resources that are

1129
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:26,199
needed um and then thinking about where

1130
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,159
the funding and support from the

1131
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:30,199
University what advocacy departments can

1132
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:32,039
do around making sure that money is

1133
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:33,960
allocated to those

1134
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:35,800
resources

1135
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,440
um was that kind of what you were

1136
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:40,599
thinking I'm like like I said I'm having

1137
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:43,960
a really hard time hearing hearing H the

1138
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:46,640
question yeah that's great thank you

1139
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:49,599
okay uh other questions from the

1140
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:52,279
room okay um it looks like and great

1141
