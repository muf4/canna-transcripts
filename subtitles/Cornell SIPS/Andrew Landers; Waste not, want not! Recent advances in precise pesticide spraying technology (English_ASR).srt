1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,339
University

3
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:12,628
so waste not want not

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,699
which is a great saying of course and as

5
00:00:12,628 --> 00:00:16,859
you appreciate with many spraying

6
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:18,210
applications there's quite a lot of

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,778
waste as I'll show you

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,390
and so I've was particularly asked to

9
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:26,339
talk about recent advances in technology

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,640
particularly then towards precision

11
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:31,679
farming as you realize there's the great

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,439
movement in the world towards the

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,558
precise application of all inputs into

14
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:40,018
farming and certain cases the outputs

15
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:43,469
and so I'd like to share with you the

16
00:00:40,018 --> 00:00:45,390
work that we've done here at Cornell I'd

17
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:49,018
like to acknowledge the help of the of

18
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:52,228
my three most recent postdocs Jordi

19
00:00:49,018 --> 00:00:55,198
Lorentz and Tomas pelea are both from

20
00:00:52,228 --> 00:01:00,000
Spain and have now gone back and have

21
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:02,820
good jobs in Spain and Cheung Yuen with

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,079
was from China is now currently working

23
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,150
here in the US at another university my

24
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,849
group at Cornell are charged with

25
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,570
looking at pesticide application

26
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:18,780
technology as a way of improving

27
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:21,449
spraying via engineering methods we do

28
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,090
this in three distinct areas tests new

29
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,770
sprayers new spraying ideas develop

30
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,980
methods for our growers

31
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:32,549
I've worked particularly with fruits and

32
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:34,980
vegetable growers the fruit growers in

33
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,620
particular as you'll see use a machine

34
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:40,890
that blow spray all over the place so we

35
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:43,320
have a lot of waste hence the title of

36
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,960
this talk and so we develop ways of

37
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:48,449
improving deposition and reducing drift

38
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:50,699
and finally because I have a 60%

39
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,820
extension position we do a lot of

40
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,670
extension demonstrations both here in

41
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:58,379
the US and around the world I've just

42
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,329
come back from Australia and Europe

43
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:02,579
where I've been speaking the grape

44
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:05,158
growers and I leave again on Monday to

45
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:08,219
talk to a Vacarro growers in Mexico and

46
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,229
as I've never yet seen an avocado tree I

47
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:12,719
think Monday is gonna be a very steep

48
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,700
learning curve and the two days of

49
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,979
touring around see the trees but a

50
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:19,500
spread to many people a sprayer is a

51
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:20,000
sprayer as a sprayer that as you'll see

52
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,090
is not

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,460
true but in all cases no matter which

54
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:28,539
audience I'm speaking to our challenge

55
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:32,120
is to produce quality food and drink for

56
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:34,669
the consumer off of a livestock that

57
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,849
we're about to feed in the case of a

58
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:42,079
consumer then disease disease and insect

59
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:45,049
free and blemish free of course the

60
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,320
challenge to the farmer or grower is to

61
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:50,450
improve the spray deposition throughout

62
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,609
the canopy and when I work with fruit

63
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:55,219
crops you will appreciate for example in

64
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:58,310
citrus that's quite a challenge when you

65
00:02:55,219 --> 00:03:00,319
look at citrus trees primarily in New

66
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,599
York State of course it's apples and

67
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,840
grapes apple apple trees and grapevines

68
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:08,269
and it still remains a challenge to

69
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,090
improve deposition throughout the canopy

70
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:13,730
and a lot of our work has been done on

71
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:16,550
that nurse I'll show you and reducing

72
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:18,169
drift is the other big issue society

73
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,600
doesn't care for drift

74
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:23,750
we don't want drift in our waterways our

75
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:25,699
water supply and of course where we have

76
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:29,449
all these wineries here in the Finger

77
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:31,369
Lakes on Long Island etc it's this type

78
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:34,488
of thing which affects the public

79
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:36,769
profile of agriculture in the world and

80
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:38,870
the public's perception of what we're

81
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:41,360
doing and this this photo is from the

82
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:43,430
Hudson Valley from a vineyard and you

83
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,549
can see this tractor it should be green

84
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,950
this one here is from a place fairly

85
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:51,650
close to here and again that should be

86
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:53,359
green people who pay by John Deere pay a

87
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,510
lot of money for that green paint and

88
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:00,890
the cover it here in died Thane and here

89
00:03:56,509 --> 00:04:02,870
in surround is a very poor image to give

90
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:06,738
to the buying customer coming to your

91
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:09,469
winery or your fruit stand so I'd like

92
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:11,989
to split my talking to two main areas

93
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:14,719
one is the work that we've done up at

94
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:16,910
Geneva and the second is examples of

95
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:21,019
boom sprayer work that other people have

96
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:22,850
done spraying is simple everybody will

97
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:25,519
tell you that you just get a sprayer out

98
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:28,550
the barn full of water and product your

99
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:31,459
pesticide put it in and off you go well

100
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,889
I've made a 40-year career trying to

101
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:36,709
complicate what is a simple process

102
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:40,490
and as you'll see we've developed it

103
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:42,829
into the volumes of air and liquids so

104
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,530
their tooth in fruit spring there are

105
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:49,038
two distinct categories two fluids air

106
00:04:45,529 --> 00:04:51,589
and liquid and so in the last seven or

107
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:54,378
eight years we've concentrated with the

108
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:57,799
three postdocs I mentioned on trying to

109
00:04:54,379 --> 00:05:00,439
measure the airflow monitor the airflow

110
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,810
in one way or another and then adjust

111
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:05,990
the airflow equally changing the amount

112
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:08,839
of liquid that's being applied this is

113
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:12,038
the classic spray account this work was

114
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:16,310
created by Santiago planners over in

115
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:18,528
Catalonia in near Barcelona in the

116
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,870
townland layer they layer the University

117
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:23,149
and has stood the test of time you see

118
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,788
it's very old piece of work hasn't

119
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:28,158
changed in New York in particular well

120
00:05:25,788 --> 00:05:32,060
the whole of the US we use sprayers like

121
00:05:28,158 --> 00:05:34,550
this to spray trees apple trees and

122
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:37,459
grapevines probably in the world

123
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:40,129
probably 95% sprayers still like this

124
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:43,459
the fruits and you can clearly see or

125
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:47,870
whatever application rate you can read

126
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:49,939
as well as I can so I tend not to you

127
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,949
can see on the slide but you can clearly

128
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:56,538
see that at the very low application

129
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:58,939
rates 10 gallons per acre then you use a

130
00:05:56,538 --> 00:06:01,579
very very fine nozzle which leads to a

131
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:05,658
lot of drift and so when we're looking

132
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:09,918
at the red symbols only 54% is going in

133
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:12,110
the canopy 45% is drifting away and if

134
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,240
ever you go around the vineyard or the

135
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,250
orchard in the spring you will see this

136
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,740
when there's very little leaf to

137
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:22,129
intercept the spray but a little canopy

138
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:26,778
there's a tremendous man adrift and at

139
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:28,689
best and say this work has stood lots

140
00:06:26,778 --> 00:06:31,848
and lots of other people have tried a

141
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:34,430
repeated the Santiago plan a cease work

142
00:06:31,848 --> 00:06:37,218
and this stood the test of time at best

143
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:41,028
we were only getting 75% in the canopy

144
00:06:37,218 --> 00:06:42,829
this any one is appalling it's a waste

145
00:06:41,028 --> 00:06:45,110
of product it's bad for the environment

146
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:48,229
from the farmers point of view is

147
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:50,780
economic you know economically

148
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:53,360
just crass the ability to be wasting so

149
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:55,969
much money and so it begs the question

150
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,220
is this the best we can do is this

151
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:00,560
precision spraying the other thing

152
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:03,020
that's happened orchards if you love

153
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:07,730
familiar with the modern system we have

154
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:09,949
more trees per acre we're looking made

155
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:12,950
anywhere between seven hundred and two

156
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:17,659
and a half thousand trees per acre huge

157
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:21,649
hedge hedge like structures very close

158
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:24,620
together ten eleven feet apart between

159
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:29,029
the rows and the trees now are very well

160
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:31,189
manicured just like vineyard compared to

161
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:33,529
the photo on the right which as you can

162
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:37,430
see is the traditional orchard and the

163
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:41,809
growers still use the same air sprayers

164
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:43,790
based on 1960s technology and so as I'm

165
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,670
one of the only people working in this

166
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:49,010
area in the US then there's quite a good

167
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:51,590
challenge and of course a very good

168
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:54,589
access to research dollars as you will

169
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:58,009
see so I have very little competition in

170
00:07:54,589 --> 00:08:02,959
this field here so our dream has been

171
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:06,170
for the last decade to create a fully

172
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:09,199
automatic sprayer and that's the the

173
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:11,629
basis to my my talk we first of all look

174
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,120
at our target whatever that might be

175
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:16,279
is it the leaf is it the disease is it

176
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,610
the fruit it's an insect whatever it is

177
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:22,099
in relation to the growing canopy like

178
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:25,280
all plants early season versus late

179
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:27,230
season full canopy we do this with an

180
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:30,079
array of sensors which I'll show you

181
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:32,120
we've tried different types we put it

182
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,909
through a processing machine and then we

183
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:38,330
adjust the two fluids the liquid flow

184
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:41,029
and the air flow because in fruits

185
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:44,360
canopies we need year to help penetrate

186
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:46,639
these dense canopies so the controller

187
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,769
is the smart box in the middle obviously

188
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:52,129
and that's what my postdocs have been

189
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:54,799
extremely good at creating the software

190
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:57,110
and as I say the sensors recognize the

191
00:08:54,799 --> 00:09:00,439
canopy and then we make adjustments on

192
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:01,649
the move GPS then everyone knows about

193
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,980
GPS you have on your

194
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:06,899
on car roadmaps stuff like that these

195
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,509
days so I won't dwell on that but it

196
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:12,629
does give us our location so this is old

197
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:15,600
hat as you know GPS and it gives us

198
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:19,079
exactly where we are what we've done the

199
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,360
Geneva we fitted an array of sensors on

200
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:24,149
a sprayer this is a vineyard or who

201
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,818
variety of in yeol French hybrid and you

202
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:30,299
can see as the tractor goes through the

203
00:09:26,818 --> 00:09:33,299
row then the senses of sending out a

204
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:35,729
sound wave so we're using ultrasound of

205
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:38,399
the Sonics to send out a sound wave

206
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:40,800
notice the envelope is the white

207
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:44,698
envelope is wider than the row of grapes

208
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:47,248
we also do the same in Orchard's here's

209
00:09:44,698 --> 00:09:49,889
the modern orchard system very narrow

210
00:09:47,249 --> 00:09:52,829
canopy and manicured canopy just like

211
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:56,428
the grapes and a wider envelope than the

212
00:09:52,828 --> 00:09:59,159
actual canopy width okay

213
00:09:56,428 --> 00:10:03,419
so we're using sound as you know as you

214
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:06,240
know sound can be generated by using a

215
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:07,049
magnet in a coral so we can allow

216
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,149
speaker

217
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:12,719
it's example we're all familiar with and

218
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:15,659
we hear this sound a sound wave we can

219
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,360
record sound by sending it back to a

220
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:21,088
pickup to a microphone as you can see

221
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,730
all the effect the loudspeaker and as

222
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:27,600
the magnet moves back it now sends us a

223
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:30,659
signal here is the trace from a typical

224
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,308
sound wave over time so we have a signal

225
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:38,610
in voltage and the time frame in seconds

226
00:10:34,308 --> 00:10:40,828
we're using ultrasonics ultrasound then

227
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:43,769
is that a higher frequency can you see

228
00:10:40,828 --> 00:10:48,628
two megahertz between 20 kilohertz and 2

229
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:51,928
Meg is the Sound area or area of the

230
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:55,740
sound wave that we're picking up okay it

231
00:10:51,928 --> 00:11:01,318
works simply by sending out a sound wave

232
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:04,318
and then it receives the echo and the

233
00:11:01,318 --> 00:11:07,708
highest voltage signal we receive is our

234
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:10,078
peak so when we set up our equipment we

235
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:12,328
set it against a wall this is a solid

236
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:15,058
you know for density of canopy as our

237
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:15,359
interest then the wall is a solid so

238
00:11:15,058 --> 00:11:18,870
that's

239
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,659
100% dense as you appreciate and so our

240
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:24,480
Soundwave gives us this voltage in our

241
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:27,088
machine and then anything less than that

242
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,778
it would loves to be a less dense or a

243
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:33,899
sparser canopy this is the system we use

244
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:36,120
you'll see in a moment here it is as the

245
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:39,269
tractor goes down the rows I showed you

246
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:42,000
in the video we're measuring the sound

247
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:44,100
waves coming back depending where it is

248
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,129
within the canopy we're getting

249
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:50,220
different peaks according to the density

250
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:52,409
of the canopy and so when we total that

251
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,870
the peaks together we get a little

252
00:11:52,409 --> 00:12:01,949
certain value that value is represented

253
00:11:54,870 --> 00:12:04,230
in volts okay in 2014 we have a look at

254
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:06,810
this and thought this well earlier than

255
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:10,100
that we started to work within the first

256
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:14,309
published results were based on the 2014

257
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:18,470
season and you can see here we have the

258
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:24,838
date 21st of May right through till the

259
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:27,589
19th of August notice then every week we

260
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,899
go to the orchard or the vineyard and

261
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:34,019
measure the canopy and we were looking

262
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:36,809
for what we estimated as density and we

263
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:39,209
call the IDI estimated density in those

264
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:42,088
days we would look at both sides of the

265
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:44,369
canopy left and right or east and west

266
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:47,640
and then the dotted line is the average

267
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:50,549
and so the first thing we notice then as

268
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,679
the density change as the canopy got

269
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:54,778
heavier into the season progressed

270
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:58,139
therefore we were getting a different

271
00:12:54,778 --> 00:13:00,809
signal voltage again so this was really

272
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:03,750
really good but like all good research

273
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:06,599
at the end of July due to the vagaries

274
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:09,179
of the New York weather we got a

275
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:12,028
hailstorm came through a severe

276
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:14,399
hailstorm and that was here and it only

277
00:13:12,028 --> 00:13:16,980
came to the Experiment Station but

278
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,669
Geneva didn't hit any of our neighboring

279
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,879
farms and it decimated everybody's feel

280
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:26,370
class all my colleagues with Apple

281
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:29,039
everybody all the grapes have just hit

282
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:32,190
by hit big hailstones and all the fruit

283
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:34,139
went with parish as parish did just went

284
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,040
no good so that's the date of the

285
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:38,490
hailstorm

286
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:41,069
yeah end of July we then went to the

287
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:43,889
field back ten days later we were also

288
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:46,740
devastated by this and we noticed that

289
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:49,230
our signal was lower because all the

290
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:52,709
leaves were shredded so our density had

291
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:55,769
changed and so there you you can see it

292
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:58,169
in the orchard in the vineyard they then

293
00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:01,259
wanted to save what little fruit was

294
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:03,870
left and so they net the canopy net the

295
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:06,240
vines which is in the shaded area and

296
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:08,850
because they then gather the vine leaves

297
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,190
together our density signal went back up

298
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:14,459
so we thought this is jolly interesting

299
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:16,980
but we hadn't compared it with real

300
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:19,229
density measurements that our colleagues

301
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,959
in horticulture use so we asked

302
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:24,300
colleagues like Alan Lac so how do you

303
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:27,149
actually measure density as a as a

304
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:31,859
horticulturalist and they use a system

305
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:35,159
called p QA and p QA involves thrusting

306
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:38,940
a pole into the canopy and you can't

307
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:41,100
everytime the pole or stick bamboo cane

308
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:44,670
in this case every time the bamboo cane

309
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:48,089
touches a leaf or touches the fruit and

310
00:14:44,669 --> 00:14:50,458
you get a number and as engineers we

311
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:55,170
wanted to repeat this performance so we

312
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:58,159
created a small frame every week one of

313
00:14:55,169 --> 00:15:01,379
our Cornell Summer Scholars went out

314
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:06,028
throughout the whole of the growing

315
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:08,818
season and put in the stick with the pqa

316
00:15:06,028 --> 00:15:11,578
here it and would count the number of

317
00:15:08,818 --> 00:15:14,370
leaves this you know it's a very simple

318
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:15,750
system and was developed by a man called

319
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:18,720
Richard smart who was a grad student

320
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:21,419
here and has gone on to become very

321
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,850
famous viticulturist anyway it's an

322
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:26,188
acceptable practice it was acceptable

323
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:29,159
enough to get it published so pretty

324
00:15:26,188 --> 00:15:32,818
good so we're quite happy and so you can

325
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:36,990
see as the season went by as the leaves

326
00:15:32,818 --> 00:15:39,899
filled our pqa went up equally

327
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:41,430
look at our signal in voltage from our

328
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:45,629
sensors so this

329
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:47,699
great grapevine Cabernet Franc from

330
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:50,850
you're familiar with it and so you can

331
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:53,250
see that when we lay the one against the

332
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:56,909
other pqa against voltage what a

333
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:59,100
wonderful graph what a wonderful end to

334
00:15:56,909 --> 00:16:01,620
a great career you might say that we've

335
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,930
finally got something as good as that

336
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,820
and we did the same with apple trees and

337
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:08,069
we've done with a number of different

338
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,350
varieties of grapes and the number of

339
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:12,930
varieties of apples because this project

340
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:15,240
in particular was funded by apple and

341
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:17,338
grape industry what can we do though

342
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,310
from a spraying point of view we now

343
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:22,110
know there's a signal a voltage from the

344
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:25,349
sensors from the ultrasound sensor

345
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:27,330
giving us a number how do we then relate

346
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,970
that to the spray how do we make

347
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:32,580
real-time changes as we're driving along

348
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:36,080
so remember there are two fluids the

349
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:38,610
liquid and the air in both cases we have

350
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,430
demonstrations to show you how we can

351
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:44,159
change liquid using a little of aerial

352
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:47,309
select nozzle or a capstan nozzle and

353
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:49,799
the air flow by a system we've patented

354
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:53,039
here at Cornell to adjust them the air

355
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:55,439
flow or using Australian's fan system

356
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:59,189
called Saudi fans so we'll start off

357
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:01,950
with liquid the first system we looked

358
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:05,400
into was the use of pulse width

359
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:07,380
technology pwt those of you who are

360
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,699
familiar with a bubble jet ink printer

361
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:14,790
which I know many students aren't old

362
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:17,100
hat really bubble jetting printers but

363
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:19,678
the idea was to have a small valve which

364
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:23,698
went up and down rapidly and would fire

365
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:27,900
dots of ink at your paper and create the

366
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:30,509
letter or the font whatever the same

367
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:33,380
principle was developed into a spray

368
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:36,089
nozzle by other researchers and

369
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:39,000
depending it's it's simply a little

370
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:43,079
valve really like a solenoid valve so

371
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,660
you apply current to the valve and the

372
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:48,149
valve will get lifted and so in this

373
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,070
case the valve is up here when the valve

374
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,710
is lifted the liquid can flow out

375
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,879
through the nozzle if you have a long

376
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,360
current

377
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,610
you get a longer lift and therefore more

378
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:01,859
spray goes out if you only open the

379
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:03,959
valve for a short time you get a very

380
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:06,899
small amount going out and as I'll show

381
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,870
you in the next video this gives us a

382
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:13,400
pulsing effect to the spray nozzle and

383
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:16,500
so some of you will remember years ago

384
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,840
there was a specialty crop research

385
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,970
initiative it still goes on and the

386
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:24,629
federal government gave boatloads of

387
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:27,089
money to some of us and we teamed up

388
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:29,880
with Carnegie Mellon that the robotics

389
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:32,399
Institute University of Florida because

390
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,950
we were working with citrus and at the

391
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,310
Cornell we developed the sprayer part to

392
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:41,220
go along with this device and so let's

393
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:45,000
have a look at that and this was to

394
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:48,059
develop an autonomous fully autonomous

395
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,750
tractor and sprayer and there it is is a

396
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:53,730
classic air blast sprayer and you'll be

397
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:57,000
able to see the tractor will move

398
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:59,789
through the orange grove completely

399
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,700
without anyone driving it it's fully

400
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:05,430
autonomous and it will change the amount

401
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:08,340
of spray according to the size of the

402
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:11,279
citrus tree see no one's driving it in

403
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:13,259
in Florida they have a thing called

404
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:15,569
greening disease that's spread by a

405
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:18,599
psyllid which is little insect spreads

406
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:20,460
it's devastating their industry and so

407
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:23,219
they were particularly interested in

408
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,230
this because they have replant trees a

409
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,410
little tree that maybe three feet tall

410
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:31,319
very sparse and then a very very dense

411
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:35,490
machine so that we're monitoring the

412
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:38,669
canopy we're monitoring the canopy and

413
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:41,460
then creating a map of the different

414
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:44,460
sized trees the algorithm then changes

415
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:48,660
the signal that goes to the pulse-width

416
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:51,360
nozzles can you see them pulsing all the

417
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:53,610
time and then see here a small trees

418
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:56,309
you'll see every now and then tiny trees

419
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:58,979
and then these very dense orange trees

420
00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:01,019
if there's a gap it switches off there's

421
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,299
some little fries they might only want a

422
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:06,730
teaspoon full of spray and a small

423
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:09,460
amount of air whereas this will 1/3 buck

424
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:12,880
Falls a spray and a lot of a to blast

425
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:16,140
the spray okay and so there it is we had

426
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,870
this huge gone nearly 5 million dollars

427
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:22,540
so everyone was quite happy so we did

428
00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:27,399
that the problem is it's too

429
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:29,109
sophisticated for most growers you know

430
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,809
it's very nice system it's you know a

431
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:35,019
lot of brainpower into it but it's too

432
00:20:31,808 --> 00:20:38,079
risky so in New York not that our

433
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:41,230
growers are not sophisticated anything

434
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:43,928
but but we wanted to develop a simpler

435
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:47,230
system so here's a sprayer that was

436
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:50,230
given to us by a company here's the the

437
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:53,289
tall mast with the ultrasonic sensors on

438
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:56,589
it this is the worst photo you've seen

439
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:57,909
ignore all these wires now that I draw

440
00:20:56,589 --> 00:21:01,689
an attention to them you look at them

441
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:05,590
whether they should and so here it is

442
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:07,990
it's a tower sprayer and attached to the

443
00:21:05,589 --> 00:21:10,089
system is an air compressor and electric

444
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:13,509
valves and what we're going to do is use

445
00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:16,240
air to open or close these valves let's

446
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:18,819
have a look at this here we are what

447
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,548
we've chosen is a Leffler which is a

448
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:23,500
german nozzle assembly the Leffler

449
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:26,039
varial select so instead of having a

450
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,690
little pulse with nozzles pulsing

451
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:31,480
wearing themselves out this is a

452
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:33,610
standard nozzle that all growers were

453
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:36,940
familiar with or are familiar with and

454
00:21:33,609 --> 00:21:41,709
now we have a nest of them three of them

455
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:45,220
in a small cluster and so by opening or

456
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:47,529
closing an individual nozzle or any

457
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:51,190
combination of nozzles we can get a

458
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:53,109
different flow rate and so here we have

459
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:56,410
the different pressures that they might

460
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:58,750
operate that if we open just an orange

461
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:01,090
nozzle we'd get a flow rate of about

462
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:05,380
nine liters a minute as you can see

463
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:08,230
there if we open the green nozzle we get

464
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:11,260
about 11 or 12 litres a minute and then

465
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:14,740
if we operate the yellow we will get

466
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:16,990
about 16 litres a minute so by having a

467
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:19,380
cluster of three nozzles we get a

468
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:22,559
variation in flow rate but

469
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:27,390
look if we have combination orange and

470
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,839
green orange and yellow so on and so

471
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:30,030
forth

472
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:33,029
green and yellow and then all three of

473
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:35,460
them on so you can see by having this

474
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:39,089
system which is very simple it's just

475
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:42,150
operated in our case by air can also be

476
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:45,659
operated electrically and so we can go

477
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:48,210
from about nine liters per minute all

478
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:50,490
the way up to 38 liters just by

479
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:52,860
switching on different nozzles as I'll

480
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:54,329
show you and at different pressures so

481
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:56,159
you can change pressure and therefore

482
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:59,879
you get there let me just show you this

483
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:03,630
at work and we'll come come back to the

484
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:06,870
graph here are the nozzles this is a

485
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:09,450
sensor this is in our lab as the sensor

486
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:12,149
moves towards the blackboard which is

487
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:14,309
representing the canopy so the closer we

488
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:17,509
get to the canopy then the different

489
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:24,869
nozzles switch on and off you see there

490
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:27,930
we see the gain in the mode you see the

491
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:30,719
switching around so we can change the

492
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:33,330
rate when we wait to the field this is

493
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,960
what the farmer does traditionally in

494
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:42,949
the red line where they use a standard

495
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,950
rate let's say 75 gallons per acre

496
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:50,430
sensors the blue line this is what they

497
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:53,400
are suggesting our flow rate should be

498
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:56,940
and then the dotted line is what the

499
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:59,640
actual sprayer nozzles put out because

500
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:03,509
we're using flow meter to measure the

501
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:06,060
flow so for the longest part until we

502
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:08,279
get here we are pretty much a good fit

503
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:12,089
to what the sensor seeing what the

504
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:13,740
output is showing it's all based on

505
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:15,689
Arduino boards those of you are into

506
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,789
electronics will know that the simplest

507
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:21,680
way to make a prototype is with these

508
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:24,599
$10 circuit boards that you can make

509
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:27,370
this huge Internet

510
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:30,609
discussion groups chat rooms about how

511
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:32,699
to operate these things so we can take

512
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:35,079
all these things flow rate pressure

513
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:37,690
there are the sensors put it all through

514
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:39,519
this device and then logged with the

515
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:41,649
data logger which tells us what the

516
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:44,528
signals are seeing and then using a

517
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:47,048
simple onboard computer send it

518
00:24:44,528 --> 00:24:50,230
wirelessly to the laptop at the end of

519
00:24:47,048 --> 00:24:51,369
the row and we know what's going on here

520
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,759
you can see it again

521
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:57,898
close up can you see them going around

522
00:24:53,759 --> 00:25:00,638
and then they're operated by electric

523
00:24:57,898 --> 00:25:03,009
valves or two opening or closing air

524
00:25:00,638 --> 00:25:04,719
compressed air lines the green is the

525
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:07,028
compressed air line so we're switching

526
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,329
on and off as and when we need to change

527
00:25:07,028 --> 00:25:13,869
the liquid flow but what about the air

528
00:25:10,329 --> 00:25:16,629
because this is the other other fluid

529
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:19,359
involved so this is the the system we've

530
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:22,899
got a patent on here at Cornell and you

531
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:25,418
can see it's a simple louver we call it

532
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:28,148
the Cornell louver system it slides and

533
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:30,278
in fact it's not just simply sliding

534
00:25:28,148 --> 00:25:33,518
it's actually redirecting the air

535
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:36,849
turning it 90 degrees so if any excess

536
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:39,669
air the air is not required therefore

537
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:41,439
its success its turn 90 degrees and

538
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:44,139
comes out the back of the machine

539
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,980
whereas the green is where the spray is

540
00:25:44,138 --> 00:25:51,418
leaving the sprayer and so early season

541
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:54,278
minimum air flow very sparse tree

542
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:56,380
maximum at the end of season then we

543
00:25:54,278 --> 00:25:59,259
want more air to penetrate the canopy

544
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:03,370
and so we can adjust it we adjust it

545
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:05,798
then by using a using an actuator here

546
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:10,629
it is an electronic actuator here then

547
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:13,210
is the sensor when he moves them the

548
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:15,850
washing up Bowl nearer the sensor so you

549
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:18,370
see the actuator changes so if density

550
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:20,589
of the canopy the signal changes so it's

551
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:24,369
the echo is collected and so the

552
00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:26,709
actuator changes so that was that again

553
00:26:24,369 --> 00:26:28,569
it's the Arduino board system same

554
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:31,179
system as we've just seen so it's very

555
00:26:28,569 --> 00:26:33,759
simple to repeat

556
00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:36,129
and so that was okay and our work shows

557
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,719
when we look at deposition which is how

558
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:39,998
do we know that we've got enough spray

559
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:41,830
on the lead you can see by changing the

560
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:45,308
air flow we're getting very good

561
00:26:41,829 --> 00:26:48,699
deposition at lower air speeds in fact

562
00:26:45,308 --> 00:26:51,069
as good as a high speed and the high

563
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:54,729
speed air creates a drift which we don't

564
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:56,858
want and therefore we're having same

565
00:26:54,729 --> 00:27:00,519
deposition at much lower air speeds

566
00:26:56,858 --> 00:27:02,528
which cost less money the modern farmer

567
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:05,798
though those that have seeing to the

568
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:07,659
future they don't really want these

569
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:09,878
old-fashioned air blast sprayer so

570
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:13,149
there's quite a development towards

571
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:16,449
these Saudi fans we've done trials up in

572
00:27:13,148 --> 00:27:19,538
Orleans County with this type of sprayer

573
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:24,369
this grower has four of them and you can

574
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:26,288
see they're vertical fans and this is

575
00:27:24,368 --> 00:27:30,488
what the machine is seeing there's our

576
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:32,440
estimated density signal in in blue left

577
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:34,869
and right hand side the tree and then

578
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:38,409
this is the fan regulation and you can

579
00:27:34,868 --> 00:27:41,019
see the fan can react very rapidly this

580
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:43,869
is on the Variety pinata and you can see

581
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:45,909
tremendous response there's a gap in the

582
00:27:43,868 --> 00:27:47,829
in the row of trees there's some trees

583
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:50,109
missing and you'll see that when we

584
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:52,678
watch the video and so we can regulate

585
00:27:50,108 --> 00:27:55,178
the fan speed yeah it is

586
00:27:52,679 --> 00:28:00,210
so here you can see how narrow the

587
00:27:55,179 --> 00:28:05,169
modern planting is of a modern orchard

588
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:05,619
and when the machine starts it's on full

589
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:07,538
bore

590
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:09,398
so it's blowing the spray right through

591
00:28:07,538 --> 00:28:11,888
you see it's going to land on the grass

592
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:14,648
it will result in pollution and then the

593
00:28:11,888 --> 00:28:17,949
sensors kick in and it'll start to keep

594
00:28:14,648 --> 00:28:20,678
that spray just within the canopy it's

595
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:23,169
not you see it's just your wisp where

596
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:24,820
there's a gap in the canopy so it's

597
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:27,669
still working we'll move in a wee bit

598
00:28:24,819 --> 00:28:29,408
can you see so it's still just puffing

599
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:31,149
in it's not blowing it all the way

600
00:28:29,409 --> 00:28:33,940
through and this is with a modern

601
00:28:31,148 --> 00:28:35,918
sprayer with the old-fashioned spray

602
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,690
will be all over the place so it's

603
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,889
certainly controlling air flow here's

604
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:41,288
the gap in the trees

605
00:28:38,888 --> 00:28:43,889
and they then picks it up so that's

606
00:28:41,288 --> 00:28:46,349
changing air and liquid flow

607
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:49,530
then I'll just skip this part if I may

608
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:52,319
because of time and show you the boom

609
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:55,200
sprayer section because that will

610
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:57,269
interest no neither there anyway there

611
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,549
it is so boom sprayer is what

612
00:28:57,269 --> 00:29:01,470
developments have occurred there you can

613
00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:04,919
clearly see the first thing is boom

614
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:06,720
movement when the big sprayers go across

615
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:11,220
the field either very rough fuel or too

616
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:15,000
fast we're going to get boom movement

617
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:16,890
either boom bounce or boom you're where

618
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,670
the Boone's move backwards and forwards

619
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:23,340
why aw boom the or and so that's a big

620
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:25,380
problem when you get boom you're you get

621
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:27,089
acceleration of the boom

622
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:30,060
the tip of the boom moves forward

623
00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:31,970
rapidly and then it lingers and then it

624
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:35,159
swings back and you can see you've got

625
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:37,620
400% application and then where as it's

626
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,840
moving it's moving through the

627
00:29:37,619 --> 00:29:41,579
horizontal plane and you get less

628
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:43,980
application so you're getting

629
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:46,409
ineffective application even with a boom

630
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,990
spread this is work done by Vander

631
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:53,160
Xander at Varga ningún and you can

632
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:56,609
clearly see that when deposition is okay

633
00:29:53,160 --> 00:30:00,029
we get lower infections when deposition

634
00:29:56,609 --> 00:30:02,549
is not a satisfactory we get these peaks

635
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:06,029
in infection here okay so as the green

636
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:08,819
is down then the disease has gone up you

637
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:11,240
can see this shown in three-dimensional

638
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:16,529
model where we've got these Peaks

639
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:17,370
depending on this sprayer boom what can

640
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:20,609
be done about it

641
00:30:17,369 --> 00:30:24,869
we can buy boom levelers here's one

642
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:27,959
attached to the boom and this is in the

643
00:30:24,869 --> 00:30:30,839
US here and again it's ultrasonics so

644
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:33,420
it's sending the sound wave down it hits

645
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:35,959
the wheat crop or barley whatever our

646
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:39,150
target crop is and then it stabilizes

647
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:43,289
the boom so it will adjust the boom up

648
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:45,330
and down hydraulically else you've seen

649
00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:47,339
this we showed you the Leffler system

650
00:30:45,329 --> 00:30:50,460
where we have a cluster of three nozzles

651
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:54,240
in this case we have a cluster of four

652
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:59,819
nozzles on the horizontal boom and again

653
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:01,680
we can change the flow rate so we can

654
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:04,470
change work rate due to variation in

655
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:08,460
speed we can vary the application range

656
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:12,029
for a specific area of crop and we can

657
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:14,279
switch from low to low drift nozzles if

658
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:16,859
we need the boundary of a field near a

659
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:19,139
water course and you can see clearly how

660
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:23,279
are the four nozzles switch in and out

661
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:27,000
and so depending on what you want where

662
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:28,980
you can flick from the cab a switch to

663
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,970
change different colored nozzles okay

664
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:34,440
and then you could have all four on but

665
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:38,089
that's so that was the early days that

666
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:40,620
would say a decade ago now we've got GPS

667
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:42,919
originally giving us boom sections as

668
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:45,389
you know the boom is in one to three

669
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:48,269
sections on the left three on the right

670
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:51,200
and one in the middle so 7 section boom

671
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:54,750
and we could switch them on and off to

672
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:57,269
prevent overlap on the headland those of

673
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:59,609
you know the farming terms the headland

674
00:31:57,269 --> 00:32:03,420
ran the boundary the edge of the field

675
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:05,789
we've now moved on again where we can

676
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:08,820
not just the boom sections the

677
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:11,670
individual nozzles and this is work done

678
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:14,309
by Scott Shearer who was at University

679
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:18,019
of Kentucky and there's now there ha the

680
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:21,299
Ohio State University and he is showing

681
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:23,910
six in this case 6.2 percent reduction

682
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:26,789
in sprays but he recorded up to nine

683
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:29,430
percent reduction so just simple

684
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:31,649
technology will allow you to save nine

685
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:33,600
percent your spray because you can

686
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:36,810
switch on and off you know where you

687
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:41,009
turn on the headland all done through

688
00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:44,669
GPS and switching the valves off equally

689
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:47,309
changes in pressure affect them as you

690
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:48,870
know pressure affects nozzle output and

691
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:51,690
so this is some work they did in

692
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:56,189
Kentucky at Lexington to show the

693
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:58,890
changing pressure across a field with

694
00:32:56,190 --> 00:33:01,650
changing your pressure comes changing in

695
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:04,710
output and you can see if the nozzle is

696
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:06,330
fluctuating from as low as 20 psi you're

697
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,690
only getting point three of a gallon

698
00:33:06,329 --> 00:33:08,788
permit

699
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:11,970
if you go all the way up to a hundred

700
00:33:08,788 --> 00:33:15,239
then we're at point eight gallons so any

701
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:17,308
variation as he found in this field then

702
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:20,190
he's going to give us an incorrect

703
00:33:17,308 --> 00:33:22,678
application rate so maybe the product

704
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:26,580
won't work anymore and then the final

705
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:29,099
part to show you what is the most modern

706
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:31,079
thing one their big silver medal in the

707
00:33:29,098 --> 00:33:36,358
Agrotech now to show in europe and that

708
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:38,608
is a Curie working to zero one of the

709
00:33:36,358 --> 00:33:41,308
Bane's of the farmers life is going back

710
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:42,868
to refill because if the effects output

711
00:33:41,308 --> 00:33:44,908
because you have to transport the

712
00:33:42,868 --> 00:33:47,668
vehicle it's not in work and so this

713
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:50,220
system allows you to see what your flow

714
00:33:47,669 --> 00:33:52,409
rate has been how much is was in the

715
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:55,618
tank to begin with how much is left and

716
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:57,359
so if our last point if we originally

717
00:33:55,618 --> 00:34:00,808
wanted to put on a hundred liters per

718
00:33:57,358 --> 00:34:03,689
hectare so ten gallons per acre and the

719
00:34:00,808 --> 00:34:06,690
Machine says we can actually use if we

720
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:09,480
use ninety one because a hectare 9.1

721
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:11,579
gallons a hectare we will run until we

722
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,260
get to the end of a rope so you're not

723
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:16,230
going to stop down in the middle of the

724
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:19,220
field and so it predicts when you need

725
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:22,648
to refill the sprayer based on flow rate

726
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:25,769
location with GPS and then tank contents

727
00:34:22,648 --> 00:34:28,858
and so you start the system and it flags

728
00:34:25,769 --> 00:34:32,429
up that if you reset it to automatically

729
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:35,369
to 91 rather than a hundred you will get

730
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:39,480
to the end of your work zone so it saves

731
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:41,608
a lot of time in the amount of liquid

732
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,710
left in the sprayer and when you refill

733
00:34:41,608 --> 00:34:46,558
so you change what you want is your

734
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:49,139
default and so that's the latest system

735
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:53,869
and I'd like to leave you with this

736
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:57,180
slide and that is in field crops we have

737
00:34:53,869 --> 00:35:00,510
tremendous adoption of technology in the

738
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:02,639
Midwest states they have auto steer they

739
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:03,778
have all these things have to show or

740
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,449
some of the things I've just shown you

741
00:35:03,778 --> 00:35:09,510
on the Amazon sprayer but in

742
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:13,288
horticultural crops which is my area we

743
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:16,109
have a fear of technology and I show

744
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:19,260
this to the growers all the time their

745
00:35:16,108 --> 00:35:19,858
biggest point is the cost involved in

746
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,410
repair

747
00:35:19,858 --> 00:35:24,389
because they like they're what we call

748
00:35:22,409 --> 00:35:27,629
nut buggers you know they like to spend

749
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:30,028
their time trying to mend the sprayer or

750
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:32,700
mend them tractor and after so many

751
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:34,230
hours they have to give up throw their

752
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:36,960
arms in the air so what we fail to do

753
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:39,809
that and then still have to pay seven 75

754
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:43,380
dollars an hour to get it fixed so it's

755
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:46,579
a different mindset but the more we show

756
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:48,960
them other aspects of Agriculture then

757
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:50,700
hopefully they'll they'll adopt this

758
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,119
technology but at the moment it's still

759
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:56,548
very early days to get them to switch if

760
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:58,640
you're excited by spraying I commend

761
00:35:56,548 --> 00:36:01,048
these two excellent publications to you

762
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:07,199
where you'll see lots of our research

763
00:36:01,048 --> 00:36:08,969
work great thank you very much this has

764
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:14,719
been a production of Cornell University

765
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:14,719
on the web at cornell edu
