1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,638
University and I managed the actual lab

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,000
itself um and this is our

4
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:19,919
Greenhouse so this is where we do the

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,960
root bio assay the root bio

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,599
assay uh is a way for us to look at them

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:30,240
am of FAL pressure specifically diseases

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,000
that may be present in your soil I'd

9
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,238
like to First clarify by saying that

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,878
most of the diseases that we look for

11
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:40,640
which is kium muscarium

12
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:43,799
biopsis and

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,640
ronia are present in most soil around

14
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:49,439
the world right we already know this

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,679
they're not all everywhere but one of

16
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:55,558
these is probably basically everywhere

17
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,920
um so what we're actually measuring is

18
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:01,000
the health of your soil and the ability

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,640
for the plant to outow that

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,118
right we're not going through and

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,680
looking and saying like yes I can

22
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:10,118
identify for instance right I know I

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,560
look at it like yeah that's cerium but

24
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:14,560
I'm not going to contact the grower and

25
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,200
say I saw cerium I could be wrong you

26
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,118
know um it could be something else who

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,520
knows I'm not a plant pathologist I'm a

28
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:26,519
soil person right but what I can say is

29
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:28,798
that you have less or more pressure on

30
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,478
your actual plant itself so what we

31
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,399
would do is we would assign them a

32
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,560
rating the ratings are based from 2 to 9

33
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:37,320
you might wonder why isn't it 1 to 10

34
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,200
that's basically because one would be a

35
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:42,039
perfect point we don't think that really

36
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,759
exists and 10 is completely dead

37
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,960
completely failed absolutely nothing so

38
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,478
we keep it more in that range right so

39
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:52,519
typically the best rating that I give a

40
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:54,200
plant is a three some of them get twos

41
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:55,359
if it really fills up the TU you guys

42
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,280
will have a chance to see what this

43
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:00,200
looks like in a minute um but typically

44
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,599
three if you get it three or four your

45
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,880
soil's doing great that really means

46
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,679
that we don't see any evidence at all

47
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:07,959
right if you get something more like a

48
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,439
seven or eight that's a really serious

49
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:13,479
issue that's telling us that you then

50
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,919
you're agricultural consultant that's

51
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:16,598
you guys or if you're you know if you're

52
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:19,518
the grower that means that you need to

53
00:02:16,598 --> 00:02:22,238
send your soil to a pathen soil testing

54
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:23,920
lab and figure out exactly what you have

55
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,878
going on because there's different

56
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:28,238
management strategies for these four

57
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:31,280
different types of diseases that we look

58
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,840
for right so so we grow these beans in

59
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,400
this highly stressful situation on

60
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,080
purpose it's very hot in here a lot of

61
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,640
these diseases are encouraged by high

62
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,760
soil temperatures um and they get really

63
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:48,158
dry they get wet they have all sorts of

64
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:50,479
stress during these W tubes so we expect

65
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:52,199
that if there is evence there if your

66
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,840
smell's not strong enough to outow it

67
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:57,639
we're going to see it we also use these

68
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,120
high style snaping which we know are

69
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:02,639
highly susceptible to these diseases

70
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,439
naturally these seeds have been treated

71
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:08,399
with various things there's a list right

72
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:11,239
here on the seeds but you know cap tan

73
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,439
strepto myosin you know kind of the

74
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,799
standards part of the reason for this is

75
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,400
because most people are using treated

76
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,439
Seas these days the other reason for

77
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,400
this is that if your plant can't is

78
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,479
still getting these diseases when

79
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,280
working if these treated seeds that's

80
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:29,399
really telling us there's a major issue

81
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,719
there right if we didn't treat these

82
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,480
seeds these plants would not

83
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:36,318
to some of them kind of would but it

84
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:39,919
would be really really

85
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:41,719
hard so over here you can see you know

86
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,759
all day long we've been talking about

87
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:47,280
the uh intensive management and thead

88
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:49,479
for good call well bad CW that's what we

89
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,360
call it it's our short hand in the lab

90
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:54,399
once again this is good call well bad

91
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,079
well and right away I think that you can

92
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,239
see a visual difference these were

93
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:01,680
planted on the same day these also are

94
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:05,079
were planted on the same day these I

95
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,079
pulled from I had about 200 samples sent

96
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:10,200
to me earlier this year for this test we

97
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,599
do all of our tests all of right I don't

98
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,839
think we've really specified that so I

99
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,840
want to make sure everyone knows that

100
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,759
you can send in just for available water

101
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:21,959
capacity if you want um so these had

102
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,520
very bad readings these were all sevens

103
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,000
and eights so I planted these on purpose

104
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:27,680
in hopes that we can see some evidence

105
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,720
of the so I can show you kind of what

106
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,800
we're looking at that said these are

107
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,560
have only been growing for about 3 weeks

108
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,918
typically we don't Harvest until four or

109
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,160
5 weeks so the evidence is very light

110
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,680
you're just starting to see some

111
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,800
evidence here if I had planted them

112
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,959
sooner if I wasn't so busy with our lab

113
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,560
becoming extremely popular I would have

114
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,719
gotten these out of here out here sooner

115
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,478
and you would see a little bit more

116
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,840
evidence but we've been looking at them

117
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:55,560
all day and we are seeing some issues so

118
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:58,119
you should be able to see that um so

119
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,918
each sample gets four reps so for

120
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,120
instance these are like go over there

121
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,000
those are actually soil Health samples

122
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,639
that I can tell you right now are having

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,918
some serious issues under the surface of

124
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:11,680
the soil I don't know what yet I will

125
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:14,359
next week um but if we only we don't get

126
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,560
enough soil they only get one W this is

127
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,199
something you know as a lab manager

128
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,519
every been kind of pushing this all day

129
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:22,478
we really need an soil it's really

130
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:25,519
important um you're going to get better

131
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:28,639
data and it also cost us a lot of Labor

132
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:30,959
to have to uh stretch the soil out right

133
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,720
so for instance these guys are you

134
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,399
know those guys I had to replant because

135
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,759
they were total failures the ones where

136
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:39,959
you don't see anything coming up so I

137
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:42,160
will replant up to three times um after

138
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,519
that I'm saying like Okay the seed is

139
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,439
over 90% germination rate I'm pretty

140
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:50,318
sure that uh you got a really serious

141
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,519
issue going on in there right um so then

142
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,039
you can see these guys didn't quite set

143
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,240
their soil they only get three reps we

144
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:58,159
take the average of the four reps

145
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,519
assuming they send us enough soil and

146
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,560
that's the result that the far or the

147
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:06,478
agricultural service provider

148
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,160
receivers so do you guys have any

149
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,598
questions before I kind of move into

150
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,599
showing you how we actually do

151
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,520
this but like yeah I think that the main

152
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:18,399
the main point about this test really is

153
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:20,918
that we're testing the supressive

154
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,758
capacity of your soil right we're

155
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:25,240
looking to see like how healthy that

156
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:28,160
soil is and if it can actually push past

157
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,280
that we're not testing how much pathogen

158
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,680
pressure you have although of course

159
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:33,879
that is a factor and that's going to

160
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,240
influence this we're really truly just

161
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:38,199
looking at whether or not it can power

162
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,120
through

163
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:45,639
that all right

164
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,598
so what we do is we use these we call

165
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:50,199
them Bean tubes I believe that these are

166
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:54,159
actually used for starting trees

167
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:57,000
generally and we take clean cotton ball

168
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,680
we place it in the bottom the purpose of

169
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,199
this is to

170
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,918
Ure that it drains properly and also to

171
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,800
um keep the soil from falling out we're

172
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:12,198
one of the only green houses on campus

173
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,000
that actually use soil in the greenhouse

174
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:17,120
most people working green houses are

175
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,360
using media various things that have

176
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,000
been sterilized as you all probably know

177
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,280
there's a lot of potentially dangerous

178
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,199
things in soil especially for green

179
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:30,198
houses some of these um issues that we

180
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,759
look for really are huge problems in

181
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,160
green houses anyway right so like I'm

182
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,840
very careful to keep everything

183
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,800
extremely clean this is a very clean

184
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,638
Greenhouse it's sterilized regularly all

185
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,280
of these wraps and these trays I

186
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,199
sterilize between every batch to just

187
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:48,000
like minimize as much as possible

188
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,000
anything spreading and throwing this off

189
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,918
that all said this is really a visual

190
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,598
test as you're going to see you can see

191
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,719
with this picture over

192
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:58,360
here we're really looking at like kind

193
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,759
of the big picture with things right

194
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,038
we're looking at so this would probably

195
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:04,479
be a three or a four probably a four if

196
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:07,240
it was whiter I would probably give it a

197
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:10,240
three and this is probably more like an

198
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,918
eight I see them look way worse than

199
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,000
this you know so you know it gets into

200
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:16,918
the nine Nine's pretty much a complete

201
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,959
damping off

202
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:21,719
failure um so that's kind of an idea of

203
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:23,638
how the ratings move this isn't the best

204
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,080
picture you know you can see like oh

205
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,158
well this is darker than this wouldn't

206
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:29,800
that get a worse rating but then if you

207
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:32,439
look more closely you can see the dark

208
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,038
moving up the stems you know and this is

209
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,360
evidence of the specific things we're

210
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:38,038
looking at right so this is these are

211
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,158
pictures of actual samples that have

212
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:43,038
come through the soil Health lab you

213
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,639
know you can see pythium something that

214
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,720
a lot of us are probably pretty familiar

215
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,399
with you know the damping off and then

216
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,440
the fusarium which was probably what was

217
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:53,559
going on in this picture would be my

218
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,600
guests like I said I'm in soils not

219
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:58,399
plant craft but I'm learning more and

220
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,120
more about it every year you know and

221
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,320
then we'll see the legions I've had some

222
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,200
samples come through here where the

223
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,879
legions are all the way up they move all

224
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,959
the way up the plant you know and then

225
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:11,078
that's going to be in 89 range and then

226
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,838
if they call us their agricultural

227
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:14,799
consultant should be telling them look

228
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:16,079
you need to send your soil to a pth lab

229
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,319
you to figure out what's actually going

230
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:21,319
on so you can actually manage

231
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,640
R it's kind of another example of

232
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,000
something where this would be more in

233
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:28,639
the three range and this would be more

234
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,600
in the 78 range just so and we see stuff

235
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:34,039
like this all all the

236
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,959
time so what we do is we take our soil

237
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:37,679
this is the good calwell bad calwell

238
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:39,599
again forgive me for shortening things

239
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:42,319
but I do it with everything up here

240
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,159
because it's lots of big words and lots

241
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,480
of talking and it just is easier like

242
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,719
that so I do kind of want to point out

243
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,159
this soil just because it's fresh you

244
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,440
know and I think that there's a lot to

245
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:55,039
be learned from fresh soil we actually

246
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,760
pull as soon as we get the sample in we

247
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,360
pull it that day or the next day and we

248
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:00,720
get it right out here in the greenhouse

249
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,519
because this does take the 4 to 5 weeks

250
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,680
that's another refinement I started this

251
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,639
year just to try to like help us get

252
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:08,519
this stuff out as quickly as possible

253
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,439
although yeah this is the world's most

254
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,879
comprehensive soil test it doesn't

255
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,800
happen overnight that's just how it goes

256
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,639
but you can see some differences here I

257
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,879
think you look at it just just right off

258
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:21,720
the bat with the color you know the good

259
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:25,078
is much darker you can see that the

260
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,040
organic matter is much higher visually

261
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:28,559
to this one you know and it's like of

262
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,278
course I know I wish that we had time to

263
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,958
show you guys the field so you could see

264
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:34,159
this field which has been in wheat for

265
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,719
20 years or something like that and the

266
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:39,278
wheat was like this tall I mean it's

267
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,839
terrible looking nasty field cracking

268
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:44,600
all sorts of issues flooding versus the

269
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,920
S is doing great no problems at all and

270
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:51,120
now that you bring it up say why are

271
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:54,000
they we on this Feld that's for

272
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,320
particular torture test I think that

273
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,759
it's some kind of a long-term breeding

274
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,440
something but I'm not sure I'm pretty

275
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,078
sure it's one of the Breeders SKS I I

276
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,519
don't know what they're doing exactly

277
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:04,879
but yeah that's kind of one cool thing

278
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:07,078
about campus is that especially Bob he

279
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,399
really knows he's been here forever he

280
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:11,719
knows these fields that have been

281
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,839
basically abused and beaten down for as

282
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,920
long as he's been here like 30 years or

283
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,760
something crazy like that right for 35

284
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,799
didn't he I think he started in ' 80s

285
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,720
early ' 80s right so he knows the

286
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:24,399
history of a lot of these fields so

287
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,959
we'll go and like pull some soil because

288
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:30,559
we know that um what it's going to do

289
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:32,199
basically we can predict that and he was

290
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,879
right you know we ran it we pulled it we

291
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,360
ran it through the soil Health test and

292
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:37,320
you know you guys all saw those reports

293
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,879
I'm sure they're right there behind

294
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,120
there with the air dried soil and you

295
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,120
can really see it's a extreme difference

296
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,000
in these areas right next to each other

297
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,000
you know just we love to talk about how

298
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,159
the management actually is affecting the

299
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,559
soil it's a really phenomenal thing I

300
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:55,199
think especially for people who are not

301
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,638
exposed to this um all right so

302
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,240
basically though what we do as far as

303
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:03,759
the actual planting is we take the so

304
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:06,440
soil and we run it through a 4 mm sip

305
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:08,360
right just a bit just like a little bit

306
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,880
the rest of it I knock out and I push

307
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,919
the side so this soil has gone to an 8

308
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:16,360
mm SI you can kind of see it if you're

309
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:18,000
familiar with siing I am I can kind of

310
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,879
look at this and say we do a lot of

311
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,078
siing you guys not as much as we used to

312
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:23,600
I don't know if you've seen the grinder

313
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:25,838
yet down you guys been1 right so that's

314
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,800
a new innovation this year um that was

315
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,800
all Bob and that has saved us so much

316
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,439
time sitting it's like my first year or

317
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:36,120
two I swear that's all I did I felt like

318
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:38,480
SI soil anyway okay so we take the soil

319
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:42,679
that's gone through the A and we put it

320
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,959
in a we put it in a labeled tube of

321
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:46,958
course you know and then we have four

322
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:49,439
reps we just label the first

323
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,278
one and typically when I do this I keep

324
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,079
my bag of soil in front of me or

325
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,278
encourage any of our texts to be the

326
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:57,239
same so that you don't ever like lose

327
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:58,838
track it's like the number one we're a

328
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,159
little bit hardcore about no mistakes

329
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:03,199
here but pretty much have to be it's

330
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:04,919
like whatever triple checking I say that

331
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:06,599
all the time I'm probably driving crazy

332
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:10,078
but it's really important you literally

333
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:13,320
triple check every um so I take the seed

334
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:16,198
and I put it on its side basically this

335
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,839
is really important because it seems

336
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:20,559
like such a simple thing but if you have

337
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,399
it kind of facing up it'll actually send

338
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:25,679
its roots out first it'll just have such

339
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,720
a harder time we've learned so many

340
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:31,078
tricks to help encourage these to grow

341
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,240
in what's naturally a highly stressful

342
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:36,239
environment right and then I just take

343
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,360
about half an inch of soil the S soil

344
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,198
and I put it on top just kind of trying

345
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,639
to make this like easier for them I want

346
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:43,799
them to just be able to pop out I want

347
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:45,519
them to germinate in a day or two you

348
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:48,799
know which they will they're properly

349
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:51,000
taken care of and then they go on the RP

350
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,559
they're always positioned like this and

351
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,159
then every other row so that they have

352
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:57,399
space and we can avoid any cross

353
00:13:55,159 --> 00:14:00,439
contamination when we're watering them

354
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:03,879
right so I water these personally by

355
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,560
hand with a hose that I have set to go

356
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:07,799
right over there you know we kind of

357
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:10,159
have it down a little bit I put on very

358
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:13,359
low volume and I come out here every

359
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:16,439
single day even Saturday and Sunday and

360
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,919
I water these because I have a strong

361
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,759
background in agriculture I have an

362
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:21,719
organic farm I have a green thumb not

363
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,879
everyone

364
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,079
does and they get have gotten killed by

365
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:27,720
people for getting to water on the

366
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,519
weekends and then you have to start from

367
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,240
scratch so to me me I live in Paul Creek

368
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:34,278
downtown it's not that big of a deal to

369
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,639
grow up here to be sure that they're

370
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:38,078
going to be

371
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,680
alive so that's just a little part of

372
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:43,439
what I do but um right so then they're

373
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:45,239
planted they're growing for 5 weeks and

374
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,199
then they're harvested which I can show

375
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,919
you guys over here what that looks like

376
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:50,919
so these are all the good and bad

377
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:57,399
Caldwell and then these are the

378
00:14:54,958 --> 00:15:00,078
allart samples that I received earlier

379
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:01,278
this year that had really terrible rings

380
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:03,439
so I'm hoping that we're going to see

381
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,240
some evidence of diseas you can see that

382
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,800
these are all really wilty this is

383
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,240
because I didn't water them this morning

384
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:11,078
on purpose in preparation for harvesting

385
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,198
them so that the soil will just fall off

386
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:15,719
the roots and it won't break off so this

387
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:19,240
is another thing kind of a learning

388
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,278
curve thing that we learned um to just

389
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,120
save time we're always I'm super

390
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:26,838
obsessed with efficiency we're all

391
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:30,560
obsessed with just trying to make this

392
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:31,800
as unlabored type it as possible it's

393
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,719
not the best way to put it but I think

394
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:37,639
you guys want all right so I loosen up

395
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,240
the tube I just whack it out of there

396
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:41,198
and then typically you would throw the

397
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,480
tube down to the end this is usually a

398
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:46,919
twers job one person would be doing this

399
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,480
part of it and the other person would be

400
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:50,719
doing the washing so then you would lay

401
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,600
your tube with the samples right next to

402
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,240
it in a very specific way and then the

403
00:15:52,600 --> 00:16:00,199
person follows along and wases The Roots

404
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,198
so this is a good cwell

405
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,680
right off the bat I can tell you I'm

406
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:07,399
seeing good things I see these are kind

407
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:09,479
of shaped like the tube right I see that

408
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,480
it kind of fills the tube out it's not

409
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,360
just this

410
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,759
little piddling of a roof so then we go

411
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:20,360
through and we actually wash them by

412
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:24,519
hand this a really important step

413
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:26,278
because I personally rate these beans um

414
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:30,078
I assign them they're rating between two

415
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:32,159
and n and then Bob sindle comes and he

416
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,399
checks my ratings and almost always

417
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,559
adjusts them because he's been doing the

418
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,360
ratings for these since the beginning of

419
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:41,838
the test this was part of the original

420
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:44,278
package on the test in 2007 so we want

421
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,000
to be sure that it's consistent we

422
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:48,759
wouldn't want a farmer to get a seven

423
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,240
one year and get a six another year they

424
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:54,759
affected it if that's not actually true

425
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:57,039
right so because it is a visual

426
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:59,360
assessment because it is you know

427
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:02,639
something that you could and have a

428
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,599
biased words perhaps you know you're

429
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,400
very careful to double check it so I'm

430
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:10,399
going to pass these around these are

431
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:13,120
good this looks clean to me I don't

432
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,880
see I maybe see a tiny bit of evidence

433
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,318
right

434
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:21,000
there looks like a little bit of

435
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:25,678
darkening um but I'm not seeing much I

436
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,679
bet this is around a 3 and 1/2 or

437
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:33,160
four and then in contrast of got that

438
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:35,279
calwell which we don't know because I

439
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,320
haven't when we ran this for the soil

440
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,000
Health test we didn't actually do the

441
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:41,200
Bean root bioassay because of course

442
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,679
it's not included in our standard

443
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,000
analysis so we don't know until now and

444
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:48,080
I'm going to leave some in here out of

445
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,038
my own curiosity to get to their full

446
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,639
age so that I can determine if how much

447
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:53,798
disease pressure is actually on me so

448
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,799
I'm going to keep these alive for

449
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:57,200
another probably week and then I'll

450
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:58,519
Harvest them and give them an actual

451
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,840
rating just so we know for our own

452
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,839
record

453
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:07,359
all right that called well all right so

454
00:18:05,558 --> 00:18:10,359
this one for some reason had two seeds

455
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:12,439
in it it's not exactly the standard but

456
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:13,639
it doesn't really matter but I think

457
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,140
right off the bat we can see a little

458
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,480
bit of a

459
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:19,320
[Music]

460
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:21,200
difference right so I'm taking this into

461
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:22,480
consideration I'm not really looking at

462
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,840
the plant you know like what I showed

463
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,558
you guys with looking at the plant

464
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,038
overall that's not something that we do

465
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:29,359
as part of our assessment because what

466
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:32,919
are we going to compare it to right

467
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,399
but as far as just my own curiosity I'm

468
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:37,360
taking that into

469
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,640
consideration and I definitely for this

470
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:41,439
purpose I'm going to be looking at these

471
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,480
compared to

472
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,519
those

473
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:49,839
so definitely I can see some evidence

474
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:52,839
here but less Roots

475
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:56,558
exactly yep and we can see some dark

476
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:59,359
spots see that starting so in another

477
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:01,798
week I guarantee that this would go next

478
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:05,199
year um you can kind of look at it along

479
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:07,798
with those and you can really see

480
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,798
there's

481
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,120
um long yep it would take too long we've

482
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:21,639
of course talked about that people have

483
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:23,918
talked to us about that um I think

484
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,559
that'd be really interesting in general

485
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,559
I think that's the kind of thing that

486
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:29,240
you could if you're a researcher maybe

487
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:31,240
would tell you we see some

488
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,839
pressure then you can take those next

489
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,240
steps or send it into the path lab right

490
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,279
so this is kind of a way it's like

491
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,480
canaran a Coline we're just we're saying

492
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:43,158
like look we can see some evidence you

493
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,599
need to then take the next step to see

494
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:47,640
what's going on right we're not going to

495
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:50,119
tell you like anything specifically

496
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:53,600
about these yeah do you grow controls at

497
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:55,359
the same time or just not exactly um we

498
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:59,079
do

499
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:01,319
grow the same we grow soil that we know

500
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:03,599
what to predict from regularly like in

501
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:05,439
our research plots and things like that

502
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,199
but yeah we don't this is actually the

503
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,798
only test that we don't have a quality

504
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,120
control with every

505
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:13,279
batch I've thought about it I don't know

506
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:17,439
I might do something like that in the

507
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:20,079
future I'm not sure but it's it's been

508
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,558
discussed I don't know how much it would

509
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,240
necessarily um influence things because

510
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,798
what are we going to do get some like

511
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,960
kium fested soil and go that along with

512
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:32,158
it it's a tricky thing but I've been

513
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,600
thinking about it maybe maybe in the

514
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:38,080
future okay so these guys like I said

515
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:41,038
they've only been in here for 3 weeks

516
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:44,879
but at the 5e Mark they had really

517
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:47,158
really terrible scorers so I think right

518
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,840
off the bat we can start to see some

519
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:52,480
issues even if 3 weeks right these marks

520
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:54,798
that doesn't come

521
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,400
off then you see how this is spitting

522
00:20:54,798 --> 00:21:01,839
there not a good sign definitely not a

523
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:04,120
good sign and then also the overall

524
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:07,038
volume okay so right so looking at the

525
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:07,038
goods compared to

526
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:12,839
that exactly yeah well we do enough of

527
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,840
our own research that we have stuff out

528
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:18,599
here definitely yeah it's kind of like I

529
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:21,480
mean I purposed thousands of these

530
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:24,719
thousands and thousands so I sort of

531
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:27,319
have a database in my mind of what where

532
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,038
it falls in as strange as that sounds

533
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:32,278
that's really how it is know but you can

534
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:34,079
really visually learn quite a bit from

535
00:21:32,278 --> 00:21:37,319
just looking at these grots we do think

536
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:39,399
that it's really a valuable thing it's

537
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:41,599
kind of a thing that we think is more

538
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,880
specific for specific people these days

539
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,480
it's not part of our you know standard

540
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,720
test anymore it's just in our

541
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,079
comprehensive or as an add-on so if

542
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,720
you're a vegetable farmer you probably

543
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,319
would really want to do this we would

544
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,319
recommend this to if you're a vegetable

545
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:56,319
partner

546
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:02,359
um yes we see nodules all the time I've

547
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:04,200
thought about we've talked a little bit

548
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:07,359
about maybe marking down if we see

549
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,919
nodules or not kind of as an additional

550
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,158
thing it's a tricky thing there's so

551
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,440
many more things we can do with

552
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:15,159
everything that we do up here you know

553
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,640
but then we're just we're trying to get

554
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:20,679
these results out as rapidly as possible

555
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,759
and we're dealing with a unprecedented

556
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:24,200
volume of

557
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:25,319
samples so that's something we

558
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,440
definitely talked about we've also

559
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:31,839
talked about doing uh Le seed thing

560
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,960
a little bit you know and like actually

561
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,959
super long term and look and see what

562
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,840
kind of weed pressure there's been some

563
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,319
talks mostly from outside of our team

564
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:40,359
people coaching me and asking me if

565
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:42,200
that's something I might be interested

566
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,558
in looking into someday and you know

567
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,400
there's a lot of that's kind of the cool

568
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:47,440
thing about this we're always refining

569
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,720
our test we're always improving our

570
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,480
tests we're always looking for new and

571
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:57,200
novel ways to show and talk

572
00:22:53,480 --> 00:23:01,400
about that's good have to do that

573
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,640
exactly yeah have to be yeah I think so

574
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,798
I think it's really

575
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,200
important yeah and this test changes

576
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:09,158
every year I mean this year we did a lot

577
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,278
of things you know we came up with the

578
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:15,159
grinder and the civer we um changed the

579
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:17,200
way that we can get the water for the

580
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:19,240
accurate stability the texture sink I'm

581
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,360
sure Jamie told you that which her and I

582
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,679
designed you know that cut our texture

583
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:26,798
time in half you know removing this from

584
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:29,720
the standard package that Sav us a lot

585
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:32,079
of time moving to this house originally

586
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,600
we were inory which is halfway it's like

587
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,798
half a mile away that way so my first

588
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:39,558
year is a temporary lach I had pushed

589
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:41,079
bags of soil on a cart across campus

590
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:42,558
soaked in sweat through all the

591
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:46,480
undergrads you know what I mean we're

592
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:46,480
like who are you you know

593
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:53,319
so

594
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:53,319
yeah call

595
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:06,359
this has been a production of Cornell

596
