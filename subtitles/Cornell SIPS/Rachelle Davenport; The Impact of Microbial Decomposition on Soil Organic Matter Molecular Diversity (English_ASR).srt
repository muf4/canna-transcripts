1
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:05,958
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:14,320
University great thank you joh for the

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,560
introduction uh thanks for everyone for

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,039
being here yeah so I will be going over

5
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:21,239
the three chapters of my dissertation

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,359
today and all of them revolve around the

7
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,159
concept of molecular diversity of soil

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,960
organic matter how deep composition

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,240
affects it and how that affects its

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,200
persistence as you all know soil organic

11
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:36,719
matter is the fraction of so soil that's

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,160
consists of plant or animal tissue in

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,558
various stages of

14
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,878
decomposition soil organic matter lends

15
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,718
many physical chemical biological

16
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:48,960
benefits to soil

17
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,120
function and then another large function

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,960
that so organic matter provides is the

19
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,439
ability to retain organic carbon in fact

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,000
soils contain three times the amount of

21
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,159
carbon as the

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,799
atmosphere and the balance between soil

23
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:02,919
organic carbon and carbon stored in the

24
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,959
atmosphere as carbon dioxide or methane

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,079
is really um dependent upon microbial

26
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:09,798
respiration of that carbon so this

27
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,560
actually a very old question of what

28
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,960
retains or what what are the controls

29
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,040
that are

30
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:20,559
um influencing the retention of

31
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,799
carbon so this is such an old question

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,079
um one of my favorite papers to go back

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,920
to every once in a while and read is

34
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:30,438
this paper from 1925 by someon Waxman

35
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,599
what is so humus and he asked

36
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:33,319
this important question which is really

37
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:34,919
driving question in my re research as

38
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:36,839
well which is why does a part of organic

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,320
matter decompose rapidly and a part only

40
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,079
very slowly he points out the economic

41
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,758
importance of this question at that time

42
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,879
really they're thinking of nutrients and

43
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,239
nitrogen and um the minerals that plants

44
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:52,118
need to grow for us there's this added

45
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:54,560
economic importance for climate

46
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:56,039
change so the current view of how we

47
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,039
understand organic matter

48
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:02,718
being uh cycled in soils is that there's

49
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:04,159
this uh Continuum as organic matter is

50
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:07,919
progressively decomposed it becomes

51
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,560
smaller and smaller along this Continuum

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,239
it has the ability to chemically

53
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,039
interact with minerals um through

54
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,400
absorption or dsorption and then also

55
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,318
physically by being occluded or released

56
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,000
from

57
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:21,159
Aggregates so this process along with

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,280
some of the bigger environmental

59
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:26,000
variables such as temperature moisture

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,479
PH soil microbial Community overall

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,598
impact the retention time of carbon and

62
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,359
soils more recently though we've been

63
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:35,639
thinking about some other

64
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,200
processes that affect organic carbon

65
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:40,039
cycling

66
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:42,719
and probobly S of the heterogeneity of

67
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:45,239
soil itself as a control and soil curent

68
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,800
cycling so there's spatial heterogeneity

69
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,158
so the collocation of organic matter

70
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,719
minerals microbes there's temporal

71
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:52,719
variability and then there's the

72
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,439
molecular diversity so variability and

73
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,919
organic matter

74
00:02:54,439 --> 00:03:01,280
properties of course what I am focusing

75
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:03,119
on so I Define the diversity as the

76
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,919
number and abundance of distinctly comp

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,439
distinctly different compounds in soil

78
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:10,639
organic matter and being clear that I'm

79
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:12,519
talking about diversity of molecules and

80
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,598
not diversity of microbes right

81
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:16,080
now so the big question to my

82
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:17,959
researchers really does molecular

83
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,640
diversity affect the composition of so

84
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:25,400
organic matter I hypothesized that as

85
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:27,439
diversity of molecules um increases we

86
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,959
would have slower rates of decomposition

87
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,639
because the energy return on investment

88
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,360
by microorganisms to use each of these

89
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:35,318
individual compounds would become

90
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,319
unfavorable they had to make new enzymes

91
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:39,560
or upregulate new metabolic pathways to

92
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:42,039
tackle each an individual each you know

93
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,878
new compound that they come in contact

94
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:48,280
with so that's sort of the step one

95
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:50,639
hypothesis is that diversity slow

96
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,759
decomposition but that decomposition

97
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,359
itself

98
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:58,560
might increase molecular

99
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,640
diversity as um microbes add all these

100
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,799
new compounds in there metabolism to the

101
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,000
pool of organic matter it might actually

102
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,959
increase molecular R cell so there's

103
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,479
this feedback loop between decomposition

104
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,479
processes and molecular diversity that I

105
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,479
am also going to try to um

106
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,238
untangle some more Foundation

107
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:23,079
information how am I measuring and

108
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,319
quantifying molecular diversity this is

109
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:27,599
you know there are studies that are

110
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:30,519
looking at they often call it hemo

111
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,080
diversity and those studies are more of

112
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:34,639
a qualitative and I really wanted to be

113
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,319
quantitative quantifying all of this so

114
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,840
to do that I'm looking at the dissolved

115
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,759
organic matter pool from soil organic

116
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:43,198
matter and this is where you do a water

117
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,400
extraction you filter at02 microns and

118
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:50,800
that's the pool of carbon it is actually

119
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:50,799
the most bioavailable and um usable by

120
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:57,280
micro the next step is actually identify

121
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:01,639
those comps and to do that I use

122
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:04,279
untargeted Canam liquidar master Tre so

123
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,840
lmss where I can then identify the

124
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:09,000
different compounds based on mass to

125
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:11,038
charge ratios and retention times so you

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,560
match those with known um standard

127
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,240
libraries I use c18 and Hill columns for

128
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,519
polar and non-polar compound

129
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,720
identification this just an example

130
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,439
Spectra where you have the mass charge

131
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,759
on the X AIS your inity on the Y AIS

132
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:25,800
which from two different soil samples

133
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:27,439
but each of these different Master

134
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,960
charge ratios could be considered a

135
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:32,079
unique molecular compound and then it's

136
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:35,038
height use to calculate the relative

137
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:39,159
proportion of that compound in your

138
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:41,038
sample I use three uh big types of

139
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,240
calculation to quantify molecular

140
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,038
diversity and these are really borrowed

141
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,960
from apologists trying to apply them to

142
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,519
molecules so the first one is just

143
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,758
molecular richness and this is just the

144
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:52,879
number of compounds and this is the most

145
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,800
basic form of the recity

146
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,800
quantification which gives you really no

147
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,000
information about the molecules just the

148
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,400
number and it treats all rare and common

149
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,639
compounds as well one so it's is equally

150
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,879
weighted the next one is an abundance

151
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,560
Spas M diversity equation where then you

152
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:11,399
take into account the proportion of the

153
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,918
molecules across

154
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:17,038
samples this so I use Hill numbers when

155
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,799
the Q quotient equals two and this is

156
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:20,240
synonymous with the Simpson diversity

157
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,000
index but it gives you effective number

158
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,560
of compounds back instead of arbitary

159
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,639
index and this uh favors the common

160
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,399
comps but again it's sort of Laing

161
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,800
information so the next step is to add

162
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,519
information about the molecular

163
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,919
properties so using a tree based

164
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,399
molecular diversity

165
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:44,359
equation I use R's quadratic

166
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:46,758
entropy and so the H numbers is a

167
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,280
probability equation ENT equation it's

168
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:50,800
different in that fact and it also

169
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:53,119
incorporates a distance Matrix of a

170
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,280
mular property of my choosing so it can

171
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,038
be something like oxidation state or

172
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,638
mass that gives us an idea of maybe how

173
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:03,560
that molecule deaves in soil system so

174
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,519
just as ecologists want to know the

175
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,199
types of organisms there so you know a

176
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,560
gorilla and a lizard are very different

177
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,919
in an ecosystem and here say lipid and

178
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,800
organic acid might also equally

179
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:17,639
different we need to know the properties

180
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,639
when we're calculating

181
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,879
diversity I also use the terms Alpha

182
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:23,758
molecular diversity and beta molecular

183
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:25,560
diversity and I Define Alpha molecular

184
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,360
diversity as a diversity within one

185
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,959
sample and beta moleular diversity as a

186
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,520
diversity of cross sample cross

187
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,519
treatments

188
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:38,359
businesses so when I first started my

189
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,039
PhD I a lot of literature literature

190
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,439
review on what did we know about

191
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:45,000
molecular diversity in natural

192
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:46,598
ecosystems and really the only um field

193
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,319
of scientist that are working that were

194
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:52,199
working on quantifying this were Marine

195
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:54,360
scientists or aquatic systems um

196
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,598
specifically foring di Mar group has a

197
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,240
lot of work around this and it comes one

198
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:00,560
paper where they did try to

199
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,918
quantify uh diversity in a way that we

200
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,038
did and so this is a marine DM

201
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:08,000
incubation and so they did molecular

202
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:10,318
richness molecular abundance and then a

203
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
trade diversity equation where they use

204
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,199
the oxidation state of carbon and really

205
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,079
what they found is what we hypothesis

206
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,759
where there be this increase in

207
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:24,399
diversity initially but then over time

208
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:27,840
it um plat or declined and then there's

209
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:30,239
this anyway def in functional

210
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,759
diversity in their system so we wanted

211
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,200
to know so this is a a marine system

212
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:38,000
with continuous mixing and no minerals

213
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,000
and no plant roots and you know it's all

214
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,158
homogenous so what do we find these St

215
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,639
TR in a soil

216
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,519
system this really where we got to my

217
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,639
first chapter which is really do

218
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:52,159
ecosystem Properties or U microbial

219
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:54,399
decomposition affect molecular diversity

220
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:57,559
so this is really a step one improving

221
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,440
ground um does molecular diversity even

222
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:01,319
vary across landscape in these very

223
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,279
different

224
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:09,640
ecosystems and can we measure it too and

225
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:11,240
quantify it so I used soil samples from

226
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:13,559
six different

227
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,959
ecosystems that we did as a larger

228
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:20,559
collection effort with some posto in

229
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:22,559
johann's lab and I grouped these samples

230
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,679
by vegetation class so dominant

231
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,399
vegetation

232
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:29,679
class so and soil order they're

233
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,879
representative in in two different ways

234
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,919
and you can see from these photos that

235
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,958
they're very different for one another

236
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,919
and they

237
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,559
grouping I also took samples from the

238
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:41,479
litter layer down to the SE Horizon so

239
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:43,599
that I could use soil depth inter

240
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,240
propoxy for duration of decomposition we

241
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,800
know that organic matter found and the C

242
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,560
Horizons is generally older than that

243
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:52,759
found in the L layer or a Horizons this

244
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:55,518
is why we could use dep as a prop for

245
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:58,159
time and I hypothesize that because

246
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,000
micro orms are on really all the action

247
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,399
they're the one they're are going to

248
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,200
have a greater control on organic matter

249
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:05,200
molecular diversity than the plant

250
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,959
letter inputs themselves especially when

251
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,959
you get down to the SE

252
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:14,518
Horizon jumping right into the results

253
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,120
here I'm showing um hydrophilic and

254
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:20,440
hydrophobic compounds identified using

255
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,560
lcms on the Hy of colums and for this

256
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,640
project I actually use negative and

257
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:28,319
positive mode and either on water and

258
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:30,799
methanol extracts s about that and most

259
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,720
little thing about these um so this is

260
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:36,078
molecular richness and a molecular

261
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,839
diversity abundance whole numbers and

262
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:41,519
then dysfunctional or tra molecularity

263
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:44,200
equation in Chanel C and depth is on the

264
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:48,039
on the y axis you see that there's this

265
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,639
decline in this Alpha with uh soil depth

266
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:52,278
but the most noticeable decline really

267
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,039
is from this litter layer the litter

268
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:57,000
samples down to your first mineral a

269
00:10:55,039 --> 00:11:00,278
horizon I also want to point out this

270
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,278
very interesting Trend um in the

271
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:03,838
for the functional diversity with the

272
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:06,439
hydrophobic compounds I going tuck that

273
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,040
away for another chapter but there's

274
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,519
this in this initial increase and

275
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:14,240
decrease with dep

276
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:16,278
there so if I separate these out by

277
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,560
ecosystem and I'm just showing molecular

278
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:19,799
richness you can see that generally

279
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,559
there's always going to be this decrease

280
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:24,399
in richness from the litter layer down

281
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:26,599
to the a horizon but there's variation

282
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,519
once you get to the mineral Horizons and

283
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,040
of course there are a lot of different

284
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:33,440
properties that soil have that could

285
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:35,360
cause this and for example the and the

286
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,320
grass a large increase from the B

287
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,560
Horizon to the Horizon and that holds

288
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,600
true for the hydrophobic compound as

289
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,919
well and so we thought you know this

290
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,519
must be some sort of environmental

291
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,240
variable or so property and so I did a

292
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,560
whole bunch of regressions with all the

293
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,600
other properties that we had measured

294
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:57,439
such as um soil texture Sandell clay

295
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,800
hydroxy attractable oxides iron aluminum

296
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,760
magines um carbon concentrations

297
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:05,599
nitrogen concentrations watering

298
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:07,399
capacity we actually found no consistent

299
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,000
and um significant relationships between

300
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,278
any of these properties in our molecular

301
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,519
diversity

302
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:18,000
indices however we did not measure any

303
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,000
microbial information for this

304
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,240
project so I thought okay if there is

305
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:23,559
this decrease in molecular diversity and

306
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,720
richness with

307
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:29,198
Deb then are all of those compounds that

308
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,399
are accumulating the seiz in the same

309
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:33,319
microbial

310
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,198
products they must be similar across

311
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,000
ecosystems so to try to answer that

312
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:38,639
question I did an upset plot analysis

313
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,320
and these plots look a little bit more

314
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,720
complicated than they really are so I'll

315
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,120
walk you through uh the different panels

316
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,639
so there's a letter a and b so all the

317
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,159
compounds are separated by

318
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,000
Horizon then I bin them into basically

319
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:55,000
two different categories one is does

320
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,440
that compound occur in all the compounds

321
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,120
denoted by these black dots or is it

322
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,120
only in one individual e

323
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,720
so the intersection size is the number

324
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,560
of compounds and then the ecosystems are

325
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,519
also have the number of compounds that

326
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:14,319
are within that individual ecosystem for

327
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:16,159
that horizon or layer next to and

328
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,199
they're all colored by compation so for

329
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,198
the litter layer there are 471 compound

330
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:25,439
layers that were shared across all

331
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:27,159
50 and then by the time you get to uh so

332
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,680
the T SES is our next one here it has

333
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:32,319
only 40 unique compounds

334
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,399
and the litter layer for

335
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,000
the

336
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,720
that's most notable finding from these

337
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
is that by the time you go from the

338
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,639
litter layer to a horizon there's

339
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,078
already a 65% reduction in shared

340
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:50,720
compound and then once you get to the

341
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:53,799
Horizon there's only 75% or there's a

342
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,120
75% loss of shared compounds so the L

343
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:59,399
layer really shares four times the

344
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,320
number of compounds as the subsoil

345
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,240
and in this way so we're losing richness

346
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,079
but we're actually increasing the

347
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,079
similarity across

348
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:13,559
ecosystems this is further displayed by

349
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:17,159
a nonmetric conventional scaling plot

350
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:19,518
just ordinating the uh hydrophilic

351
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:21,319
compounds and you can see that the liter

352
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,959
layer here these dark green symbols

353
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,639
cluster together really closely whereas

354
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:29,439
all the mineral samples kind of mismatch

355
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,639
over one another and in fact the

356
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:37,160
ecosystem P did explain 10% of the

357
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:37,159
variance but Horizon explain 21% of that

358
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:43,799
clustering further dri Point home about

359
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:48,639
the similarity in the sub soils cross

360
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:48,639
ecosystems um the N

361
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:57,079
aak the average break index by Horizon

362
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,759
each ecosystem and you can just see that

363
00:14:57,078 --> 00:15:02,278
there are more yellows and oranges OCC

364
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,759
the horiz that just more of the

365
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:04,759
similarity

366
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:14,000
across so to summarize this chapter and

367
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:16,039
really this is a the title pad line of

368
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,360
this paper that came out last summer PN

369
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:22,198
is that decomposition decreases

370
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,199
molecular diversity and ecosystem

371
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:28,078
similarity in general we found a

372
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,480
decrease in alha diversity with depth an

373
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:32,120
increase

374
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,000
diversity with depth though so the

375
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,000
diversity AC cross ecosystems uh

376
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,039
increases and in general there are more

377
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,480
shared compounds in the litter layer

378
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:41,919
compared to the Sea Horizon meaning

379
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,240
there's probably more sight specific

380
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,159
compounds that microbes are making in

381
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,879
the subsoils compared to what's being

382
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:49,240
inputed by the the

383
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,639
litter so really this is a study about

384
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,680
molecular diversity across soil depth

385
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:57,680
for time and time of you know Millennia

386
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:59,958
long periods of time of

387
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:03,000
decomposition but really I wanted to

388
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:04,758
next now like okay what about true time

389
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,159
and and time that I can measure in the

390
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:09,199
lab and would we find similar Trends

391
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:11,639
over shorter periods of De competition

392
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:12,919
time you how long did it take to get to

393
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,720
these

394
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:17,198
Trends so my next chapter is essentially

395
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,920
that is how does molecular diversity

396
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:21,879
change over

397
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:23,399
time and can we identify the microbial

398
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:25,639
products or the diversity of those

399
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,879
products and how that contributes to

400
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:29,639
those changes and so to do this um I did

401
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:32,439
a very simple

402
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,079
I'm calling it a long-term time series

403
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,480
experiment but really it's relatively

404
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:40,599
short it's only 220 days PhD is only so

405
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,319
long and so I used one microbial

406
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,079
community and one plant litter type and

407
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:47,679
incubated that for 220 days and

408
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:50,039
destructively harvested um microcosms at

409
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,638
14 different time

410
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:57,039
points I then analyzed the de extract

411
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,959
with the ATR ftir and um to and then

412
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,879
from there selected seven time points

413
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:04,879
then analyze us lpms to quantifi molec

414
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:07,439
diversity so the more and then the next

415
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,199
layer is then how do I identify

416
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:14,319
microbial products to do this we um

417
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:17,759
wanted to try to use an isotope label of

418
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:19,480
o08 instead of a carbon substrate label

419
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:23,599
since there's some issues with using a

420
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:26,279
carbon uh labeled carbon we want use o o

421
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,558
is normally used by microbiologists um

422
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:30,558
to do stable isotope probing to identify

423
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:33,440
which microbes are actually present in a

424
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:35,480
community because all microbes use water

425
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,080
for the most part during their um

426
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,038
metabolism and respiration processes and

427
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,558
they generally take up the oat and add

428
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:44,759
it into their DNA and then you do the

429
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:46,839
see what prob figure's active in your

430
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:48,679
community we wanted to know okay well

431
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:52,399
can we then use it to know which

432
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:54,400
compounds the microbes are producing or

433
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,960
oxidizing um or maybe they're in putting

434
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:01,400
some necromass that has this O8 in it

435
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,640
and we uh submitted a proposal to msil

436
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:07,759
and got an msil exploratory research

437
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:09,919
Grant to explore this and try it um so

438
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,679
we I chose two different time points day

439
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,038
six and day 59 to then take a subset of

440
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:18,360
sample from the me uh

441
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:21,759
microcosms and added either natural

442
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:23,759
bonus water or 08 or biotic and a biotic

443
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:27,400
so it you know Parks out which compounds

444
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:29,558
are actually being uh produced with the

445
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,919
O and then we did

446
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:33,399
uh water methanol formal extraction but

447
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,080
I'm going to only be going over the

448
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:39,840
water extraction results today with for

449
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:42,839
transform ions resonance Mass

450
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,959
spectometry primarily and again I

451
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:48,279
hypothesize that because of micro are

452
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,840
the ones you know not only are they

453
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:52,079
transforming the organic matter by

454
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:54,879
cleaving all the different plant litter

455
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:57,359
compounds and you know oxidizing hyding

456
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,080
fermenting everything they're so they're

457
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:02,279
making all these different metabolites

458
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:04,599
enzymes product organic so the more

459
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:08,279
active a microbial population is the

460
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:08,279
more diversity of compounds you will

461
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:14,240
have so these are the results from the

462
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:16,558
lcms uh long-term time series

463
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,960
experiment

464
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:22,759
and sorry what we can see is that these

465
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,440
Trends actually are very similar to M

466
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:26,279
profile Trends where duration of

467
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:30,000
decomposition is on the xais up until

468
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:31,558
202 days U panel a is molecular richness

469
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,960
the number of compounds we have our

470
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:37,359
abundance diversity H

471
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:40,640
numbers and you see these large deines

472
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:42,519
and richness and diversity in the

473
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,480
beginning of the

474
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:48,798
decomposition for this project I use a

475
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,798
multivariate molecular trait diversity

476
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:53,359
equation where I use the nominal

477
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:55,759
oxidation state of carbon oxygen and

478
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:59,959
carbon ratios hydrogen and carbon ratios

479
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:03,319
number of nitrogen uh atoms and Mass all

480
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,200
in one equation to try to get this whole

481
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:07,279
mole

482
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,279
picture and what we found is that

483
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,079
there's actually instead of an initial

484
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,519
decrease there's initial increase in

485
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:17,240
molecular trait diversity so diversity

486
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:20,119
of uh molecular properties is increasing

487
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,720
initially as microbes are decomposing

488
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:23,879
the

489
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,919
lit I'm a big fan of Breakers

490
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:29,640
dissimilarity indices so this is showing

491
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:31,679
again the dissimilarity across time

492
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,440
points and the most notable thing and

493
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,640
you can see it here is that you have

494
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,400
these larger differences from day 28 to

495
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,080
32 so bigger changes in the in the index

496
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,280
bigger changes in color and by the time

497
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:44,079
you get to day 60 this is really a flat

498
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:48,079
toil there's not much change happening

499
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:48,079
see that with the Curve as

500
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:55,759
well so

501
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,400
the can't tell if that color is bad um

502
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:58,960
the

503
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,519
O8 results from the FTR if you're

504
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,038
familiar with ftss you're familiar with

505
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:07,240
these van prevalent

506
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:10,000
plots these plots have oxygen carbon

507
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,519
ratios on the X AIS and hydrogen carbon

508
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,919
ratios on the y axis these are um

509
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:18,200
Elemental not mass

510
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:23,240
ratios I'm showing

511
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:25,880
the so the top um left plot is the O

512
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,839
isly enriched compounds from J seven and

513
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,200
then on the right is the are the non

514
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:32,319
isotopically enriched and then the

515
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,600
bottom two panels are

516
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:37,278
60 these PL each point is an individual

517
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,000
Peak identified with mass spec and then

518
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:41,558
the coloration of that beak is the

519
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,480
relative abundance across

520
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:47,519
samples often with uh V prevalence you

521
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,558
use some sort of bridge sort of

522
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,879
uh try to understand the properties of

523
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:54,359
that molecule and

524
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,480
here there's some different zones so

525
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:57,519
this one is more these compounds are

526
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,120
more aliphatic these would be more

527
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:04,200
aromatic mid aromatic you know low mid

528
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:06,678
High oxygen

529
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,640
regions to the right these are just

530
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:11,679
calculated bar plot of the molecular

531
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:15,799
richness of comparing the enriched to

532
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:18,840
the non-enriched for day seven and day

533
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:22,480
60 and then also Hill number diversity

534
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:22,480
and then our molecular trait divers

535
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:28,679
multivision okay complicated your kind

536
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:31,240
of explain so the most important thing

537
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:33,840
you take from this figure well not most

538
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,079
important but the uh most obvious one is

539
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:39,319
that the non-rich pool had many more

540
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:41,678
compounds than the enriched pool and I

541
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:43,439
should note that the the compounds that

542
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,159
these enriched ones they were incubated

543
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,759
for 24 hours so this is a snapshot of

544
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:48,880
what microbes are producing within a

545
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:50,480
24-hour time frame at these two

546
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,880
different

547
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,400
heades but non andrich are more Rich

548
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,360
more

549
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,960
diverse not that surprising they're just

550
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,639
kind of the background

551
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,880
but if you look at the the molecular

552
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,799
trait diversity there's actually equal

553
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,799
trait diversity when you're considering

554
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:09,679
these Peak and these at the early time

555
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:11,839
point so even though they differ in

556
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,159
number they the trade diversity is just

557
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:18,599
as

558
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:20,000
large however by 60 there's a um decline

559
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:22,119
in trade diversity you can see that

560
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
there's some loss of these

561
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:29,399
aliphatics uh well ala Regent seem to be

562
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,839
lost but the overall

563
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:36,919
tra diversity between day7 and B 60 does

564
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:40,439
not differ and if we go back to our our

565
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:43,360
time series uh plot these two time

566
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,480
points are essentially the same as uh

567
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,038
these on the longer scale and so it's

568
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,319
kind of like we're we're picking up on

569
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:52,798
maybe the shoulders of trait

570
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:54,319
diversity for day seven and day 160 we

571
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,639
kind of missed that initial Peak for the

572
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,079
overall

573
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,799
background or also that there maybe

574
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:03,038
there's a lag where the microorganism

575
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:04,278
Community starts making uh fewer and

576
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:06,200
fewer diverse

577
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:08,480
compounds and then it takes a little

578
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,960
while for that to be shown in your

579
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,960
overall

580
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:17,000
C okay also looking at what compounds

581
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:19,480
are being produced and consumed over

582
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,159
these two time points day7 day 60 this

583
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,079
is just a heat map of the different

584
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:27,440
compounds identified with lcms for day 7

585
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:29,918
and day 60 this is adjacent to the O8

586
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,558
labeling experiment

587
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,559
the brighter colors mean they're more uh

588
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:36,639
abundant higher relative

589
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,440
abundance and so what we're seeing here

590
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,960
is that the the sugars and sugar

591
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,320
alcohols at day seven are occurring in

592
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,240
higher

593
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:47,439
bonuses and then at day 6 there are more

594
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,960
of these organic

595
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:53,320
acids meaning that perhaps microbes are

596
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:55,440
you know suing these carbohydrate from

597
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:57,240
the Fresh plant litter inputs and then

598
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,038
producing a whole bunch of organic

599
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,038
organic acids during their um

600
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,080
metabolism this is just sort of an

601
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:09,918
overall snapshot of what I think is

602
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:12,199
happening for this this chapter where as

603
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,080
you introduce microbes to plant

604
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:18,159
litter there's going to be this initial

605
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:19,720
de orance during rapid microbial growth

606
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,720
they're going to be consuming all these

607
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,759
different uh simple sugars but they're

608
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,079
producing a wider range of compounds so

609
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:31,359
this could be they're producing Amino

610
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:33,519
sugars organic acids IES um etc etc and

611
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:36,678
that's where you would get this increase

612
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:38,240
in molecular trait diers you're increase

613
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:40,600
in the different types of compounds that

614
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:44,079
you're finding in the full of organic

615
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:47,480
matter but with no new added plant

616
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:49,158
litter or you know substrates microbial

617
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,399
growth is going to end ultimately slow

618
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:51,799
down and then they're going to have to

619
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:53,719
start recycling some of their own

620
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:57,440
microbial product and that's where you

621
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:59,120
would get sort of this U Decline and

622
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,480
molecular treats everything comes back

623
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:05,798
down to Baseline and microbes then start

624
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,038
producing more more moleculars similar

625
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:10,759
compounds at this point may just all

626
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:10,759
micob

627
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:16,319
products so this was a study for one

628
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:18,918
plant letter type and one microbial

629
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,398
community and my next question is really

630
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:22,080
does this hold true for different plant

631
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:26,319
letter types in different microbial

632
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:28,639
communities and microbial

633
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:30,200
diversities so there is an aish

634
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,278
relationship between microbial and

635
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:36,640
molecular diversity and we've seen it

636
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:38,960
using uh thiser in 2022 that is

637
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,200
established across different

638
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,240
biomes and a relationship strength is is

639
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,319
varied across biomes but really I wanted

640
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,240
to know okay is this establish

641
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:50,639
relationship true in with different

642
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,200
plant litter

643
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:57,200
types and for different microbial

644
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:59,120
communities so this is my third chapter

645
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,519
type microbial community diversity

646
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:05,119
molecular diversity

647
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:08,119
of so to do this I uh used five

648
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:10,719
different plant litter types these are

649
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:12,879
from similar Samples used in my first

650
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,200
chapter and then from the same location

651
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,919
where I took the plant letter type I

652
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,840
took the a Horizons Minal a Horizons did

653
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:20,440
a soil wash to generate a microbial

654
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:24,720
community and

655
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:27,558
not so this paper really S L Type and

656
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,759
microbial Unity are synonymous not sort

657
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:30,759
of dis that

658
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:36,720
relationship so that's watch then I have

659
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,599
the high M diversity Community which is

660
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:43,200
you know 10 to zero my stock community

661
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:45,599
and then we did a Serial dilution of

662
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,319
those communities 10 to the minus 10 to

663
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:50,240
get this low microb diversity community

664
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:53,000
and I say we because my undergraduate

665
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,240
Caleb levit and I worked on this for

666
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,398
almost entire semester just getting

667
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:01,640
these communities together um

668
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:03,678
was a amazing okay so then the plant

669
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,799
litter that complimentary to that

670
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,759
microbial inoculum was inoculated with

671
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:12,359
either the high or the low microbial

672
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:14,480
Community incubated for 150 days and

673
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:16,359
then at the end of those that incubation

674
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,000
they were uh the DM was analyzed for

675
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:21,678
mole diversity using ltms again and the

676
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:29,240
microbial Community was analyzed using

677
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:32,240
16s r r sequency using the Alum platform

678
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,919
and I hypothesize that again it's more

679
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,960
about microG community structure than it

680
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:41,080
about where they came from but again

681
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,079
those two are are difficult to

682
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:48,960
um thankfully um these dilation

683
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:51,000
treatments had an effect on the endpoint

684
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,159
microbial community so these are the

685
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,038
results from the end of 150 days not the

686
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,760
starting point of the inoc inoculum but

687
00:28:56,038 --> 00:29:01,480
the end of the incubation for microbial

688
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:03,319
richness microbial diversity and

689
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,159
microbial phenetic

690
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:07,720
diversity and I am talking about

691
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:09,440
microbial diversity now and molecular

692
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,000
diversity so I'll try to help you keep

693
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,759
them

694
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,359
separate for microbial more this trait

695
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:18,398
diversity I'm using a microbial

696
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:20,519
phylogenetic diversity index using Rous

697
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:22,479
CTIC entropy again but for this I'm

698
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:25,440
using the genome size the number of base

699
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,880
pairs the average number of base pairs

700
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:32,159
per sample and this is try to get

701
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,640
um again an idea of that function of the

702
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,640
microbial community in the soils not

703
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,360
just who's there and how many of them

704
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:42,480
are there but what are they

705
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:45,918
doing so there's about a 40% loss in MO

706
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,319
uh microbial richness for for the

707
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,960
ecosystems and then a shrubs is just you

708
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:53,038
know a Death Valley sample it's very

709
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,240
unique and just kind of a Bugaboo but it

710
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:57,278
was not affected of richness but it did

711
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,480
uh portion of those individuals was

712
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:01,480
alter and then we have differences in

713
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,399
col andity as

714
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:08,000
well just ordinating the

715
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:10,959
communities um and by litter type and

716
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,759
treatment it's the PCA plot showing how

717
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,519
they cluster and showing that the litter

718
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:19,359
type

719
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:21,558
more explains the variance of the

720
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:23,119
clustering than the D treatment which

721
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:25,398
did have that but you can notice that

722
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:26,839
the Del treatment actually brought the

723
00:30:25,398 --> 00:30:29,959
micob communties closer together in

724
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:29,959
terms of composition

725
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,960
and if you're looking at the soil order

726
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:40,840
the composition the relative composition

727
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:42,679
would be generally this loss inalis and

728
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:45,359
areas L

729
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:46,960
but compositional um and there's

730
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:49,678
generally more

731
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,558
single I'm so sorry for

732
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,559
my new

733
00:30:53,839 --> 00:31:00,000
language starting a suite of um linear

734
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,960
regressions so here I'm plotting my

735
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,398
microbial diversity indices on the x

736
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,200
axis against my molecular diversity

737
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:09,518
indices on the Y

738
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:12,120
AIS so I have mobial richness molecular

739
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:16,519
richness have a significant relationship

740
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:19,158
here R 10 the microbial diversity using

741
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:21,720
Hill numbers isly related to the

742
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:24,320
molecular diversity with Hill numbers

743
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,960
and then actually genome size rather

744
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:29,638
than the diversity equation with genome

745
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,240
size was very strongly related to the

746
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:33,119
molecular trait diversity so there's

747
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:36,278
something

748
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:39,918
about uh micro the microbial community's

749
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:41,798
uh function that is related to trait

750
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,240
rather than just the number of micos

751
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:45,679
which is I think more often what people

752
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:49,759
think about is Rich microbial richness

753
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,759
is related to diversity in

754
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:56,558
general so to account for the dilution

755
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,399
treatment and the uh litter type

756
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:01,359
Community type

757
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:04,079
I did a multi-level correlation analysis

758
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:05,798
where it takes into account dilution and

759
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:08,000
going type as random effects into the

760
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:09,519
model and that just kind of proves the

761
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,240
point that genal size is the most

762
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,759
strongest predictor of molecular trait

763
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,079
diversity and even though this this

764
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:17,359
interesting Trend where richness is

765
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:20,918
related to richness and diversity

766
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:20,918
diversity still holds true but

767
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:24,599
weaker I noticed something else

768
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:28,039
different when when I was looking at

769
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:29,638
these these regressions is that the

770
00:32:28,038 --> 00:32:33,119
non-diluted communities actually appear

771
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:36,158
to have stronger relationships with each

772
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:39,278
other um

773
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:42,360
than with the mo

774
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:44,200
diversity then the diluted Community if

775
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:47,319
you look at molecular richness here on

776
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:49,600
the it actually is correlated to all of

777
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:52,839
the indices but this relationship with

778
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:55,599
molecular Origins is greatly

779
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:57,798
improved same for uh microb diversity

780
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:59,839
and molecular diversity and then

781
00:32:57,798 --> 00:33:03,398
similarly for genome size the r squ here

782
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:05,158
is 66 for molecular trait diversity so

783
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,678
there's something happening here that I

784
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:08,720
find very interesting and I don't know I

785
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:12,679
don't necessarily have the answer yet

786
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:15,679
about the disruption caused by my

787
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:17,960
artificial um dilution to try to get

788
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,679
this bigger range of diversity has

789
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,880
disrupted the microbial Community

790
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,720
functioning

791
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,799
somehow and it could be they're taking

792
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,120
out the you know members of the

793
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:30,879
community that are involved full

794
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:33,678
metabolism or thus like kind of the

795
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,600
whole chain disrupts but these are just

796
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,600
final usings but in general genome size

797
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:42,319
is still the best predictor of molecular

798
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:42,319
tra diversity for any of

799
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:52,918
diversity so I'm gonna wrap up a little

800
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,558
bit on this big question of does do

801
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:59,080
molec diversity influence organic matter

802
00:33:55,558 --> 00:34:01,480
mineralization R that's you know where I

803
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:04,439
started and I have not explained this

804
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,960
experiment yet uh but at the end of the

805
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:09,918
incubations for my second and my third

806
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:12,119
chapter I saved the Doom from those end

807
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:14,598
points when I sent it off for alus

808
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:16,760
analysis I held him back and then took

809
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:20,679
that DM and added it into a new

810
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:22,839
microcosm carbon normalized across each

811
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:25,119
microcosm uh which had you know clean

812
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:28,398
sand and then added one micr Community

813
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:31,000
to that microcosm and then measured

814
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:33,199
respiration over the next 10 days so

815
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,440
this is cumulative respiration on the Y

816
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:38,439
AIS and then either molecular richness

817
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:41,480
my molecular abundance diversity or

818
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:44,878
trait diversity on the X on the top

819
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:47,199
panels and then molecular properties on

820
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:49,358
the um bottom panel so the oxidation

821
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,199
state of carbon molecular weight or

822
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:52,598
degree of saturation which is a hydrogen

823
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,039
carbon

824
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:55,879
ratio and once together the two projects

825
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:57,920
they

826
00:34:55,878 --> 00:34:59,519
essentially The Experience were done in

827
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,079
the same

828
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:04,039
manner and overall what I found is some

829
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,920
some weak correlations that I don't

830
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:08,559
really believe in for molecular richness

831
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:13,358
and diversity which are just really

832
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:15,440
being pulled by some um a few handful of

833
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:16,639
samples but there actually does seem to

834
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,519
be some pretty good relationships

835
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:20,838
between molecular properties and the

836
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:24,320
respiration rates of that

837
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:26,639
D whereas with the oxidation state of

838
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,000
carbon imagine that as these values

839
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:31,279
become more positive

840
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,519
that compound is more oxidized therefore

841
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,440
more readily available to be used in

842
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,880
comparison to so more negative values

843
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,838
that are more a more reduced compound

844
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:43,440
which have higher energy yeld that are

845
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:45,000
more energy costly to use same principle

846
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,679
for molecular weight where the bigger

847
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,358
the compound is potentially the more

848
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:51,598
difficult is to be degraded but these

849
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:55,239
are these are average values for an

850
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:59,640
entire pool of carbon in a

851
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:59,639
sample so yeah

852
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:07,199
um so coming back to this feedback loop

853
00:36:03,318 --> 00:36:07,199
of decomposition and molecular

854
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:12,039
diversity and really what have I learned

855
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:15,720
about decomposition in Rel diversity

856
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:17,920
over the last six years overall

857
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:20,239
decomposition um in the short term

858
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,119
increases molecular trade diversity once

859
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:24,559
there's a fresh plant litter Supply

860
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:26,599
Rapid growth um and all these new

861
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:28,679
compounds are being made but over time

862
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:30,720
without any new

863
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:31,919
additions you ultimately get this

864
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:34,199
decrease in the number of different

865
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,960
compounds and trait diversity over time

866
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:38,679
if there's really no new food sources

867
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,960
during microbial

868
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:44,118
activity molecular diversity is

869
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,760
influenced by microbial diversity and

870
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:47,920
Community functioning

871
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,800
potentially and it's influenced by

872
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,838
litter type and the fact

873
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,880
that you know that could cause faster SL

874
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:57,838
of growth perhaps but liter type inputs

875
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,960
don't actually determine the end point

876
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:02,799
diversity of B so just because you know

877
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,960
lit a has a higher starting point

878
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,000
molecular diversity than lit B it

879
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,440
doesn't mean that L A after you know 200

880
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,280
days of decomposition is still going to

881
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:18,119
have a higher diversity than L

882
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:22,000
B has more to do with the the microbial

883
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:23,920
population and ultimately that microbial

884
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,119
molecular diversity May influence

885
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,280
organic carbon persistance but there are

886
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,880
truly some some big furtile to overcome

887
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,480
in terms of instrument capabilities and

888
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,640
some experimental barriers to really

889
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,960
getting at this question we're talking

890
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:39,598
about small molecules that we're trying

891
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:44,318
to identify all of them um and one pool

892
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,318
and quantify them it it's very

893
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,599
challenging all right that I just want

894
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:53,719
to say thank you and um want to thank of

895
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:56,160
course my committee members and all of

896
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:58,519
my collaborators or people that have

897
00:37:56,159 --> 00:38:02,318
helped me along the way let me use their

898
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:05,079
lab let me use their equipment um given

899
00:38:02,318 --> 00:38:07,279
me advice and then um my my funing

900
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:08,920
opportunity that I've had while I S here

901
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,079
and I just also want to shout out for

902
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:14,119
the sh noack small grant program that

903
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,359
has been you know I wouldn't have able

904
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:18,160
do this research really without that in

905
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:21,279
the beginning and the for Center grate

906
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:27,039
research grants also largely funded This

907
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:27,040
research and so that um any questions

908
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,760
that

909
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,960
right wait sorry can you repeat the the

910
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:13,760
question yeah my question is

911
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:16,760
that only measure moleular diversity of

912
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,760
or

913
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:23,480
is right right do you want essentially

914
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:25,000
is especially off of a fresh plant

915
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:28,159
litter anything that you measure is

916
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,760
already going to be like a d microbial

917
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:33,759
products because the atic decomposition

918
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,760
plant L is probably quite small and what

919
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,480
we're measuring is really all microbial

920
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:41,720
products from D is that what you're

921
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,719
getting at

922
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:48,820
[Music]

923
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,280
yeah yeah I

924
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:10,679
don't yeah we everything that we measure

925
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,920
so this is one of the challenges with

926
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:16,399
the lcms is everything that we measure

927
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:18,079
has to be filtered at 02 microns and

928
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,039
then the instrument itself actually only

929
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,160
measures between like 200 and a th000

930
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:24,800
dolins so everything below that is what

931
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:29,000
we're measuring we would have to sort of

932
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:31,200
do some sort of both analysis where then

933
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,079
you can quantify molecular diversity on

934
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:37,799
that and we did try diversity

935
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:40,760
calculations on Nexa Spectra or ftis FTI

936
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:43,760
Spectra but it's very

937
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,760
difficult

938
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,599
yeah

939
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,920
questions I had a question um at the

940
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:53,559
very beginning in uh in the depth

941
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,599
profiles um the sort of eyeball that

942
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:58,318
there is in the in the hydrophobic

943
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,599
compounds there's an increase in

944
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:03,719
uh functional

945
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:06,039
diversity can you speculate why we see

946
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:08,838
it there and not for the hydrophilic

947
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:12,400
compounds does that have anything to do

948
00:41:08,838 --> 00:41:17,039
with the analysis or production is that

949
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:19,280
a true ecological yeah or mixing or

950
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:21,480
movement or one thought about that is

951
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,040
that for the the hydrophilic they're

952
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,760
much I mean they're hydrophilic so

953
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:28,279
they're more polar and they can move

954
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:31,079
through the so profile probably better

955
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,839
but the hydrophobic ones are really more

956
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:35,160
in

957
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:39,318
place yeah they're sticky the minerals

958
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:43,598
and all that why we seeing that trend of

959
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:46,679
last longer with the hydrophobic

960
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,680
compound that

961
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,480
are back slides

962
00:41:54,838 --> 00:42:00,000
yes I just a little bit nerv

963
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:02,079
some little clueless here but when the

964
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,679
title says it's the big question and the

965
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:07,160
two experiments really occupy different

966
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:09,759
parts the

967
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:12,358
gra yeah

968
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,000
so so we so I did the experiment

969
00:42:12,358 --> 00:42:17,679
separately for each

970
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,599
project but when I analyze them

971
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:21,799
separately they have different Trends a

972
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,760
little bit which made me nervous about

973
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,800
making any declarative statements about

974
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,599
those Trend when they differ by project

975
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,599
so I wanted to lump them together and

976
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:33,480
see these are normalized by the amount

977
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:37,119
of carbon that was in the microcosms

978
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:39,559
too so yeah they they're different you

979
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:44,920
really draw a line through

980
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:47,760
like one there bottom bottom right I

981
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,760
know that just

982
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:54,240
wonder anyway just yeah this is more

983
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,599
just sort of amings on on the big

984
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:59,919
question and my best attempt to answer

985
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:02,318
the gain that I have

986
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,680
yeah there's so much that's fascina here

987
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:06,279
I'm sorry about listen this but you

988
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:08,879
mentioned something about thetion

989
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:11,480
disrupting function

990
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,720
something like how the microbial

991
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,679
diversity might be working

992
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:17,078
together yeah this is something I had to

993
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:18,558
consider when I was doing these zal

994
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:20,200
dilutions that I could just be

995
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:22,960
completely disrupting the function of

996
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:24,439
that Community through that process even

997
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,159
though it's already a disruptive process

998
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:30,838
to get to my stock Community the the

999
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:33,639
Next Step appear to really disrupt any

1000
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:35,558
relationships so I'm my thought process

1001
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:39,000
was we thinking about this after lab

1002
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:41,440
group meeting recently well if a whole

1003
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,199
Community every every individual has a

1004
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,119
role in producing a certain mcab or you

1005
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:47,838
know product that then this organism

1006
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:50,160
uses and then you know it's like that

1007
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:52,799
Chain Reaction they're all like working

1008
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:55,118
together say you take out some of those

1009
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,559
those species then you don't have the

1010
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,960
next person to eat that and then that

1011
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:03,960
was disrupting that Trend in terms of

1012
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:05,800
diversity of molecule

1013
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,440
diversity this where I couldn't quite

1014
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,280
see through but are you saying that you

1015
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,720
feel your observation support that idea

1016
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,720
that the community does have this sort

1017
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:16,519
of pass along collectivity it's possible

1018
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:20,279
I have to look into the data and look at

1019
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:23,838
more of the um Med faculties that are

1020
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:26,559
present like do that and see I'm losing

1021
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:29,039
certain Pathways that would then maybe

1022
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:29,040
be like

1023
00:44:29,318 --> 00:44:36,800
next it's my best my

1024
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:39,079
best five different systems or some nice

1025
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,400
number at the beginning in chapter one

1026
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:43,000
were they replicated like you really see

1027
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,400
that each one of them is somehow

1028
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,800
coherent microbial

1029
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,680
phology or is there sort of all sorts of

1030
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:56,200
variation within as much

1031
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:58,919
across for sorry Which chapter one yeah

1032
00:44:56,199 --> 00:45:01,679
um were the three replic sort of

1033
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,838
Representative they go together

1034
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:06,759
all yeah they there were definitely some

1035
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:08,719
variations within those triplicates

1036
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,400
because there like there's good

1037
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:12,239
difference between some of them but we

1038
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,838
tried to want them in the best way

1039
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:17,159
possible where the soil order was the

1040
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:20,119
same and the dominant vegetation type in

1041
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:23,440
general assignment so some of them were

1042
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:23,440
better they had lower

1043
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,960
variances had a lot more

1044
00:45:31,369 --> 00:45:34,460
[Music]

1045
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,280
in these samples there's not a way to

1046
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:51,039
distinguish between depth and time we

1047
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,280
didn't measure like c14 on any of them

1048
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:56,119
and that's also really difficult to do

1049
00:45:52,280 --> 00:46:00,720
on D anyway but um so it's really just

1050
00:45:56,119 --> 00:46:04,318
using de as a proxy for a time and and

1051
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:04,318
assuming that what's deeper is

1052
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:17,440
older potentially um you could

1053
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:20,078
use I mean in general think about the

1054
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,039
the the samp that are in the Northeast

1055
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,519
are going to be a lot younger than those

1056
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:27,159
in the Southeast so there's going to be

1057
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:30,159
an age discrepancy already

1058
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:33,480
that I know maybe used account

1059
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:33,480
for I have

1060
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:40,159
not that's

1061
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:48,358
yeah it um ripping off I guess what

1062
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:51,519
Rebecca was saying um do you think that

1063
00:46:48,358 --> 00:46:58,838
the dilution step maybe lowers genome

1064
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:58,838
size which would for the lower divers

1065
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,720
doesn't appear that the dation actually

1066
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:08,118
lowered the average genome size for the

1067
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:11,078
most part you have some oddballs out

1068
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:12,280
here which are driv in this relationship

1069
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:15,400
but

1070
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:16,400
they're kind of in the same range maybe

1071
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:20,800
slightly

1072
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:22,960
lower I'm not sure if it's St yeah what

1073
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,760
do best the Illusions do to the

1074
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,240
community and

1075
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:30,040
how right what does it mean that these

1076
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:34,959
are correlated with diversity of

1077
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:38,759
Mo yeah but it's obviously there's a

1078
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,760
difference somebody

1079
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,079
somebody we love to talk more about this

1080
00:47:41,239 --> 00:47:44,519
this is more of just like interesting

1081
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:46,640
finding where I thought I was creting

1082
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:47,800
like this perfect you know diversity

1083
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:53,879
grad

1084
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:58,400
micro the rations Community yeah yeah

1085
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,400
great thank you very much r
