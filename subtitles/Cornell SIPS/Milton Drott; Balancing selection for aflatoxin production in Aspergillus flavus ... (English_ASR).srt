1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,510
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,698 --> 00:00:08,129
University so I'll start by demystifying

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:09,599
the title a little bit I won't reread it

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,740
to you since Michael just read it but

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,929
essentially what this means is that

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,490
there are individuals of Aspergillus

7
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,469
fathers who produce aflatoxin and

8
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,820
individuals that do not and both are

9
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:19,349
maintained through evolutionary time

10
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,509
which means that producing alpha toxin

11
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:23,910
must confer a benefit to the fungus

12
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:28,259
sometimes and not producing the toxin

13
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,300
must confer benefit at other times so

14
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:31,259
I'm gonna just give you a little outline

15
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,230
I'm going to start with some background

16
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:35,369
on secondary metabolites in general

17
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:38,429
moving into background on Aspergillus

18
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:40,890
flavus and aflatoxins talk a little bit

19
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:43,109
about work we've done and looking at a

20
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,628
flautist population structure talk about

21
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:47,659
the hypotheses behind that we think

22
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:51,299
might be driving balancing selection and

23
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:55,890
spoiler alert it's we think it's insects

24
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:57,780
and soil microbes and then concluding so

25
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,539
secondary metabolites are generally

26
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,719
defined as just any compound that's not

27
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,849
required for growth and interestingly in

28
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,500
fungi there have been hugely diversified

29
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:09,269
and this is partially due to the

30
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,989
diversification of poly q tide

31
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:13,228
synthetases

32
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:18,359
and non-ribosomal peptide among peptides

33
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:19,828
impetuses most other things but just

34
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:21,509
because we know of all these compounds

35
00:01:19,828 --> 00:01:23,339
it doesn't mean that we know what they

36
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,409
do for the organisms that produce them

37
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,320
so for example here in magna portho

38
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,909
arise ii it was discovered that melanin

39
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,969
which we normally think of as a UV

40
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,159
protectant is also required in a purse

41
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:37,530
or 'ya for structural integrity so that

42
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,780
it can actually punch through plant

43
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,329
tissue so this to say even when we think

44
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,218
we know what compounds are for there may

45
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:48,179
be other functions or we may just be

46
00:01:44,218 --> 00:01:50,298
wrong so to start off with some things

47
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,490
that we have a sense of what they do

48
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:55,140
these are host specific toxins which

49
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:56,519
determine the host range so you can

50
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,430
imagine if it produces one of these

51
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,170
compounds then it's able to infect a new

52
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,180
host and that obviously confers a

53
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,539
fitness advantage to the fungus so it

54
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,730
would be selected for and with virulence

55
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:10,319
factors virulence is not the same thing

56
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,699
necessarily as Fitness you can have

57
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,400
increased virulence without increased

58
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:16,199
Fitness but in general it does

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,938
correlate some degree so again it

60
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,250
suggests that we have a sense of what

61
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:22,680
these compounds are doing they're

62
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,959
allowing the fungus to infect a new

63
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,829
plant or to better infect a plant and

64
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,680
thus reproduce more but in the case of d

65
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:33,810
axing de balón all which is also

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,430
classified as a micro toxin it's known

67
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:39,840
as vomitoxin endearingly it's again the

68
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,879
way that we find out about these

69
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,670
compounds is because they are toxic

70
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:46,169
so actually we heard a little bit about

71
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:48,509
last week so I had to throw it up there

72
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:50,608
but I got alkaloids even back in the

73
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:53,459
15th century when Bush did this painting

74
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:55,709
you can see that Saint Anthony's fire

75
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,209
was an issue long before we knew that

76
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,039
there were microbes causing these

77
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:00,329
diseases we knew about the compounds

78
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,949
well we knew about the diseases they

79
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:04,980
caused and we've gone on to learn about

80
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:07,530
that but this is all from a human

81
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:09,060
perspective instead of what it does for

82
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,139
the fungus that produces the compound

83
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:15,389
and that's of course important because

84
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:17,579
micro toxins contaminate 25% of the

85
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:21,060
world's food supplies and they cause

86
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:24,659
disease and stunting of growth and even

87
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:28,079
death but again well that's sad and

88
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:30,840
costly to the to everyone involved in

89
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:32,549
agriculture what I want to know is why

90
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,329
do the organisms that produce these

91
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:37,829
compounds produce them just to drive

92
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:39,150
home that we really don't know what

93
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:40,769
these compounds do so we think about

94
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,049
antibiotics antibiotics if you ask

95
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:46,949
anyone what why does a bacterium produce

96
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:48,629
antibiotics they'll say to kill bacteria

97
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:50,579
or fungus proves antibiotics to kill

98
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:52,408
bacteria and we know that they're

99
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:54,870
effective at killing bacteria in the lab

100
00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:57,719
and medical settings however in their

101
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,669
natural settings so like in soils the

102
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:02,219
levels of antibiotics are actually sub

103
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:03,900
inhibitory so the idea that they're

104
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:04,408
killing bacteria has kind of gone out

105
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,209
the window

106
00:04:04,408 --> 00:04:08,128
as far as antibiotics in their natural

107
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,650
environment instead people now believe

108
00:04:08,128 --> 00:04:15,239
that they're used for interest specific

109
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:17,250
communication in the soil environment so

110
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,048
this kind of brings home the idea that

111
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,478
we have to think about not what these

112
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:23,429
compounds are doing to us but what these

113
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,288
compounds are doing in the natural

114
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:28,230
environment at the concentrations and in

115
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:29,729
the context of the natural

116
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:35,189
ecology of the organisms that produce

117
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:39,390
them so now moving on to the star of the

118
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:43,079
show alpha toxin alpha toxin is an

119
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:44,939
incredibly important mycotoxin it is the

120
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:47,069
most carcinogenic naturally produced

121
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:48,300
compound which has been a great line for

122
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:51,990
my elevator speech when I'm talking

123
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:54,720
about my research it affects the p53

124
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,840
gene which regulates the cell cycle so

125
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,310
if it disrupts that then the cells

126
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:00,869
become aberrant and just grow out of

127
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,149
control it's especially associated with

128
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:06,209
liver cancer which is a particularly

129
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:11,009
nasty one as such is highly regulated by

130
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:13,500
the FDA in a bunch of crops including

131
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:18,449
maize cotton peanuts and a variety of

132
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,350
tree nuts today as you notice from the

133
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:20,879
title we're going to be looking at

134
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,350
Aspergillus flavus but is actually

135
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,600
produced a fluxes are produced by

136
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,560
several species closely related to

137
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,740
Aspergillus flavus

138
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:33,600
and here you can see estrogen alavés

139
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:35,009
growing on this ear of corn and you'll

140
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,629
notice that it's a yellowish green color

141
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:39,029
that's going to be important later I

142
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:41,759
want you to retain that and then this is

143
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:43,679
an infected kernel fluorescing a bright

144
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,750
blue so aflatoxin the one that we're

145
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,689
most interested is called b1 is it

146
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:51,209
fluoresce is blue so again the colonies

147
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:55,259
are a yellowish green it fluoresce is

148
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:57,659
blue and here we have Aspergillus flavus

149
00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:00,599
growing on a plate and we're hitting it

150
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:03,210
with UV light and it's illuminating the

151
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,980
red is just at overloading the system

152
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:06,569
but what you can see here is that

153
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,400
different isolates produce different

154
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:10,319
amounts so these two are not producing

155
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,089
any this one is producing these two are

156
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,800
producing a little he's reducing more

157
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:14,729
and these two are producing just a lot

158
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,610
of aflatoxin

159
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:20,910
and what this illustrates is that only

160
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:24,540
40 to 60% of Aspergillus flavus isolates

161
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:26,250
produce aflatoxin and that people have

162
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,960
looked at the genetic code so this

163
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,000
happens across the country forty to

164
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,739
sixty percent all over the place but

165
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,220
also if you look at the genetic code you

166
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,629
find evidence of balancing selection

167
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,000
which means that this is a persistent

168
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:41,009
polymorphism again it means that at some

169
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,129
point athletes producing alpha toxin

170
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:44,428
confers of

171
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:46,749
this advantage at some point not

172
00:06:44,428 --> 00:06:49,538
producing apple toxin confers a fitness

173
00:06:46,749 --> 00:06:52,569
advantage relative at least to the other

174
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:53,678
chemo type so this is we're really

175
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:55,179
interested in this balancing selection

176
00:06:53,678 --> 00:06:57,088
it's important to note that while

177
00:06:55,178 --> 00:06:59,458
balancing selection is rare for

178
00:06:57,088 --> 00:07:02,709
secondary metabolites as far as we know

179
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:05,408
it's not unique so track of species and

180
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:07,538
Fusarium Grumman arum are also under

181
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:09,938
balancing selection but even here this

182
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:11,438
is a little bit different so this

183
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:13,539
balancing selection is for different

184
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,959
chemical profiles as opposed to produce

185
00:07:13,538 --> 00:07:18,699
and not so this is kind of an

186
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:24,009
interesting system in addition to being

187
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:25,990
agriculturally important so my mantra

188
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:28,229
today or what are the ecological factors

189
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:31,240
that are driving balancing selection and

190
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:32,800
as I've been saying in order to get at

191
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:37,569
this question we have to look at the

192
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:39,309
natural ecology of the fungus so the

193
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:40,989
fungus the natural environment of the

194
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:43,509
fungus is typically considered soil

195
00:07:40,988 --> 00:07:46,718
where it produces Canadia four's that

196
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:48,399
disperse spores everywhere and I really

197
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:52,118
do mean everywhere it has a global

198
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:54,908
distribution and because of this spores

199
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:58,240
being distributed everywhere it can get

200
00:07:54,908 --> 00:08:00,188
into crops while they're in the field in

201
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,329
maize it infects the silk it grows

202
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:05,349
through the silk and then gets into the

203
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:07,749
kernels but it can also be a post

204
00:08:05,348 --> 00:08:12,428
harvest issue because it's just in the

205
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:14,499
air everywhere now if we're trying to

206
00:08:12,428 --> 00:08:16,748
understand what aflatoxin is doing for

207
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:18,849
it we might expect aflatoxins only to be

208
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:20,469
sequestered in the sclerotia as like

209
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:23,259
overwintering structures to protect them

210
00:08:20,468 --> 00:08:24,788
unfortunately we did not it didn't give

211
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:26,379
us any kind of sense of that is the

212
00:08:24,788 --> 00:08:28,628
aflatoxins are everywhere in it it's in

213
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:31,449
the mycelium it's in the Canadia it's in

214
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:32,769
the sclerotia and also it's not as

215
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:34,778
clear-cut as just being a virulence

216
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:37,000
factor it's not like those that produce

217
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:40,028
alpha toxin can infect a plant and those

218
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,979
that don't can't so

219
00:08:40,028 --> 00:08:43,838
no hints really on what aflatoxin is

220
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:46,480
doing but again is just to give some

221
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,569
background on what the natural ecology

222
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:53,889
is that we need to look at to understand

223
00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:55,778
what athletes bison is doing so if it's

224
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:57,129
not if you can't just tell

225
00:08:55,778 --> 00:08:58,509
what Athens doing by where it

226
00:08:57,129 --> 00:09:00,610
sequester's it in the fungus itself

227
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:03,039
maybe there's global distribution

228
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:06,339
patterns that can kind of start to help

229
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:09,159
but to help us understand now aflatoxin

230
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:12,610
has been known to be more common in hot

231
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:14,708
dry areas for a long time but it's a

232
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,568
little unclear if this has to do with

233
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:18,518
the stress on the plant so this plant

234
00:09:16,568 --> 00:09:19,568
gets stressed it's easier to infect you

235
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:23,009
wind up with more athlete oxygen

236
00:09:19,568 --> 00:09:26,049
contamination or if this is just a

237
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:30,220
phenomenon where higher hotter

238
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:32,969
temperatures at lower latitudes select

239
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:36,160
for athletic so genic while the cooler

240
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:39,699
latitudes select for non athletics genic

241
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,539
and so when looking at soil here man

242
00:09:39,698 --> 00:09:44,919
abhi

243
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:47,379
in 1978 showed that the black portion

244
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:49,240
here is athlete oxygen 'ok those that

245
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:51,039
produce aflatoxin as you can see he

246
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,889
showed that as you go farther and

247
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:56,169
farther south this portion is increasing

248
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:59,620
suggesting that at lower latitudes in

249
00:09:56,169 --> 00:10:05,979
hotter areas there's more selection for

250
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:10,179
aflatoxin production so we decided to

251
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,558
follow up on this because japan is far

252
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:17,438
away we decided to do it in the united

253
00:10:11,558 --> 00:10:20,078
states so we developed two transects so

254
00:10:17,438 --> 00:10:25,688
these are roughly of the same latitude

255
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:28,419
here across and so we did sampling at

256
00:10:25,688 --> 00:10:30,549
all of these locations with the help of

257
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:34,659
collaborators who scooped up soil and

258
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:38,169
sent it to us and then we isolated them

259
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:39,909
on soil dilutions plates so this is a

260
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:42,849
rose bengal plate and you can see the

261
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:45,068
yellowish green colonies here or

262
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,259
Aspergillus flavus coming up so we take

263
00:10:45,068 --> 00:10:50,849
the soil we put it onto a plate and then

264
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:53,139
we can isolate it with a single Canadian

265
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:56,259
also these plates are just really

266
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:58,839
cool-looking so what do we find what we

267
00:10:56,259 --> 00:11:04,629
find is we don't see the same pattern as

268
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:07,629
base on Japan forty years ago in the

269
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:09,060
eastern transect we don't see any real

270
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:10,980
pattern at all

271
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:13,409
it's there's a lower percentage of

272
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,990
aflatoxin producers goes higher it goes

273
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:18,120
lower if anything in the Western

274
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,139
transect it's going the opposite

275
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,409
direction where we're seeing more

276
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:24,299
aflatoxin producers towards the north

277
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:26,549
this to say there doesn't seem to really

278
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:29,039
be a clear pattern it's not as simple as

279
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:33,359
just in southern latitudes aflatoxin

280
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:38,639
production is favored so it's not

281
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:42,470
latitude than what Dan Jannsen who's an

282
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:45,259
evolutionary biologist currently at Penn

283
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:47,790
wrote a paper that suggested that

284
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:51,450
secondary metabolites in jenner general

285
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:54,000
and specifically aflatoxins may be an

286
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,890
agent of interference competition by

287
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,899
which you produce these chemicals into a

288
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:59,360
substrate and then you kind of claim the

289
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:01,980
substrate as yours

290
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,389
to consume because nobody else wants to

291
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,810
eat it because you've poisoned it

292
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:08,610
basically or interference can a

293
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:12,169
competition can also be that you the

294
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:14,759
compound just keeps down other species

295
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:18,088
so he specifically suggests that this

296
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:19,350
would be an agent of athletics one would

297
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:23,160
be an agent of interference competition

298
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:26,639
for insects and for soil microbes okay

299
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:29,969
so Dan Dan Jannsen suggested as an idea

300
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,069
let's follow this up with a real

301
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:34,050
hypothesis so we started off with the

302
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:36,990
hypothesis that aflatoxin production

303
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:39,059
confers an advantage to a flavius in the

304
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,080
presence of soil microbes again this

305
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:42,569
would be through interference

306
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,500
competition where production and soil

307
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:48,270
kind of carves out some resources for

308
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:51,480
Aspergillus flavus to grow and have

309
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:54,960
higher fitness and the flipside here is

310
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:57,269
that in the absence of these organisms

311
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,310
so in the absence of soil microbes or in

312
00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:02,129
the absence of insects we kind of assume

313
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:04,799
a cost so the production of aflatoxin

314
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:07,889
takes energy so we just kind of assume a

315
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:10,019
cost so this to say while we're doing

316
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:11,399
balancing selection we're just doing one

317
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:14,850
side of it with these hypothesis right

318
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,620
now I'll come back to that later so

319
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:19,139
we're starting with soil microbes in

320
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,330
order to look at soil microbes we need

321
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:22,889
some of the background aflatoxins are

322
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,989
produced in soil which is a

323
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:28,739
first step if you're hypothesizing that

324
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:31,470
they have a role there and aflatoxin

325
00:13:28,739 --> 00:13:33,739
contamination of soil is common both in

326
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:36,209
agriculture where farmers have to bury

327
00:13:33,739 --> 00:13:38,579
really contaminated crops and the

328
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:40,528
aflatoxins leach into the soil but also

329
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:42,358
just because detritus on the soil

330
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:44,730
surface can leach aflatoxins into the

331
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:46,379
soil so people have found aflatoxins

332
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,100
leaching into the soil and also produced

333
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:50,249
in the soil

334
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:53,819
now aflatoxin does have limited toxicity

335
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:57,540
to microbes but in some studies it does

336
00:13:53,818 --> 00:14:00,899
keep down some microbial communities and

337
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:03,088
interestingly bacillus and Aspergillus

338
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:05,308
flavus have this relationship where

339
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:07,309
bacillus produces compounds that are

340
00:14:05,308 --> 00:14:08,668
very inhibitory to Aspergillus and

341
00:14:07,308 --> 00:14:11,519
Aspergillus flavus

342
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:13,438
are produced apple toxin which has seems

343
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,489
to have the biggest effect on bacillus

344
00:14:13,438 --> 00:14:22,198
species specifically of the microbes

345
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:23,910
that people have tested okay so to look

346
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:25,409
at whether or not a Fatah and production

347
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:28,259
confers a benefit in the soil

348
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:31,139
environment we took a falcon tube and we

349
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:33,480
put soil in the bottom of it now this

350
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:35,610
soil was either autoclaved or not

351
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,619
autoclaved we also tried gamma or

352
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,149
radiating it and it didn't the fungus

353
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:40,980
didn't grow any differently and

354
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:44,339
gamma-irradiated so from autoclaves and

355
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:46,860
autoclaving is a little bit easier so we

356
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:48,929
went with that and then we either in

357
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,619
some experiments we added toxin or we

358
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:54,749
did not add toxin to the soil itself and

359
00:14:51,619 --> 00:14:57,389
that was both too sterile soil or non

360
00:14:54,749 --> 00:14:59,009
sterile soils then of course we have to

361
00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:01,379
add the fungus so we added a bunch of

362
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:05,188
isolates separately either nontoxigenic

363
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:08,009
or toxigenic isolates to these tubes

364
00:15:05,188 --> 00:15:11,639
under these conditions and then we would

365
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:13,499
extract the DNA and use qpcr to quantify

366
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:16,409
the amount of DNA that was present and

367
00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:19,109
so that's kind of a proxy for fitness so

368
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:20,879
the more DNA that's present the more

369
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:23,579
that it's growing the higher the fitness

370
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,399
and this will be important later my

371
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:28,108
graphs are going to say relative fitness

372
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:30,928
qPCR you quantify things relative to a

373
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:33,509
standard curve so relative fitness just

374
00:15:30,928 --> 00:15:35,338
means a measurement relative to a curve

375
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:36,480
on here there you can just think of them

376
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:38,630
as fitness

377
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,420
numbers but it'll say relative fitness

378
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:44,159
we also looked at HPLC to quantify the

379
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:46,860
aflatoxins make sure it was producing

380
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,299
under some of our conditions and make

381
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:52,169
sure that our addition of aflatoxin

382
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:54,059
stayed actually happened and then for a

383
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:56,909
subset of the samples we did amplicon

384
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:59,099
sequencing to look at the microbial

385
00:15:56,909 --> 00:16:01,379
communities and try to understand what

386
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,670
both the addition of aflatoxins and the

387
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:05,338
ability of the fungus to produce

388
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:10,500
aflatoxins what effect that had if any

389
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:12,180
on the microbial community so again to

390
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,730
show you this is what the microcosms

391
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:16,109
looked like so these are the falcon

392
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,759
tubes that I was talking about and this

393
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,589
is a close up inside so we added a

394
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,230
little bit of maize and here you can see

395
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:24,300
a maize bit with Aspergillus fathers

396
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:26,310
Canadia 4 is coming off of it this is

397
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:29,458
one of our non autoclaves so this would

398
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:32,759
be considered natural soil and you can

399
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:35,159
see here there's Penicillium species

400
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,110
coming up we often see a whole bunch of

401
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:40,649
different species that we haven't really

402
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:43,889
identified but i'll talk about some of

403
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:45,809
the composition in a minute so we did

404
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:47,698
this initially we looked at three

405
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:49,619
different temperatures so we had 25

406
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:52,250
natural and sterile 37 natural and

407
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:55,049
sterile and 42 natural and sterile and

408
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:57,929
what you immediately notice is that the

409
00:16:55,049 --> 00:17:01,979
42 is a stressful condition even under

410
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:08,730
the sterile condition the growth is way

411
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:09,959
down but at 37 and 25 the growth is more

412
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,630
or less the same these are not

413
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:15,328
significantly different these in sterile

414
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:17,250
are significantly different but we're

415
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:19,318
interested in the question of what does

416
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,429
aflatoxin do for it not it does it grow

417
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:22,168
differently in the sterile or at

418
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:23,370
different temperatures we just this was

419
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:24,780
initially what we were doing because we

420
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:25,588
didn't know we were going to find so

421
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:31,319
we're like let's look at all the

422
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:32,940
temperatures and what we find is that in

423
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:36,569
the natural soil we consistently see

424
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:39,090
that the non-athlete oxygenic have

425
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:43,529
higher fitness than the alpha toxigenic

426
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:45,689
so not producing aflatoxin seems to

427
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:47,279
confer a benefit here and this is only

428
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:50,370
in the natural soils if you look at the

429
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:52,428
sterile soils if there's no clear pad

430
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:55,829
here the non-athlete oxygenic has a

431
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:58,019
little bit higher media mean here it's

432
00:17:55,829 --> 00:18:01,710
the Alpha toxigenic here they're exactly

433
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:03,389
identical but across the natural soil is

434
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:06,390
there was a significant difference

435
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:10,038
between the non-athlete oxygenic and the

436
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:12,390
alpha toxigenic Fitness okay so this was

437
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:14,220
the opposite of what we expected we

438
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,140
expected aflatoxin to keep down other

439
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,620
soil microbes allowing it to colonize

440
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:21,870
more food and grow better so we didn't

441
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:23,189
believe this this is experiment one we

442
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:25,769
didn't really believe that this was a

443
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,240
real thing so we did it again and this

444
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:30,148
time we were like we're gonna hit it

445
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,649
with a ton of alpha toxin because that

446
00:18:30,148 --> 00:18:33,750
way we'll definitely see the effect that

447
00:18:31,648 --> 00:18:35,459
we were expecting so here we have a

448
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:38,130
different and independent set of

449
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,899
isolates grown again in natural and

450
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:42,480
sterile conditions natural and sterile

451
00:18:39,898 --> 00:18:45,269
this time with the addition of alpha

452
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:49,048
toxin in these two and no aflatoxin

453
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:51,808
added here and with this independent

454
00:18:49,048 --> 00:18:53,730
experiment that was at 37 so note that

455
00:18:51,808 --> 00:18:55,168
the best growth was at 37 so it was

456
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:58,409
easiest to work with the fungus at that

457
00:18:55,169 --> 00:19:01,020
temperature this is at 37 we see the

458
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:02,680
same pattern that a natural soil we see

459
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:04,250
a significant difference between

460
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,390
[Music]

461
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,909
non-athlete oxygenic and alpha toxigenic

462
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:11,220
isolates now it looks like the same

463
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:14,179
patterns here in sterile this difference

464
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:19,679
was not significant this difference was

465
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:22,080
so we were again surprised by this so we

466
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,419
decided to do it a third time

467
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,339
now what this graph is is it's the

468
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:28,049
37-degree from the first experiment so

469
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:33,168
you've already seen this data and the

470
00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:35,730
37-degree natural without toxin added

471
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:36,778
also adding the toxin as you can see

472
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:40,349
from the Phet the features of the same

473
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:42,119
had no effect at all all right so this

474
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:44,099
is from the previous graph and then we

475
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:46,229
did it a third time with another

476
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:49,798
independent set of isolates and we got

477
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:51,839
the same pattern and across all of these

478
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:53,788
we again see a significant difference

479
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,889
between athletics genetic and

480
00:19:53,788 --> 00:19:58,648
non-athletic so genetic isolates with

481
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:04,050
the non-athlete oxygenic isolates having

482
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:05,969
higher fitness so to summarize

483
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:08,490
genetic isolates have a fitness cost

484
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:13,440
instead of the hypothesized Fitness

485
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:14,880
benefit and this is seems to only occur

486
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,920
in natural soils at least we only got

487
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,160
significant differences in natural soils

488
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:24,779
and the addition of aflatoxin to the

489
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:26,430
soils had no effect at all so as we were

490
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:29,160
really surprised by this we had to ask

491
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:31,680
why is aflatoxin so costly to produce in

492
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:34,259
soils well the first piece of the puzzle

493
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,110
what we did was we added aflatoxin to

494
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:39,900
soils and then we measured it over time

495
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:42,240
and what you can see is that so here you

496
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:45,030
have the dotted lines are sterile soils

497
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,099
and the solid lines are non natural

498
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:48,960
soils at three different temperatures

499
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:51,899
and what you can see is even in the

500
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,380
dotted sterile conditions aflatoxins

501
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:57,060
degrade at a really high rate so it goes

502
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,210
from about 2,000 parts per million

503
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:02,429
athlete oxen in the soil to even a a

504
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:05,370
little over a thousand in just about

505
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:07,650
four days so this is degrading apple

506
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:08,969
toxin really quickly in fact we think

507
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,470
that this might be such quick

508
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,690
degradation that is difficult for the

509
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:14,759
fungus to produce enough toxin to keep

510
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:17,430
up with the rate at which it's degraded

511
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:19,410
in soil okay so this starts to paint a

512
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:22,470
picture of maybe why alpha toxin is not

513
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:25,380
a great thing not great for fitness in a

514
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:29,819
soil environment next we wanted to look

515
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:32,940
at the impact on microbial composition

516
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:34,230
so these are n MDS plots essentially I

517
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,750
don't want to get into it too much but

518
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:39,509
it's a multivariate analysis to look at

519
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:41,250
the community structure and what I want

520
00:21:39,509 --> 00:21:43,230
you to see here is that we have so we

521
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:45,690
have added toxin and then we have the

522
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:47,880
producing ability of the fungus so added

523
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:50,490
toxin circle's is no edit ox in

524
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:53,580
triangles is added toxin and then with

525
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:56,309
blue and green I forgot this so the

526
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:57,899
fungus is green but it produces a toxin

527
00:21:56,309 --> 00:22:00,119
that fluoresce is blue so throughout the

528
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,890
presentation when there's blue its

529
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:03,149
aflatoxin genic when it's green it's not

530
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:06,230
producing the toxin that fluoresce is

531
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:10,200
blue so it's not aflatoxin jenner so

532
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:11,880
Green is not producing it by itself blue

533
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,980
is and what you can see is that these

534
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,720
points are just all on top of each other

535
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,970
there's no clear pattern it's not like

536
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,829
you get the producers going

537
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:22,200
this way and the non producers going

538
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:23,970
over this way and again this is the

539
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,710
fungal community and the bacterial

540
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:29,160
community is even more so just

541
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:31,110
completely on top of each other so this

542
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:33,140
is kind of a visualization of the fact

543
00:22:31,109 --> 00:22:36,149
that we found no significant difference

544
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:38,190
either with the addition of Atholl toxin

545
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:41,160
or with the ability of to produce alpha

546
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:43,259
toxin of the fungus itself on bacterial

547
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:46,529
community or sorry on microbial

548
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:48,750
communities now remember we had that we

549
00:22:46,529 --> 00:22:52,289
had a specific idea that maybe bacillus

550
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:55,619
would be the answer to our questions of

551
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:57,750
why aflatoxin might confer a benefit

552
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:59,329
which it doesn't in soil and bear a

553
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:02,130
fireman so what this is is it's

554
00:22:59,329 --> 00:23:03,179
demonstrating the log to base twofold

555
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:07,080
chain so these are actually small

556
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:09,810
changes across all of the different

557
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:14,939
phyla of bacteria that we found and each

558
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:16,230
spot here is an OT u which for practical

559
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:21,779
purpose you can think of as a species

560
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:23,970
essentially so within each one of these

561
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:26,819
each dot represents a species of this

562
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:30,240
phylum and then how much it changed from

563
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:31,500
go its abundance from not having an

564
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,390
aflatoxin producer so a non-athlete

565
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,250
oxygen and iceland to having an

566
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:37,950
athlete's oxygen and isolate so how much

567
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:39,630
did it change in that what we find is

568
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:42,150
that here in the Firmicutes which is

569
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:46,550
where bacillus is there's no significant

570
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:51,210
difference between the prevalence of

571
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:52,799
bacillus in microcosms inoculated with a

572
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:56,309
father that produces alpha toxin and

573
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:59,399
those in non-athlete oxygenic microcosms

574
00:23:56,309 --> 00:24:01,950
in fact we didn't find any species

575
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,630
fungal or bacterial that changed

576
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:06,390
significantly between any of our

577
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:08,550
treatments so it really seems that after

578
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:10,410
the addition of alpha toxin and the

579
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:16,289
alpha toxin producing ability has very

580
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:18,210
little effect on soil microbes so again

581
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:21,509
we found instead of finding a Fitness

582
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:23,850
benefit to alpha toxin production we

583
00:24:21,509 --> 00:24:25,619
found a Fitness cost remember at the

584
00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:26,909
beginning I was saying for balancing

585
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:28,799
selection to be maintained

586
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:30,360
you need the non-athlete oxygen x to be

587
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,950
favored under some conditions and the

588
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:35,849
athlete oxygen X to be favored under

589
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:37,679
others so here we're creating an

590
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:40,168
environment in the soil when competing

591
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:43,639
with microbes we're not producing the

592
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:46,500
toxin confers a benefit essentially and

593
00:24:43,638 --> 00:24:48,778
this may be because alpha toxin doesn't

594
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:53,308
seem to have much effect in the soil

595
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:55,319
environment it doesn't it's degraded

596
00:24:53,308 --> 00:24:57,210
quickly as I showed you and it doesn't

597
00:24:55,319 --> 00:25:01,470
seem to change the microbial community

598
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:03,269
composition and so as I mentioned

599
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,589
earlier the most likely explanation for

600
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:06,480
this is that in the soil environment

601
00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:09,240
that is low in nutrients and they're

602
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,190
competing with other microbes the cost

603
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,190
the metabolic cost of producing

604
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:17,669
aflatoxin may result in a fitness loss

605
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:19,889
so this is the simplest explanation for

606
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:22,919
why this is happening why there'd be the

607
00:25:19,888 --> 00:25:28,408
benefit to the eye slits that don't

608
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:31,169
produce the toxin okay so our first

609
00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:32,880
hypothesis was about soil microbes we

610
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:36,750
did not find a benefit we found a cost

611
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:42,320
we decided to try again maybe it'll have

612
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:45,388
a benefit in the presence of insects so

613
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:48,148
insects have an own association with

614
00:25:45,388 --> 00:25:50,009
Aspergillus flavus when there's insect

615
00:25:48,148 --> 00:25:52,888
infestations in the field it creates

616
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:55,798
openings where Astralis clubs can get in

617
00:25:52,888 --> 00:25:59,158
and infect in the field also in stored

618
00:25:55,798 --> 00:26:01,440
grain environments it's known that the

619
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:03,210
that insects like maize weevils can

620
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,730
vector it it can go through their system

621
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:10,860
it can go come out in their Fras the

622
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:13,470
spores survive that is and so as a

623
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:15,629
result of this their insects are often

624
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:20,839
associated with increased athletics and

625
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:24,240
contamination and interestingly

626
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:27,089
aflatoxin is toxic to a large number of

627
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,579
invertebrates in vitro but none of these

628
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:32,369
studies that have added aflatoxins to

629
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:34,589
food have looked at what effect it has

630
00:26:32,369 --> 00:26:37,288
on fungal fitness so they've just been

631
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:40,648
poisoning insects and invertebrates and

632
00:26:37,288 --> 00:26:42,269
this photo to show you to kind of depict

633
00:26:40,648 --> 00:26:43,500
that anytime I go out for a walk in the

634
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:44,099
woods I always see some kind of

635
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,809
invertebrate

636
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:47,490
on a mushroom when I come across it

637
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:49,730
there seems to be a lot of this kind of

638
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:53,309
interaction where invertebrates are

639
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:55,769
trying to eat fungi so we decided to

640
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:57,929
look at whether or not alpha toxin

641
00:26:55,769 --> 00:27:00,690
production through interference

642
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:03,150
competition would allow it to claim the

643
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:08,190
resources that we give it better than

644
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:09,390
its non-athlete oxygenic counterparts so

645
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,250
similarly I'm going to start off with

646
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:12,930
telling you the methods here we use

647
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,250
little micro centrifuge tubes we put a

648
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:17,460
little bit of food in the bottom of it

649
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:21,089
that both Drosophila larvae and the

650
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:23,759
fungus could eat into the food we either

651
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:26,579
did or did not add aflatoxins similar to

652
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,829
the last time and then we added we did

653
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:30,539
or did not add larvae so to a single

654
00:27:28,829 --> 00:27:35,250
micro centrifuge tube we'd add up to

655
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:36,930
nine larvae then we either added an

656
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:39,119
a-star genacore namitha toxigenic

657
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:42,630
isolate very similar construction to the

658
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:45,569
last set of experiments and extracted

659
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:50,060
DNA using qPCR as proxy for fitness

660
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:52,139
again and HPLC to quantify alpha toxins

661
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:53,789
so give you a sense of what this it

662
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,820
looks like here's the micro centrifuge

663
00:27:53,789 --> 00:28:00,029
tube way zoomed in here's the food at

664
00:27:56,819 --> 00:28:02,069
the bottom and what you can see here the

665
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:05,000
green is the fungus as you will remember

666
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:07,019
and here on the sides are some

667
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,849
Drosophila larvae that have started to

668
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,980
pupate and then here in the middle this

669
00:28:08,849 --> 00:28:12,750
kind of white structure is a Drosophila

670
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,910
larvae that did not fare so well it

671
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:18,690
seems to have mostly died there didn't

672
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:21,360
make it to be patient so the first thing

673
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:24,299
that we need to figure out is is

674
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:27,990
aflatoxin toxic to our model organism so

675
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:32,099
over the course of 20 days we grew we

676
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:33,630
raised Drosophila larvae on food

677
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:36,599
containing increasing amounts of alpha

678
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:39,270
toxin content or aflatoxin and then we

679
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:40,859
looked at the number of Drosophila

680
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:44,400
larvae that Pugh pated and then the

681
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:47,000
number that emerged as adults and the

682
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,890
takeaway from this is yes as a photonic

683
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,240
entrer ssin increases the number that

684
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:53,460
pupate and the number that emerges as

685
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:57,000
adults goes way down so alpha toxin is

686
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:59,039
toxic to our model organism but again

687
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,759
this is just poisoning insects this

688
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,099
doesn't tell us

689
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,779
anything about the fungus and what we

690
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:06,500
want to know about whether or not this

691
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:08,910
confers a Fatah and confers an advantage

692
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:11,430
just to bring home that it's toxic here

693
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:13,710
are just awful larvae in our model

694
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:17,160
systems here and here and here you can

695
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:19,769
see the mouth parts but these black dots

696
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,779
in the middle are an immune response so

697
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:23,910
it's the melon ization that's either due

698
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:28,680
to a direct response to aflatoxin or

699
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:32,820
tissue damage caused by alpha toxin that

700
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:37,799
then elicits an immune response so it

701
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:40,439
really is toxic to our model organism in

702
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:41,940
case you were not convinced this is now

703
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,470
four days the last one was twenty days

704
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,350
which is why when we don't add the

705
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:49,890
fungus we see we don't see the drop-off

706
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:52,049
in number of living larvae so a number

707
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:53,730
of living larvae over alpha toxin

708
00:29:52,049 --> 00:29:56,129
concentrations before what we saw over

709
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:58,440
twenty days it dropped off dramatically

710
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:00,090
here in four days they survived there

711
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,130
you can tell in the tubes that they're

712
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:05,459
not as happy but they don't die within

713
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:06,990
that span of time unless the fungus is

714
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:09,420
present so here we inoculated

715
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:13,259
non-athlete oxygenic which is green and

716
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:15,480
aphid oxygenic blue and you can see that

717
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:18,359
without any added toxin to the food

718
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:22,500
there's a significant difference in how

719
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:24,359
many larvae survive the living in the

720
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,369
tube with the fungus with the alpha

721
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:28,589
toxigenic killing more of the larvae

722
00:30:26,369 --> 00:30:30,750
than the non matha toxigenic and as you

723
00:30:28,589 --> 00:30:33,619
might expect as you add aflatoxin to the

724
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:36,059
tube the benefit of alpha toxin

725
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:37,829
decreases and they become more similar

726
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:39,059
because now there's a photogs in both of

727
00:30:37,829 --> 00:30:41,699
these tubes where here there was no

728
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:44,549
aflatoxin at all before okay

729
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:46,890
so again this tells us nothing about our

730
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:51,210
main hypothesis this just shows that

731
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:53,370
when grown with the fungus larvae die so

732
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:55,529
if we got into the fungus here is the

733
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:58,079
fitness of the fungus as measured by

734
00:30:55,529 --> 00:31:01,529
qpcr over increasing alpha toxin

735
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:03,899
concentrations and we have tubes that

736
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:06,480
have larvae and tubes that do not have

737
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,580
larvae so the tubes that do not have

738
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,559
larvae seems to have no change in fact

739
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:12,750
there's no snow change statistically

740
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,589
across the increasing alpha toxin

741
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:16,200
concentrate

742
00:31:13,589 --> 00:31:20,359
so just adding alpha toxin to the tube

743
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:23,250
does not increase fitness of the fungus

744
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:25,619
however in the presence of larvae you

745
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:27,059
can see with the 9 larva competing with

746
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:30,929
the fungus it's there's a dramatic

747
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:33,329
reduction in fungal biomass compared to

748
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:36,570
no larvae and this is ameliorated and

749
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:40,289
becomes as the app toxin concentration

750
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:44,339
increases in fact these last two points

751
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:46,170
here at about 1.7 parts per million are

752
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:48,899
not significantly different whereas

753
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:51,600
these two are about 20 times different

754
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:54,960
so adding athlete's oxen to the medium

755
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:57,480
clearly increases fungal fitness however

756
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,940
we're interested in if the fungus is

757
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,610
production of alpha toxin can benefit it

758
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:04,380
and here the alpha toxigenic and

759
00:32:02,609 --> 00:32:06,029
non-athletic genetic isolates were not

760
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,650
significantly different you can even

761
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:10,440
kind of see that they're just on top of

762
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:12,960
each other throughout this experiment

763
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,990
and to kind of visualize what this

764
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,880
difference looks like here's a tube with

765
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:19,730
no added aflatoxin and you can see a

766
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,610
bunch of the white food shining through

767
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:25,620
here's 1.75 parts per million alpha

768
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:28,529
toxin added to the food and this lush

769
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:31,049
green yellow Matt is Aspergillus flavus

770
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:35,119
Canady ating all over the surface the

771
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:38,940
larvae have all died more or less so

772
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:41,369
before we were adding toxin to the tubes

773
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,500
we wanted to ask does the natural

774
00:32:41,369 --> 00:32:48,149
production by the fungus itself have an

775
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:49,890
effect so here we just did non-athlete

776
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:53,030
oxygenic and athletics genetic isolates

777
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:56,310
without alpha toxin added to the food

778
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:59,579
and what we see is no significant

779
00:32:56,309 --> 00:33:02,190
difference between their growth when no

780
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:05,129
larvae are present but in the presence

781
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:06,840
of larvae we do see a significant

782
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:08,670
difference with alpha toxin genic

783
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:11,849
isolates having slightly higher Fitness

784
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:13,590
than non-athletes oxygenic isolates this

785
00:33:11,849 --> 00:33:16,589
is a little bit shocking we went from

786
00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:20,429
having this kind of visualizable

787
00:33:16,589 --> 00:33:23,250
difference 20 fold difference just kind

788
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:25,769
of eking out a difference there and so

789
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:27,480
we had to ask why why is the difference

790
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:30,329
so small and what we have to

791
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,579
is that Aspergillus flavus doesn't just

792
00:33:30,329 --> 00:33:34,649
produce aflatoxin it also produces a

793
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:37,379
bunch of toxic compounds like kojic acid

794
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:38,940
cyclopia zonic acid and alpha trem all

795
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,460
of which are known to be toxic to

796
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,690
insects you have to remember that both

797
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,340
the non atha toxigenic

798
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:46,950
and alpha toxigenic isolates may be

799
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:48,720
producing these compounds as well also

800
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:51,569
the amount of aflatoxin that are

801
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,819
isolates produced varied a thousandfold

802
00:33:51,569 --> 00:33:56,609
from eight parts per billion to eight

803
00:33:53,819 --> 00:33:58,289
parts per million so caught up in this

804
00:33:56,609 --> 00:34:00,449
difference is a lot of the variation

805
00:33:58,289 --> 00:34:03,569
between isolates and what compounds

806
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:05,759
they're producing and even how much

807
00:34:03,569 --> 00:34:08,819
aflatoxin our alpha toxigenic isolates

808
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:11,369
are produced for context eight parts per

809
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:13,230
billion you could eat a corn that was

810
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:15,089
infected with that level in the u.s. not

811
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:18,780
in europe but in the u.s. that's

812
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:21,000
regulated at 20 parts per billion okay

813
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:24,150
so there is a significant effect a much

814
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,510
smaller effect on fitness of producing

815
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:33,570
aflatoxin of the fungus producing alpha

816
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:37,080
Sox in in the microcosms so what is

817
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:38,070
going on in these microcosms we we said

818
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:40,139
that this was an interference

819
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:42,150
competition hypothesis by which it would

820
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:43,710
claim resources and what I'm going to

821
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:45,869
show you here is there's a Drosophila

822
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:47,970
larvae here you can see its mouth parts

823
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:49,889
the little black parts there and up here

824
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:55,769
we have expert village committee of four

825
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:58,529
is coming off you can see that it

826
00:34:55,769 --> 00:35:06,300
reaches up to the Canadian for and bites

827
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:11,490
it I'm gonna play it twice more really

828
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:15,600
gets its back into it so what this tells

829
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:17,009
us is that this competition isn't just

830
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,529
competition there's also fun jewelry

831
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:22,380
going on so it might be an interference

832
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:26,430
competition a story but there might also

833
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:28,769
be an anti fun jibbery

834
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:30,359
story going on here we didn't wind up

835
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:32,250
separating those in fact we kind of

836
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,170
think that when the fungus is growing

837
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:35,849
through a substrate it might be

838
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:37,440
inextricable you can't you can't

839
00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:38,699
separate what's fun jibbery and what's

840
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,440
competition for resources because the

841
00:35:38,699 --> 00:35:43,769
fungus has grown through all the

842
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:46,559
source but what this does show us is

843
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:48,750
that there's a direct eating of the

844
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:52,130
fungus which got us interested in what

845
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:56,690
effect that might have on the fungus and

846
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:59,608
we were surprised to see that with

847
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:01,318
larvae present isolates produced on

848
00:35:59,608 --> 00:36:03,598
average so this is aflatoxin production

849
00:36:01,318 --> 00:36:06,000
no larvae added to the tubes larvae

850
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,619
added to the tubes and simulated damage

851
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,260
so what I did was I took a toothpick

852
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:13,680
twice a day for four days and stabbed

853
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:16,050
each tube 30 times to simulate the kind

854
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:17,549
of little mouth parts that Drosophila

855
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:20,430
larvae would be eating the fungus web

856
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:22,019
and so in with no larvae they produce a

857
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:24,210
baseline amount of mass collection with

858
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:26,280
a single larva piece if I added nine

859
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:27,720
larvae it decreased the biomass so much

860
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,420
that was really difficult to compare

861
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:33,029
between things with a single larva it

862
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,230
increases alpha toxin and when I stab it

863
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:38,519
with the toothpick it really does not

864
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:41,699
like that and what this shows us is that

865
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:44,068
this is consistent with an induced

866
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:45,750
resistance response that it's no it

867
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:47,818
knows that it's being eaten so it

868
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:50,400
produces half toxins to defend itself

869
00:36:47,818 --> 00:36:52,559
now it's important to note that because

870
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,519
it also does this just when I stab it

871
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:55,440
with a toothpick just when it's

872
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:57,269
physically damaged not only when the

873
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,280
larvae does it it's not clear that this

874
00:36:57,269 --> 00:37:01,230
is necessarily an evolved adaptive

875
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,140
response this could just be that when I

876
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:05,608
damage it it releases oxidative stress

877
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:08,759
oxidative stress is known to increase

878
00:37:05,608 --> 00:37:10,469
alpha toxin production and so this could

879
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,430
just be that when you damage it it

880
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:13,739
produces more alpha toxin

881
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:19,799
not that it's an evolved relationship

882
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:21,659
between the two okay so to summarize as

883
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:25,500
we started out with a Patuxent is toxic

884
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:27,328
to our model organisms aflatoxin when

885
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,670
added to the medium dramatically

886
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:30,539
increases alpha toxin the fitness of

887
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,550
Aspergillus flavus

888
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:34,679
but this is true for both talks and

889
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,060
nontox it just shows us that increases

890
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:39,838
fungal fitness in the presence of

891
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:41,549
insects but not in their absence and

892
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,559
then we showed that the production of

893
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:46,200
alpha toxin by the fungus itself with us

894
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:47,699
without us adding it also increases

895
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:48,960
fungal fitness but if you recall it was

896
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:51,199
just a little bit it wasn't nearly as

897
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,199
much

898
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:56,019
and then finally the graph that I was

899
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:57,579
just showing you aflatoxin production is

900
00:37:56,018 --> 00:37:58,808
increased when fungus is physically

901
00:37:57,579 --> 00:38:03,900
damaged consistent with an induced

902
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:05,829
resistance response so with insects

903
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,989
balancing selection could also be

904
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:09,789
maintained by the variability and how

905
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:11,650
susceptible insects are to it

906
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:14,650
so we tried similar experiments with

907
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:16,930
maize weevils and they were resistant to

908
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:18,699
alpha toxin up to 40 times the

909
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:19,989
concentration we used for Drosophila so

910
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:22,150
we just gave up at some point they just

911
00:38:19,989 --> 00:38:24,278
they didn't care so you can imagine if

912
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:28,449
you're producing aflatoxin and there's a

913
00:38:24,278 --> 00:38:29,438
resistant insect it might not confer the

914
00:38:28,449 --> 00:38:32,259
benefit that it does if there's a

915
00:38:29,438 --> 00:38:34,298
susceptible one and although we were

916
00:38:32,259 --> 00:38:35,739
unable to show a fitness cost in the

917
00:38:34,298 --> 00:38:38,380
second experiment we think that has to

918
00:38:35,739 --> 00:38:40,688
do with the nutrient richness of the

919
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:42,519
medium rather than that there isn't a

920
00:38:40,688 --> 00:38:43,528
cost to it so we saw it in the soils but

921
00:38:42,518 --> 00:38:45,909
not here

922
00:38:43,528 --> 00:38:48,309
so what does this mean for balancing

923
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:50,489
selection overall so if you have a piece

924
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:54,369
of organic matter on the soil surface

925
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:55,630
fungus comes the non-athletic so genic

926
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:57,759
isolates will do better so non-athletic

927
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:59,769
so genic are favored when competing with

928
00:38:57,759 --> 00:39:01,239
soil microbes for resources when

929
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:03,088
competing with insects however the

930
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:06,568
production of aflatoxin benefits and

931
00:39:03,088 --> 00:39:08,949
aflatoxin genic individuals are favored

932
00:39:06,568 --> 00:39:12,308
when you have everything going on all at

933
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:16,389
once we have no idea it really depends

934
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:18,959
on how strong these factors are in the

935
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:21,338
field and so this does not preclude

936
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:23,708
áthis oxen from having other functions

937
00:39:21,338 --> 00:39:25,478
in other systems and it needs to be

938
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:27,489
field tested so that's what I mean by we

939
00:39:25,478 --> 00:39:29,169
don't know what the strength relative

940
00:39:27,489 --> 00:39:30,909
strength of these factors are so if

941
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:35,318
there's both insects and soil microbes

942
00:39:30,909 --> 00:39:38,219
present what's going on and we've

943
00:39:35,318 --> 00:39:40,420
emphasized the potential for insects to

944
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:42,849
insect control to be good for alpha

945
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:45,309
toxin reductions because while it was

946
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:47,890
known that insects vectored Aspergillus

947
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:49,390
flavus before it was not known that they

948
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:51,338
could actually increase the amount of

949
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:54,458
toxin that as individual would produce

950
00:39:51,338 --> 00:39:57,159
and most importantly for our questions

951
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:59,469
this presents a conceptual framework

952
00:39:57,159 --> 00:40:01,588
that could explain what maintains

953
00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:05,528
balancing selection for athletics and

954
00:40:01,588 --> 00:40:05,980
production in Asheboro swallows and with

955
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,139
that

956
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,670
I'd like to thank all the people who

957
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:11,980
helped us collect soil with him we

958
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:14,710
couldn't have gotten the isolates my

959
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:19,000
committee members Brian Lazaro and Eric

960
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:20,800
Nelson funding from USD a free and my

961
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:51,789
lab members and other collaborators on

962
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:53,740
these projects and with that I would so

963
00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:56,889
the question was what are the molecular

964
00:40:53,739 --> 00:40:58,569
underpinnings of being able to produce

965
00:40:56,889 --> 00:41:00,250
alpha toxin who are not being able to

966
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:03,580
produce aflatoxin and what effect that

967
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:09,730
might have so baphu toxin gene cluster

968
00:41:03,579 --> 00:41:11,650
is composed of 25 genes and the way is

969
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:14,170
that non-athlete oxygen acai so let's be

970
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:15,670
calm non-athletic genic varies a lot

971
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:18,250
there's some consistency but it can go

972
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:20,019
from a single nucleotide polymorphism to

973
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:22,300
missing the entire cluster and just

974
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:24,820
about everything in between as to what

975
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:27,310
effect missing having many of the genes

976
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,470
versus missing the whole cluster has on

977
00:41:27,309 --> 00:41:31,630
fitness we don't know we just we've just

978
00:41:29,469 --> 00:41:33,579
found out that producing the toxin

979
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,960
versus not has this effect is a little

980
00:41:33,579 --> 00:41:37,150
unclear if there's a difference between

981
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:44,470
retaining some of the genes or not in

982
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:46,539
the cluster and two strains that are

983
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:55,059
genetically different one can produce

984
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:58,269
and one cannot so none of these

985
00:41:55,059 --> 00:42:02,019
experiments were was oh sorry the

986
00:41:58,269 --> 00:42:04,630
question was if we're comparing one ask

987
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:06,519
toxigenic and one non-athletic one atha

988
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:08,140
toxigenic one non-athletic genic how do

989
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:10,809
we get at the diversity that might

990
00:42:08,139 --> 00:42:15,759
underpin differences between the two

991
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:16,779
groups in the field and so the answer to

992
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,800
that is that we've so we've sampled

993
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:20,450
field isolates and

994
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,690
these experiments we've used more than

995
00:42:20,449 --> 00:42:26,659
one isolate so each experiment I think

996
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:31,010
had a minimum of four or five of each

997
00:42:26,659 --> 00:42:32,210
type of isolate in it so we hope with

998
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:41,260
that that we've captured some of the

999
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:45,289
diversity and seen that much more stable

1000
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:50,710
in the food substrate it is in soil even

1001
00:42:45,289 --> 00:42:50,710
sterile so do you have any explanation

1002
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:59,079
so the question was why might aflatoxin

1003
00:42:54,769 --> 00:43:01,519
be more stable in food than in soil and

1004
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:04,279
I don't have a great answer for that

1005
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:05,929
soils or soils a really nasty place I

1006
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,700
mean it's known that humic acids and

1007
00:43:05,929 --> 00:43:09,649
things and all of the compounds that are

1008
00:43:07,699 --> 00:43:11,989
present in soils they get really

1009
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:13,789
difficult for compounds to persist there

1010
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:20,959
but I don't know specifically what could

1011
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:22,099
be happening compared to in foods well

1012
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:31,869
could be but it was even in the sterile

1013
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:34,400
soils so you have to exercise special

1014
00:43:31,869 --> 00:43:41,929
techniques to protect yourself and

1015
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:43,490
others in the lab yeah we followed we

1016
00:43:41,929 --> 00:43:45,559
use a biosafety cabinet when working

1017
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:47,389
with the fungus we use gloves the real

1018
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:50,559
issue with atha toxin is when it's

1019
00:43:47,389 --> 00:43:53,359
ingested so I was able to refrain from

1020
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:54,949
eating any contaminated substances but

1021
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,019
but we still were careful with it

1022
00:43:54,949 --> 00:43:59,299
working with it in biosafety cabinet and

1023
00:43:57,019 --> 00:44:05,059
using gloves whenever use being pure

1024
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:08,360
alpha toxin somebody did maybe it was

1025
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:22,039
Cornell I don't get you nested they've

1026
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:25,480
been all over us to come in contact with

1027
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:27,679
specialists would have evolved some

1028
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,579
resistance compared to the Drosophila

1029
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:30,579
larvae or anything just

1030
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:36,280
so it was it was the the maize weevil

1031
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:38,920
but yeah so the question is might

1032
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:40,710
insects as that are more likely to

1033
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,298
interact with estrogens in the field

1034
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:47,650
more likely to be resistant to athlete's

1035
00:44:43,298 --> 00:44:49,088
oxen and I wouldn't be surprised if that

1036
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:50,950
were the case there's a seems to be a

1037
00:44:49,088 --> 00:44:54,190
lot of variation in how susceptible they

1038
00:44:50,949 --> 00:44:57,730
are I know that the corn corn armyworm

1039
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:58,990
is susceptible to aflatoxin within the

1040
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:03,000
range that we were looking at with

1041
00:44:58,989 --> 00:45:03,000
Drosophila and there are a few other

1042
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:07,929
agriculturally relevant organisms that

1043
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:10,480
are susceptible as aflatoxin within the

1044
00:45:07,929 --> 00:45:13,118
range that we looked at but they haven't

1045
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:24,250
been done with the fungus there so we

1046
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:27,250
don't know yet this has been a

1047
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:31,500
production of Cornell University on the

1048
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:31,500
