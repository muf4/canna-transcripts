00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,080
you can all

20
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:19,759
right but it's cutting

21
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:21,478
out I don't hear anything in my

22
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,759

beautifully okay now it

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,478
appears so I don't have to hear any

26
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,000
background I can just go ahead it should

27
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:37,759
actually be quiet in the back

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,280
okay I do I

29
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,280

presentation no I have the welcome

31
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:06,560
okay it's loading I hope this takes

32
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:08,280
longer I mean I hope it doesn't take as

33
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,120
long as it did the other day Okay this

34
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:15,400
seems to be going

35
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,400
better I'm at 50%

36
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,360
now I don't usually get nervous for

37
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,280
talks like this anymore but there's so

38
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,560
much stuff that can happen for this not

39
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,759
to happen in its full fruition I just

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,239
hope I have a a better day today than

41
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:36,719
Bill bich had on Sunday

42
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,759
night so I'm waiting for the

43
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,759
presentation to pop up in front of me

44
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,598
here and then I can get started when I

45
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,599
see

46
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,719
it huh that's weird because on my

47
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,719
computer

48
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:57,719
but okay

49
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:08,120
all right Frank you want might want to

50
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,878
check your toggle button and make sure

51
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,039
that that's that little thing stays on

52
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,318
because apparently we're getting a

53
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:16,798
little bit of cutting

54
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:19,399
out

55
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:22,040
yep yeah I remember this was happening

56
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,680
to Anam the other day when we did our

57
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:27,598
practice okay I have talk in front of me

58
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:31,080
now I'm G let you go

59
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:34,280
okay off and i'mna let you

60
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,120
yeah okay Tom well we you have your time

61
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,759
on Sunday with us don't

62
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:43,120
you all right I did not see any

63
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:45,959
cranberry Growers but uh even if you

64
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,360
grow something else never assume that

65
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,519
you're not going to grow cranberries so

66
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:55,120
listen intently here I'm going to talk

67
00:03:51,519 --> 00:04:00,438
today about cranberry diseases

68
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,640
particularly the East Coast version

69
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:04,959
and of all of our diseases the most

70
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:09,759
important one that we have to deal with

71
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:11,840
is fruit rot now fruit rot consists of

72
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,919
two things field

73
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,120
rot before the berries are harvested and

74
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:22,360
storage rot after the berries go into

75
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:25,120
storage which doesn't impact you unless

76
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,520
you are a fresh fruit grower which for

77
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,120
us in Massachusetts is about 10% of our

78
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:34,758
harvested material

79
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,439
yeah I remember this uh had issues

80
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,960
advancing the other day in a timely

81
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,879
fashion

82
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:45,439
so we have to be patient this is a big

83
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,439
file and

84
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,680
uh

85
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,800
H it's going to be hard to get through

86
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,400
my talk in 30 minutes if this is what

87
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,800
it's going to take to advance each one

88
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,799
of these

89
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,639
slides come on here Frank hopefully it

90
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:06,240
might be getting better as it uh kind of

91
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:08,439
gets warmed up here and hopefully it'll

92
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,199
improve yeah of course I've pushed the

93
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:11,439
button four times which means it's

94
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,240
probably going to jump ahead to the

95
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:18,839
fourth slide when it finally comes on

96
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,840
so this is very

97
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:28,240
frustrating field rot is an issue every

98
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:30,959
year for cranberry Growers and it's a Hu

99
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,439
okay you guys are getting it before I

100
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,839
am and it sounds like it's it's

101
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:39,600
advancing to probably ahead of where

102
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:42,239
it's supposed to be early or but I still

103
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,240
have

104
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,080
uh yeah see this is this is strange

105
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:52,399
because I'm still on the first Slide the

106
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:55,719
fruit rot slide you guys are ahead of me

107
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:59,198
and it's hard for me talk until I have

108
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,600
the slide in front of me here all right

109
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,639
earli right well now I got to back

110
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,319
up but maybe I'll say the heck with

111
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,759
backing up because it's going to take

112
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:13,240
forever I just backed up

113
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,720
one so now we have to wait for me to go

114
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,240
back one so I'm never going to back up

115
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,720
and I'm never going to push this Arrow

116
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,759
more than once I'm just going to have to

117
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,280
be very patient

118
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:26,400
okay well at any rate I had a couple

119
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,799
slides that you're not going to see but

120
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:31,159
uh at any

121
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:34,759
rate the fruit rot that you get in the

122
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,439
field that goes to the Handler does not

123
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:38,000
include the berries that you can see

124
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:41,240
right here which is the are the ones

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,598
that are left behind on the bog that we

126
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,879
see as trash these are very small and

127
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:49,399
they never make it onto the truck these

128
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:53,038
are all fruit rot however although there

129
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:55,598
may be some fruit worm mixed in

130
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:58,719
there some of our rots can be readily

131
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:00,439
identifiable by symptoms this one that

132
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,479
you can see here is the one we call

133
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:07,719
Early rot and and typically what you'll

134
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:09,560
see for this one is concentric circles

135
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,080
on the barrier this is our first rot

136
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,959
that shows up in the field this is

137
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:17,279
caused by the fungus fos sticta these

138
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:20,478
are all fungal induced fruit rots end

139
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:23,598
rot you can see the symptoms on the KX

140
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:25,399
end of the the berry here I'm even

141
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:27,478
having issues with the pointer here but

142
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:29,198
there's the pointer you can see the rot

143
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:32,038
that's developing there on the Kix end

144
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:36,680
this is caused by the fungus fusic

145
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:40,878
these berries on the right here

146
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:43,240
these are ones caused by um rip rot

147
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,960
chopa I'm also having issues with the

148
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,478
pointer which doesn't seem to be working

149
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:51,758
here either uh healthy berries on the

150
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:54,240
left chopa is the causal agent here and

151
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,199
now I have to wait for the next slide

152
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,800
can up

153
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:03,520
here so again I have to be very patient

154
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,960
I'm sorry for interrupting but go here's

155
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:09,639
yeah okay if you um want to I'll raise

156
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:12,158
to pre uh host and you can um then we

157
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,800
can watch your cursor but you just have

158
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:16,839
to promise that you won't push any

159
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,960
buttons that uh change everything on me

160
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:20,239
and that way we can watch your cursor if

161
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,839
you would

162
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,120
like so why don't I do that I'll just

163
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:29,119
quick change your

164
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,120
status okay

165
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:38,559
and now we should be able to watch your

166
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,560
cursor okay well this one you

167
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,679
see this one you see is uh black rot

168
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,120
which turns the berries totally jet

169
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:49,879
black and the causal agent of this one

170
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:54,039
is a lantop

171
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:56,439
opsis again nothing is coming up in a

172
00:08:54,039 --> 00:09:01,240
very timely fashion here

173
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:03,120
so again patience is a virtue

174
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,720
I should have printed out these things

175
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,200
so I knew it was coming ahead of

176
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,440
time yeah I know you guys all seem to be

177
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,278
getting these before I do here which is

178
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,440
very frustrating I'm still looking at

179
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:19,000
black Rod

180
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,519
here and I know we had issues with

181
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,200
this okay now I have it this is

182
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,799
miscellaneous rot which means these are

183
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,720
berries that you can't readily identify

184
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:32,199
by a particular fungus these ones here

185
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,680
so in order to isolate and determine

186
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,920
what the causal agent is these berries

187
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:39,559
have to be in my hand so that I can

188
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:39,559
culture out

189
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:46,838
fungi

190
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:50,039
again waiting for gdau here I'm still

191
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:50,040
looking at miscellaneous

192
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,680
rot there's

193
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:59,039
obviously many issues that uh have to be

194
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:01,319
dealt with here I apologize Frank in the

195
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,319
future

196
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,040
what's going on because this is

197
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:13,399
not well this is F this has followed me

198
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,480
my whole life creation of new

199
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:19,039
problems at any

200
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,720
rate just because you have berries that

201
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,719
look like

202
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:27,759
here this is not a a fruit rot situation

203
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,958
these are berries that were scalded by

204
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,759
very quick Heat temperature changes

205
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,078
these are rotted berries on the left

206
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,600
here and you can tell they're rotted

207
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:39,439
berries because you can see all the

208
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,440
anthos essence around the area of rot so

209
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,680
this is how you can tell that you have

210
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,880
fruit rot because those scalded berries

211
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:49,599
will eventually look like this and if I

212
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:51,240
don't see them in the field right after

213
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,920
they've been scaled I can't tell the

214
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,919
difference between rot and

215
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:01,958
scal we have cultered as many as nine

216
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:04,360
different fungi out of one rotted Berry

217
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:06,479
and in some instances you'll have a

218
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,639
berry like this one here that has

219
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,920
absolutely no rod on it at all the one

220
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:14,600
on the

221
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:16,919
right we have a real disease complex for

222
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,000
fruit Rod as you can see there are 12

223
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:21,159
listed organisms here the ones that have

224
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,720
two

225
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:26,519
asterisks a fix to them are the ones

226
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,920
that are the most important for us in

227
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,799
Massachusetts and pretty much in New

228
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:32,360
Jersey

229
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:35,599
as well if you go to the Midwest in

230
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,839
Wisconsin and the Pacific Northwest in

231
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,920
Oregon Washington and British Columbia

232
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,920
they're very different situations out

233
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:45,479
there the fungus fos sticta can also

234
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:48,759
cause a a disease symptom we call

235
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:52,360
Blossom blast you can actually see some

236
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:56,399
of the uh fruiting bodies of the

237
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:59,600
pathogen right here and right here as

238
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:03,000
well fruit rot management includes a

239
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,120
true integrated approach of many things

240
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,679
from the application of fungicides to

241
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,879
the using of flood waters uh keeping

242
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:14,759
good air circulations by pruning the

243
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:18,159
vines or sanding The Vines uh removal of

244
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:20,519
trash After the flood irrigating them

245
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:24,198
properly and using cultivars that are

246
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:25,919
less susceptible to fruit rot this is a

247
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:28,639
list of our fungicides that were

248
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:30,799
registered in this past growing season

249
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,879
you can see we have a wide range of

250
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:37,479
active ingredients that we can choose

251
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:38,439
from uh the best one of these by far is

252
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,680
the

253
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:44,240
chlorothalonil group Bravo chloranil

254
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:46,278
Echo Equis although some of these other

255
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,240
ones are very good as

256
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:52,198
well our fungicides go on when the

257
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,639
cranberry blossoms go into bloom usually

258
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:57,359
our first application going on a 10%

259
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,799
Bloom followed in Massachusetts by two

260
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,800
subsequent applications they will use

261
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,719
one or two more in New Jersey because

262
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:05,838
they have a bigger issue of fruit rot in

263
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,759
New

264
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,399
Jersey in a conventional situation which

265
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:12,078
is one where they don't use a spring

266
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,039
reflood that I'll be talking about

267
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:18,319
shortly again the fungicides go on early

268
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:20,559
during Bloom to apply those fungicides

269
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,519
you must use the phenological plant

270
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:26,518
development don't go by just because you

271
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,120
applied your first application June 15th

272
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:29,919
last year that you should do the same

273
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,959
this year so some years were're two

274
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:35,439
weeks ahead some years we're two weeks

275
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,518
behind we have mostly protectant

276
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,920
fungicides but now we have some new

277
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,039
materials that do have Kickback activity

278
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:45,879
or systemic activity indor and

279
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:48,519
abound uh you need to determine whether

280
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:52,838
your fate of your fruit are going to be

281
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:54,679
processed or uh for fresh fruit your

282
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,880
Cult of ours will

283
00:13:54,679 --> 00:14:01,879
determine what you do Stevens being the

284
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:04,000
most resistant Ben leer being the most

285
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:05,919
susceptible you should never use any

286
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,759
Fungicide and this goes for you

287
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,240
blueberry Growers dealing with blueberry

288
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,320
diseases you should never use a

289
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,720
fungicide at less the registered rate

290
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,360
there's a good reason why that high rate

291
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,920
and low rate are there because we've

292
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,800
done the testing ahead of time if you

293
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:23,719
have a material like a Bravo that has

294
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:27,479
very good sticking agents you should not

295
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:29,519
add something to it to add presumably

296
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,800
better sticking ability because you'll

297
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,320
end up with

298
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:36,278
phytotoxicity for us slate water is a

299
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,040
particular management of water that we

300
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:44,278
use by floting from mid April until

301
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:46,679
miday by using this you can reduce your

302
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:48,759
number of applications to as few as one

303
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:51,719
applications during the current growing

304
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:54,039
season and subsequent years as well you

305
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,639
can use later

306
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:59,198
applications and uh the tricky thing is

307
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,198
when you use light water is that bloom

308
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,879
will be compressed into a a shorter time

309
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:06,879
period and your plants will be very

310
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:11,240
susceptible to frost coming out of that

311
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:13,198
flood trash piles you'll see bog side

312
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,159
and these trash piles are a tremendous

313
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:16,240
source of

314
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,679
inoculum as you can see the fruiting

315
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,000
bodies on this one leaf and the fuing

316
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:23,198
bodies on this one Berry that are

317
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,799
sitting right in that trash pile these

318
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,599
are pathogenic fungi that are

319
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:30,000
overwintering here as far as the

320
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,600
irrigation goes you should never water

321
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,078
at night going into the long evening

322
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:38,360
where the water film will sit on the

323
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:41,120
plants for 12 to 14 hours water in the

324
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,318
early morning this goes if you have uh

325
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,000
any kind of plants you should irrigate

326
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:47,799
in the early morning to minimize the

327
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,399
optimal conditions for

328
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:53,078
infection we do have some cultivars that

329
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,679
do have some field rot resistance as you

330
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:57,439
can see

331
00:15:54,679 --> 00:16:00,919
here we also have ones that have good

332
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,360
storage rot resistance

333
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:05,879
we have some new cultivars available to

334
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,480
Growers coming out of the Rutter

335
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:11,159
breeding program and the Wisconsin

336
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,720
breeding Pro program and we're still

337
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:16,078
trying to assess the susceptibility and

338
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,839
resistance of these particular cultiv

339
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,599
ours to fruit rot and we're getting a

340
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:22,319
pretty good idea so far what their

341
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,600
situation

342
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:28,958
is now some of these fruit rot pathogens

343
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,480
can also cause leaf spot in newly

344
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:34,078
planted beds this seems to be an

345
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,519
increasing problem and you can see the

346
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:37,039
the fungus that's probably the most

347
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,519
important is the one at the top there

348
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:46,679
fos sticta altho katrum seems to be a a

349
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:49,799
big problem issue causing organism as

350
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:52,120
well here is a situation where we have a

351
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:54,679
leaf spot and you can see the Fring

352
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,278
bodies on this particular

353
00:16:54,679 --> 00:17:00,519
Leaf right

354
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:03,519
there these are simp symptoms of the

355
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:05,759
fungus fos sticta again you can see the

356
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,038
Fring bodies on the leaves and how it

357
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:11,439
can sign significantly defoliate the

358
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:13,078
plants if the infection is severe in

359
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,759
fact with this fungus we're now even

360
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:19,759
seeing stem caners on some of the stems

361
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:22,838
because some of our new cultivars are

362
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:25,119
particularly susceptible to fos

363
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:26,958
sticta all right leaving fruit rot

364
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,918
behind and what I'd like to do is is

365
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,279
leave questions to the end so can keep

366
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,360
moving

367
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:38,678
here our next disease of importance for

368
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:39,918
us is phy root rot it's the same phyo

369
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:41,880
that affects

370
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,000
blueberries this is what it does in a

371
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,160
cranberry bed and you can see how much

372
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,919
death of the vines are occurring you can

373
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,400
also see how poor the drainage is in

374
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,640
this particular area here's an aerial

375
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,480
shot showing you the significant areas

376
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:01,679
of this disease that can occur in a

377
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:06,200
particular bed it's nothing to scoff

378
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,280
at using my pointer I will show you

379
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,360
where

380
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:12,918
the

381
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:16,479
new areas of the disease are

382
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:20,799
occurring get it early is the key again

383
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,519
you can see the areas of poor drainage

384
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:23,558
and the areas of dieback in this

385
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,879
particular

386
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:29,000
bog these are some artificially

387
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,720
inoculated plants that we did years

388
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,480
years ago here's a a healthy plant and

389
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,440
here's a phyo infected plant you can see

390
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,679
what it does to the root systems and

391
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,440
that's why the the top of the plants

392
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:43,840
turn red and will eventually

393
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,919
die here's healthy Roots you can see

394
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:49,000
they're typically yellow here's phyto

395
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:52,520
infected plants which are typically an

396
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,720
olivaceous color very rly identifiable

397
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:58,079
if you take these roots here and you put

398
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,600
them on culture media within 48 to 72

399
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:03,879
hours we have the fungus phyto camomi we

400
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,639
can do a very quick diagnosis and we can

401
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,919
do this with blueberries as well we did

402
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,600
some earlier this

403
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,360
summer this is the

404
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:16,279
sporangium filled with sporangia spores

405
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:18,079
that will spread the fungus around it

406
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:21,119
can readily spread in

407
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:23,720
water these are the causal agents phyto

408
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:26,239
camomi is the most important one but we

409
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:29,159
will find these two other species of

410
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:32,000
phyo present

411
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:34,960
manag and fight tother root rot is again

412
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,599
a truly integrated disease you can see a

413
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,558
lot of things need to be done the low

414
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:43,639
spots need to be improved drainage wise

415
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:46,639
you can assist this by sanding those

416
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:50,038
areas fertilizing the peripheral

417
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:53,080
plants um using some resistant cultivars

418
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:56,480
fungicides are very important and

419
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:58,279
preventing the spread of these this is

420
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,480
the one that you need to do first and

421
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:02,079
foremost most and in many cases if you

422
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,200
do this one you don't need to do any of

423
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,960
the

424
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,240
rest here are some means of improving

425
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,079
the drainage you can see the area of

426
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,558
phyo there and how they improve the

427
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:15,798
drainage digging the ditches out

428
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:18,200
maintaining good drainage is another

429
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:21,639
important means of controlling this

430
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:24,798
disease sanding applying sand to the

431
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,360
affected area as you can see here it's

432
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:29,200
nice when these things advance on a

433
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:32,158
timely fashion uh these are peripheral

434
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,120
plants that were originally red and with

435
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,880
careful fertilizing they have greened up

436
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:38,158
nicely and are now moving back into the

437
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,600
area of dead

438
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:44,360
Vines rimil and alet are our two most

439
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:48,038
utilized fungicides they're the same

440
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:50,558
ones that you can use for blueberry

441
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:53,000
phyto upright dieback boy it really

442
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:56,440
helps if you get into a nice Rhythm here

443
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,919
I'm just clicking now upright dieback is

444
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,919
a disease that we will see every every

445
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:04,440
year in Massachusetts they also see in

446
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,559
New Jersey in Wisconsin and the Pacific

447
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,798
Northwest this is typically what you

448
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:11,678
will see and we will see some infections

449
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:14,879
that will affect 25 to 30% of the

450
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,360
uprights depending on the individual bed

451
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,679
you may have only vegetative uprights

452
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:22,359
affected on a 500 to1 basis versus the

453
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:24,759
fruiting uprights or you may see a one

454
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:26,558
to one situation where fruiting uprights

455
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:28,839
are getting clobbered just as badly as

456
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:32,759
the vegetative ones are here your

457
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:35,558
symptom right here going from the tip

458
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:39,879
downward on this one you can see every

459
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:43,000
single one of your uprights are

460
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:46,240
affected these are the causal agents of

461
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,480
upright dieback we've proven phomopsis

462
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,919
we've proven synchrono blastia we've

463
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,880
proven fusicoccum we think katrum is

464
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:58,720
also involved but phomopsis no question

465
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:01,240
this is the most important fungus

466
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,319
management of upright dieback includes

467
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,880
several things avoiding stress on the

468
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:09,558
plants managing fruit rot because those

469
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,320
organisms that were listed there not

470
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:14,119
only can they cause upright dieback they

471
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:16,960
can also cause fruit frot so they're

472
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:19,119
multer multifaceted

473
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,159
pathogens in Massachusetts and New

474
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:24,000
Jersey we're allowed to use a pre-bloom

475
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:27,880
application of Bravo or champ Bravo is

476
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,319
the better one and as any diseases avoid

477
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,480
excessive Vine growth because this

478
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:33,879
allows

479
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,839
for perfect conditions for fungal

480
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:40,440
infection to occur here's the stage that

481
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:44,918
you need to have of your Vines when you

482
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:48,558
apply the fungicide for upright dieback

483
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:50,799
management fairy ring is a disease that

484
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:53,678
we have in Massachusetts and New Jersey

485
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:56,240
only it's an East Coast disease and

486
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,120
here's your typical Rings right here in

487
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,480
fact this bog has rings all over the

488
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:03,000
place it's Stevens which is the most

489
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,278
susceptible cult

490
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,278
ofar here's a closeup of of another ring

491
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:11,960
that you can see right

492
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:14,119
here rings are typically found right on

493
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,120
the

494
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:19,798
ditches now we may actually change the

495
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,640
name of this disease to another disease

496
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:24,960
based on the finding that we we have a a

497
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,320
very unique

498
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,960
pathogen this one here we may end up

499
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:32,519
calling the disease viol root Rod

500
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,480
instead and we are still working out all

501
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:36,918
the details on the life cycle of this

502
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,679
thing it's very complicated life cycle

503
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:41,840
where it consists of a haid mop

504
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,919
parasitic stage and a diotic

505
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:45,278
phytoparasitic stage this is the one you

506
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,559
need to control right here on

507
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:51,480
Cranberries the phytoparasitic stage it

508
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:54,079
involves a lot of different organism

509
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:58,120
structures that the the fungus will

510
00:23:54,079 --> 00:24:00,158
produce uh management of this uh we're

511
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:03,119
still still working out the details on

512
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:06,880
this but again avoiding stress applying

513
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:09,519
a bound indar or fur bam but ferbam

514
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,679
comes later you can't apply ferbam until

515
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:16,400
after June 1st you can use these after

516
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:19,000
May 1st and watering these things these

517
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,519
uh indor and aound applications in

518
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,720
before and after application seem to

519
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,519
work the

520
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,159
best now we have some minor diseases

521
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:29,119
that we really don't have to deal with

522
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,679
and

523
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,558
so I listed them here and I'm going to

524
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,919
show you some pictures just to show you

525
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:38,798
what they look like and and that will

526
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:42,440
essentially wrap up the presentation

527
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:44,558
here so let's look at some typical

528
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,679
symptoms of these this is prot venturia

529
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:49,480
leaf spot we see this one every year in

530
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:51,679
Massachusetts your typically diagnostic

531
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:56,159
symptoms on the upper surface of the

532
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:58,640
leaves this is parabot leaf spot

533
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,360
another Leaf spotting fungus very

534
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,399
similar to Proto

535
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:07,278
venturia this is rose bloom which is one

536
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:10,038
of the three exobasidium caused diseases

537
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:12,480
that we have uh in the east coast we've

538
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:15,359
only seen this on Nantucket Island so

539
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,960
far this is more of a West Coast disease

540
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:19,879
but this is the typical flowery type of

541
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,840
overgrowth that you have on the second

542
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:26,720
year uh buds this is red leaf spot

543
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:28,398
caused by another species of exobasidium

544
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,720
we had quite a lot of this this year

545
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:34,839
year because the weather was so wet and

546
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:37,440
so cool and this is Red Chute disease a

547
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:39,959
typical Chute infected by this

548
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,840
particular species of exobasidium three

549
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,120
different species of exobasidium

550
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:48,439
involved uh know it is not the same

551
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:52,239
fungus that causes fairy ring and

552
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:55,240
turf this is cotton ball

553
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,599
disease you can see the the melium on

554
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:00,359
the inside of these berries I've seen

555
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:03,558
cotton ball one Berry in Massachusetts

556
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:05,639
in 25 growing Seasons so the fungus and

557
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:08,200
the disease are here but it's not an

558
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,600
issue for us like it is in Wisconsin and

559
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,440
in Washington and Oregon Wisconsin this

560
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:14,480
is their number one disease problem that

561
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,399
they usually have to deal with the

562
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,880
fungus is very closely related to The

563
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:21,959
Mummy Berry fungus and blueberry it has

564
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,320
a shotlight phase that you can see here

565
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,720
so the fungus will sporulate on this

566
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:29,079
material producing canidia and those

567
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,399
canidia infect the blossoms and result

568
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:33,398
in those berries that show the the

569
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:35,639
typical cotton ball symptoms in the

570
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:39,079
berries boy I wish these were advancing

571
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,360
like this early on and I hadn't lost my

572
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:43,678
patience so

573
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:45,199
much this is false Blossom disease which

574
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,080
is caused by a

575
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:51,038
phytoplasma which is vectored by the

576
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:53,278
bluntnose leaf Hopper it's a disease

577
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:55,000
that was rampant in the industry back in

578
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:59,519
the 20s and the

579
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:04,798
30s and consequently almost destroyed

580
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:07,639
the industry in New Jersey um it was

581
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:10,158
managed particularly well by eliminating

582
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,960
the the bluntnose leaf Hopper but the

583
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,360
fact of the matter is is this this

584
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:17,000
disease is still present in Wild

585
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:19,639
cranberry beds in both Massachusetts and

586
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,240
New Jersey and so it has not gone away

587
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,360
it is still around and you can see what

588
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,640
it does to the blossoms no fruit

589
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:28,959
produced this is one of our virus

590
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,559
diseases our few virus diseases this is

591
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,399
ring spot Red Ring spot probably the

592
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:35,398
same as we have in blueberries symptoms

593
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:39,119
on the

594
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:41,079
fruit it does not impact the yield from

595
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:45,239
everything that we've been able to

596
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:45,240
see these are the symptoms on the

597
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:50,519
leaves this is funky flow condition that

598
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,398
we again just have on the East Coast you

599
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:55,839
can see the symptom here we have an A

600
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:58,959
type and a b type and this is the uh

601
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:02,199
typical symptom of the a type in Mass to

602
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:06,360
chusetts here we can see normal blossoms

603
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:08,440
here funky a funky B and this is false

604
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:10,558
Blossom so we do have some virus

605
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,320
conditions to deal with uh these are

606
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:14,319
caused by a virus very similar to

607
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:17,200
cucumber mosaic

608
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:20,278
virus stem caner Gall is something that

609
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,200
we will see in Massachusetts some years

610
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:25,839
it uh is caused by the uh very closely

611
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,080
related bacterium to what causes Crown

612
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:31,519
Gall and we we hardly ever do see it and

613
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:34,319
it's Associated supposedly with winter

614
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:36,679
injury this symptom here is very typical

615
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:39,278
it looks like upright dieback in the

616
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:41,720
field and this seems to be more of a

617
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:42,798
problem in Wisconsin than it is in the

618
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,960
east

619
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:48,079
coast I must mention parasitic nematodes

620
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,880
because we do sometimes have very high

621
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:52,398
levels of this one in particular

622
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:55,000
hemicycle offer the sheath NE

623
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:57,839
nematode uh we don't have anybody doing

624
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,519
work on nematodes in cranberries except

625
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:03,000
for some spotty work on the west coast

626
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:05,038
at Oregon State and in British Columbia

627
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,440
they may be more of a problem than we

628
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:10,158
realize they are and may impact yields

629
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,240
in certain situations we have some

630
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,640
valuable sources of information that you

631
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,599
can learn more this is our cranberry

632
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,000
chart book that we put out of UMass here

633
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:23,359
every year we renew

634
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,159
it we are currently working on the

635
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:29,079
second edition of the compendium of

636
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:30,799
blueberry cranberry and lanberry disease

637
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:33,639
and we'll have it available to you

638
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:37,440
sometime next year it is going currently

639
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:40,159
going through the editor editorial

640
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,159
process we also have this book that

641
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,399
talks about cranberry production as it

642
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,880
is in Massachusetts but cranberry

643
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:50,119
production here is the same as it is

644
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:55,600
anywhere they grow cranberries in many

645
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:57,479
ways and now I have time for questions

646
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,678
any questions does anybody have any

647
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,960
questions for for Frank that was a great

648
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:05,840
job um we got through that

649
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,880
beautifully and uh certainly cranberries

650
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:09,678
are really fascinating I had the Good

651
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,159
Fortune to go on a tour this summer of a

652
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,240
cranberry bug and it was just really

653
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,960
really

654
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,440
interesting um I think we might have a

655
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,440
question

656
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:25,000
coming wellow was kind

657
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:26,480
of was kind of like uh Tom Brady the

658
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,119
beginning of the Season he couldn't hit

659
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,679
Randy mosson once he got a good Rhythm

660
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:34,798
he started hitting him time and time

661
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:34,798
again out of the question for cranberry

662
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:44,798
Growers Tom uh organic cranberry

663
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:47,600
production in the east in Massachusetts

664
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:50,480
and New Jersey is about as challenging

665
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:53,439
as you can find anywhere we do have

666
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,960
people doing it we do have people that

667
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,038
are doing it

668
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,759
successfully but it's a constant battle

669
00:30:58,038 --> 00:31:03,558
especially with insects and weeds and

670
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:05,679
with fruit rot so I won't say that you

671
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:07,798
can't do it but it has about every

672
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,080
challenge you could expect in the world

673
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:12,200
thrown at you all right do we um have

674
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,839
any additional comments before we move

675
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,840
to our next

676
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,278
presenter yeah believe me there's lots

677
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,880
of discussion on that one in New England

678
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:33,240
this week very very much for that um I'm

679
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,240
sorry we got off to a rocky

680
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,120
start so I should turn my turn your mic

681
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:41,038
off and I'm going to I should turn my

682
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:44,918
mic off now anim shoulder and change the

683
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:44,919
presentations here

684
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:10,320
um Dr schelder I should have asked you I

685
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:13,038
just turned on the shortened version and

686
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:15,439
perhaps that is not the one you wanted

687
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:18,759
and I I you had two versions The

688
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,759
shortened and the regular

689
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,320
one anim

690
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:31,638
make hi I think we can

691
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:35,360
the shortened version um Laura that is

692
00:32:31,638 --> 00:32:37,759
the one I just cut it back a little bit

693
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:40,918
because of the let introduce you to the

694
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:43,119
group um Dr Anna milder is a professor

695
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:46,120
of Plant Pathology with Michigan State

696
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:47,439
University in East blancing Michigan

697
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:49,158
where she works to develop

698
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,519
environmentally and economically

699
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:54,000
sustainable methods of Disease Control

700
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,440
in small fruit crops and today she's

701
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,398
going to be talking about to us

702
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,399
specifically about blueberry

703
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:06,880
viruses and anim you can go ahead um it

704
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,240
looks like some people might think

705
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,399
you're a little bit

706
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,359
loud um so I don't know if we should

707
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:18,359
change

708
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:18,359
here put it to medium volume

709
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:25,039
okay can you adjust to where it's

710
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:29,158
comfortable volume level yes that is

711
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:29,158
something that they could do

712
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,278
I think I think I would go ahead with

713
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:36,399
the volume that they're at and hopefully

714
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:39,720
they can adjust their own on their um

715
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:41,959
headsets or their own uh audio levels on

716
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,960
their

717
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:52,158
computer that sounds great well I put

718
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:55,638
myself to medium volume now that sounds

719
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:59,639
wonderful and I hope it's not too loud

720
00:33:55,638 --> 00:33:59,638
then perfect

721
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,840
okay so I'll get

722
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:07,839
started okay well thank you so much

723
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:11,918
Laura and Frank thanks for being the

724
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:11,918
guinea pig on this one I hope

725
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:17,759
mine afternoon

726
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:19,639
everyone uh do if you have any comments

727
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,679
yeah try to put them in the chat box so

728
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:24,960
I can see I will try to check that uh I

729
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:27,280
did notice that my presentation changed

730
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,878
a little bit so if the slides look well

731
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,040
to me they might look different from

732
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:32,598
what I put together and I'm not sure

733
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:36,878
what that that is about but I think

734
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:39,800
everything is there so today um I will

735
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:42,639
be talking about blueberry viruses um as

736
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:45,519
you know they have been more uh of a

737
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:48,559
problem lately and our Michigan

738
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:50,878
situation has been in the uh in the news

739
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:53,679
so that has been an interesting summer

740
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:56,239
and what I want to do is to give you an

741
00:34:53,679 --> 00:35:00,240
overview of the viruses that affect

742
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:02,279
blueberries um some of these are mostly

743
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,799
prevalent in Michigan and not in many

744
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,400
other places but I thought that you

745
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:09,440
should be aware of the symptoms just in

746
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:13,200
case um the symptoms show

747
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:16,838
up so uh let's see

748
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:19,039
aha first question is what is a virus a

749
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:21,440
virus is really quite different from

750
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:23,440
fungi and bacteria which is what you've

751
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,280
probably realize as people were talking

752
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,960
about the flu virus and how antibiotics

753
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:32,200
don't work against flu virus

754
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:35,838
so a virus is is really a very simple

755
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:38,039
pathogen it consists of DNA or RNA which

756
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:39,719
is genetic material surrounded by a

757
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:44,320
protective protein

758
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:46,118
code um I'll try to get the um the arrow

759
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,119
going

760
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:50,280
here

761
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:52,358
H the

762
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,640
pointer there we go so that's the

763
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:56,039
protein code and this would be the

764
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,960
genetic

765
00:35:56,039 --> 00:36:02,639
material uh they are dependent on their

766
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,159
host whether it's an animal or a a plant

767
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,440
for their

768
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:09,358
reproduction and the question sometimes

769
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:12,358
comes up is are they really alive or or

770
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:17,358
not but they are able to reproduce and

771
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:20,239
infect with the help of um their host

772
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:22,318
plants viruses are extremely small they

773
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:24,639
can only be viewed by an electr

774
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:26,559
microscope and if you look at this um

775
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:29,759
this picture next here these are virus

776
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:31,920
particles uh these would be magnified

777
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,400
100,000 times for you to see them and

778
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,599
they are present in plant sap and as

779
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,838
small as they are it's uh interesting

780
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:39,838
how much damage they can

781
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:47,759
cause so what happens when a virus gets

782
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:49,358
in it plants and so a virus and I've

783
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,640
drawn it as a little

784
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:54,679
vampire but um in reality of course it's

785
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:57,239
a it's a boring little particle but if

786
00:36:54,679 --> 00:37:00,078
it gets into the plant cell uh what

787
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:02,598
happens is it takes off its protein coat

788
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:05,960
and it hijacks the cell the cell

789
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:06,720
Machinery to make copies of itself so

790
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,318
the

791
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:12,000
cell uh will make copies of the virus

792
00:37:09,318 --> 00:37:15,000
particle and of the protein code it

793
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,679
reassembles um and then it gets out from

794
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,960
that cell and starts to spread

795
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:21,318
throughout the

796
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:23,199
plant so once it is in the plant uh it

797
00:37:21,318 --> 00:37:24,920
has to redistribute to every cell of

798
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:28,039
that plant and that could take a while

799
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:31,838
from several months maybe to a year but

800
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:31,838
the virus can also end up in the

801
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:41,559
roots viruses um do not have legs even

802
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,680
though that's what I drew but they don't

803
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:45,759
have a way to spread except for

804
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:49,239
vegetative propagation which is one of

805
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,960
the main ways in which viruses spread in

806
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:54,118
plants and that's a big big problem some

807
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,880
viruses will spread through seed as well

808
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:58,440
as

809
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:01,680
pollen uh some viruses need a FS or

810
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,880
other insects to spread them uh

811
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:06,318
basically the insect will suck up the

812
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,960
the sap of the plant virus particles are

813
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:09,719
in that and then it will spit it back

814
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:13,480
out into a healthy

815
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:16,159
plant um even mites and some nematodes

816
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:20,199
are involved in the spread of certain

817
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:22,799
viruses in general viruses have very

818
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:25,838
specific um relationships with their

819
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,920
vectors so it's not like any insect can

820
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:30,759
spread any virus it's it's quite

821
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,760
specific

822
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:36,440
situation so viruses can be hard to

823
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:38,480
control because once the plant is

824
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,760
infected it's infected for life and

825
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,199
there is no

826
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,920
cure uh they can be present in Woody

827
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:46,000
plants in a symptomless state for

828
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,559
several years before you know that

829
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,719
there's something wrong with that plant

830
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:52,759
and they can even spread when the plants

831
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:56,439
are symptomless and it's further

832
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:58,640
Complicated by the fact that some um

833
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,679
viruses remain symptomless in certain

834
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:03,078
plants but they still spread and then

835
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:05,199
when they get to a cultivar for instance

836
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:08,119
that's highly susceptible or will show

837
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:11,279
the symptoms then you get a problem so

838
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:13,599
they're pretty tricky in that

839
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,880
sense some important points about

840
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,720
viruses uh like I mentioned they most

841
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,800
commonly spread through vegetative

842
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:22,000
propagation so it's really important to

843
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:26,119
start with virus-free planting material

844
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,358
and I think a lot of people uh either do

845
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:31,760
not know this or they well it's

846
00:39:28,358 --> 00:39:33,358
expensive maybe it's not worth it but um

847
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,560
I think it's a very good investment

848
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:38,559
especially when you're working with a

849
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:40,199
crop that could live you know 30 to 50

850
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:42,599
years maybe

851
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:45,318
longer uh each type of virus has a

852
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:47,318
specific vector or way that uh in which

853
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:50,159
it moves from plant to plant and so if

854
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:53,880
there's insect vectors uh if you control

855
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:53,879
the vector you control the spread of the

856
00:39:55,679 --> 00:40:01,480
virus uh unfortunately a virus cannot be

857
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:04,118
positively identified by symptoms alone

858
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:06,880
uh even though some viruses are so

859
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:08,640
characteristic that um you know you

860
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,960
could say well that's probably that

861
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:13,799
virus to be absolutely sure you need to

862
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,760
do a laboratory analysis and the test

863
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,560
that is performed um is akin to a

864
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,680
pregnancy test where you see a colar

865
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:22,559
reaction and then you know the virus is

866
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:26,078
present there are also some more

867
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:29,279
advanced uh DNA based methods uh some

868
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,920
Nursery sell virus tested Nursery stock

869
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,040
and the way they do that is that the

870
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:36,079
mother blocks from which the cuting are

871
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:38,559
taken are laboratory tested for viruses

872
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,839
every year uh that's also based on

873
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:42,599
visual inspection and then uh sorry

874
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:45,599
visual inspection and tissue culture

875
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:50,880
alone do not guarantee freedom from

876
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,880
viruses because because some viruses are

877
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,240
symptomless okay so I'll I'll go through

878
00:40:56,199 --> 00:41:00,439
the most common virus symptoms in

879
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:02,399
blueberries uh the one that I think is

880
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,358
most striking and actually could be

881
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,160
called beautiful especially for plant

882
00:41:04,358 --> 00:41:09,358
Pathologists looking at those uh is

883
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:11,358
blueberry Sho string virus and this one

884
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:13,358
has really characteristic symptoms that

885
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:15,880
almost cannot be mistaken for anything

886
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:18,920
else but you'll see uh the Oakleaf

887
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,640
pattern so there rening you can see red

888
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,960
blotches on the stems this is usually

889
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:23,960
what you see the

890
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,440
first and then there's the shoes string

891
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:33,159
leaves which are very thin strapped

892
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:36,519
likee leaves so if you see that that is

893
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:39,440
very likely to be blueberry Sho string

894
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:41,679
virus this virus uh in addition to being

895
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,559
spread by propagation material is spread

896
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:47,239
by apids uh it tends to spread down the

897
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:49,480
road because if it's either walk from

898
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:51,078
plant to plant it's more easier it's

899
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,000
easier for them to walk down the road

900
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:55,599
and to Crossroads and also because uh if

901
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,400
there's mechanical harvesting the

902
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,200
mechanical Harvesters could pick up

903
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,880
infective aphids and carry them down the

904
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:05,318
row uh Transmissions usually start in

905
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:08,240
spring when aphids emerge and can

906
00:42:05,318 --> 00:42:10,039
continue until fall leaf drop but most

907
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:12,959
of the spread will occur when aphid

908
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:15,440
populations explode so one of the the

909
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,240
things uh that you could do to control

910
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:21,159
blueberry shoestring virus is to monitor

911
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,318
Aid populations and to use insecticides

912
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:25,078
well timed

913
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:27,599
insecticides uh including and washing

914
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:30,318
Harvesters after harvesting an infected

915
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:33,760
Fields um now when I talk about control

916
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:36,880
measures for specific viruses I um

917
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:39,880
emphasize you know additional control

918
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:42,440
methods to virus-free or virus tested

919
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:46,599
materials I think the virus tested plant

920
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,599
material um goes for all virus

921
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,760
problems tomato ringspot virus um is

922
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:55,679
actually a virus that infects a lot of

923
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,200
other hosts in addition to

924
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:59,838
Blueberry um you can tell that there's

925
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:03,039
something wrong and we find that this

926
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:05,639
virus is pretty common in Michigan uh

927
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:08,358
probably in other areas too New York

928
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:10,639
where you see Leaf spots sort of

929
00:43:08,358 --> 00:43:13,000
spotting in the plants necrotic spots

930
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:16,078
and the leaves are distorted along those

931
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,039
spots you can see a decline a dieback of

932
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:21,400
plants uh usually it's uh one or a few

933
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:24,920
plants in the area that are showing this

934
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,920
dieback and slow

935
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:31,318
decline tobacco rings spot virus is

936
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:33,119
another very similar virus um and it

937
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:35,719
also looks quite similar it has these

938
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,720
spotting on the leaves

939
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:40,759
and the leaves are deformed or curled

940
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:43,358
and infected bushes will Decline and

941
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,359
eventually

942
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:49,279
die now here we have a little problem

943
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:52,440
with the formatting of the slide but

944
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,800
hopefully you can still read it um both

945
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:57,480
of these viruses have a wide hose range

946
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:01,039
which in includes many weeds d line

947
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:04,280
chickweed and they can be carried from

948
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:07,440
um you know from crop to crop by these

949
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:10,119
weeds uh also they infect tree fruits

950
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,440
apples Etc so if you plant it after an

951
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:15,000
orchard you might have a problem with

952
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:18,039
this virus because uh it's transmitted

953
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,519
by dagger nematodes zanima

954
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:22,558
americanum and this nematode which is a

955
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:25,358
small roundworm that lives in the soil

956
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:30,359
and feeds on plant roots can transmit

957
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:31,799
the virus and even for a year after um

958
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:35,480
the crop has been

959
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:38,440
removed so this is a bit of a problem um

960
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:41,240
so if you do have this virus and again I

961
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,920
would recommend testing or diagnosis

962
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:46,399
first to be sure that's what's going on

963
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,159
uh if you do remove infected bushes you

964
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,639
should test the soil for the presence of

965
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:52,480
the dagger nematodes and if they are

966
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:55,719
present there's a good chance that they

967
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,719
will then transmit the virus uh to the

968
00:44:55,719 --> 00:45:02,239
next planting or if you replant in those

969
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:05,318
same areas so fumigation with fumigant

970
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:07,719
or uh rotating out of blueberries for

971
00:45:05,318 --> 00:45:10,318
several years planting uh for instance

972
00:45:07,719 --> 00:45:13,279
Rye that will not um have the the

973
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:16,519
nematode survive beyond the you know

974
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,519
that year would be ways to control that

975
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:20,358
and maintaining good wheed control uh

976
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:23,519
there are some resistant or tolerant

977
00:45:20,358 --> 00:45:23,519
cultivar that can be

978
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:30,318
planted a blueberry leaf model for virus

979
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:33,000
is another virus that um as far as we

980
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:35,719
know only is found in Michigan uh so

981
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,039
I'll talk about it briefly but um just

982
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:41,399
in case people start seeing these

983
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:43,960
symptoms uh typically you see uh uh

984
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:47,280
yellowing or modeling modeling means

985
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:48,838
sort of a light and dark uh green areas

986
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,040
on leaves

987
00:45:48,838 --> 00:45:54,199
stunting can occur um the leaves are

988
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:55,159
very small and rosetted and more more or

989
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:59,279
less

990
00:45:55,159 --> 00:46:00,960
pointy and this virus disease does uh

991
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,599
cause some problems it causes slow

992
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:07,639
decline in blueberries uh the variety

993
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,640
Rubble especially declines more

994
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:15,159
rapidly the um control of this disease

995
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:17,079
sorry this disease or this virus

996
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:19,159
interestingly is transmitted by pollen

997
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:23,079
which are carried by bees so you

998
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:24,759
inadvertently get uh problems or the

999
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:27,359
bees will be carrying the pollen and the

1000
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:29,880
virus around and as I mentioned is only

1001
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:31,719
known in Michigan so far and the control

1002
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,280
would be to remove and Destroy infected

1003
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:37,078
bushes uh and not moving beehives from

1004
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:40,000
infected Fields this just brings another

1005
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:41,920
aspect of certain virus diseases where

1006
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,119
uh bees are involved in a transmission

1007
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,119
of

1008
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:50,880
pollen you place the hives and what you

1009
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:52,960
do with the hives after pollination of

1010
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,960
the

1011
00:46:53,639 --> 00:47:00,679
blueberries okay

1012
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:02,760
another virus that is a common or not

1013
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:05,919
very common but it occurs in Michigan

1014
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:07,599
and it's also uh appears to become more

1015
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,559
problematic in States like North

1016
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:13,838
Carolina is blueberry red ringspot virus

1017
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:16,319
and just looking at the symptoms um I

1018
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:18,880
think it's quite striking you could see

1019
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:21,679
red blotches on the

1020
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,680
stems they sometimes have a beautiful

1021
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:26,239
ring- like shape but most of the time

1022
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:29,159
it's more like a blotch and then you see

1023
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:30,838
a red spotting on the leaves that is

1024
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:32,598
only visible from the top of the leaves

1025
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:35,358
and it's the older leaves that start to

1026
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:39,000
have this problem there may even be Flex

1027
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:39,000
on the fruit and delayed

1028
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,760
ripening and let's

1029
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:52,639
see I'm having a little bit of a problem

1030
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:55,598
CU I don't aist or something screen

1031
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:58,000
anymore I don't know what just happened

1032
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:59,800
but this thing is doing things without

1033
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,318
me touching

1034
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:06,920
anything so are we back on

1035
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:10,079
track no I don't know what's going on oh

1036
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:12,800
okay I thought I was doing something my

1037
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:15,280
fear was I was doing something

1038
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,880
wrong okay well I'll

1039
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,480
continue

1040
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,960
um okay I hope there's I'm not running

1041
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:27,280
out of time or

1042
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:29,639
anything uh okay so uh the the

1043
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,680
formatting has changed here but anyway

1044
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:33,759
blueberry red ringspot virus does not

1045
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:36,039
reduce yield significantly but delays

1046
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,240
ripening it does not seem to spread in

1047
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:41,239
Michigan but in New Jersey it's uh it

1048
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:43,679
appears to be transmitted by Mele bugs

1049
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:45,519
so um in the rare event that you start

1050
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:47,519
to see this you know you would have to

1051
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:51,400
monitor infected plants for spread and

1052
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:51,400
watch for MOG in infected

1053
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:58,239
Fields okay blueberry Mosaic uh this is

1054
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,240
something thing that we don't actually

1055
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:02,399
know is caused by a virus but we suspect

1056
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:04,919
it's a virus and they have found virus

1057
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,240
like particles in these plants but um

1058
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,960
it's still being studied and so we know

1059
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:11,279
don't know for sure what virus we we

1060
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,039
have there but it's pretty common I

1061
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:17,119
think in many growing areas where you

1062
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:19,639
see this Mosaic pattern uh where there's

1063
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:21,559
yellow and green area sometimes they're

1064
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:24,078
reddish

1065
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:27,240
um sometimes the whole leaves could be

1066
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:30,160
yellowish and so uh it's it's not really

1067
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:32,318
very harmful we don't think that there

1068
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:33,920
it's it's a big deal um it sometimes

1069
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:36,159
looks like it's spreading but it could

1070
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,798
be that in cool years you just have more

1071
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:40,159
plant showing

1072
00:49:37,798 --> 00:49:42,239
symptoms and the only known source is

1073
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:44,440
infected plant material we don't really

1074
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:48,519
recommend control but if people were

1075
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:50,679
concerned you know the uh the uh recipe

1076
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:53,199
would be the recommendation would be to

1077
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:57,159
pull out that

1078
00:49:53,199 --> 00:50:00,118
bush all right

1079
00:49:57,159 --> 00:50:00,118
let me see if it's

1080
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:06,838
advancing so let's switch to the viruses

1081
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,480
that have really made my summer very

1082
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:13,119
very busy and uh people I know are

1083
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:15,280
concerned about these and you should be

1084
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:19,400
because especially this blueberry Scorch

1085
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:23,079
virus is a very uh potentially damaging

1086
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:25,680
virus is been around in New Jersey for a

1087
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:27,440
long time and it's called Sheep pen Hill

1088
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:30,679
virus in the

1089
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:33,119
area um the characteristic symptoms are

1090
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:36,519
sudden bliding of the flowers and leaves

1091
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:40,119
during Bloom so if you start to see a

1092
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:42,759
lot of uh flowers Al together

1093
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:46,920
simultaneously bliding uh right before

1094
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:49,079
they open that is potentially a

1095
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:51,159
problem also the leaves and the young

1096
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:53,280
shoots will will blight

1097
00:50:51,159 --> 00:50:56,039
back

1098
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:58,519
um this disease is common in Oregon

1099
00:50:56,039 --> 00:51:00,480
Washington British Columbia also in New

1100
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:03,759
Jersey it has been found in

1101
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:06,280
Massachusetts Connecticut and Europe uh

1102
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,160
in 2009 so this year we discovered it in

1103
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,720
Michigan at several

1104
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:13,118
locations um and these locations or

1105
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:15,679
these fields were destroyed to try and

1106
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:17,559
contain it because since we don't know

1107
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:19,639
that this disease exists anywhere else

1108
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:22,559
in Michigan and we want to protect our

1109
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:25,719
industry we had to go to this this

1110
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:28,400
process of destroying the bushes uh in

1111
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:32,439
this case we could trace the infection

1112
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:36,400
to uh a specific or two nurseries that

1113
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:38,358
um had plants that were infected but

1114
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,559
those had been imported you know 14

1115
00:51:38,358 --> 00:51:43,400
years ago from actually from New Jersey

1116
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:45,680
and I'll show you later but they were

1117
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:48,318
not showing typical symptoms so that we

1118
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:48,318
didn't know they were

1119
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,480
infected uh other symptoms of the

1120
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:55,919
blueberry Scorch virus are a yellowing

1121
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,119
or marginal Leaf necrosis as you can see

1122
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,480
here

1123
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:02,200
uh and sometimes some cultivar show Red

1124
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:04,000
Line patterns in the fall so if you see

1125
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:07,159
patterns like these this is really quite

1126
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,318
unusual and uh I would be

1127
00:52:07,159 --> 00:52:11,798
concerned uh there are multiple strains

1128
00:52:09,318 --> 00:52:13,920
of the virus and the symptoms are strain

1129
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:16,400
dependent there is what they call an

1130
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,400
east coast train and a west coast train

1131
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:22,720
and with the west coast train there are

1132
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:25,240
some um cultivars which are symptomless

1133
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:28,118
so that is a bit of a problem they can

1134
00:52:25,239 --> 00:52:29,798
still serve as a reservoir of the virus

1135
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:32,440
uh so if you planted a symptomless

1136
00:52:29,798 --> 00:52:34,519
cultivar you might start to see symptoms

1137
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,960
in varieties that show symptoms with

1138
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:38,798
that particular

1139
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:40,559
strain now since then uh they've

1140
00:52:38,798 --> 00:52:43,119
discovered that there are many more

1141
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,798
strains um that you know really need to

1142
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,440
be studied because we don't know all the

1143
00:52:44,798 --> 00:52:49,000
reactions of these

1144
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:51,159
strains uh the mild symptoms that could

1145
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,079
easily be overlooked and also could be

1146
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:56,719
confused with say nitrogen deficiency uh

1147
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:59,920
are for instance in blue crop a pale

1148
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:01,480
pale greens uh leaves in blue crop uh

1149
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,599
the problem we had in Michigan was with

1150
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:07,159
a variety Legacy and the only symptom

1151
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:09,240
that I could tell uh was a yellowing of

1152
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:11,480
the leaves and sometimes some kind of

1153
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:14,279
strange Red Leaf you know stripe

1154
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:17,599
patterns um or line patterns on the

1155
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:19,280
leaves so I think you know the Growers

1156
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,880
just thought the plants weren't growing

1157
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:25,960
very well and um and they just thought

1158
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:25,960
they need to fertilize them more

1159
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,720
here you can see uh I hope you can tell

1160
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:34,759
that The Scorch infected Legacy row and

1161
00:53:31,719 --> 00:53:37,759
it was still a very young planting um is

1162
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:39,280
much paler than this row next to it and

1163
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,799
that's the only indication that you

1164
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,480
would have had that it was infected uh

1165
00:53:41,798 --> 00:53:46,119
the only other way was of course to do

1166
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:49,000
the laboratory diagnosis and it came

1167
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:52,318
through that almost 100% of these plants

1168
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,318
were infected with the

1169
00:53:53,719 --> 00:53:59,679
virus blueberry shock virus um is very

1170
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:01,199
similar in its

1171
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:04,838
symptoms

1172
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:07,759
um you can see here that you have also a

1173
00:54:04,838 --> 00:54:10,558
very uh simultaneous dback of shoots as

1174
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:13,119
well as blossoms same thing as with

1175
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:15,519
Scorch however it is a very a different

1176
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:18,838
virus and interestingly there's a second

1177
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:20,880
flush of leaves that occurs um after

1178
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:22,639
these shock symptoms have shown up you

1179
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,358
can see that there's some live leaves on

1180
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:27,118
these on these canes and that

1181
00:54:24,358 --> 00:54:30,480
distinguishes it for instance from from

1182
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:32,280
msis um however it is possible to

1183
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,079
sometimes confuse the symptoms with say

1184
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:37,960
mummy Berry or with

1185
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:40,920
phomopsis uh this virus is common in

1186
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:43,838
Oregon Washington and British Colombia

1187
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:46,358
and unfortunately in 2009 we found one

1188
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:48,798
site that had this disease it was at our

1189
00:54:46,358 --> 00:54:51,400
research station uh we still don't know

1190
00:54:48,798 --> 00:54:54,239
where it came from but it is possible

1191
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:56,559
that it came in with some uh variet it

1192
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:59,279
was a variety T trial that was planned

1193
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:02,640
or some some breeding lines we're not

1194
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:05,359
sure we're currently trying to eradicate

1195
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:08,118
this uh

1196
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:11,759
virus now in British Colombia or Pacific

1197
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:13,559
Northwest they find that the uh the

1198
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,760
plants after several years of showing

1199
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:18,119
symptoms will come back to full

1200
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,000
production and that may be possible in

1201
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:22,160
Michigan as well but we don't know

1202
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,679
whether the virus would make the plants

1203
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:27,440
less winner hearty and therefore perhaps

1204
00:55:24,679 --> 00:55:29,000
more susceptible to winner injury

1205
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,559
uh but over there they are not so

1206
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:36,798
concerned about blueberry shock Scorch

1207
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:39,160
is the way more dangerous one and so um

1208
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:41,440
they're just suggesting to Growers that

1209
00:55:39,159 --> 00:55:43,000
they let the disease run its course and

1210
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,920
uh but I don't think we can do that

1211
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,400
because we don't know what it would do

1212
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:50,519
in our regions and um you know if you

1213
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,079
still have it in a small contained area

1214
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:55,038
the best approach is to try and

1215
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:57,519
eradicate it so that it doesn't spread

1216
00:55:55,039 --> 00:55:59,640
and this disease can spread very rapidly

1217
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:02,480
because it also spreads via

1218
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:05,038
pollen carried by

1219
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:07,358
bees uh here you can see an infected

1220
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:11,160
plant um and one of the things I want to

1221
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:14,440
point out is that distinguishes a virus

1222
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:16,480
disease uh from other diseases is that

1223
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:18,838
you can see this this plant is showing a

1224
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,199
lot of necrosis a lot of dieback of the

1225
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:24,119
ches but the neighboring plants look

1226
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:26,759
perfectly healthy so if you see this

1227
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:29,358
very random pattern of a plant here and

1228
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:32,000
there that has a sudden bliding of of

1229
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:34,759
leaves I think that is what is very

1230
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,400
indicative of a virus disease you might

1231
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:40,119
see maybe two next to each other but

1232
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:42,318
generally this uh uh if it was a fungal

1233
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:44,480
disease you would see symptoms on other

1234
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:49,119
bushes

1235
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:52,240
nearby and Laura that is a good uh sign

1236
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:54,480
I'm almost done with my talk here uh so

1237
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:57,479
if you suspect shock or

1238
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,358
Scorch um

1239
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,400
I would say suggest that you contact

1240
00:56:59,358 --> 00:57:03,078
your local Extension agent you can mark

1241
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:06,079
the plants and take Leaf samples from

1242
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:08,000
several branches because the viruses may

1243
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,519
not be distributed very well throughout

1244
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,480
the plants and you can send them for

1245
00:57:10,519 --> 00:57:15,519
diagnosis either to a university

1246
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:17,920
laboratory or to uh agdia which is a

1247
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:21,798
private lab or AC diagnostics is another

1248
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:24,119
private lab that will test samples and

1249
00:57:21,798 --> 00:57:26,599
uh the sample should be as fresh as

1250
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:28,000
possible there's more information on the

1251
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:31,079
on our blueberry

1252
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:34,400
website uh plus the fact sheets or pest

1253
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:36,519
alerts that I produced um are available

1254
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,318
uh through the webinar for you to

1255
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:40,719
download and hopefully that will help

1256
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:43,400
you recognize the symptoms I think

1257
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:45,719
there's you know no need to panic I

1258
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:49,760
think in many cases we have seen uh you

1259
00:57:45,719 --> 00:57:53,038
know just a very small area of infection

1260
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,599
that could be traced back um to certain

1261
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:56,839
you know uh

1262
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:59,240
sources and I don't think we have any

1263
00:57:56,838 --> 00:58:00,759
widespread occurrence but we have to be

1264
00:57:59,239 --> 00:58:05,719
alert or

1265
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:08,520
Vigilant so with that uh I do have this

1266
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:11,279
table here that would just show you or

1267
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:14,318
the different viruses and their symptoms

1268
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,519
and their vectors and I apologize for

1269
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:19,480
the uh the formatting change that

1270
00:58:16,519 --> 00:58:22,280
happened when I uploaded this um and

1271
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:23,920
also I didn't mention stunt because

1272
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:27,359
that's not actually caused by a virus

1273
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:29,680
but by a bacterial like uh a agent but

1274
00:58:27,358 --> 00:58:32,519
there's more information on stunt in on

1275
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:35,440
the website as well as in our virus fact

1276
00:58:32,519 --> 00:58:37,159
sheet and with that I'll stop and if

1277
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,599
there's any time I'll entertain some

1278
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:42,318
questions one from onid

1279
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:44,720
County can injury from herbicides give

1280
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:44,719
similar

1281
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:50,159
appearance yeah I see

1282
00:58:50,358 --> 00:58:55,920
can um I think it can and I think one of

1283
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:57,838
the reasons why we did not recognize

1284
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:01,318
that we had shock at our research

1285
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:03,798
station is because we had a lot of uh

1286
00:59:01,318 --> 00:59:08,159
Roundup and so maybe some paraquat

1287
00:59:03,798 --> 00:59:09,759
injury in our bushes so uh the only

1288
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:12,279
difference would be that if you have

1289
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,920
herbicide injury it tends to be more

1290
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:16,559
widespread you know it wouldn't be a

1291
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,119
single Bush here or there and I think

1292
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,000
that's that's probably the main way to

1293
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:23,119
try to distinguish

1294
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,559
them chance I know

1295
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:28,358
there has been a lot of interest and

1296
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:31,319
Frank has a question there oh it's a

1297
00:59:28,358 --> 00:59:34,838
statement wonderful um more information

1298
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:36,400
about um viruses uh at the New England

1299
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:39,239
vegetable and Berry conference in

1300
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:42,760
Manchester New Hampshire and that date

1301
00:59:39,239 --> 00:59:45,879
is on the 15th 15th of

1302
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:47,640
December and Google that you'll get

1303
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:51,960
right to their website for registration

1304
00:59:47,639 --> 00:59:51,960
inform thank you Frank

1305
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:01,358
oh and I would like to add to that that

1306
00:59:59,239 --> 01:00:05,318
uh for anyone attending the Great Lakes

1307
01:00:01,358 --> 01:00:07,960
Expo in Michigan uh Bob Martin from

1308
01:00:05,318 --> 01:00:09,759
Oregon who is sort of the virus expert

1309
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:11,400
in blueberries and other small fruits

1310
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:16,039
will be attending and we'll be talking

1311
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:16,039
about shock and Scorch as well at that

1312
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:26,838
meeting right that's uh 8th to 10th the

1313
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,280
8th to the 10th in Grand Rapids Michigan

1314
01:00:26,838 --> 01:00:30,798
okay so there's a question what if you

1315
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:33,160
don't remove all of the roots would the

1316
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:35,519
virus remain in the roots in the ground

1317
01:00:33,159 --> 01:00:38,038
yes there's a possibility that while the

1318
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:41,318
roots remain alive that the virus

1319
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:44,520
remains alive so it's very important to

1320
01:00:41,318 --> 01:00:47,239
uh if you had infected plants to kill

1321
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:50,440
them uh apply an herbicide first before

1322
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:53,000
you pull them out so that the roots are

1323
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:55,440
killed um let's see

1324
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,280
how this is going real fast here is the

1325
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,838
Michigan C ification process working

1326
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,119
well for nursery plants or is it

1327
01:00:58,838 --> 01:01:03,719
possible that infected plants have

1328
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:07,880
slipped through um I think our Nursery

1329
01:01:03,719 --> 01:01:10,558
certification process is working however

1330
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:13,079
uh the the one Scorch case slipped

1331
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:15,559
through because uh there are several

1332
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:18,519
reasons one is that it was symptomless

1333
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:20,359
so it didn't initially give uh any

1334
01:01:18,519 --> 01:01:23,159
indication that there was something

1335
01:01:20,358 --> 01:01:25,038
wrong um and we didn't know that we had

1336
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:27,078
shock or Scorch in the state so we

1337
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:31,200
didn't test for it until several years

1338
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:33,079
ago and when we started testing for it

1339
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:36,239
uh because we had also simultaneously

1340
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:38,680
had plump box virus uh the blueberry

1341
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:41,679
testing was uh relegated to the the

1342
01:01:38,679 --> 01:01:44,558
latter part of the season in the fall

1343
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:47,239
and uh we didn't because the virus

1344
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:49,440
concentration lower gets lower the later

1345
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:51,479
you get into the season they had some

1346
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,240
suspect samples but they weren't sure

1347
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,920
that they were infected so only this

1348
01:01:53,239 --> 01:01:58,358
year did they confirm that uh it really

1349
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:01,480
was infected so and those plants were

1350
01:01:58,358 --> 01:02:03,719
imported by the nursery uh 14 years ago

1351
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:07,920
so they didn't sell any because they

1352
01:02:03,719 --> 01:02:10,519
weren't growing well but um you know

1353
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:13,119
they did slip through uh because you

1354
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:15,798
know we just didn't test through variety

1355
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:17,519
of circumstances but I think we you know

1356
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:20,038
all the nursery plants are tested for

1357
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:23,719
these both of these viruses now so uh we

1358
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:26,278
should be it should be working um okay

1359
01:02:23,719 --> 01:02:29,078
let's see sorry

1360
01:02:26,278 --> 01:02:33,679
yeah I can read them to you anim um how

1361
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:33,680
trying to catch up all the the questions

1362
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:40,880
here oh no I I think I let's

1363
01:02:38,358 --> 01:02:44,838
see how soon after removing can you

1364
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:46,640
replant um I think you can replant if

1365
01:02:44,838 --> 01:02:50,838
you're sure that the roots are

1366
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:52,159
dead uh you can replant you know within

1367
01:02:50,838 --> 01:02:55,119
even several

1368
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:57,038
months um but I think it'd be good to

1369
01:02:55,119 --> 01:03:00,160
plow up

1370
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:02,599
and if depending on the virus if you

1371
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:05,639
have a nematode born virus you might

1372
01:03:02,599 --> 01:03:07,760
have to wait longer at least a year uh

1373
01:03:05,639 --> 01:03:09,480
if it's one of those viruses like Scorch

1374
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:13,319
or shock you have to make sure that the

1375
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:16,039
insects are all killed if there's any um

1376
01:03:13,318 --> 01:03:18,199
um call it transmission by aphids and

1377
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:20,520
such and I should mention that for The

1378
01:03:18,199 --> 01:03:23,239
Scorch virus we don't know that it's

1379
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:24,798
transmitted transmitted by the aphid

1380
01:03:23,239 --> 01:03:27,239
that we have which is Illinois at

1381
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:30,239
peppery uh but it's transmitted by

1382
01:03:27,239 --> 01:03:31,639
ericus species so we're we're looking

1383
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:34,038
into

1384
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:36,278
that uh for the fields infected did you

1385
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:39,119
test for both Scorch and shock Sy since

1386
01:03:36,278 --> 01:03:41,599
the symptoms look alike yes we tested

1387
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:42,720
for both because we didn't know uh which

1388
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:45,039
one was

1389
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:47,879
which um do you know if they plan to

1390
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:50,039
record Bob Martin's talk for later Vie

1391
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:53,000
uh that's a good question I will look

1392
01:03:50,039 --> 01:03:55,359
into that uh for the Great Lakes

1393
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,838
Expo I don't think they have actually

1394
01:03:55,358 --> 01:04:01,679
record talks in the past they have just

1395
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:04,719
put the presentation on um online or

1396
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:07,199
they have put some kind of summary

1397
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:10,318
online uh I'll check into that to see if

1398
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:11,798
that's possible and Frank's comment if

1399
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:13,480
you have a positive detection of

1400
01:04:11,798 --> 01:04:15,358
squatcher shock in a New England S I

1401
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:19,240
would like to know

1402
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:21,119
okay I I think we should all be um you

1403
01:04:19,239 --> 01:04:24,278
know I guest talking to each other to

1404
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:27,278
know where these viruses occur because I

1405
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:29,960
can uh guarantee that once you start

1406
01:04:27,278 --> 01:04:32,039
looking there will be some places where

1407
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:33,278
it will show up I think there was a lot

1408
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:35,799
of plant

1409
01:04:33,278 --> 01:04:38,159
movement before uh you know we were

1410
01:04:35,798 --> 01:04:41,559
really aware of these viruses and some

1411
01:04:38,159 --> 01:04:44,960
of it could have been just moved you or

1412
01:04:41,559 --> 01:04:47,960
moved years ago and is uh infected maybe

1413
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:51,119
it hasn't spread hopefully but once we

1414
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:54,079
start looking I think we'll find

1415
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:55,760
more um let's see are nurseries required

1416
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:59,200
to test and certify their stock as

1417
01:04:55,760 --> 01:05:03,278
disease free no it's a voluntary

1418
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:07,159
program and if you buy plants you have

1419
01:05:03,278 --> 01:05:08,679
to ask or be sure that it's virus tested

1420
01:05:07,159 --> 01:05:11,519
there are some nurseries that have

1421
01:05:08,679 --> 01:05:13,798
visual inspections and they might say

1422
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:15,920
that you know it has been inspected for

1423
01:05:13,798 --> 01:05:17,719
diseases but that doesn't mean it's

1424
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:19,680
virus tested it has to undergo a

1425
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:20,879
Laboratory test so you have to confirm

1426
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:23,239
that with your

1427
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:26,760
Nursery do you or Frank have an opinion

1428
01:05:23,239 --> 01:05:29,919
about usda's National clean plant networ

1429
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:32,480
very good question I am right now at the

1430
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:37,400
berry clean plant Network meeting in St

1431
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:40,079
Louis um and uh we are working on having

1432
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:44,240
I guess more virus testing done and

1433
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:46,760
cleanup of planting material um and also

1434
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:49,598
perhaps support certification programs

1435
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:50,400
for more nurseries or States through

1436
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:53,039
this

1437
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:56,599
network and I can you know it's still

1438
01:05:53,039 --> 01:06:00,079
developing so but they're working on on

1439
01:05:56,599 --> 01:06:02,278
it Kathy uh Growers with blueberry virus

1440
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:04,160
concerned in yor should contact Dr carot

1441
01:06:02,278 --> 01:06:06,159
Cox is there any way we can find out

1442
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:10,000
which nurseries carried the infected

1443
01:06:06,159 --> 01:06:10,000
plants okay is

1444
01:06:11,079 --> 01:06:14,079
there

1445
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:22,400
um uh no I well I I guess I'm not at

1446
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:25,719
Liberty to divulge which Nursery that

1447
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:30,200
was um which carried the infected plant

1448
01:06:25,719 --> 01:06:32,838
I think they've worked on removing the

1449
01:06:30,199 --> 01:06:35,919
materials um and contacting all the

1450
01:06:32,838 --> 01:06:38,960
people that might have purchased those

1451
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:41,880
plants um so I think Frank said I think

1452
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,880
that's the best I can

1453
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:47,920
do so if you are

1454
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:51,000
contacted the the one thing I can

1455
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:53,798
mention is that for the scor in our area

1456
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,159
it was the variety Legacy so if you have

1457
01:06:53,798 --> 01:06:58,599
any concerns about you have legac see

1458
01:06:56,159 --> 01:07:01,399
and not many people are growing it but

1459
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:02,880
some people are using it for as a

1460
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:06,200
pollinizer

1461
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:08,680
for um Liberty some of the late

1462
01:07:06,199 --> 01:07:12,358
varieties uh if you're finding that it's

1463
01:07:08,679 --> 01:07:14,318
not growing well I would be uh you know

1464
01:07:12,358 --> 01:07:16,480
looking into that and have it test

1465
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:18,440
questions or comments things that they'd

1466
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:21,039
like to share are there any other I want

1467
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:23,720
to apologize to you folks I don't know

1468
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:26,039
exactly what happened today we had some

1469
01:07:23,719 --> 01:07:28,199
unusual um

1470
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:31,278
things happened during the presentation

1471
01:07:28,199 --> 01:07:34,118
that I am not totally sure why or if

1472
01:07:31,278 --> 01:07:37,880
they'll ever happen again but I really

1473
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:40,599
appreciate uh Dr Caruso and Dr scher's

1474
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:43,680
uh willingness to use this technology

1475
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:46,400
and the presentations were wonderful and

1476
01:07:43,679 --> 01:07:48,358
I encourage you folks to um I'm going to

1477
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:51,519
leave the website up so if you want to

1478
01:07:48,358 --> 01:07:53,400
continue to upload some of the fact

1479
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:56,038
sheets about the

1480
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:59,599
presentations and if you

1481
01:07:56,039 --> 01:08:01,559
um if you want to go uh back and listen

1482
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:05,160
to the archived version that might be

1483
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:09,240
helpful as well these are big uh issues

1484
01:08:05,159 --> 01:08:09,239
um right now so I just

1485
01:08:09,639 --> 01:08:15,278
appreciate help and then we have one

1486
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:19,559
other question from Tom Stevenson about

1487
01:08:15,278 --> 01:08:19,560
what about vectors to be concerned about

1488
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:28,519
while maybe

1489
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:28,520
yes um should I answer

1490
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:36,159
that um I think the same

1491
01:08:33,798 --> 01:08:38,479
vectors um would be an issue if you're

1492
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:41,358
growing organically or conventionally

1493
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:43,000
maybe there would be less control in the

1494
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:45,359
organic

1495
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:49,279
situation um I wouldn't be concerned

1496
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:51,400
about vectors unless you had a a virus

1497
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:54,799
problem or maybe if your neighbor had a

1498
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:57,838
virus problem uh I would say that really

1499
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:58,960
in most cases viruses get transmitted by

1500
01:08:57,838 --> 01:09:01,000
taking

1501
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:03,158
cuting and I know we have several

1502
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,198
growers in Michigan who have you know

1503
01:09:03,158 --> 01:09:08,479
said oh yeah I just got cuttings from my

1504
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:11,039
neighbor and yes you know that seems to

1505
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:12,838
be the the problem uh because the

1506
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:15,759
neighbor also had a virus problem and

1507
01:09:12,838 --> 01:09:17,359
some cases some Growers have noticed

1508
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:21,719
that people have been taking cuting from

1509
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:23,279
their planting at night and uh anyway

1510
01:09:21,719 --> 01:09:25,679
that could be a problem if you have had

1511
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:28,560
a virus be a problem for the thieves any

1512
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:30,319
additional questions for Dr schilder or

1513
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:33,759

01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:38,158

1516
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:40,560
recording of it but I'll leave it up

1517
