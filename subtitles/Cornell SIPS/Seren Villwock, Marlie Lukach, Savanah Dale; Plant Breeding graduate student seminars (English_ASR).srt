1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,400
University okay um my name is sarin I'm

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,759
going to talk about preliminary results

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,039
today for a multivariate genomic wide

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,839
Association study for carotenoids and

6
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:20,160
dry matter which are two negatively

7
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:22,278
correlated traits in

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,599
cassava so you've probably know that

9
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:27,198
cassava is a really important um food

10
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:29,240
security crop it feeds over 800 million

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,920
people globally it's a really important

12
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:33,159
source of calor mostly through

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,359
carbohydrates but it's pretty low in

14
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:38,799
micronutrients and so um populations

15
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:40,878
that rely heavily on cassava based diets

16
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,878
often have high rates of vitamin

17
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,119
deficiencies including vitamin A

18
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:48,238
deficiency which affects one in four

19
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,238
children and subser in

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,280
Africa there are some yellow cassava

21
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:56,280
varieties that accumulate carotenoids

22
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,439
which are um some of which are cleaved

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,280
in the human body to form vitamin A so

24
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:04,118
they're called provitamin a CR ooids and

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,200
um what's great about yellow cassava is

26
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:09,159
that it can provide a sustainable source

27
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,879
of provitamin a um for people in

28
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:13,479
subsaharan

29
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:16,759
Africa and because of this breeders have

30
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:18,640
been um investing over the last 20 years

31
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:21,200
in breeding improved varieties of yellow

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:25,200
cassava that can provide provitamin a

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,400
and meet other agronomic uh trait

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,560
needs um unfortunately there's a

35
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,640
trade-off between carotenoids and dry

36
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,960
matter content um dry matter content

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,159
I'll abbreviate DM throughout this

38
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:40,078
presentation um it's a really important

39
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,240
um driver of consumer acceptance it

40
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:45,798
influences the dry yield for flour and

41
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:48,039
also the textural properties of cassava

42
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:51,000
and it's one of the key traits to Target

43
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,600
for um improving improving for yellow

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,078
cassava varieties so this um negative

45
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:58,519
correlation it's been persistent in the

46
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,359
African breeding programs and that's

47
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:03,118
been a problem for

48
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:06,239
um producing high dry matter varieties

49
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,239
that also have high Chron

50
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:11,598
oids previous gwas Studies have um

51
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,039
identified that there's a Locus on

52
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,878
chromosome one which is associated with

53
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:19,919
both catenoids measured here by

54
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:19,919
chromometer and also dry matter

55
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,598
content um because there is a strong

56
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:29,000
candidate Gene at this Locus for both

57
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:31,280
cottonoids which is fyin synthes 2 um

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,840
the key rate limiting enzyme and choid

59
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,878
synthesis and also sucros synthes a

60
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,280
separate candidate Gene um that's likely

61
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:41,679
to influence dry matter content it's

62
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,719
thought that this Locus represents um a

63
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,920
genetic linkage between these two genes

64
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,519
and that's driving the negative

65
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,839
correlation between the

66
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,400
traits there's also been molecular

67
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,039
studies looking at the transgenic

68
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,640
expression of psy2 that suggests it has

69
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,120
a plyopic effect on both catenoids and

70
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:00,759
dry matter so there's a bit of

71
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,800
conflicting evence evidence in cassava

72
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:04,318
for whether linkage or ply tropy is

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,840
driving this

74
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,878
relationship and the objective of most

75
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,000
of my research is um trying to

76
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,120
understand the genetic relationship

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,239
between catenoids and dry matter and

78
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,439
implications for um developing breeding

79
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,239
strategies that can help us increase

80
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:21,919
both choid and dry

81
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,878
matter so there's a few um different

82
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,119
hypotheses about how these traits are

83
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:29,878
related both at um the chromosome one

84
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,680
Locus or genomewide so first for linkage

85
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:34,959
it's the idea that there are two

86
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,879
separate low side that are um closely

87
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,080
spaced together that separately affect

88
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:41,120
coronoids and dry matter there could

89
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,680
also be horizontal pliot tropy or

90
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,920
biological Pat tropy where a single

91
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,560
Locus affects both coronoids and dry

92
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:51,199
matter directly or

93
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,759
mediated and then there could be

94
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:57,039
vertical pyot tropy where a single Locus

95
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:59,280
affects cottonoids which then because of

96
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,560
physiological connections affects dry

97
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,919
matter or vice

98
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:09,120
versa and so testing um which of these

99
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:11,158
relationships um fits at chromosome one

100
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,759
is important and if we think that it

101
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:15,000
might be vertical pliot tropy which

102
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:17,478
seems more likely than horizontal pliot

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,560
tropy in this case we'd also expect that

104
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:21,758
other lowside that affect cottonoids

105
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,639
genome wide would have a similar

106
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,319
association with dry matter because of

107
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:30,240
there if they do have an inherent trait

108
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:32,478
relationship so for this study we doing

109
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,240
a multivariate genomewide Association

110
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:38,478
study to look at Loi um genome wide

111
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,240
using a multivariate analysis we can

112
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,560
increase statistical Power by taking

113
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,000
advantage of the correlation between

114
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,800
traits and we can also test hypothesis

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,720
about the distribution of jointly

116
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,360
Associated Loi across the

117
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,400
genome so we want to know if there are

118
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,038
multiple Loi that are jointly associated

119
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,519
with both traits besides just the

120
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:56,639
chromosome one Locus that we already

121
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,279
know

122
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,079
about and if so whether those jointly

123
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:04,279
ass Associated Loi affect the traits in

124
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,279
opposite directions more often than

125
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:07,839
expected by chance which would suggest

126
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:10,319
that there is an inherent relationship

127
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:10,319
between the two

128
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:17,560
traits so for this study um we genotyped

129
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,199
378 accessions sampled from the yellow

130
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,879
Cava breeding population at The

131
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,000
International Institute of tropical

132
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,719
agriculture in ibadan Nigeria and Dr

133
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,240
Elizabeth Parks um is the breeder who

134
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,199
has been working in that

135
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,918
population and they have um together

136
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,080
with her team there they have collected

137
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:39,758
child data over the last several years

138
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:42,079
um which include CR noids measured by

139
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,199
spectrometer which is a quantitative

140
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,359
method that's improved from previous

141
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:51,520
color chart methods that are um more

142
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,520
qualitative and also dry matter

143
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:57,800
content and with this data we are using

144
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:59,719
two methods um the first is a

145
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,360
multivariate linear model which is of a

146
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:05,160
traditional gws and the second is aasan

147
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,439
model comparison which is going to help

148
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:12,160
us interpret the results um of these

149
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:15,120
associations so first the first method

150
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,280
um for the multivariate linear mix

151
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,560
models we're doing a two-step approach

152
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,478
first we calculate blops and then we

153
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,639
test associations between Snips and

154
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:26,000
blops accounting for relatedness

155
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,720
population structure and the major

156
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,360
effect Locus on chromosome one that we

157
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,960
already know about

158
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,400
in terms of the linear model the first

159
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:39,478
step looks like this where we um account

160
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:42,318
for trial effects and calculate um blops

161
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:44,439
using box Cox transformed phenotypes so

162
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,120
they're normalized and then we take

163
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:49,279
those blops and put them in an

164
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,598
association model where we have um in

165
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:54,318
addition to the effect of this snip

166
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:57,279
we're also accounting for um genome wide

167
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,240
relationships also the relationships of

168
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:03,598
the Hypes at the psy2 locus

169
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,400
and the Hypes um at a region in

170
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:08,680
chromosome one where there are

171
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:11,079
integration diagnostic markers or idms

172
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,598
and those are tagging a hype that causes

173
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:14,399
a lot of population structure on

174
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:17,639
chromosome one and is also known to

175
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:20,799
affect dry matter so we account for um

176
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,680
those effects so that we can try and um

177
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,240
reduce confounding from population

178
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,800
structure and also identify Loi other

179
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,319
than the major effect that we already

180
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,720
know

181
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,319
about so for this Manhattan plot there's

182
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,639
the negative log 10 P values from those

183
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,759
associations on the y axis um the cut

184
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,478
off here the dotted line represents a

185
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:46,280
modified bonon cut off cut off which is

186
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:48,079
calculated with um Alpha of 05 and the

187
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:50,758
estimated number of effective

188
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:53,279
Snips and you can see that there are

189
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:56,560
multiple Peaks Above This significance

190
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:58,239
threshold um not just on chromosome one

191
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,598
would suggest there are joint

192
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,639
associations in other parts of the

193
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:05,079
genome as well what's challenging about

194
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,280
this um more traditional multivariate

195
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:10,198
gwas approach is that when you have a

196
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,918
single P value for these associations

197
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:15,000
it's difficult to interpret whether that

198
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:17,198
snip is associated because it affects

199
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,439
both traits jointly or if it really just

200
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,240
affects one trait um these associations

201
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:23,399
can

202
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,478
represent strong associations with

203
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:28,239
coronoids and or dry mod so even if it's

204
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,800
a very strong association with one trait

205
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,399
it might get picked up here as well so

206
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:38,278
to help us um interpret this we're using

207
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,399
um a method by Matthew Stevens called

208
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:43,399
multivariate vasion imputation based

209
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,639
Association mapping and the idea behind

210
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:50,000
this approach is to compare models that

211
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:52,120
bend the two phenotypes into these um

212
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,120
three possible partitions that are

213
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,039
directly associated with the snip

214
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,039
indirectly associated with a snip via

215
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:01,199
correlation with the other trait or

216
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:01,199
unassociated with the snip

217
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:08,360
and so it calculates uh probability for

218
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:10,599
each of these possible partitions and a

219
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,240
base factor which represents the support

220
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,720
for a particular partition um compared

221
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,959
with a null which would be that um

222
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:22,879
neither trait is associated with a given

223
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:26,319
snip so then um how this looks in

224
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:28,078
practice um because the stepen algorithm

225
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,200
doesn't allow you to fit covariates we

226
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:33,039
have to do it in two steps again so the

227
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,959
first step is similar to the um previous

228
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:39,120
model I showed um where we are

229
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:42,359
accounting for the effect of um the psy2

230
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,240
hype the chromosome one ingression and

231
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,079
also the rest of the genome um

232
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,680
relationships using a leave one

233
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:53,799
chromosome out approach where we're um

234
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:55,439
taking the residuals from this model um

235
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:58,278
for which one chromosome has been left

236
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,720
out and then fitting that with the Snips

237
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:02,838
on that chromosome

238
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:05,959
um which were left out and so uh for

239
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:09,120
each snip we can then uh see which

240
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:12,039
partition um has the highest base Factor

241
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,078
representing which model fits um the

242
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:15,078
data the best in this

243
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,800
case so in this um figure it's the same

244
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,679
Manhattan plot I showed earlier from the

245
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:26,000
multivariate um linear mixed models and

246
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:28,838
the color that's overlaid on top is

247
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,600
representing the top base factor that

248
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:37,760
came out of the um BIM Bam approach so

249
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:39,600
in red are um Snips which their highest

250
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,159
base Factor was corresponding to the

251
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,079
direct direct partition which is that

252
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,159
the snip is directly associated with

253
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:48,559
both coronoids and dry

254
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:51,240
matter there's also a peak that's in

255
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:54,679
green which represents the partition

256
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,600
where um the snip is directly associated

257
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:58,719
with cottonoids and indirectly

258
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,120
associated with dry matter so once you

259
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:05,399
account for the effect of cottonoids

260
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,399
there's um no residual effect for dry

261
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:13,278
matter we can also look at the effect

262
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:16,319
Direction um of these of these Snips so

263
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:18,879
in red are Snips that their effect

264
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,360
estimate um for cids and dry matter are

265
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,879
in opposite directions and the blue

266
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,879
color is for the same direction so you

267
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:28,360
can see that all of the Snips which fall

268
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:30,838
above the significance threshold are in

269
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,680
red which means that the they affect the

270
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:33,680
traits in opposite

271
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:39,519
directions um so in conclusion it looks

272
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,519
like we have significantly Associated

273
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,159
lowside that affect both coronoids and

274
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,120
dry matter in opposite directions that

275
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,360
are across the genome not just on chome

276
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,320
one which suggests that there's a genome

277
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,600
wide negative

278
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,240
relationship the direct direct model

279
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,959
fits best for most of the jointly

280
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,959
Associated Loi except for the one on

281
00:11:55,958 --> 00:12:01,239
chromosome

282
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:03,159
10 and also there's still a peak on

283
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:07,000
chromosome one even after accounting for

284
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:08,919
the um psy2 hype so this suggests that

285
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,240
there might be multiple causal Loi in

286
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:13,879
that region on chromosome

287
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,519
one and our next steps are to evaluate

288
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:19,360
candidate genes um and follow up on some

289
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:21,240
of these ply tropy hypotheses using um

290
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,959
other methods like a network analysis

291
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,720
that we're

292
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:28,399
doing I'd like to thank um my committee

293
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,639
and the I cassava breeding unit team who

294
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:35,399
collected this field data over the years

295
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,919
led by um Dr Parks and Dr Gabby andano

296
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,679
um and those are a picture of some of my

297
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:42,479
labmates at the next gen kava conference

298
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:45,838
last year thank

299
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,839
you there any

300
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:51,078
questions really nice work I was

301
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,919
wondering is it possible to get access

302
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:53,919
to data on

303
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:02,000
ABA It's Kind got rot thing help get

304
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,759
into AA that

305
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,958
would

306
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:09,399
explain yeah Ed was asking if it's

307
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,599
possible to get a Aba abscissic acid

308
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:14,240
data which is Downstream of um beta

309
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,278
carotene and is one of the possible

310
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,680
mechanisms for which cottoid pathway

311
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:22,159
might affect um the the dry matter and

312
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:24,519
starch Pathways um it's we don't have

313
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:27,799
large data sets on that but the data

314
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:30,120
that there are for um where abic acid is

315
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:32,120
measured shows so there's a positive

316
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,799
association between total chromid

317
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:38,039
content and obic acid and with lower dry

318
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:42,519
matter so it the correlations support

319
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:45,120
that idea um but it's very hard to

320
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:46,799
um I think test abic acid in a high

321
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,799
throughput manner although Tim stter may

322
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,799
have different

323
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:58,879
ideas um so the starch there's two

324
00:13:56,198 --> 00:14:00,240
starch biosynthesis genes near psy2

325
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,120
chromosome one that have been

326
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,799
hypothesized as candidate genes um the

327
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:10,919
first one is sucn sucros synthes um

328
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:14,039
which is bidirectional in um converting

329
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:17,039
sucrose into starch there's also another

330
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:18,439
enzyme um called UDP glucose pyrro

331
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,360
phosphor ASE that's involved in the

332
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,800
starch pathway and those are both really

333
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,079
close to the vitamine synthase 2 Gene so

334
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,719
either of them um are likely canidate

335
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:29,239
genes to affect starch synthesis but

336
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,800
there have been no variant

337
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,759
tested um in those genes that are

338
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,838
potentially

339
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:40,600
causal great thanks for your answer SAR

340
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:42,759
other questions yes just want to clarify

341
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,759
the definition of the

342
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:47,839
vertical is that a

343
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:53,240
sequential yeah so the question was

344
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:53,240
clarifying um vertical ply tropy

345
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:02,480
so sorry so for um horizontal ply tropy

346
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:05,198
or biological P tropy the idea is that a

347
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,839
variant like phyto synthase 2 has a

348
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:09,359
direct effect on dry matter which in

349
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,959
this case is kind of hard to imagine but

350
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,000
there's other um cases in which it might

351
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,198
be possible to find a gene like a

352
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,799
transcription factor that has Direct

353
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:22,120
effects on multiple separate traits for

354
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:24,319
vertical pyot tropy the idea is that

355
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,560
there's a single variant for example in

356
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,319
psy2 that affects carotenoids which we

357
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:31,078
know it does and then because oids might

358
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:34,039
affect dry matter for example through

359
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:36,239
the obic a acid um connection that Ed

360
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:38,799
mentioned then that variant would also

361
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,519
affect dry matter but only via its

362
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,318
effect on cottonoids and so once you

363
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:45,879
account for the effect of the snip on

364
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:48,360
cottonoids there's no more effect on dry

365
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:51,198
matter separate from that does that

366
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:54,399
makes sense maybe simplyy to

367
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:56,919
sayic parallel and the vertical is more

368
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,078
like a sequential yes yeah horizontal is

369
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:00,599
like parallel vertical is like

370
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:00,599
sequential

371
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,599
yeah okay thank you we can pass it to

372
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,519
the next

373
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,319
speaker all righty many of you already

374
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:13,720
know that much of my research has to do

375
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:15,958
with gourds and today I'm going to

376
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,000
specifically focus on bords as part of

377
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,838
my research I'm characterizing the USDA

378
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,278
Li gener area

379
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:26,440
collection okay so first I want to talk

380
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:28,159
about the area I'm focusing on so most

381
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,319
of my work is dealing with Southeast

382
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,078
Asia

383
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:35,198
and there's a lot of discussion on how

384
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:37,439
to define southeast Asia as a region by

385
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:39,359
Scholars whether it really should be its

386
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,720
own region whether we should think about

387
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,879
it kind of between

388
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,600
regions um as a connector but for my

389
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:50,120
purposes we're going to talk about

390
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:52,000
southeast Asia in these 11 countries

391
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,919
mostly focusing on Mainland southeast

392
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,360
Asia so Cambodia Vietnam Thailand

393
00:16:54,919 --> 00:17:00,799
Myanmar and LA but a little bit in the

394
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:06,038
Philippines um and also in

395
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:07,759
Indonesia so why bours so to me bours

396
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:09,160
really interesting because it's believed

397
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,720
to be one of the first domesticated

398
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:14,519
crops in the entire world and I believe

399
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,798
part of this is Du its Duality so B

400
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:19,639
gourds are quite unique because you can

401
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:22,439
eat the leaves you can eat the flowers

402
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,959
you can eat the fruit but when the fruit

403
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,319
matures and the plant sesses it has a

404
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,160
very thick

405
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:33,399
rind and this rindes can be used for

406
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,880
many different things now traditionally

407
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,880
if you might have some familiar with

408
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,679
bords the most common thing to think

409
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,720
about is it's used for holding water so

410
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,559
we might think of a bour something like

411
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,400
this where we might cut a hole in the

412
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,839
spout we might cut a hole in the side to

413
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,840
allow air to come through and we would

414
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:52,199
use this as a drinking vessel so I'm I

415
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:54,918
have some show and TOS I'm going to pass

416
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:58,000
some things around for you guys to

417
00:17:54,919 --> 00:18:01,000
see but when we look at the history of

418
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,960
Bor in Southeast Asia it's quite diverse

419
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,480
the different

420
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,440
uses I'm going to keep doing

421
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,440
that oh my video is not g to play okay

422
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,159
so one of the uses you see across

423
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,480
especially Mainland southeast Asia is

424
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:18,080
its use of musical instruments so in

425
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,759
most countries you can find these

426
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:24,119
instruments by different names so we

427
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:28,960
have classification such as the zither

428
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:31,359
so the idea is you have this long stick

429
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,679
that has strings attached it can be

430
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:35,519
maybe one string it could be up to like

431
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,960
six to eight strings depending on the

432
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,798
country of origin but the really

433
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:44,000
important thing in most gour instruments

434
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:46,400
is that ax is a resonator and a lot of

435
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,240
instruments actually come from boards

436
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,679
originally so things like

437
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,440
banjos we have these Vietnamese uh loots

438
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:57,840
played by these th

439
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:02,200
women where the base of um the

440
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:05,918
instrument is the gourd and it also can

441
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:09,200
be used kind of as an amplifier with the

442
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:12,159
human body so in the case of the zither

443
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,279
here we're going to use our imaginations

444
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:16,760
but if this is my gourd resonator I can

445
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:19,480
hold this to my chest it's going to be

446
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:21,558
cut in half and as I play it this will

447
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,200
act as a resonator and then also my

448
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:25,720
chest is a resonator to increase the

449
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,558
volume so before we have Electronics you

450
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,200
know in the premodern era when we're

451
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,240
playing musical instruments gourds are

452
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,360
our natural amplifier so we can play to

453
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,798
a large audience and everyone can hear

454
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:42,079
us a second use that you might think of

455
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:44,839
gords being used as is garments so two

456
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:47,798
um of the more common examples is in the

457
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:54,720
Philippines these T bangal

458
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:59,079
hats and also in Pap in West Papua um as

459
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:01,120
ctia so this would be a common Bo you

460
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:05,158
might use for these traditional Filipino

461
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:07,959
hats um typically again you cut these in

462
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:11,600
half you'd braid up some re to act as a

463
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,880
soft interior and depending on where

464
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:16,119
you're going to wear it you might just

465
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,080
keep it plain um and use some sort of

466
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:20,719
resin to preserve it um and wear out in

467
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:23,000
the field or if you're going to wear

468
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,400
this for a special occasion you might

469
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,400
carve into it create designs you might

470
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:32,759
paint it and unfortunately

471
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,240
um a lot of times doing due to Imperial

472
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:36,319
um powers in a lot of these Southeast

473
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:40,679
Asian countries be colonized many of

474
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:44,960
these practices are dying out so um this

475
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:46,640
uh Filipino man uh T tiil Garcia he is

476
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,600
one of the last people actually making

477
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,759
these hats in all of the

478
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:55,399
Philippines um same thing with the use

479
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:57,798
of the cotia in west Papa um it's very

480
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,679
important culturally this is like the

481
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:03,480
tradition tral garment that men will

482
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,919
wear um you might use something like

483
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,558
this to make your

484
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:11,320
cotita um depending on the shape you

485
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:14,678
want which partially does um correlates

486
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:17,319
to tribal identity you may um keep it

487
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:20,400
curled you probably don't want it this

488
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:21,839
curled um but typically you might have

489
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,880
something you might wrap this around a

490
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,519
log if you want it straight you tie a

491
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,679
small rock to the end so it grows

492
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:30,359
straight then once you get your desired

493
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,919
shape you're going to harvest your Gorge

494
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:36,079
put it on coals gut it out and then you

495
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:39,320
let it smoke uh in the roof of the men's

496
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:41,720
house until it's preserved after that

497
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:44,798
you might decorate it um so here are

498
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:48,759
these canak warriors uh I believe this

499
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:50,839
one has a like braided ratton covering

500
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:53,599
um this one's a little bit more um

501
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:56,759
simple in design people might put Furs

502
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:59,199
on it they might paint them um and part

503
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:02,079
of it is for use whether you're at a

504
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,519
festival versus working out in the field

505
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,879
um and part of it is also the tribal

506
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:09,200
identity as I said

507
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:13,080
before so another place we see gourds is

508
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:15,120
as amulets and as relics and this photo

509
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:17,798
here is when I actually took in Thailand

510
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:20,319
when I was visiting a farm that grows

511
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:24,200
bours which there they called

512
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:26,038
n and they're seen as a sort of

513
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,480
protector so at Each corner of their

514
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:29,879
house they actually had one of these

515
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:35,599
gourds hanging um and it's supposed to

516
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:37,960
kind of Ward out um evil into their farm

517
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,519
and um you know keep their plants

518
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,798
growing

519
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:44,519
well and although this is not part of

520
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:48,558
Southeast

521
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:50,639
Asia um there are also a lot of um

522
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,759
Chinese communities that over the

523
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,880
centuries have come to live in Southeast

524
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:59,319
Asia and in many of the chinat towns and

525
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,360
other communities you can find these

526
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:06,879
especially near um new years's where in

527
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:10,479
China um from what the I was told by the

528
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,600
ladies is typically bours are meant to

529
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,200
bring Good Fortune to you so you might

530
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:16,918
hang a bagour in your house in a car or

531
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,120
to bring your family more money for the

532
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:19,120
new

533
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:26,879
year another way that uh bours are in

534
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,519
Southeast Asia sort of this religious

535
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,000
folklore

536
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:35,759
um area is in these uh people of the

537
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,558
gourd stories so there's this idea that

538
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,879
um mostly Mainland southeast Asia that

539
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:43,960
people actually came from the gourds and

540
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,919
depending on how the people exited the

541
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:49,759
gourds says something about the social

542
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:54,120
ranking of people so in one

543
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:56,119
mythology um the gourd is pierced twice

544
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:59,239
once just kind of drilled and once with

545
00:23:56,119 --> 00:24:01,319
a hot iron rod out of the side that's

546
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,120
just drilled come people of lighter

547
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:05,960
complexion out of the side that's uh

548
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:08,399
charred come people with darker

549
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:11,360
complexion and from this and the way

550
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,960
they come out kind of talks

551
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:18,158
about how people are viewed at that time

552
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,519
and these myths change over time so in

553
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,640
some of the older versions you see more

554
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:26,038
traditional communities of Southeast

555
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,360
Asia named um and once you get into more

556
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:30,558
modern eras you might start to see

557
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:33,319
Americans and French and other people

558
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:34,599
being added into the stories as people

559
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:36,678
from different countries come into

560
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:40,240
southeast

561
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:44,000
Asia another place is an architecture so

562
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:49,278
here we have um the bipua pagota in

563
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,960
Myanmar and also wat cuta in ching maai

564
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,919
and besides an architecture you can also

565
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,880
see these shapes in a lot of pottery as

566
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,440
well so if you can use some of your

567
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,520
imagination

568
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,720
a bour something like this might have

569
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:05,440
inspired this

570
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,519
W and maybe something like this would be

571
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,519
the inspiration for the bip

572
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:16,759
pooda but as you look across southeast

573
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:18,960
Asia you can start to see all these

574
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:21,519
similarities to the Bobble

575
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,038
gour so I'm telling you all these

576
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:26,158
historical

577
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:29,679
uses of botle gours but what does this

578
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,679
really have to do with plant breeding

579
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,559
well when when plant breing is defined

580
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:39,079
we also think about things about you

581
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:41,960
know maximizing positive genetic traits

582
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:45,918
higher production resistance to P paths

583
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:49,079
and drought but what does plant buring

584
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:51,480
really mean so one thing I'd like

585
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:53,079
everybody to do at the end of this

586
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,480
presentation is take out a piece of

587
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:57,398
paper and write down your definition of

588
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,480
plant breeding and think about what

589
00:25:57,398 --> 00:26:01,639
plant breeding really means to each of

590
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,240
you because when I read some of these

591
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,799
definitions that tend to be more

592
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,079
technical it's not quite how I Envision

593
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:08,079
plant

594
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,519
breeding and when I think about plant

595
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:16,918
breeding I feel like The Missing Link in

596
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:19,519
some of these definitions is the people

597
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:21,480
yes having res dis resistance diseases

598
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:24,000
drought tolerance does help people in

599
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,599
the way but it doesn't really think

600
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,960
holistically about how that those

601
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:30,959
changes change the systems they go

602
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:37,479
into so as I've been characterizing the

603
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,120
USDA bog work collection and taking some

604
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,798
of these cours work in southeast stage

605
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:45,359
of History it's really changed my

606
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:48,158
perspective of how I think about plant

607
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,719
breeding so just to give a few

608
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:54,919
examples of things I've started thinking

609
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:58,640
about um so one is thinking

610
00:26:54,919 --> 00:27:00,559
about how gene flow and bottlenecks

611
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,038
mimics how this crop has been

612
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:04,759
transported to different countries can

613
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:07,440
we look at some of these trade routes

614
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:10,879
between countries in Southeast Asia but

615
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,960
also to Africa to China to Europe and

616
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:18,200
see how these crops are moving and maybe

617
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:20,960
see points of genetic diversity or

618
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:25,759
mutations another thing with

619
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,840
characterizing um is some of these uses

620
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:30,278
have phenotypes that we might not first

621
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,759
think about using a gourd as a resonator

622
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:33,159
well what makes a good resonator is a

623
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:35,200
phenotype that we should be capturing

624
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:36,360
that's important to people it's not

625
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,600
something I probably would have thought

626
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:40,319
of firsthand but there's all these

627
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:42,119
traits that may be very important to

628
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,200
these communities culturally that we're

629
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:46,239
not capturing if we don't capture them

630
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,558
in the germ plasm diversity there's a

631
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,960
potential that these traits will no

632
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:49,960
longer

633
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,159
exist and you know here thinking again

634
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:58,960
about culture and you know a lot of

635
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:01,278
these can kind of relate into plant

636
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,880
breeding so obviously you know we think

637
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:06,278
most about food but thinking about folk

638
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,320
art and

639
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:09,720
celebrations you know that's maybe not

640
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:11,678
something we first think about in plant

641
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,558
breeding but these things are really

642
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,559
important to different

643
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:21,679
communities so with

644
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:25,359
that thank you for listening to my

645
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:29,240
presentation and do you guys have any

646
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:31,678
questions yeah TRS

647
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,278
any de for

648
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:38,679
how much of

649
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:42,679
like say

650
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:42,679
already you say majority

651
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,960
still so I mean I can only speak to what

652
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:54,879
the usdaa has because that's what I've

653
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:57,360
most been working with

654
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:01,559
um there are quite there's a lot of

655
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:04,079
phenotypes present and um there is about

656
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:07,319
174 accessions that are currently

657
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:09,839
available that we used in the trials and

658
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:11,200
I guess one of the benefits slash some

659
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:14,359
of the hard things working some times

660
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:17,038
with the USA germplasm is it's not

661
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:18,158
always uniform and a lot of it the

662
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:19,839
accessions are a little bit more like

663
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,120
populations than they are like a

664
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:23,599
breeding line or a cultivar so I think

665
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:27,439
because of that we're capturing a lot

666
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:30,519
more of the diversity um unfortunately

667
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,240
there's still like we only had one or

668
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:35,599
two accessions from Southeast

669
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,079
Asia I think we still capture some of

670
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:38,439
that diversity we see in Southeast Asia

671
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:40,599
but I don't know if maybe there's

672
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,278
different mutations that are causing

673
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:43,599
maybe the same trait that we're not

674
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:44,919
capturing looking at like the genc

675
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:47,879
diversity

676
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:49,600
standpoint um one thing I'm trying to do

677
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,120
is start looking at germplasm

678
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:54,359
collections um in other countries and

679
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:57,879
think about maybe capturing the genetic

680
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:59,439
diversity and working with them um but

681
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,480
that's I guess that's kind of my C

682
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,919
concern

683
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,519
is there's definitely certain countries

684
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:06,240
that are like very represented and ones

685
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:08,399
that have very little representation and

686
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,240
I I mean if you don't have it you don't

687
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,079
know what's really there and if it's

688
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,759
really something different or if it's

689
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:15,519
really the same as what is it from these

690
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:17,798
other

691
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:20,798
countries any other

692
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:20,798
questions

693
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:28,158
Ed I guess you didn't talk very much

694
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:30,398
about um using them for fishing

695
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,919
yeah as a as a

696
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:35,158
bob when I was thinking archaeology many

697
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:37,278
many years ago this is what the argument

698
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:42,200
was they were used as early science

699
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:45,038
fishing is that still hold you know not

700
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:50,480
water yeah yeah

701
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:53,720
I in um for when I wrote this the paper

702
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,919
related to this talk for my class it

703
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,519
didn't really I didn't really get

704
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:58,320
anything for fishing as far as southeast

705
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:00,159
Asia I have heard about using them in

706
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:03,119
Bobbers and I think people still do

707
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,639
quite often um and I think part of that

708
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:08,518
might just be like the sources I was

709
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:11,000
able to access um and I wish I could

710
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:12,679
like look at more archives but I only

711
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,798
speak a little bit of

712
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:17,240
Thai um but I think if I was able to

713
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:18,398
kind of go into those archives and look

714
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,000
more I would be able to find a much

715
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:24,759
larger diversity of their uses as

716
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:30,679
well o this is something I think about a

717
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:35,638
lot um so most of the Collection comes

718
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:39,600
from Africa I believe

719
00:31:35,638 --> 00:31:42,000
Zimbabwe and then from India and then

720
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:44,079
there's kind of a smattering of things

721
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,240
from the Middle East a couple from

722
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:47,759
Southeast Asia and a few from

723
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,480
Europe

724
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,638
um there are a couple

725
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,200
collections I believe the world

726
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:58,599
vegetable Center has quite a few quite a

727
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,159
few um accessions from Southeast Asia so

728
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:01,519
there's a potential that that area is

729
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,880
maybe a little bit more covered but just

730
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:08,440
not in the USDA

731
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:13,320
context um other countries I'm not so

732
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:15,679
sure of um and there is use of balls on

733
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:22,038
every single continent except for maybe

734
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:24,480
Antarctica um but um not into the gas I

735
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:28,158
think it's used in Africa and through

736
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:31,519
Asia um I'm very interested in doing

737
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:33,679
exploration especially to see what

738
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,558
farmers are still currently

739
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,399
using um unfortunately from my

740
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:41,079
experience trying to submit plant

741
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:43,759
exploration proposals it's quite

742
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:45,798
difficult um and one of the really big

743
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:48,519
barriers is they want you to have

744
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:51,079
experience going a plant exploration um

745
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:52,558
but there's very few people left who

746
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:55,599
have gone these Explorations and would

747
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:57,519
like to continue doing them um so I

748
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:00,439
would say that's kind of the big barrier

749
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,359
right now um for doing some more

750
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,159
collections but I

751
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:06,558
think um just doing some more work

752
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:10,639
figuring out what maybe smaller

753
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:12,759
collection exists May um may not need to

754
00:33:10,638 --> 00:33:15,519
actually do a plan

755
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:17,200
exploration great than for your

756
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:21,120
answer

757
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:23,440
yeah just wondering Y semar is fantastic

758
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:27,518
reminded me a little bit of like last

759
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:29,880
week pleas I love this febrary have a

760
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,319
cost I'm wondering for

761
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:37,360
your disertation what do you see other

762
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:41,319
chapters of vision over scope

763
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:43,879
oh that's a good question so I'm still

764
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:48,000
kind of debating how I want to split my

765
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:50,039
dissertation um so part of the work I'm

766
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,038
doing I want to create a formal crop

767
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:55,000
characterization guide for bottle gourds

768
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:57,158
because there are no formal crop

769
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,558
descriptors and as I've been going

770
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:02,240
through previous studies that look at

771
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:04,759
bours it's really hard to tell um

772
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,960
whether this shape is really the same

773
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:08,239
shape where they're talking about

774
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:11,119
something slightly different um so I'm

775
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:13,358
hoping that that will be a chapter um

776
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:16,280
for the USDA collection we took Leaf

777
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:18,799
tissue samples for Dart seek um so

778
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:22,480
hoping to look at a frequency and

779
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:24,280
hopefully run a gows um as well the

780
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,320
third chapter is a little bit up in the

781
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,519
air there's potential I kind of would

782
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,079
like to talk about some of the cultural

783
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:32,759
aspects of this because I think it's a

784
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,039
really important thing um I've been

785
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,079
trying to do a lot of research looking

786
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:37,800
at the care and fair principles and

787
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,519
maybe trying to write something talking

788
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:43,200
about this project and those principles

789
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:45,440
and thinking about characterizing these

790
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:47,239
more traditional vegetable

791
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,760
crops okay thank you for the

792
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:52,158
introduction Charlie um once again I am

793
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,960
Savannah Dale I am from Mike and Joyce F

794
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,480
xlabs and today I'm going to be tell you

795
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,800
telling you about some work that I've

796
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,000
been doing doing adapting a practical

797
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,480
hype graph for imputation in sweet

798
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,440
corn so sort of to give you some

799
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:10,920
background on this work um low vitamin

800
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:14,358
intake is a modern food challenge in the

801
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,400
USA um and by low vitamin intake I don't

802
00:35:14,358 --> 00:35:19,598
mean clinical levels of low vitamin

803
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:23,800
intake but sub recommended levels of

804
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,800
vitamin intake um so a few

805
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,800
[Music]

806
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,240
um

807
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,079
a few compounds that we're really

808
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:32,519
interested in in sweet corn are

809
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:35,560
provitamin a

810
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:38,358
carotenoids antioxidant carotenoids and

811
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:40,960
vitamin E so these compounds when you

812
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:42,598
don't get enough of these in your diet

813
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,599
what can happen is you can have

814
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:48,760
increased risks of um conditions such as

815
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:51,240
blindness maternal mortality um or

816
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:54,240
increased risk of cardiovascular

817
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:56,358
disease and sweet corn offers a great

818
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:59,519
opportunity for addressing some of these

819
00:35:56,358 --> 00:36:02,598
issues because sweet corn is a very

820
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:05,719
popularly consumed vegetable in the US

821
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:08,039
um as of 2019 it was the sixth most

822
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:11,078
consumed vegetable according to the

823
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:14,400
USDA um and it also has natural

824
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:16,800
variation for these fresh kernel

825
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,760
nutrient quality traits including

826
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,760
vitamin E and

827
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,560
carotenoids so um previous work that has

828
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:28,039
been done in the gor laab has used a

829
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:30,119
sweet corn and bread Association and

830
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:33,880
radline Association panel that was

831
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:37,680
created by Bill Tracy Bill Tracy and

832
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:41,039
Matt besio um and this was used to

833
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:45,279
identify inbred lines that had Desir

834
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:47,559
desirable alals for um genes that we

835
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,079
know contribute to these fresh kernel

836
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:53,759
nutritional quality

837
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:56,920
traits so after we selected these inbred

838
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,480
lines um with desirable alals what we

839
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:02,079
did was created F1 biparental

840
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:05,599
populations and from here for the rest

841
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:08,240
of our breeding pipeline um we are

842
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,640
selfing these to the F5 generation at

843
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:13,959
which point we will conduct yield and

844
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:17,719
quality testing and uh generate high

845
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:21,519
vitamin and bread lines however as every

846
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:24,279
plant breeder knows um this we are

847
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:27,679
constrained by time and space so what we

848
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:29,480
want to do to speed up this pipe line is

849
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:32,318
integrate marker based selection in

850
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,838
early Generations so keep in mind these

851
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:36,318
will be highly

852
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:39,400
heterozygous individuals that we want to

853
00:37:36,318 --> 00:37:41,000
perform this selection in um ideally our

854
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,200
F2

855
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,838
generation and this necessitates a

856
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:49,039
method for efficient genotype

857
00:37:46,838 --> 00:37:51,119
amputation so this is where the

858
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:53,279
Practical haplotype graph which was

859
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,800
created in the buckler lab comes into

860
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,280
play this can be used to accurately

861
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,240
imput impute genotypes from skim

862
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:03,400
sequence

863
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:06,199
data so just to give you a very very

864
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:10,480
brief overview of a phg I wish I had

865
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:12,799
more time to go into this but a phg is

866
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,159
when we say graph this is what we mean

867
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,960
by the graph it is a graph of different

868
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:20,399
consensus sequences that have been

869
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:23,519
created from um a starting panel in this

870
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:27,240
case a pangenome of different maze

871
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:29,880
accessions for each region and in the

872
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:32,759
genome and the number of regions is

873
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:36,838
variable depending on who who creates

874
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:40,040
the phg and also what the end user

875
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:42,679
wants so the way this works is we would

876
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:45,239
start out with our reference genome here

877
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:47,879
so for Maze this would be something like

878
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:51,399
b73 um and then a low coverage whole

879
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:54,519
genome sequence um genome this would be

880
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:57,000
the accession that we want to impute and

881
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:59,159
the reference we would align to this to

882
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,760
the reference this reference genome is

883
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:03,679
the same reference genome that was used

884
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:07,280
to create the phg that I showed

885
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:10,039
you so what happens is we split our low

886
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:13,440
coverage or skim sequencing data into

887
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:16,079
the same regions that the phg includes

888
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,599
and then we can actually compare each

889
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,680
region where we have known data so this

890
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:24,640
would be um the orange block the green

891
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:26,960
block and the Blue Block we can compare

892
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:29,559
these to our PhD say this is okay this

893
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,039
is most similar to the orange Block in

894
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:33,838
the PHD

895
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:36,000
itself um the green block is most

896
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:38,599
similar to The Green Block the green

897
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,679
consensus sequence in the PHD and the

898
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:43,119
Blue Block is the same as this blue

899
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:44,719
consensus sequence but we have this area

900
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,838
of missing

901
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:50,719
data here in our scam

902
00:39:48,838 --> 00:39:53,838
sequencing

903
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:56,639
um and what we want to do is use the PHD

904
00:39:53,838 --> 00:40:00,559
to predict or impute what the this

905
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:02,279
missing data is so the PHD uses this

906
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:05,318
graph of consensus

907
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:08,480
sequences um and uses a hidden marov

908
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:11,400
model and a viit by algorithm to

909
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:15,318
actually predict the most likely path

910
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:18,240
through these consensus sequences to

911
00:40:15,318 --> 00:40:22,039
then predict okay this is the most

912
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:24,279
likely hype that we see in this region

913
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:27,519
where we're missing

914
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:30,839
information so then we can

915
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:35,000
fill in the blanks so to

916
00:40:30,838 --> 00:40:36,759
speak but the use of a PhD raises a lot

917
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,519
of questions and I think the biggest one

918
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:44,040
is does the PHD that you're using need

919
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:46,318
to include your population Founders so

920
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:47,920
that's the big question for me um I've

921
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:51,480
been working with the buckler lab using

922
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,318
their maze Pang genum PhD but this

923
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,838
doesn't include any of my sweet corn

924
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:58,318
population Founders so is there enough

925
00:40:55,838 --> 00:41:00,679
genetic representation in it to perform

926
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:03,400
imputation in my

927
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:06,879
populations so what I'm starting out

928
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:11,559
with is I have nine sweet corn and bread

929
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:15,000
Founders which I have 72x wgs data for

930
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:19,039
my four by parental populations of about

931
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,239
200 individuals each which I have 8X wgs

932
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:25,719
data for and then I have this control

933
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:30,159
IIA 453 line um from the rende lab which

934
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:32,598
I have 22x wgs data for and then I like

935
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:36,399
I said am using an existing maze panum

936
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:40,519
PhD from the buckler lab um and then I

937
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,559
want to impute genotypes for my

938
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:46,880
populations at the

939
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:50,000
end but I need to test if this phg has

940
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:53,318
enough genetic reputation representation

941
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:58,119
to accurately impute genotypes in my F2

942
00:41:53,318 --> 00:42:01,159
progyny so to start with I am using this

943
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:04,559
method this pipeline that I have here to

944
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:07,199
input my nine inbred sweet corn Founders

945
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:09,880
um so I'm not doing anything with my f2s

946
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:11,719
at this point just to clarify as well as

947
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:15,318
my control line and this is very high

948
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:17,639
coverage full genome sequencing data um

949
00:42:15,318 --> 00:42:20,599
I aligned it to the maze pan genome so

950
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:24,679
this is my reference genome um and then

951
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:27,000
I'm using the existing maze panum phg to

952
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:30,639
predict hype path

953
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:34,639
or impute genotypes for my Founders and

954
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:36,719
my control line here um and this IIA 453

955
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:38,719
is my control line because it is one of

956
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:41,519
the three sweet cornex sessions that

957
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:44,959
were used to create the Pang genum

958
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:48,280
PhD um so ideally it would perform

959
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,519
better than any of my lines so once I

960
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,680
have these predicted hype pths I'm

961
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:56,559
converting them into pseudo references

962
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:58,919
which is a term that Ed very um

963
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:01,400
wonderfully gave to me so thank you Ed

964
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:05,159
if you're still here

965
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:07,838
um and then aligning these pseudo

966
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:09,920
references which is basically just a

967
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:13,558
fasta of my

968
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:17,240
predicted genomes for each of these

969
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:19,160
lines to the actual sequence data and

970
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:22,199
then I'm calling variance from those

971
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:23,920
alignments so what this is doing is

972
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:26,960
allowing me to look at the differences

973
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:30,800
between the predicted sequence and the

974
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:33,039
actual sequence so if the the imputation

975
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,160
works perfectly I would expect there to

976
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:39,239
be no difference between my actual data

977
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:41,399
and my imputed data um but what we can

978
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:43,919
more realistically expect is that in my

979
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:47,039
pseudo reference the imputed founder

980
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,680
sequence um there will be gaps or mis

981
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:52,239
calls in this

982
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:54,000
sequence so what I I did I ran the

983
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:56,799
pipeline that I've shared with you so

984
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,000
far um and then I looked at the number

985
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,559
of snips that were called so these are

986
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:06,639
the number of variant between the actual

987
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:09,960
and imputed sequence um and got a lot of

988
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:12,679
information but we're still working on

989
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,679
how to really interpret this um what

990
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:17,799
does this mean but I'd like to draw your

991
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:21,558
attention specifically to um I sub

992
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:25,440
sectioned out this graph and converted

993
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:28,640
it to show snip percentages so on this y

994
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,720
AIS I have snip rate or percentage of

995
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:34,879
snips um of all base pairs that were

996
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:39,239
imputed how many are imputed incorrectly

997
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,240
so this is ranging from a little under

998
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,200
0.006% up to

999
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:48,240
0.00 uh

1000
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:48,239
17% incorrect

1001
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:55,039
imputations um oh I would also like to

1002
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:56,799
point out this IA 453 again is my

1003
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:59,159
control line and this is what I expected

1004
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,160
to perform the best so when we're

1005
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:03,799
interpreting these we want them to all

1006
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:05,440
be zero everything should be zero in

1007
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:08,079
this graph if it was a perfect

1008
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,119
imputation that's not what we're seeing

1009
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,720
and I'm also seeing my control line did

1010
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:15,960
not perform as well as I would have

1011
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:18,719
expected it to and I hypothesized that

1012
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:21,000
this could be due to um the

1013
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:25,558
representation of sorn that is in the

1014
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:29,079
Pang genum PhD um particularly so here's

1015
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:31,640
my control line uh which again is one of

1016
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:35,559
the sweet Corin lines that were May used

1017
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:36,759
to create the Pang on phg along with P39

1018
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:40,280
and i1

1019
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:44,160
14h um what I would have expected is

1020
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:46,119
that fa 56a which is my founder that

1021
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:48,679
performed the best out of everything

1022
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:50,358
would be more more closely related to

1023
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:53,399
one of the sweet corn lines that was

1024
00:45:50,358 --> 00:45:55,920
used to create the Pang on PhD but

1025
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,000
that's not what I'm seeing based on this

1026
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,838
philogenetic tree that was created by

1027
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,838
Vincent col Antonio formerly of the Rend

1028
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:07,960
day lab so thank you Vincent

1029
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:07,960
um so that is my

1030
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:15,719
hypothesis so what I'm doing now um I've

1031
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:19,960
showed you this Pipeline and just a few

1032
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:23,439
of my results from my work so far um and

1033
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:26,000
I am actually adding that information

1034
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,559
from I use the variants so those

1035
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,679
differences or miscalled Snips between

1036
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:34,680
my imputed and my actual sequences added

1037
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:37,679
that information back into the PHD so

1038
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:40,679
now we have an updated Pango PhD with

1039
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:43,000
information from my sweet corn Founders

1040
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:45,399
and I'm performing the same steps again

1041
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,199
and what I would expect to see is this

1042
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,160
is what we saw before where I have these

1043
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:50,519
pseudo

1044
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:52,879
references um where I have gaps and

1045
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:56,039
mistakes I would expect to still see

1046
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:59,760
some mistakes in the new amputation that

1047
00:46:56,039 --> 00:47:02,679
I'm in that I'm generating but fewer

1048
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,559
because the PHD database has been

1049
00:47:02,679 --> 00:47:07,919
updated with new

1050
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:10,079
information um unfortunately I have not

1051
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,519
completed this at this stage so you guys

1052
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:16,079
will have to stay tuned for

1053
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:19,358
later but the eventual goal is to then

1054
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,240
use the existing phg an updated version

1055
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:25,960
of the

1056
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:29,399
PHD um to as well as another very common

1057
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:32,519
ly used method of utation and compare

1058
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:36,318
these and their utation accuracy in my

1059
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:39,280
F2 progyny sequences my skim sequence

1060
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:41,279
data so with that I would like to thank

1061
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,200
the gore lab the Rend day lab the

1062
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:47,160
buckler lab especially for all of their

1063
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:48,439
help with this work um and all of my

1064
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:51,118
funding

1065
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,559
sources and I will take any questions at

1066
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,720
this

1067
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:57,040
time yeah

1068
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:59,679
Travis

1069
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:02,679
are you planning for your error

1070
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:02,679
rates

1071
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:11,318
distrib yeah that's a really qu good

1072
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:13,598
question so the question was am I

1073
00:48:11,318 --> 00:48:15,880
looking at distributions of error rates

1074
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:18,359
whether they're occurring in genic

1075
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,880
regions or intergenic regions what

1076
00:48:18,358 --> 00:48:23,759
regions of the genome are we seeing the

1077
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:25,838
most error and amputation in um and the

1078
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,520
answer is yes I will be doing that but

1079
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:30,239
have not done that so far so that's a

1080
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:32,440
really good question because if the

1081
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:35,318
errors are occurring in mostly

1082
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:37,679
intergenic regions it might not matter

1083
00:48:35,318 --> 00:48:40,920
and this is a very good point for PhD

1084
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:43,399
users is how much accuracy do you

1085
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:46,119
actually need to be able to get the data

1086
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:47,519
that you need for your project right um

1087
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:50,640
so that's a question that I want to

1088
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:53,679
answer with my work um but also

1089
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:55,239
especially in my case we know if we have

1090
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:57,558
some particular low side that we're

1091
00:48:55,239 --> 00:49:00,759
interested Ed in if we have good

1092
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:03,640
amputation and those lowai then we're

1093
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:05,799
probably okay to move forward so thank

1094
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:07,719
you good

1095
00:49:05,798 --> 00:49:11,599
question yes

1096
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:16,078
Ed again I really like that but I wonder

1097
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,079
theal scale' be

1098
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:22,879
very I think there lot of hidden Mark

1099
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:26,119
models can

1100
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:31,480
absolutely weird re The genome is bad to

1101
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:31,480
read probably go off the rails

1102
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:42,440
and yeah yeah thank you Ed which again

1103
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:44,400
is supporting what Travis said that

1104
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:47,679
looking at where these mistakes are

1105
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,838
occurring is really important um and

1106
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:53,199
also if these are occurring in rare

1107
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:56,599
alals which this is also a really good

1108
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:58,558
point because part of this is if you are

1109
00:49:56,599 --> 00:50:01,160
really looking at rare alals then you

1110
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:05,559
want to have a low error rate in your

1111
00:50:01,159 --> 00:50:07,039
rare alals um but and in particular

1112
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:10,319
that's important when you're looking at

1113
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:12,279
very highly heterozygous lines like I am

1114
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:14,880
as

1115
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:18,000
well this has been a production of

1116
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:21,000
Cornell University on the web at

1117
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
cornell.edu
