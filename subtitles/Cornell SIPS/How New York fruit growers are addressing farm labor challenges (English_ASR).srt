1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,360
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:15,798
University uh what I'd like to do uh

3
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:19,519
with my time here today is to uh talk

4
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:22,000
about a survey that uh I and others have

5
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:26,160
been very involved with over the last

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,359
year and to give you the survey results

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:34,000
and both uh are some very to very

8
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,039
specific questions and most of the uh

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,200
information will be presented in charts

10
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:40,878
on the very specific questions and then

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,359
we had some o open-ended questions that

12
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:46,920
also created uh and

13
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:50,000
generated some very good information

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,480
about what Growers are thinking and then

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,238
uh before I finish up uh Andy mentioned

16
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:58,238
immigration reform I want to put some of

17
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:01,238
the things that we found in this survey

18
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:03,280
in the context of immigration reform

19
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:06,359
because that is so much on the mind of

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,000
Growers today and uh has so much

21
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:12,840
relevance to the future of labor

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,840
intensive agriculture like like apple

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,840
growing

24
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:25,399
um let me start by uh recognizing the

25
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:29,280
co-authors of this study uh first of all

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,960
uh is Paul Baker Paul is the executive

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,519
director of the New York State

28
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,919
Horticultural

29
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:40,798
Society uh Paul said that Paul actually

30
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:44,840
came to me and and asked if we could do

31
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,280
this survey and he said that he would um

32
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,920
help get the survey out and get the

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,718
responses back which he did Allison

34
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,519
dearie uh retired over the last year as

35
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:58,438
a regional fruit specialist but her

36
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,840
background uh in Fruit production and

37
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:05,000
economics uh was very very invaluable to

38
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,079
this project uh Nicole ho uh was a grad

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,520
student from the Dyson school who helped

40
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:13,120
do data analysis um I took the

41
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,719
leadership on uh writing the report

42
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:21,000
which will be out shortly and Brad

43
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:24,800
Rickard helped with uh with the uh data

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,680
analysis and the manuscript uh review

45
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,680
and input uh on the report

46
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:39,719
so let me tell you about what we did and

47
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:43,439
and let me first say that um Paul Baker

48
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:45,598
in the hord society spends a lot of his

49
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,318
time uh working with the labor

50
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,679
department and other government agencies

51
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:53,280
getting them to

52
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:57,879
understand uh horiculture and in this

53
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:00,360
case uh the Apple industry and uh one of

54
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:04,679
the things that one of his his

55
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,519
motivations was that if he has specific

56
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,920
information about what goes on in the

57
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:13,799
orchard he can help uh inform the

58
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:15,318
process of regulating through uh labor

59
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,200
department and other

60
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:21,439
agencies um the other motivation the

61
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:23,878
motivation for us in extension is to

62
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:26,598
have a data set and be able to say

63
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:29,239
something more about the industry and

64
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:31,759
about Workforce issues in the Apple

65
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:35,158
industry then what our government data

66
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:37,199
sets uh give us today yes we get labor

67
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:39,519
information from the Census and we get

68
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,798
some from the New York New York EG

69
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:45,120
statistics and there is something called

70
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:48,680
the the agricultural workers survey uh

71
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:52,000
out of uh out of Washington but none of

72
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:57,400
those give us the detail that we can get

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:01,280
when we do a survey such as this um so

74
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:04,560
we uh Paul through the Hort Society took

75
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:08,239
the initiative to uh mail out

76
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,959
480 surveys to Apple Growers who

77
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,920
contribute to the New York State Apple

78
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,759
order for

79
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:18,120
promotion uh we asked it was a

80
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:21,000
three-page survey we asked the Growers

81
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:26,360
to report their information based on the

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:30,439
2013 growing season we got uh 955 usable

83
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:33,319
responses back about 20% uh response

84
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:36,079
rate we were fairly pleased with that

85
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:38,038
and uh one of the things that I want to

86
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,359
point out right up front especially with

87
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:43,319
so many grad students in the audience is

88
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:47,439
that this is not a random

89
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:51,120
sample uh this is 95 Growers who self-

90
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:54,038
selected to return our survey form and

91
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,478
as a result uh we have to be careful

92
00:04:54,038 --> 00:05:00,240
about expanding to the entire industry

93
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:03,399
because um I'll give you one example

94
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:08,439
here at the bottom of the slide um it

95
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:10,959
just so so happens that uh the many of

96
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:14,279
the people who decided to send this back

97
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:17,879
happen to be Growers who use the h2a

98
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:20,719
program about half of them so uh this is

99
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:24,439
not a random sample but nonetheless we

100
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,280
have uh more detailed information about

101
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:31,639
what's going on in on New York apple

102
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,638
farms uh than is available elsewhere

103
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:41,959
so the number of bearing acres per Farm

104
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:45,840
uh this slide uh gives you a sense that

105
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:50,879
um we did get responses from every size

106
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:53,799
group uh 19% were greater than 250 Acres

107
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:56,439
19% were also less than 20 acres and

108
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,079
then uh

109
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:03,399
distributed uh in between that as well

110
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:06,120
but no one group uh was is far larger

111
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:08,598
than the other in terms of size based on

112
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:12,800
Acres uh in the

113
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:16,839
survey um we asked for their threeyear

114
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,960
average annual Apple production and

115
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:22,000
specifically asked for the three-year

116
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:26,120
average because there was a a very poor

117
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:30,120
year with frost uh damage and cold

118
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:33,319
damage to the crop that uh really

119
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,680
reduced some people's yield a couple of

120
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:37,560
years ago so that's why we asked for the

121
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,720
three-year average and you can see how

122
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,720
that distributes uh as

123
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:50,160
well and then we asked for the total

124
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:52,918
number of workers and uh not

125
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,360
surprisingly the workers we've you can

126
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:58,399
see very visually there that the workers

127
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,120
are concentrated in the top two size

128
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:05,799
groups uh

129
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,800
100 to 250 acres and over 250

130
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:14,280
acres and then we did uh we asked each

131
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:17,918
grower what region that they produced in

132
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:20,399
and so um there are far more charts uh

133
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:23,318
that will be in the report than uh I'm

134
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:28,758
able to provide here today but we were

135
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:32,800
able to um to cross tab between regions

136
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:37,680
and get some interesting information and

137
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:39,439
uh so uh there are basically four uh

138
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,160
Apple growing regions in the State

139
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,639
Central and Western New York Northern

140
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,280
New York Eastern New York and Long

141
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,319
Island uh Long Island is not a very big

142
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:49,878
player in all this although Long Island

143
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,158
is a very

144
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:55,158
Horticultural uh spot for New York State

145
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:57,719
uh there aren't all that many apples

146
00:07:55,158 --> 00:08:00,240
grown on Long Island but this gives you

147
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:04,479
a sense of how many

148
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,840
uh how much response we got uh from all

149
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,839
over the state we only got five

150
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:12,038
responses from Northern New York but you

151
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:14,318
can see that up in that's the uh Lake

152
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:16,639
Champlain region there are there are

153
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,879
very few Farms up there but they account

154
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,879
for a lot of the Apple

155
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:29,000
production apple farms hiring uh h2a

156
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,439
workers and uh so I I alluded to this

157
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,200
earlier

158
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:40,080
48% said we hire on our Farm h2a Workers

159
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,278
um the other 52% said that they didn't

160
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,800
now one of the reasons why this is

161
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:50,360
important is uh there is that in that

162
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:54,199
52% very likely there are some Growers

163
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:57,240
who have some undocumented workers who

164
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:59,800
are working on their Farm anecdotally

165
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,560
what what I find from talking to grower

166
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:05,559
is even if you are in the h2a program

167
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:08,359
and hire some h2a workers you might also

168
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:12,838
have some non h2a workers that are

169
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:15,519
undocumented workers and so uh it's many

170
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,480
people have have looked at and discussed

171
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,399
the fact that even though we don't have

172
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:24,079
specific numbers undocumented workers

173
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:26,958
are not only a part of

174
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:28,679
uh labor intensive Agri all kinds of

175
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,879
labor intensive agriculture but they're

176
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:32,719
a part

177
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:33,559
uh likely of the New York Apple industry

178
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,959
as

179
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:40,359
well for those of you who may not be

180
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:42,199
familiar with the h2a program uh let me

181
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,680
just make a couple of comments about

182
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:48,640
that uh the h2a program is a Government

183
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:51,039
Federal Government run program operated

184
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:54,120
through the labor department that brings

185
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:56,559
in seasonal agricultural workers for

186
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,039
commercial farms in this country they

187
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:02,199
can come here for up to 10 months and

188
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,639
then go home this time of year Growers

189
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,120
are filling out their work orders and

190
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:10,120
planning ahead to get their workers for

191
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,120
the coming growing

192
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:19,759
season the home country of h2a workers

193
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,200
um primarily in this state U most of the

194
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:24,879
workers are coming from Mexico Andor

195
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,600
possibly other uh Central American

196
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,720
countries some are coming from there but

197
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,159
most of them are coming from Jamaica

198
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,160
and

199
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:38,719
um the I I will just go into more detail

200
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:41,639
in a few minutes but the h2a program is

201
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,600
very controversial uh it's

202
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:47,560
expensive and uh there's a lot of

203
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:51,200
paperwork and red tape involved in in

204
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:55,879
using the program uh so sometimes it's

205
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:58,720
criticized on the other hand uh if we

206
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:00,720
look at Lake the Lake Champlain area and

207
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,600
other areas to the state where Jamaican

208
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,278
workers come uh to work on apple farms

209
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,278
and we talk to The Growers we will find

210
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,720
that many times the Growers will say

211
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:13,600
that these Jamaican workers have come

212
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,639
here uh

213
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,159
for sometimes for decades for 20 30

214
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:22,600
years the same workers coming back to

215
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:25,039
work for 8 to 10 weeks uh they're very

216
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,000
productive they're very reliable from

217
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:30,480
the Grower's perspective and from the

218
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,639
worker perspective they can come for 8

219
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,560
weeks or 10 weeks and make a fair amount

220
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:39,278
of income compared to their income

221
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:43,799
potential at home and then have a much

222
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:45,919
better standard of living in their home

223
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:49,039
country the length of seasonal

224
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:52,479
employment uh this just tells you that

225
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:56,360
uh for those uh Growers that hire uh

226
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,079
seasonal workers 28% just hire Harvest

227
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,200
workers the other

228
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:05,719
72% uh hire workers throughout the

229
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:08,480
season for production various production

230
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,000
practices such as pruning and thinning

231
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,000
and other

232
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:18,320
operations using a crew leader um 26%

233
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
said that they did use a hired crew

234
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:25,120
leader and Allison de tells me that this

235
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,519
number has slowly decreased over the

236
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,519
years and continues to decrease

237
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:35,078
worker experience

238
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:39,040
requirements um now I want to go back to

239
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:42,120
Paul Baker and the hord society because

240
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,958
uh a few years ago with the h2a program

241
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,560
one of the things that happened and uh

242
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,039
policies change and rules change based

243
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:51,719
on political

244
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:53,000
administrations and for some reason in

245
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,440
the labor

246
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,039
department um the labor department

247
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:05,360
started to change their Phil philosophy

248
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:08,480
of what experience was needed uh for uh

249
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,159
Apple Pickers and and Orchard

250
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,079
workers

251
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,838
and uh

252
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:16,958
consequently a farmer a few Farmers

253
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:20,839
would farmers would put in their work

254
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:23,879
order and find out that and ask for a

255
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:25,639
lot of experience requirements and the

256
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:27,799
labor department said well you Pro you

257
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:29,959
don't need all these work requirements

258
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:33,519
and so we're going to they ended up

259
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:36,559
sending in some cases less experienced

260
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:39,959
workers and this created some concern in

261
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:43,278
the grower community and so the Growers

262
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:46,198
went to Paul Baker at the hord society

263
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:49,519
and said um we need to document the

264
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:51,879
kinds of experience that workers need

265
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,839
because these are not unskilled jobs and

266
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:58,720
so this next set of slides gives you

267
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:00,759
some idea of uh the kinds of experience

268
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:06,800
that Growers feel that they need when

269
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:08,720
they're hiring uh workers so um 35% said

270
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:11,359
no we can deal with the workforce the

271
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,720
way it is we don't need uh previous

272
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,639
experience but 65% said yes we

273
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,120
definitely need previous experience uh

274
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,079
for what we're trying to accomplish in

275
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,639
our

276
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:26,198
Orchard uh months of experience required

277
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:29,480
by types of work uh on the left hand

278
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:32,599
side you get a sense of the kinds of uh

279
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,839
um experience that is needed pruning

280
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:41,639
equipment operation tractor driving

281
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,639
picking uh for both fresh and for uh

282
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:50,359
process and then we have this whole list

283
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:53,078
of specific work experience requirements

284
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,879
some of which Growers not All Growers

285
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:59,078
ask for this but some Growers do ask for

286
00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:01,320
all of these pruning chainsaw operation

287
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:03,479
Etc all these different kinds of

288
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:07,000
experience they want the workers to have

289
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,920
had for productivity reasons before uh

290
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,919
they show up on the

291
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:17,120
job then there's a picking requirement

292
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:20,278
people want uh workers that can uh pick

293
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,120
quickly and without bruising and so

294
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:25,559
there's not only so there's two

295
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:28,600
components to that requirement one is to

296
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:32,000
uh be very productive and um pick

297
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:36,720
quickly and also not bruise the fruit

298
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,759
and uh so the average hours uh that we

299
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,278
found uh workers were working for

300
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:46,199
picking uh was

301
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:48,360
8.6 and they were doing all of these uh

302
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:52,399
they they might be asked to pick drop

303
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:56,519
apples uh they might be asked to uh do

304
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:58,559
fresh stem clipping spot picking uh

305
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:00,679
cleaning the whole tree and then picking

306
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:03,638
for process apples and the requirements

307
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:07,758
on how fast they do that depend upon how

308
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:12,198
how difficult or easy the job is to do

309
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:14,480
now um many of you may be familiar with

310
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:16,599
this but but I learned a few things as

311
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,920
an AG Economist doing this project and

312
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:23,079
one of the things I learned was about uh

313
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:26,919
fresh stem click clipping and if you

314
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:30,559
don't know what that is uh very often

315
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:34,399
you have a thin skinned Apple like honey

316
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:38,039
crisp and if you leave the stem on the

317
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:41,559
apple and that Apple gets in a bin with

318
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:43,838
other honey crisp apples the stem is

319
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:47,799
going to pierce the skin of the other

320
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:52,000
apples and so uh so the

321
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:55,078
worker uh the Picker is given a little

322
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,399
set of Clippers that look like uh small

323
00:16:55,078 --> 00:17:02,719
scissors and that is used to do the

324
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:05,798
picking so now we've made this job of

325
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,720
picking apples uh even more complex

326
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:10,720
because they have to clip the stem when

327
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,519
they pick the Apple instead of just uh

328
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,519
pulling it off the

329
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:24,759
tree how Apple Pickers get

330
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:28,880
paid um by say we we gave uh four

331
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:32,400
choices for this uh by the hour only 26

332
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:37,679
% said that's how they paid only by the

333
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:39,720
piece 14% said that and then 27% said we

334
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,798
have a combination of Peace rates and

335
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,880
hourly rates depending upon what we're

336
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:49,960
doing and how easy or difficult it is to

337
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,360
do the job and that also um goes to the

338
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,759
last one

339
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,879
depends uh means it depends upon how

340
00:17:54,759 --> 00:18:00,000
difficult it is to do the job uh if a

341
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:03,240
job gets difficult enough and you can't

342
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,960
make your piece rate by doing that job

343
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:09,240
it makes more sense for a grower to use

344
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:13,079
an hourly rate and so we have all

345
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:16,558
combinations of how Pickers get

346
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:19,798
paid wage rates so this will give you an

347
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:21,879
idea of wage rates for fresh apples and

348
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:27,119
this goes back to my comment about the

349
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:29,400
random sample uh if we had average wage

350
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,399
rates for the entire industry

351
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,320
they would be a bit lower than what you

352
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:37,000
see here but when you have 48% of The

353
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:44,119
Growers in the

354
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:48,000
survey um uh as h2a Growers the h2a rate

355
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:50,918
is uh I'm not sure what it was uh for

356
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,880
2013 but it's around $11 it was around

357
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:58,000
$111 per hour so these rates are very

358
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,919
likely higher than what would be the

359
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,480
average for the entire

360
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,799
industry uh I think wage rates are

361
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,079
really important that we keep an eye on

362
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,200
them and take a look at them examine

363
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:13,119
them uh I'm going to talk about

364
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,880
immigration reform in a minute uh one of

365
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:18,319
the big challenges that we have in

366
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,240
agriculture is paying enough to compete

367
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:25,319
with other Employers in the geographic

368
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:27,919
area that the business is in and so um

369
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:30,439
keeping an eye on and making sure our

370
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,679
wage rates are competitive is is an

371
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,320
important issue now and I think it's

372
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:35,200
going to become even more important in

373
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,798
the

374
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,440
future uh and this just gives you an

375
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:44,720
idea of what the peace rates are peace

376
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:47,400
rates uh generally are um by 20 Push bin

377
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:53,440
and this gives you an indication of

378
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:57,919
those as well and uh as the rate as the

379
00:19:53,440 --> 00:20:00,000
uh job gets more difficult uh we start

380
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,919
with cleaning the entire tree is the

381
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,359
easiest job and so that rate's a little

382
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,919
lower and that goes all the way up to a

383
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:10,959
much higher rate for fresh Sten uh

384
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:10,960
clipping when that is required in the

385
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:19,158
orchard

386
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:22,200
now one of the things one of the

387
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:24,960
opportunities we have and this this is a

388
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,798
good example of the kinds of information

389
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:32,558
that we cannot get from other government

390
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:36,038
data sets and that is the um we can ask

391
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:38,480
in a survey like this what are your

392
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:42,279
worker shortage issues do you have

393
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,839
worker shortage issues and I don't have

394
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:47,119
I don't have my slide I don't have the

395
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:50,119
slide here for the whole group but what

396
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:55,158
that slide says is that

397
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:59,000
36% of The Growers said uh in the in the

398
00:20:55,159 --> 00:21:00,760
whole of all those who responded 36% %

399
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,480
said that that they were short of

400
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:09,798
workers in 2013 and this gives you a bit

401
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:11,599
of an idea of uh of a Breakout by region

402
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:14,319
of who said they were short of workers

403
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:16,038
and who said that they had uh sufficient

404
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:18,359
workers and Central New York and

405
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:22,038
Northern New York indicated that they

406
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:22,038
were most short of

407
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:29,599
workers then we asked them along these

408
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:31,720
same lines uh what was the average

409
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:34,240
number of additional workers that you

410
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,200
would have hired if they were available

411
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:41,599
for your farm in

412
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:44,000
2013 and you can see that uh in in some

413
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,399
of the smaller Farms that started out

414
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,278
with two workers and the Very largest

415
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,000
farm said they would have hired uh

416
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:54,400
almost 11 workers full-time equivalent

417
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,278
wise uh to work on the farm if those

418
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,278
workers were available

419
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:05,038
then we went one step further and said

420
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,159
well what do you as you look at your

421
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:09,519
Workforce needs in the future what are

422
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,360
you

423
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:14,038
anticipating and uh how many employees

424
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:17,719
do you think that you'll need three

425
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:22,480
years from now uh fewer less or stays

426
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:24,640
the same and 74% said um that they are

427
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,240
were anticipating with the needs of

428
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,240
their business that they were going to

429
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,400
need more employees than what they hire

430
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:35,319
today and this has real implications for

431
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,240
immigration reform and how we where

432
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:42,240
these workers are going to come from uh

433
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,519
in the future and how we Source uh labor

434
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,519
in the

435
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:53,000
future and then finally so the last

436
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,720
thing that the grower got uh in the Sur

437
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,519
when he was filling out he or she was

438
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,720
filling out the survey was a couple of

439
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:04,639
open-ended questions and here's an

440
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:07,798
opportunity for us to ask some things

441
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,919
about um they can answer the question

442
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:12,440
any way they want now it gets a little

443
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:16,640
bit you have to then do this grouping

444
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:19,919
lumping process at the end but uh we end

445
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,080
up writing out all the answers on

446
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,759
summary sheets and it's very interesting

447
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:27,558
to look at what uh Growers say in an

448
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:29,599
open-ended question when they can answer

449
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:33,158
it any way they like

450
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:36,480
um so we asked them first what were the

451
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:38,640
top three issues that you think grower

452
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,120
organizations that work on your behalf

453
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:45,679
should work on in the next 5 years labor

454
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:47,918
availability and immigration and h2a and

455
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:53,080
efficiency and all those things were Far

456
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:56,400
and Away above the the following two um

457
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:59,678
so labor labor availability was number

458
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,759
one uh not surprising in government

459
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,400
regulation is number two we hear that

460
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:09,119
all the time especially as the farm

461
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:11,480
grows in size um and then marketing

462
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:14,678
consumer education Global markets

463
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,880
bilocal all those marketing issues uh

464
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:19,240
were number three so this is what they

465
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,480
said they wanted organizations that they

466
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,599
belong to uh to do on their behalf in

467
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:29,240
the years

468
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:32,519
ahead um and this just is to reinforce

469
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:36,359
uh the point that uh we hear this not

470
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:38,839
only in the Apple uh industry today but

471
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:42,119
many many labor intensive IND industries

472
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:45,319
that um labor workforce issues are our

473
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:48,000
number one management issue and if we

474
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:51,000
could solve that life would improve in

475
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:56,159
terms of managing the farm

476
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:58,919
business now to me this W is the

477
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:02,559
question U that was most interesting of

478
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:04,720
me almost of interest to me when we put

479
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:08,000
this together one of the things that was

480
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:11,440
on my mind a lot is okay we all know

481
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,119
that immigration reform has stalled but

482
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:18,519
the farm manager is dynamic operates a

483
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:21,439
dynamic uh business and does not stop

484
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:23,639
just because immigration uh reform is

485
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:27,600
stalled they have to keep running this

486
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:30,480
business because they have such a large

487
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:34,439
capital investment in many cases so we

488
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:37,720
asked the survey participants given the

489
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:40,159
labor pressures that you've experienced

490
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:43,399
uh in the last several years including

491
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,520
labor being short how has or will your

492
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:49,239
business

493
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:52,558
change and uh so these are in order of

494
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:56,440
the response again we we grouped uh

495
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:59,398
their open-ended responses and in order

496
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:02,519
of priority this is what they said

497
00:25:59,398 --> 00:26:05,678
Orchard design planting systems and

498
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:08,519
equipment to be more labor efficient was

499
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:12,320
the biggest thing uh that they were

500
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:16,440
doing uh the other thing that goes the

501
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:19,519
second item that goes along with this is

502
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:23,480
downsizing producing less and decreasing

503
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:26,519
L acreage um and and what that really

504
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:29,798
means is uh with these high density

505
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:32,960
planting systems that we have converted

506
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:35,918
to in this state over the last 10 years

507
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,440
uh with a Vengeance we are producing

508
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,240
more apples on less acreage or more

509
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:44,278
apples far more apples on the same

510
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:47,519
acreage in some cases um the other the

511
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:50,558
third thing that they said is we are

512
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:53,960
relying more on h2a than we have in the

513
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:56,798
past which means two things sometimes

514
00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:00,000
the grower was not in the h2a program

515
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:03,119
was but was going to uh go to the h2a

516
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,759
program to hire workers and others were

517
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:09,398
hiring more workers through the h2a

518
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:11,319
program and then fourth uh and this is

519
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:14,798
not surprising either it's gone on for

520
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:17,200
decades if if a business becomes too

521
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:19,119
labor intensive or too complex there are

522
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,319
certain people who say we just cannot

523
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:25,439
come up with the capital or we don't

524
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:27,599
want to proceed with this business it is

525
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:32,278
uh the business is not viable for the

526
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:32,278
Next Generation a and we're going to opt

527
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:38,038
out

528
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,639
so some further comments on the

529
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:41,440
open-ended questions Growers are

530
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:46,080
reporting a shift to high density

531
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:48,519
planning systems um uh higher yields per

532
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:51,319
acre platforms and other equipment

533
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:55,159
dramatically improve labor efficiency I

534
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:58,918
took this photo at the uh fruits at the

535
00:27:55,159 --> 00:28:02,840
fruit extension fruit tour uh up in

536
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:05,840
Orleans County this summer and uh this

537
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:09,119
gives you a look at two things one is

538
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:11,519
the planning system is uh the tall

539
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:15,119
spindle planning system a high density

540
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:18,839
system that has been uh developed and

541
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:21,479
refined and promoted at Geneva and the

542
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:24,959
other thing is uh there you have in the

543
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:28,120
middle of that row a platform and that

544
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,038
platform uh the workers stand on the

545
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:34,558
plantform and can prune and can uh pick

546
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:37,398
and do other operations that make the

547
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:41,599
operations far more labor efficient than

548
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:45,879
they ever were before and so the uh the

549
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:48,918
the one thing that is really interesting

550
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:52,320
to me about all of this is that the high

551
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:55,000
density planting system and labor

552
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:58,319
efficiency were were not developed

553
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,278
independently it was all developed

554
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:05,839
together to be integrated so um so all

555
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:08,880
of these the row spacings and the

556
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:12,720
timeing and all of these things uh were

557
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:16,200
all put together in a way that uh labor

558
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,200
could be the very most

559
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:23,480
productive so grower response to labor

560
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:26,359
challenges uh make each full-time

561
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:29,640
equivalent uh worker as productive as

562
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:33,000
possible in these new systems C do that

563
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:36,799
uh eliminate excess labor and less

564
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,960
productive acreage I was uh I was in the

565
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:40,839
orchard I was up in Western New York

566
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,480
during Apple Harvest and one of the

567
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:45,879
things that's increasingly clear land

568
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,519
prices in Western New York and around

569
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:52,240
the state are going up dramatically and

570
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:54,599
so if you can be more productive on the

571
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,359
same acreage or less acreage then you

572
00:29:54,599 --> 00:30:00,480
don't have the extra capital investment

573
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:05,079
of of new acreage and new high-priced

574
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:07,278
acreage uh reduce Risk by using the h2a

575
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:11,119
program and I haven't said anything

576
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:13,599
about this yet but in New York um

577
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:14,798
immigration enforcement pressure has

578
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:20,079
been

579
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:23,519
dramatic and uh the the most likely

580
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:25,839
reason appears to be our border with

581
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:29,240
Canada and a high critical mass of

582
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:32,278
enforcement officers in in Border Patrol

583
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:36,679
out of Buffalo and in the North country

584
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:39,679
and so um one there are several reasons

585
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:41,679
why a grower would use the h2a program

586
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,679
one is to make sure that they have the

587
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,159
workers they need if there is a little

588
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:49,679
bit of Labor shortage out there the

589
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:53,440
other is to make sure that they don't

590
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,639
have workers that are undocumented and

591
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,600
could get deported in the middle or

592
00:30:55,638 --> 00:30:59,558
detained in the middle of the harvest

593
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:03,759
season or the middle of the growing

594
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:07,240
season so reducing risk is becoming a

595
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:09,879
more important part of the h2a program

596
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,278
uh and a motivation uh especially in

597
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,000
this state where we have so much

598
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:17,000
enforcement pressure I go to other

599
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,638
states I talk to folks from other states

600
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,638
and uh New York and Vermont uh uh seem

601
00:31:21,638 --> 00:31:26,678
to have a disproportionate share of

602
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:29,439
enforcement pressure and The Growers

603
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:32,080
feel that as they try to operate their

604
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,159
businesses um and then the other thing

605
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:36,079
that uh in their open-ended questions

606
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,760
that the grower said is we we're going

607
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:42,439
to continue to aggressively advocate for

608
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:42,440
immigration

609
00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:49,558
reform um I already made this point

610
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,880
Growers report an increasing Reliance on

611
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:55,200
h2a because other workers are not inv

612
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:57,278
available they can manage risk and uh

613
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,840
it's a response to enforce re

614
00:31:57,278 --> 00:31:59,839
enforcement

615
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:05,319
pressure

616
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,960
now the h2a Paradox and I've sort of

617
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:11,158
been leading up to this Growers who use

618
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:14,079
the h2a program are often very critical

619
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:16,440
of the program it's expensive there's a

620
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:20,240
lot of paperwork occasionally you don't

621
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:22,720
get your workers on time uh and Growers

622
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,278
don't like that they want they're in the

623
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,480
program so that their labor needs will

624
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:29,398
be predictable and their the labor force

625
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,038
will be

626
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:33,678
predictable and so there can be a few

627
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:38,038
problems along the

628
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,720
way that said some Growers have reported

629
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:42,319
in their open-ended question on this

630
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,839
survey that without the h2a program they

631
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:46,798
don't know what they do without the h2a

632
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:48,959
program they would probably be out of

633
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:53,158
business and

634
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:56,639
so um so

635
00:32:53,159 --> 00:33:00,159
h2a is especially in this state is

636
00:32:56,638 --> 00:33:00,158
becoming um more

637
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,639
important so now that I've sort of now

638
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:09,599
that I've gone through some of the

639
00:33:06,638 --> 00:33:11,638
things we found and there are a lot more

640
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,558
uh there's a lot more information that

641
00:33:11,638 --> 00:33:15,599
will be in our publication that'll be

642
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:19,678
posted on the Dyson website in the

643
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:22,119
extension section um so now that we've

644
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:26,240
gotten to this point I want to put this

645
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:28,518
in the context uh a little bit of uh

646
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,798
immigration reform and what does what

647
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:33,480
does some of these things mean to

648
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:33,480
immigration

649
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:40,600
reform

650
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:44,440
when we talk about what agriculture

651
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:48,079
wants out of immigration reform policy

652
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:50,519
what agriculture wants is very clear uh

653
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:53,720
and the entity that speaks for

654
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:56,960
agriculture in Washington is called the

655
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,519
agricultural Workforce Coalition and it

656
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:03,319
is a

657
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:06,359
uh it is a coalition of dozens of

658
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:10,039
agricultural groups like American Farm

659
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:12,960
Bureau Western uh Western

660
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:14,800
Growers uh Western United dairymen and

661
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,679
so on all of the

662
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,919
major uh Farm organizations that deal

663
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:23,918
with labor intensive agriculture are

664
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:27,039
part of this Coalition and the Coalition

665
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:28,799
speaks with one voice and it says uh the

666
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:32,320
following and right right before the

667
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:35,359
last Congress about almost 3 years ago

668
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,639
after the presidential election they got

669
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:41,358
together and redid this and reinforced

670
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,679
their position which is that

671
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:47,440
agricultural operations must have access

672
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:50,320
to a stable and skilled Workforce and we

673
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,639
need to do this by doing two things one

674
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,679
is providing an adjustment in

675
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,800
immigration status for the undocumented

676
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,358
workers that are already working in ag

677
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,400
culture so that can they can stay and

678
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:04,960
work in

679
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:07,760
agriculture and the other thing that is

680
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:11,639
needed is to address Workforce needs

681
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:16,119
with a modern guest worker visa program

682
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:18,719
and what that means is uh if we continue

683
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:22,519
with the h2a program it needs to be

684
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:26,039
fixed and if we don't we need a new

685
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:28,719
program that improves the good things

686
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:32,358
that that improves upon on the good

687
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:36,118
things uh that we already have uh in the

688
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:38,199
h2a program and one of the realities of

689
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:40,800
policy in this country is that

690
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:44,358
government policy is often based on

691
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,880
inertia and the likelihood that we are

692
00:35:44,358 --> 00:35:51,679
going to throw out the completely throw

693
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:54,680
out the h2a program and start over is

694
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:57,039
pretty slim in my estimation which means

695
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:58,639
uh immigration reform needs to look at

696
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:02,119
what we're what's going right with the

697
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:04,078
H2 proa program uh think about what

698
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:06,318
needs to be improved and then come up

699
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,119
with a new guest worker program that

700
00:36:06,318 --> 00:36:12,318
will combine those two

701
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:16,119
things so that's what agriculture says

702
00:36:12,318 --> 00:36:20,800
it wants so let's we just started the

703
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:23,559
114th Congress uh a few weeks ago let's

704
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,280
look at what happened in the 113th

705
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:28,400
Congress the last Congress that ended on

706
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:33,119
July 31st

707
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:36,318
the senate in that Congress passed

708
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:40,000
s74 uh which was a comprehensive

709
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:43,480
Immigration Reform Bill it had its own

710
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,318
separate agricultural title largely

711
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,960
because that's what the agricultural

712
00:36:45,318 --> 00:36:52,199
Workforce Coalition

713
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:55,119
wanted and uh in my opinion we probably

714
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:57,919
agriculture could probably have not done

715
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:01,119
much better there was uh an opport Unity

716
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,400
for legalized status for uh the

717
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,400
undocumented workers and there was a new

718
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:08,599
and improved guest worker program that

719
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:12,760
would make some real changes to the h2a

720
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:15,838
program so what happened it went it then

721
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:19,480
became the House of Representatives term

722
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:22,960
turn to do something with this piece of

723
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:25,960
legislation uh last year at this time we

724
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,318
knew that the window there was a window

725
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,960
before the midterm election

726
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:33,559
uh right up until about the August

727
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,358
recess they there were some bills

728
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:40,318
introduced none of them uh that were one

729
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:43,519
was introduced by the Democrats and it

730
00:37:40,318 --> 00:37:45,838
looked just like s74 and that was going

731
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:50,000
nowhere the other bills introduced by

732
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:52,318
the Republicans failed to do anything

733
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,480
about the 11 million illegal immigrants

734
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:58,679
in this country and at the end of the

735
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:00,800
day the August recess came nothing was

736
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:05,759
done no bills were passed out of the

737
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:08,599
house and uh and at that point President

738
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,119
Obama began threatening and saying well

739
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:11,960
if you're not going to do if you the

740
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:13,240
house if if the Congress isn't going to

741
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:17,440
do anything then I'm going to do

742
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:22,199
something on my own uh which he did uh

743
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:24,079
it prob it only it probably only would

744
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:27,199
affect what he did with his executive

745
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,960
action a small number of workers to make

746
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:31,838
them

747
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:36,000
uh allow them deferred status and

748
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:40,159
deferred uh detention and deportation so

749
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,119
I don't see it as having a big uh impact

750
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:45,799
on agriculture and all the organizations

751
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:49,760
that represent agriculture within 24

752
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:54,519
hours of the executive action being

753
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:56,960
announced uh came out and said uh this

754
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:59,679
is no substitute the executive action is

755
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,039
no sub substitute for comprehensive

756
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:05,480
immigration reform which we still want

757
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:08,480
and are going to work hard to to

758
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,838
get so that brings us to the new

759
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,639
Congress the 114th

760
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:18,159
Congress um I uh had the opportunity to

761
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:21,039
be uh with a group of farmers who were

762
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:24,679
um visiting house members on Capitol

763
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:29,039
Hill two weeks ago and it

764
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:30,318
is increasingly apparent that to me that

765
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:33,559
the House of

766
00:39:30,318 --> 00:39:35,800
Representatives uh cannot agree on how

767
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:38,400
what to do with the 11 million ilal

768
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:42,640
immigrants what immigration reform

769
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:44,720
should look like and the likely it seems

770
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:48,400
unlikely that anything is going to

771
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:50,519
happen in the 114th Congress because we

772
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,960
have the presidential elections that

773
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:55,519
will be in full swing by this summer and

774
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,720
when we have an election cycle it's very

775
00:39:55,519 --> 00:40:02,759
hard to get these kinds of of tus tough

776
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:04,559
pieces of legislation passed so it is it

777
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,880
seems unlikely to me that we're going to

778
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:10,239
have much progress or any progress in

779
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,720
this Congress which means we're probably

780
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:15,039
going to have to wait until we get a new

781
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:19,799
president and another new Congress and

782
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:21,960
hope at that time that we can get some

783
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,839
movement

784
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,318
so what if you are an apple grower if

785
00:40:24,838 --> 00:40:29,799
you're a farm manager how do you think

786
00:40:27,318 --> 00:40:33,719
think about all of this stuff that comes

787
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:38,318
out of the survey and uh emanates from

788
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:40,318
the immigration reform process um I I

789
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:43,279
think Growers there's no doubt that

790
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:45,440
Growers uh will continue to improve

791
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,800
labor efficiency these new systems have

792
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,039
worked great and they continue to take

793
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:54,359
out the older varieties and the tall

794
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:56,880
trees and put in uh these new dwarf

795
00:40:54,358 --> 00:40:58,679
trees and these new high density systems

796
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,720
that is going to

797
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:04,039
continue um they have said in their

798
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:05,480
open-ended question answers that they're

799
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:09,318
going to stay involved in the

800
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:13,039
immigration reform legislative process

801
00:41:09,318 --> 00:41:15,519
and I think that if uh I think we have

802
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:17,639
an environment now that if the

803
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:20,960
organizations like Farm Bureau and

804
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:24,078
others send out a letter that says it is

805
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:27,599
time to call your Congressman this this

806
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:30,599
issue is so important that if there a

807
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:33,359
piece of legislation to support or to

808
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:35,480
oppose those offices will be flooded

809
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:38,960
because Palmers are now paying a lot of

810
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:42,358
attention to this and then finally uh

811
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:46,318
develop a human resource strategic plan

812
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:50,000
to include improved wages and benefits

813
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:52,519
improved housing and supervisory

814
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,960
training one of the things that comes

815
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:57,838
out of this discussion of immigration

816
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,599
reform is how do we keep the

817
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:02,318
undocumented workers once they have a

818
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:03,960
piece of paper that says that they have

819
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:09,480
a legalized

820
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:12,039
status uh and uh I think that one of the

821
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:15,199
answers to that is going to be these

822
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:18,358
three points the wages benefits housing

823
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:22,960
and supervisory training now with

824
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:25,119
housing Apple Growers have a leg up over

825
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,960
for example Dairy Farmers and we're a

826
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:30,358
big we're a big Dairy state

827
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,760
well Apple Growers because of seasonal

828
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:36,920
label labor already have housing

829
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:40,040
inspections Dairy Farmers don't and uh

830
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:42,079
if so Dairy Farmers are going to have we

831
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:45,279
still have to be vigilant in the fruit

832
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:48,400
industry but da uh farmers are going to

833
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,119
have to uh have a a whole new way of

834
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,440
thinking about their housing and some of

835
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:55,039
the regulations that may come about

836
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:57,760
because they're less regulated uh than

837
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:00,199
the Growers are at this point

838
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,359
at this point I will stop there and I

839
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:05,719
think we've got we stop at at 1:10 so

840
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:08,360
we've got time for some questions and

841
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:12,159
comments and rebuttal and so

842
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:14,160
[Applause]

843
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:17,838
on my name

844
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:19,318
is this year back in the50s what we have

845
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:21,920
to do with that

846
00:43:19,318 --> 00:43:25,480
time those people who do not have Farm

847
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:28,680
experience before cor we have to work on

848
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:31,519
farms okay um

849
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:34,598
um what we did was a lot of things that

850
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:37,920
are being done today you show the slides

851
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:40,559
we had pick the apples uh thin them and

852
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,559
a lot of different things at that point

853
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,760
I know farming has changed and Cornell

854
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:47,960
has changed are we still doing anything

855
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:51,200
here at Cornell to uh to have some of

856
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:54,838
our students work in the Summers and and

857
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:57,879
and do the U uh do the growing process

858
00:43:54,838 --> 00:44:01,880
in in let's say up state

859
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:03,880
champagne Val Etc not to my knowledge

860
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,760
but I might not be the best person to

861
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,440
answer that question there are there are

862
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,160
a lot of internships available to

863
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,079
students and so those opportunities

864
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:14,960
exist in the form of internships okay

865
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,760
yeah both off campus here I know like

866
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,079
the fruit group right here Cornell has

867
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:21,119
five every summer that they come and

868
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:23,119
take them on and they work on various

869
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,280
aspects of growing

870
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,240
fruit plantations has interns yeah so I

871
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,440
think there are there's also a formal

872
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:33,759
course you can take on farm equipment

873
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,880
and and use uh you sign up for like a

874
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,960
regular course and every week you know a

875
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,240
couple of days a week you out and you

876
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,480
learn how to drive tractors and hook up

877
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:44,519
equipment and stuff like that right you

878
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,280
mentioned um positions with people would

879
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:48,719
the stem clipping for the you mentioned

880
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,119
the honey crisp apples right what is the

881
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:51,879
in New York state what is the economic

882
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:54,440
import I mean I know honey CIS is a

883
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:57,920
relatively new and also very high value

884
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:00,639
variety um what is the the like What

885
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,440
proportion of farms are growing like the

886
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:03,920
these high value varieties that would

887
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,880
actually require that versus something

888
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:10,519
like a red delicious or a granny smith I

889
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,119
I we did not we did not have enough

890
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:13,838
information from the survey to answer

891
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:17,720
that question and I don't know the

892
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:20,159
answer to that question those the newer

893
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:21,279
varieties keep expanding and the old

894
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:25,558
varieties

895
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,559
keep uh keep being

896
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:32,199
replaced so so farmers as a whole in

897
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:34,639
general tend to be conservative

898
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:38,318
politically and folks that are sort of

899
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:40,598
pushing for you know slowing down you

900
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:41,960
know no path to citizenship and no

901
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:43,880
amnesty and all that are also

902
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,838
politically conservative so there seems

903
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,640
to be there must be some tension between

904
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:50,119
those two groups is the n what's the

905
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:52,799
nature of that conversation between the

906
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:55,599
politically conservative politicians and

907
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,559
a politically conservative farmer is it

908
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,640
different than the what we hear here as

909
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:02,240
sort of the general public and what

910
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:04,279
what's the farmer say to the politician

911
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:06,679
who seems to be working against their

912
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:10,359
interest in this particular

913
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:12,719
Cas well that that's that is a

914
00:46:10,358 --> 00:46:15,000
fascinating question I can tell you what

915
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:16,358
happened two weeks ago when when we were

916
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,280
on Capital

917
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:27,239
Hill we um so I went with a group of

918
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:29,839
Growers and we went to five or six house

919
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:33,838
member's office and usually end up talk

920
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:36,679
talking to the staff now some of those

921
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:38,838
congressmen are new and so then you have

922
00:46:36,679 --> 00:46:42,039
to start at the beginning and say why

923
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:45,159
all this stuff is important but some of

924
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:47,639
them like Tom Reed and others have been

925
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:51,920
around for a long time Chris Collins and

926
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:54,920
they've heard this from the same Growers

927
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:57,880
for several years running and so then

928
00:46:54,920 --> 00:47:00,119
you don't have to educate them and so

929
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:03,000
then uh it's likely that one of the

930
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:05,200
Growers will say well so what do you

931
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:09,159
tell us really what you think is going

932
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:11,279
on and one of the things we heard was uh

933
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:14,519
and this is one this is a quote from one

934
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:18,160
of the staff members was there are two

935
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:21,559
dozen Knuckleheads in Congress in the

936
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:24,679
house that do not

937
00:47:21,559 --> 00:47:27,559
want anything want to do anything with

938
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:31,118
the 11 million undocumented uh

939
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:36,319
immigrants and so you have that small

940
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:38,039
group that is very vocal and very dug in

941
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:41,358
and trying to find the middle for the

942
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:43,079
Republicans has been very very difficult

943
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:48,318
does that help to answer the question I

944
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:51,280
mean the the if you're Tom Reed or Chris

945
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:52,719
Collins and you come from an Upstate

946
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:56,280
agricultural

947
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:58,078
District um you get it and you know that

948
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:01,720
the farmers are not going to get off

949
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:03,720
your back so they're going to these

950
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:05,399
conservatives and trying to get

951
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:09,318
something going and the conservatives

952
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:12,240
are having are are just staying dug in

953
00:48:09,318 --> 00:48:15,759
to Marvin's question the argument isn't

954
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:17,558
ideological it's between those in

955
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,800
agriculture who want them to do

956
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:23,359
something and the Republicans who can't

957
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,720
do anything so they end up explaining

958
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:27,719
why it can't be done and we and we have

959
00:48:25,719 --> 00:48:30,879
to remember politic

960
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:35,078
that those house members who are taking

961
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:37,240
that um that hands off we don't want to

962
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:39,680
do anything on immigration approach or

963
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:42,318
anything for the illegal immigrants they

964
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:45,558
come from districts whose electorate

965
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:48,679
want the same thing so while Chris

966
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:51,720
Collins's electorate wants this moving

967
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:54,039
for agriculture you've got another

968
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:55,798
person a Conservative Republican in a

969
00:48:54,039 --> 00:48:57,960
Conservative Republican District who

970
00:48:55,798 --> 00:49:02,079
doesn't who wants the same thing that

971
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:02,079
that house member is

972
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:08,240
saying uh Geneva do you have any

973
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:10,920
questions I was wondering on that point

974
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:14,439
three you have down there on that last

975
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:16,599
slide whether uh they're looking to

976
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:18,480
current employers like McDonald's that

977
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:21,440
trains a lot of people in supervisory

978
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:24,559
training as a source of Labor or crew

979
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:27,519
chiefs or anything along those

980
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:30,559
lines uh will you I'm not sure I

981
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:34,960
completely understand the question are

982
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:37,559
would we get would we stand to hire some

983
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:41,039
workers away from McDonald's is that

984
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:43,000
what you're saying right so that it's

985
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:45,920
not immigrant

986
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:49,559
labor um they're working at sort of

987
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:53,400
similar wages um and they have some

988
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:56,200
training uh I think that

989
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:58,400
uh that we're there is a difference

990
00:49:56,199 --> 00:50:03,558
between outdoor work and working in the

991
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:06,039
elements and so on uh and working at uh

992
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:08,480
McDonald's uh number one number two it

993
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:10,519
gets back to this whole question of will

994
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,358
Americans do these

995
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:15,000
jobs uh and I have a feeling that there

996
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:17,759
are probably some

997
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,798
McDonald's uh managers who wonder the

998
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:24,839
same thing if Americans would do those

999
00:50:19,798 --> 00:50:26,159
jobs so at these low labor levels um I

1000
00:50:24,838 --> 00:50:28,880
think we're going to continue to

1001
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:31,318
struggle with how

1002
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:34,079
to uh get the workers and get them

1003
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:37,558
trained and compensate them uh to get

1004
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:40,599
the work done I I actually don't see

1005
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:43,200
much movement between a job like

1006
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:46,318
McDonald's and an apple orchard but I do

1007
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:50,199
see both employers having the same

1008
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:52,719
challenges just one thing I we always

1009
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:55,000
take it for granted that h2a is an

1010
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:57,558
oppressive program and you've

1011
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,119
explained the fact that that it's

1012
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:03,200
difficult for employers why is it that

1013
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:05,200
way why isn't it built to to provide

1014
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:06,558
that stable Workforce that everybody

1015
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:09,879
wants

1016
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:13,680
can um I think a large part of the

1017
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:16,400
reason is that when laws like this are

1018
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:19,798
uh enacted the labor Advocates have had

1019
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:22,920
something to say about them and so there

1020
00:51:19,798 --> 00:51:25,358
are assurances put into the program I

1021
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:27,119
think part the paperwork is part of that

1022
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:30,039
I think the wages are part of that that

1023
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:31,599
the labor Advocates have said uh the

1024
00:51:30,039 --> 00:51:33,920
workers need more than what you're

1025
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:37,838
willing to give and so they compromise

1026
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:41,559
on something that uh does have higher

1027
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:45,078
wages and more uh

1028
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:45,079
restrictions along the

1029
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:54,159
way okay I think we're

1030
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:56,838
