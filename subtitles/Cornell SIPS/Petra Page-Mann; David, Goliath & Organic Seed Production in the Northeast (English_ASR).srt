00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:14,089
thank you so much to you it is such a

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,339
privilege and pleasure to be here and

5
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:19,100
thank you all for making this time in

6
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:22,059
your busy schedules and first and

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:27,349
foremost I have some questions for you

8
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:32,060
how many of you like to grow things how

9
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:33,859
many of you have saved seed before how

10
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:39,620
many of you have developed brand new

11
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:41,628
varieties of vegetables yes how many of

12
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:44,839
you know the story of David and Goliath

13
00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:46,519
and how many of you woke up this morning

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,820
put on clothes I need something for

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,820
breakfast

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:55,609
so good news is we have a lot in common

17
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:58,429
and and here's the thing you all play a

18
00:00:55,609 --> 00:01:00,948
larger role in our food system in our

19
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:02,179
seed system today and the world that

20
00:01:00,948 --> 00:01:03,738
we're building for our

21
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:07,400
great-great-grandchildren as well

22
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:09,140
perhaps more than you realize and even

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,049
if you've never developed a brand new

24
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,420
variety of vegetable if you've saved the

25
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:16,970
seeds of vegetables and flowers of herbs

26
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,670
you've made subtle shifts in that

27
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:22,280
variety and that's really all that a

28
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:25,240
plant breeder is doing - no offense

29
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,618
Michael maybe there's some more

30
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:30,949
methodology and there are certainly lots

31
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:32,900
of intention but next now you know next

32
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,460
time someone asks you if did that you've

33
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,829
developed new varieties that have

34
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:39,319
forever changed the genetics available

35
00:01:36,828 --> 00:01:41,469
its people on this planet if you have

36
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,908
save seeds confidently raise your hands

37
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:47,450
and even if you've never sown a seed in

38
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:49,700
your life every day you eat and every

39
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,100
day you put on clothing and so every day

40
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,049
you are determining the plants that are

41
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:55,819
being bred by those professional plant

42
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:58,219
breeders all around the country and all

43
00:01:55,819 --> 00:02:02,269
around the world so even if you never

44
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:04,399
sow a seed your life every day impacts

45
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:06,379
the seeds being bred and sewn around the

46
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,560
world that are changing the world for

47
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:13,099
our grandchildren and David and Goliath

48
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,590
is a story that I thought I knew and it

49
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:18,859
turns out I didn't know it so part of my

50
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:21,719
story today is sharing with you one of

51
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:25,440
my favorite stories retold

52
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:27,569
my name is Cara Petra Paige man and I

53
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:30,240
grew up here in the Finger Lakes saving

54
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:33,359
seed I really like to eat and that is

55
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:36,120
the core of my passion my motivation

56
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,160
that brings me here today and to my

57
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,759
fields every day that I'm so fortunate

58
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:44,000
in 2012 I started a seed company with my

59
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,139
beloved partner Matthew Goldfarb and

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,909
we're really excited to grow seeds

61
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:51,479
organic seeds that are originally

62
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:53,819
adapted for this place I've traveled all

63
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:56,340
around the world I love plants and I

64
00:02:53,819 --> 00:03:00,719
love that I can see that even between

65
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:03,719
here in Ithaca there are different kinds

66
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,109
of Oaks than there are in Naples on my

67
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,000
farm

68
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,620
to say nothing of the Oaks that are in

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,379
Oregon to say nothing of the Oaks that

70
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:14,550
are Australia and I really believe that

71
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:18,000
seed can be that resilient as well if we

72
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:21,689
choose to select it so so without

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,050
further ado I left my clicker over

74
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:24,050
yonder

75
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:33,659
so I'd like to start with what is a seed

76
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:36,360
and a seed I'm doing a lot of moving

77
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:40,199
around today a seed is a living

78
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:43,680
breathing being just like you and I and

79
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:46,469
this particular seed is a hub in ishani

80
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,680
skunk bean the Haudenosaunee people does

81
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:52,800
anyone recognize that name yes the

82
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,780
Iroquois people Iroquois vaguely sounds

83
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,969
French and indeed Iroquois was the

84
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,640
French derogatory term for indigenous

85
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:03,449
people in this bean has been grown in

86
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:06,419
the valley where I grew this bean for

87
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:10,500
over a thousand years and without

88
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:13,289
question it is the most disease

89
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,360
resistant it's the quickest maturing and

90
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:17,969
we harvest twice the yield of any other

91
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,560
cold dry bean I've ever grown which

92
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,090
perhaps isn't saying that much because

93
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,280
I'm a little girl and I don't have an

94
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:26,699
extensive trialing system but I've grown

95
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,979
a lot of dry beans in my day and this

96
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:31,180
being friends I have to imagine that

97
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,910
there's something to the fact that

98
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:36,009
it's been growing in our soils been

99
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:39,700
adapting with our climate and adapting

100
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:42,490
with our ancestors as all of these

101
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:44,279
variables have changed over time this is

102
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,990
such a profoundly regionally adapted

103
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:49,119
variety and it sends shivers down my

104
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,970
spine in the same way that we have

105
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,590
ancestors and that we may become

106
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:58,720
ancestors these seeds made to become

107
00:04:56,589 --> 00:05:01,439
ancestors as all of the ancestors

108
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:06,220
countless that have come before them

109
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:08,620
part one the magic of seeds and seeds

110
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,610
are domesticated plants right

111
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,560
I've been around we've been

112
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,050
domesticating plants give or take ten

113
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,269
thousand years and I love every time I

114
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,189
see the image of teosinte it sends

115
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:20,529
shivers down my spine again because I

116
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:25,930
would have just mowed it if it was in my

117
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:31,089
lawn ancestors that knew nothing about

118
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:33,069
DNA have been selecting this grass for

119
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:35,349
thousands of years and now it's grown

120
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:39,300
over millions of acres on every

121
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:41,410
continent except Antarctica and feeds

122
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,840
outrageous percentage of our global

123
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,970
population every day and I have to

124
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,279
imagine that those same people in the

125
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,960
Andes thousands of years ago if I'd

126
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:52,689
asked them have you ever developed a

127
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:54,339
brand-new variety of vegetable they

128
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:59,980
probably would have not raised their

129
00:05:54,339 --> 00:06:01,599
hands as well but here we are probably

130
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,970
all of us in this room today I've

131
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,560
already eaten corn at some point in the

132
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:10,920
last day if not week multiple times

133
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:15,280
those ancestors have impacted our lives

134
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:17,770
in an fab unfappable ways and to a new

135
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:20,019
save seeds this is the impact that you

136
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:25,509
may have on countless generations as

137
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:27,399
well and we reap what we sow I love does

138
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:31,199
anyone recognize what the seed head

139
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:31,199
might be PS by the way

140
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:38,610
it is carrot yes and so same genus

141
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:41,340
species as Queen Anne's lace which is

142
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:45,080
the reason we put it in isolation cages

143
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:49,109
at our farm and then still are nervous

144
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:52,439
but we probably so in that these seeds

145
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,629
that we can save and pass on generation

146
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,279
after generation we've lost over 80

147
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:58,409
percent of the genetic diversity that

148
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:01,500
we've cultivated as a species in the

149
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:03,630
last ten thousand years and I don't the

150
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,339
percentage is always changing and I

151
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:08,129
can't quite keep up with it but

152
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:10,199
something around sixty percent of all

153
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:13,379
the seeds all the genetic diversity on

154
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:18,589
this planet is controlled by three and

155
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:21,269
now quickly to companies it's ludicrous

156
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:24,659
this precipice that we find ourselves on

157
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:27,269
as seed has gone from this Commons this

158
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,770
I can't imagine selling new water or

159
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:30,509
selling you the hair that you're

160
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:32,519
breathing and I can't quite imagine

161
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:34,199
selling you the seed packet in fact I'm

162
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,990
not selling you the seeds I'm selling

163
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:39,420
you a really beautiful packet with some

164
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:41,340
nice information and a website where you

165
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,319
can learn how to grow them really well

166
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:45,899
this is what I tell myself anyway there

167
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,870
happens to be seeds inside too but as

168
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:52,560
seed has moved from Commons to a

169
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:56,100
commodity and our food system has become

170
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,670
increasingly globalized our seed system

171
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:02,180
has dramatically changed as well and one

172
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:05,790
day I was sharing this extraordinary

173
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,500
darkness that I feel around our food

174
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:09,629
system in our seed system with my dear

175
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,720
friend Bill mcdorman and perhaps some of

176
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:15,810
you know Bill mcdorman here's this

177
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:18,870
crafty wizard poet of a seed saver and

178
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,699
he as I'm telling him this distr he

179
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,399
shared with me this quote which I'm

180
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:25,860
happy to share with you before we delve

181
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:27,929
into some other stories so he smiled at

182
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:31,830
me as I'm like on the verge of tears

183
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:34,110
reaching for my hanky and as I'm sharing

184
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:35,939
with him the sadness that I feel and he

185
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,639
said well Patrick let me tell you you

186
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,900
forgot you have forgotten something

187
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:42,689
because in a single generation we have

188
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:44,879
lost untold wisdom around our genetic

189
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,180
heritage but you've forgotten that there

190
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,490
is

191
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:50,399
infinite potential and a handful of

192
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:53,250
seeds because each seed is infinitely

193
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:56,549
replicable incredibly adaptable and

194
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:59,159
they're everywhere so we'll break that

195
00:08:56,549 --> 00:09:01,139
down for 45 seconds each seed is

196
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:02,730
infinitely reputable I love that that

197
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:05,159
seed that I'm passing around that have

198
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:08,399
been a Shawnee skunk bean I planted one

199
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:10,799
of those the first week in June from

200
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,199
that single seed I'll harvest thousands

201
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,870
probably at least a thousand if not two

202
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,020
thousand seeds from a single plant by

203
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,940
fall with things like amaranth there

204
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:23,039
will be tens of thousands of seeds from

205
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,780
that one single seed and I definitely am

206
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,149
focused on plants I'm not a

207
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:28,919
mathematician but if I have one thing

208
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,569
that can make ten thousand things and

209
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:32,639
each of those ten thousand things can

210
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,250
make another ten thousand things all of

211
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,799
a sudden I hope that you're hungry and I

212
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,899
hope that you have friends and I hope

213
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:44,039
that you also see that this is a reason

214
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:45,539
to have hope for the world and you see

215
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:48,179
it as incredibly adaptable this is a

216
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:48,629
photograph of kale overwintering on our

217
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:51,089
farm

218
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:52,139
and every year we overwinter lots of

219
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,060
things on our farm and other

220
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:58,409
collaborator farmers and here in the

221
00:09:54,059 --> 00:10:01,949
Finger Lakes and plants can adapt to

222
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:04,500
whatever our imaginations might contrive

223
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:07,440
whether it's shipping tomatoes from San

224
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,710
Diego to Maine in February or asking

225
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,540
lettuce to overwinter uncovered in the

226
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:17,160
Finger Lakes anything is possible our

227
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:18,990
imagination is the limit and they're

228
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:22,679
everywhere I love remembering that even

229
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:24,000
if we lose 100 percent of the debt of

230
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:27,899
the genetic diversity that we've

231
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,909
cultivated as a species for ten thousand

232
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,110
years we live on the greenest planet

233
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:35,299
that I've ever seen

234
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:35,300
and we can start again and

235
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:42,818
I also have to mention in such astute

236
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:47,019
community that there's probably way more

237
00:10:42,818 --> 00:10:51,878
spores in this picture than seeds I

238
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:54,519
think you get the idea so I'd love to

239
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:56,649
share this little sentiment before I

240
00:10:54,519 --> 00:11:02,078
move on this is poncho and Davi by the

241
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:03,999
way my are little dogs and Davi is named

242
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,969
for David and Goliath which I'm excited

243
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:08,528
to share with you in a little bit but I

244
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,989
don't people ask me all the time why I

245
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:12,730
love saving seeds and why it's important

246
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:14,769
and I really think it's about well

247
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:18,699
building community and eating good food

248
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:22,028
but selecting seeds not just saving

249
00:11:18,698 --> 00:11:24,698
seeds I'm interested in those lettuce

250
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:27,278
not that bold first and not the dye over

251
00:11:24,698 --> 00:11:30,938
the winter but the ones that vote last I

252
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:33,278
had survived the winter and with those

253
00:11:30,938 --> 00:11:36,009
seeds I took them in the ground and put

254
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:39,458
tuck them in packets and I'd love for

255
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:41,649
you all to take a pack at home there's a

256
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:43,568
good number of packets in there I hope

257
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:45,308
you all take them home and know that if

258
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:49,808
you'd like to keep in touch you can also

259
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:51,360
sign up on our email sheet as well we

260
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:54,909
have a monthly organic gardening

261
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,028
newsletter that's very entertaining as

262
00:11:54,909 --> 00:12:01,928
well as informative from time to time

263
00:11:57,028 --> 00:12:04,749
and oh yeah because so selecting seed is

264
00:12:01,928 --> 00:12:06,399
important because oh yeah you might be

265
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:08,860
interested in a flavor or a disease

266
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,778
resistance or yield there's a lot of

267
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:14,789
really valid interests but you can

268
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:17,259
select your seeds for and I'd love to I

269
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:21,278
remind myself all the time that I do

270
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:23,350
this joyfully but there may be a time

271
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:26,588
that we do this out of necessity and

272
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,308
this time might in fact be now my dear

273
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:30,639
friends

274
00:12:27,308 --> 00:12:33,399
Danvers voix up in Montreal has an

275
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:37,298
organic seed farm and three years ago

276
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:39,428
when he was starting his greenhouses he

277
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:41,318
was paddling through his greenhouses as

278
00:12:39,428 --> 00:12:43,119
we were starting ours here in the Finger

279
00:12:41,318 --> 00:12:46,360
Lakes and this was a hundred year flood

280
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:49,089
of the st. Lawrence and this was the

281
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:53,168
third hundred year flood in five years

282
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:56,859
so it's a very humbling reminder for me

283
00:12:53,168 --> 00:12:59,678
that if I that I want to do this works

284
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:01,719
joyfully first and foremost but that out

285
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:05,769
of necessity our climates are changing

286
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:08,349
our markets are shifting as well and if

287
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:12,869
decentralization is becoming a necessity

288
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:12,869
that needs to start at the genetic level

289
00:13:13,349 --> 00:13:18,189
so David and Goliath first let me

290
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:22,958
introduce my partner Matthew both I'm

291
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:26,019
spreading cover crop seed and so David

292
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:30,428
and Goliath is a story that I thought I

293
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:31,448
knew all about I've always been rooting

294
00:13:30,428 --> 00:13:34,509
for the underdog

295
00:13:31,448 --> 00:13:38,408
and I always thought that the improbable

296
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:40,209
was probably possible but it wasn't

297
00:13:38,408 --> 00:13:42,428
until a few years ago and Malcolm

298
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:44,768
Gladwell wrote a book about David and

299
00:13:42,428 --> 00:13:49,149
Goliath that I realized that oh I didn't

300
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:52,448
know this story in any way and it has

301
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:54,278
been a huge inspiration for me this

302
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:57,128
retelling of David and Goliath in

303
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:57,788
starting a seed company here in the

304
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:00,819
Northeast

305
00:13:57,788 --> 00:14:05,288
because PS by the way you don't grow

306
00:14:00,818 --> 00:14:07,688
seed here in the northeast Petra I spent

307
00:14:05,288 --> 00:14:10,149
years growing seed where seed has grown

308
00:14:07,688 --> 00:14:12,548
in the world in the Pacific Northwest

309
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:14,318
where it's dry it doesn't rain from the

310
00:14:12,548 --> 00:14:17,078
beginning of May till the end of

311
00:14:14,318 --> 00:14:21,188
September and the sea there's all these

312
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:23,708
great reasons why you don't grow seed in

313
00:14:21,188 --> 00:14:24,759
the northeast so petrol why are you

314
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:28,118
starting a seed company in the right

315
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:31,808
least let me tell you this story about

316
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:34,989
David and Goliath so 3,000 years ago

317
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:36,848
the Philistines and the Israelites were

318
00:14:34,989 --> 00:14:38,619
having a disagreement as they had had

319
00:14:36,849 --> 00:14:41,499
before and they had had again but this

320
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:44,559
was one in a long line and in ancient

321
00:14:41,499 --> 00:14:45,969
warfare there was this thing single

322
00:14:44,558 --> 00:14:47,618
combat which was really convenient

323
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:50,229
because if you have two armies and they

324
00:14:47,619 --> 00:14:53,229
go at each other a lot of life can be

325
00:14:50,229 --> 00:14:56,259
lost but if you choose your one single

326
00:14:53,229 --> 00:14:58,028
warrior and from one side and the other

327
00:14:56,259 --> 00:15:01,329
side chooses their one single warrior

328
00:14:58,028 --> 00:15:02,759
maybe we can maybe we can be a tiny bit

329
00:15:01,328 --> 00:15:06,409
more civilized

330
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:09,539
so the Philistines sent down this

331
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:12,000
massive warrior their finest warrior and

332
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:14,399
he's literally a giant and he's covered

333
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,278
in head to toe with gleaming armor and

334
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,559
he has not only a sword he's brandishing

335
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,929
a javelin and a spear and he's pretty

336
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:25,169
formidable he is the spectre of

337
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:28,259
dominance and the Israelites are little

338
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:31,769
quaking in their boots and King Saul is

339
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:36,809
looking through his army and trying to

340
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:40,139
decide who could he possibly send to

341
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:43,399
defeat this undefeatable giant

342
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:46,409
the Giants name by the way was Goliath

343
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:49,078
and no one's stepping forward King Saul

344
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:53,490
doesn't want to have anybody four and

345
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:56,099
this little Shepherd steps up his name

346
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:59,250
happens to be David and the Shepherd

347
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:02,190
says well you know I've been fending off

348
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:06,929
lions and wolves and my flock for years

349
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:11,750
and I think I got this and King Saul

350
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:14,429
says thanks I am gonna laugh at you

351
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:17,639
right here in the Bible I'm laughing at

352
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:20,849
you and and he goes to take off his

353
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:23,879
armor the king of the Israelites takes

354
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:27,720
off his own armor to send the shepherd

355
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:30,208
boy to battle with and David says no I

356
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,430
really I don't need these things but I

357
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:34,888
do need some stones so he leans down and

358
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:36,599
he brings five stones from the valley

359
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:41,250
floor with him and he goes to meet

360
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:45,028
Goliath and here's the thing slingers

361
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:47,220
were a thing 3,000 years ago and like

362
00:16:45,028 --> 00:16:51,899
slingshots our children's toys but these

363
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:55,680
people could swing stones like 45

364
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:58,828
millimeter handgun style with incredible

365
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:01,528
accuracy and I think you can see where

366
00:16:58,828 --> 00:17:03,918
this story is going David just walks up

367
00:17:01,528 --> 00:17:06,808
to this giant far enough away so that

368
00:17:03,918 --> 00:17:09,179
Goliath has no chance to use his

369
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:14,009
well-honed beautiful gleaming tools

370
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:16,410
weapons against him and he just shoots a

371
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:18,779
stone right here

372
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:21,870
and Goliath is down on the ground waning

373
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:24,149
consciousness David walks up takes

374
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:28,049
goliaths own sword and locks off his

375
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:31,590
head and why we all know a different

376
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:35,940
story why we all think it was surprising

377
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:39,119
that David one is a different story but

378
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:42,059
a piece today that I want to share with

379
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:44,789
you all that I love remembering because

380
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:46,849
I forget all the time is that advantages

381
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:48,649
are not always advantages and

382
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:52,079
disadvantages are not always

383
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:56,700
disadvantages and when the underdog

384
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:58,799
knows the tools in his pocket when the

385
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:02,460
underdog is on his own turf when he's

386
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:05,970
confident and when he refuses to play by

387
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:08,539
the rules of the dominant paradigm the

388
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:12,299
underdog wins every time

389
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:16,589
Malcolm Gladwell's book beautifully

390
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:18,389
portrays this and yeah Goliath didn't

391
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:21,720
have a chance so how does this relate to

392
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:26,490
the seed system we have the Goliath of

393
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:29,870
this industrial global economy feed seed

394
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:34,980
food system and it's pretty formidable

395
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:37,049
the branding we can't touch it people

396
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,269
buy things buy their products just

397
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:41,129
because on the reputation and they've

398
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:42,660
been around for so long and these

399
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,880
international markets they're so

400
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,269
significant and the profit centers that

401
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,300
they have nailed oh my goodness it's

402
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:55,200
really it's incredibly challenging to

403
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:59,329
see how we can possibly begin to create

404
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:02,490
a different paradigm and take down this

405
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:06,779
incredible Goliath of a food system that

406
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:09,200
is serving some people but who is really

407
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:13,559
being served by this food system and

408
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,960
then we have David this is my little

409
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:20,039
friend in a field of kale and intruments

410
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:23,730
burg and surrounded by four acres of

411
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:26,990
kale that and so here's the thing about

412
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,990
seed in the Northeast

413
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:34,200
we're on our own turf we're saving seeds

414
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:39,929
Institute in place no one is doing this

415
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:41,519
work unless we do this work and we don't

416
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:43,590
have to play by the same game we can

417
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:47,579
make up our own rules we can make up our

418
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:51,178
own vision of branding our own vision of

419
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:52,259
all of these tools that have and we

420
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:54,480
don't have to throw the baby out with

421
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:56,879
the bathwater there's a lot of babies

422
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,980
and there's a lot of bathwater but

423
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,520
another thing that is really critical is

424
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:07,170
David knew how to wield his tools well

425
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:09,119
and yes we might have some significant

426
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:13,050
constraints here in the Northeast for

427
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:15,779
creating quality seed but we have some

428
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:17,339
great tools whether it's timing just

429
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:19,500
when do you plant things when you

430
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:21,349
harvest things whether it's using things

431
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,089
like root cellars or high tunnels

432
00:20:21,349 --> 00:20:26,579
leveraging other kinds of resources in

433
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:29,308
our communities and just looking at it

434
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:30,869
not only as what can we do on our farm

435
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:33,210
but how can we collaborate with other

436
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:37,319
farmers with other with our local

437
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:40,440
universities with whether it's you know

438
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:45,928
food banks there are so many tools that

439
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:49,110
we have in our toolbox and add and and

440
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:52,490
the creative piece of thinking outside

441
00:20:49,109 --> 00:20:55,109
the box we have so many reasons why

442
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:58,049
Sita's yes there are certainly

443
00:20:55,109 --> 00:21:00,539
constraints to growing economic to

444
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:03,269
competing at global economic scale

445
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:05,759
growing seed here in the Northeast but

446
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:09,150
I'm incredibly excited to be constantly

447
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:12,200
learning more every day and finding more

448
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:15,870
people excited to do this work and

449
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:19,650
here's the other thing too about David

450
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:22,889
and Goliath and you and I and the world

451
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:29,840
that were living in and are saving for

452
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:33,990
our grandchildren Goliath was chosen by

453
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:36,689
the Philistines he I don't know that

454
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:38,890
Goliath personally but I suspect he was

455
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:41,529
this warrior that had been

456
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:46,120
trained and groomed as this warrior from

457
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:48,369
inside for years and years and years and

458
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:51,599
he had all of these resources to buffer

459
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:56,199
him from the world around him where

460
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:59,169
David was in fact not selected by King

461
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:04,000
Saul King Saul laughed at him he chose

462
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:06,429
himself and he stood up and said I can

463
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,160
make a difference and let me give it a

464
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:12,790
try and so the thing is who is the King

465
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:15,910
now that's making this no industrialized

466
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:21,759
global food system Goliath

467
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:24,790
I think I'm part of it I think we all

468
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:26,769
are in the ways that we spend money and

469
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:28,779
the ways we spend our time even if we

470
00:22:26,769 --> 00:22:33,069
don't overtly want to be supporting

471
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:35,410
these systems we all in little ways and

472
00:22:33,069 --> 00:22:38,918
an often not little ways are part of

473
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:42,548
what is perpetuating this paradigm and

474
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:43,330
so that means we all can be David and we

475
00:22:42,548 --> 00:22:46,119
all are

476
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:49,599
David should we choose to stand up and

477
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:54,519
do what we love to wield our tool as

478
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:59,168
well and to have skin in the game so yes

479
00:22:54,519 --> 00:23:03,369
this is that same field of kale a month

480
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:06,820
later with Sandy and that is that same

481
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:09,789
little girl's hands going through 450

482
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:15,339
pounds of kale seed a few days after

483
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:18,069
that and now I'd like to share some

484
00:23:15,339 --> 00:23:19,149
stories of different collaborations here

485
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:21,789
in the Finger Lakes that I'm really

486
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:25,150
excited about because seed in the

487
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:28,149
Northeast doesn't isn't just seed in the

488
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:30,100
Northeast it is engaging all of these

489
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:34,720
different stakeholders and the food

490
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:37,418
system and well beyond and I don't think

491
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:41,769
I have put in a big enough bug yet so

492
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:43,780
I'm going to cut myself off you're at

493
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:46,690
one of the most amazing universities on

494
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:49,710
the planet and you have a public plant

495
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:52,590
breeding program

496
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:54,840
has changed my life profoundly and has

497
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:59,099
changed this world profoundly in the

498
00:23:54,839 --> 00:24:02,369
last 150 years and I'm so thrilled that

499
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:06,509
you all are a part of this wonderful

500
00:24:02,369 --> 00:24:10,699
institution and have never underestimate

501
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:15,359
the David's that you already are in

502
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:17,640
creating this new world and a special

503
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:22,798
hats off to Michael is Erick

504
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:27,899
I am at your service and the same is

505
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:29,940
true for you all as well so this is a

506
00:24:27,898 --> 00:24:33,589
little story about a purple cone headed

507
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:36,330
cabbage that is an heirloom variety that

508
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:39,119
Robin at Blue Heron farm and Lodi

509
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:42,210
absolutely loved and she and Lou grew

510
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,678
this cabbage for almost 30 years and

511
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,990
they personally witnessed the

512
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:49,320
degradation of this fantastic variety

513
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:53,370
from you know it has it's a beautiful

514
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:57,869
cone head dense super tender incredibly

515
00:24:53,369 --> 00:25:01,168
sweet and flavorful and when we first

516
00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:04,619
met them four years ago less than 10

517
00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:07,890
percent of the heads were still conical

518
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:09,449
and you can see some of them were these

519
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:12,179
tiny little heads on these great big

520
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:13,860
plants and some were just regular you

521
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:16,769
know round heads and some were very

522
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:18,658
loose heads where others were dense very

523
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:22,349
few of them were actually cone headed

524
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:24,990
and actually dense and nice compact

525
00:25:22,349 --> 00:25:27,389
plants and they grow but they continued

526
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,710
to grow it out several thousand plants

527
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:31,559
just because they loved them and they

528
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:34,019
could market them regardless and the

529
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:36,269
five eight percent that was actually

530
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:39,990
doing what they wanted to that was just

531
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:42,869
the cream on top so we went in and put

532
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:46,048
in lots of flags and we actually saved

533
00:25:42,869 --> 00:25:50,219
saved plants from that first generation

534
00:25:46,048 --> 00:25:53,220
there were 55 plants out of almost 2000

535
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:55,890
that actually had all of the qualities

536
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:58,558
that we were looking for and in that and

537
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:00,809
we they were able to actually cut off

538
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:03,599
the heads market the heads so they

539
00:26:00,808 --> 00:26:06,109
didn't have any losses a market

540
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:08,609
gardener growing this crop and then we

541
00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:10,339
lifted the roots and stems and all

542
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:12,479
brought them to our root cellar and

543
00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:15,679
planted them out the following spring

544
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:19,620
and saved the seed and lo and behold

545
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:22,380
that next generation it was around 65 70

546
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:25,049
percent we're good heads and that next

547
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:28,050
generation is now being germination

548
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:30,180
tested as we speak so we'll see what it

549
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:32,879
looks like now but this is a great

550
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:36,810
example of how you know these amazing

551
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,820
market farmers market growers yes I

552
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:41,099
would love to have an R&amp;D department and

553
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:43,319
have more extensive trialing at fruition

554
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,639
seeds but in lieu of that you we have so

555
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:47,389
many phenomenal farmers here in the

556
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,210
Finger Lakes that have extraordinary

557
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:54,890
observations that they've made over

558
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:54,890
decades and sometimes generations and

559
00:26:55,009 --> 00:27:03,960
collaborating with them has been such a

560
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:06,509
privilege and another marvelous

561
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,400
land-grant University University of

562
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:11,579
Wisconsin Madison has the open-source

563
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:14,820
seed initiative and we're really excited

564
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:17,009
to collaborate with Erwin and Claire and

565
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:20,119
they have and as well as Nathaniel

566
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:24,029
Thompson at remembrance farm and so

567
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:26,009
selecting something that is a bolero the

568
00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:27,930
next generation that is actually a

569
00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:31,529
certified organic variety and is going

570
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:33,029
to be an Okie and I'm looking at the

571
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:35,129
time and want to share all these other

572
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:38,639
little stories and so I don't want to go

573
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:41,310
in too deeply but we can talk about

574
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,610
these things in a few minutes if you

575
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:47,099
would like but know that there's lots of

576
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:51,389
amazing ways that universities and

577
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:53,429
farmers and lots of other players and

578
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:57,420
the food system game are playing

579
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:59,910
together and the final piece that I

580
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:03,570
wanted to share is this lovely little

581
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:06,330
Cuza style summer squash that's very

582
00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:07,829
delicious blah blah blah the exciting

583
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:13,319
part that I want to share with you is

584
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:16,869
that we've created dozens and dozens and

585
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:18,789
dozens of pounds of seed they have no

586
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:22,089
in a seed packet no place going into the

587
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:25,269
next generation so generally in new

588
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:28,058
variety development there's just a lot a

589
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:32,069
lot of byproducts whether it's delicious

590
00:28:28,058 --> 00:28:35,920
food or seed that in fact has enormous

591
00:28:32,069 --> 00:28:39,159
nutritive potential as well and so in

592
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:43,230
the process of creating a brand new open

593
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:47,680
pollinated varieties from and from an f1

594
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:51,819
we have collaborated with Stony Brook in

595
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:53,380
Geneva and they are this might have any

596
00:28:51,819 --> 00:28:56,169
of you heard of them or tasted they're

597
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:59,110
good things I'm so glad they are so

598
00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:01,330
outrageous Lee Devine and they so

599
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:05,049
they're toasting these seeds they are

600
00:29:01,329 --> 00:29:07,720
pressing them for oil and then marvelous

601
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:10,089
and visionary chefs are putting them on

602
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,400
their table so taking this waste stream

603
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:15,009
and turning it into a revenue stream

604
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:18,130
that is not only a revenue stream but

605
00:29:15,009 --> 00:29:20,558
it's really genuinely feeding people and

606
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:24,520
nourishing people has been one of my

607
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:29,049
favorite little nuances of some of our

608
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:31,450
collaborations as well I also wanted to

609
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:34,109
share this quick little story we often

610
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:37,000
grow lots of winter squash and sometimes

611
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:38,859
it's a lot of winter squash first and

612
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,960
when I go when I do things I tend to

613
00:29:38,859 --> 00:29:43,089
really do things Oh

614
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,750
for better and for worse our first year

615
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:48,549
we do 7,000 pounds of winter squash and

616
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:50,289
what do you do with 7,000 pounds of

617
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:53,319
winter squash when you just need the

618
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:55,329
certified organic seed inside so we

619
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:59,139
collaborated with food link up in

620
00:29:55,329 --> 00:30:01,629
Rochester and they drove a tractor

621
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:04,150
trailer down to our farm in Naples and

622
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:06,040
brought all of this various and sundry

623
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:08,019
deliciousness up to their

624
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:09,700
state-of-the-art kitchen in Rochester

625
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:11,379
and we developed this whole protocol

626
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:15,700
with them so they saved the seed right

627
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:18,520
on-site and gave us back 80 pounds of

628
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:26,220
seed and they kept the rest of the

629
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:27,720
winter squash and food link

630
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,850
linked up in Rochester they're a

631
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:33,450
phenomenal they serve ten counties and

632
00:30:29,849 --> 00:30:37,740
their if make a model food bank for the

633
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:43,880
country and for the world and I'm going

634
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:48,769
to so piecework is a marvelous pepper

635
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:51,900
that is a project that was a farmer led

636
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:55,168
breeding development project but Cornell

637
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:56,580
very much first facilitated it back in

638
00:30:55,169 --> 00:30:58,140
the day and there are so many other

639
00:30:56,579 --> 00:31:01,798
things I wanted to share about this but

640
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:03,570
I am NOT going to so leave this as a as

641
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:05,339
an earmark and perhaps we can pick up

642
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:09,089
this conversation at another time

643
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:13,369
because I'd like to finish with this

644
00:31:09,089 --> 00:31:18,918
slide three years ago I was invited to

645
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:18,918
save seed in the Dominican Republic and

646
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:28,019
here's the thing I've taken for granted

647
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:30,360
my entire life that I have access to

648
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:33,119
seeds so any kind of seed that I could

649
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:35,339
possibly want to grow whether they're

650
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:37,709
organic or not whether they're heirloom

651
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:41,399
whether f-1 any kind of see in the world

652
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:42,798
I have access to in the Dominican

653
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,870
Republic

654
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:49,168
Syngenta owns the rights exclusively to

655
00:31:45,869 --> 00:31:53,158
import seed and sell seed and so anytime

656
00:31:49,169 --> 00:31:56,669
you want to buy a seed in the dr you're

657
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:58,289
buying any one of that one variety

658
00:31:56,669 --> 00:32:02,549
that's available from this one company

659
00:31:58,288 --> 00:32:05,308
and they're ludicrously expensive and

660
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:07,798
it's really exciting to me that they are

661
00:32:05,308 --> 00:32:10,250
saving seeds and sharing seeds and

662
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:12,658
building this incredible seed system

663
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:14,369
that it's not illegal for them to save

664
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:16,980
seed and it's not even illegal for them

665
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:20,719
to sell the see that they grow they just

666
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:23,400
can't import it and then sell it

667
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,769
which brings me to the thought that you

668
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:29,220
have seed packets in your hands I'm so

669
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:31,079
grateful you're going home with some of

670
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,779
my little babies and people ask me if I

671
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:34,409
have children I say yes I've

672
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:38,519
great-great-great-grandchildren effect

673
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:40,290
and you can eat them and I'm so glad

674
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:42,660
you're bringing some of them home it

675
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:45,149
makes me so happy and here's the thing

676
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:49,290
though it's an act of faith to plant a

677
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:51,240
seed and it's an act of faith to buy a

678
00:32:49,289 --> 00:32:54,539
seed packet as well how many of you have

679
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,429
planted something and it's not actually

680
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:58,529
what it was in the seed packet it

681
00:32:56,429 --> 00:33:02,570
happens all the time and fruition seeds

682
00:32:58,529 --> 00:33:04,889
is part of that lovely legacy I'm sure

683
00:33:02,569 --> 00:33:07,829
so it's an active faith you're just

684
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:10,200
going on faith that whatever it says on

685
00:33:07,829 --> 00:33:13,230
the seed packet is what you're planting

686
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:15,090
and what are the questions that you're

687
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:16,829
asking your seed companies what are the

688
00:33:15,089 --> 00:33:20,308
seed what are the questions you're

689
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:23,369
asking yourself what is the world that

690
00:33:20,308 --> 00:33:25,259
you're wanting just to grow and build

691
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:28,619
for your great-great-grandchildren and

692
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:32,179
as are your seed companies actually

693
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:35,609
living into those values they could be

694
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:37,890
they may not be and the more questions

695
00:33:35,609 --> 00:33:41,250
you ask the more opportunities it gives

696
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:45,840
the Davids of the world to be to do the

697
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:48,720
work and I'm really thrilled to be here

698
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:52,319
and I've listened to myself talk way too

699
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,819
much I'm clearly capable of monologues

700
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:57,240
but I'm really excited to have a

701
00:33:53,819 --> 00:34:00,689
dialogue with you all now and so please

702
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,490
by all means keep in touch you'll find

703
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:04,590
all of our contact info on that seed

704
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:08,128
packet you can follow us on Instagram

705
00:34:04,589 --> 00:34:11,099
and Facebook and I hope that you all

706
00:34:08,128 --> 00:34:14,099
come to visit our farm in Naples as well

707
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:17,250
we're an hour and a half west but I'd

708
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:19,309
love to know if there's anything on your

709
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,309
mind

710
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:34,940
Geneva do you have any questions verse

711
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:42,449
[Laughter]

712
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:47,528
[Music]

713
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:58,868
so thank you for your wonderful you're

714
00:34:47,528 --> 00:35:01,088
so welcome thank you for joining us we

715
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:14,890
always hear that again that you can't

716
00:35:01,088 --> 00:35:16,750
grow seeds great question Steve's

717
00:35:14,889 --> 00:35:18,429
question was how how do we produce

718
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:22,179
healthy disease-free seed in the

719
00:35:18,429 --> 00:35:25,239
Northeast and the answer is many folds

720
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:29,588
they're certainly the answer of just

721
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:33,518
don't grow spinach here there are

722
00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:35,409
certain things that I humbly have

723
00:35:33,518 --> 00:35:36,969
learned that there's just a reason that

724
00:35:35,409 --> 00:35:39,068
they're not grown here but the vast

725
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:41,108
majority of crops I really believe that

726
00:35:39,068 --> 00:35:44,528
we can grow here and whether it's

727
00:35:41,108 --> 00:35:46,900
growing things in high tunnels or just

728
00:35:44,528 --> 00:35:49,028
shifting the seasonal little planting

729
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:51,940
planting schedules a little differently

730
00:35:49,028 --> 00:35:54,358
or things like hot water baths you know

731
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:58,059
with tomatoes early blight is seed born

732
00:35:54,358 --> 00:36:01,210
but we hot water baths any of our tomato

733
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:03,819
seed that has that has gone come from

734
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:07,000
early blight plants and then certainly I

735
00:36:03,818 --> 00:36:09,159
have there are so many things that you

736
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,949
know that I don't know and that's where

737
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:15,338
it takes a village and having resources

738
00:36:11,949 --> 00:36:17,169
like Chris smart here at Cornell I am a

739
00:36:15,338 --> 00:36:21,699
little embarrassed how often I email

740
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:23,889
Chris Martin he's amazing and I don't

741
00:36:21,699 --> 00:36:25,629
pretend to have all the answers and as

742
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:27,368
soon as I suspect that there's as soon

743
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:29,798
as there's something I don't know I okay

744
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:32,588
who do I know that might have some

745
00:36:29,798 --> 00:36:34,900
insight so whether it's Chris smart here

746
00:36:32,588 --> 00:36:37,858
at Cornell or sending photos to John

747
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:41,769
navazio you know lots of people have

748
00:36:37,858 --> 00:36:44,048
lots of great insight but I'm been

749
00:36:41,768 --> 00:36:45,659
really fortunate at fruition to not have

750
00:36:44,048 --> 00:36:47,730
significant

751
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:50,429
significant disease issues which I

752
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:52,860
wonder too is partially a scale thing if

753
00:36:50,429 --> 00:36:55,649
you're growing if you're growing acres

754
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:59,039
and acres of acres hundreds of acres of

755
00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:01,440
X and you have limited genetic diversity

756
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:04,320
especially if you're you know perhaps

757
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,240
creating an hybrid with two very inbred

758
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,980
parent lions like there might be some

759
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:11,639
there might be some susceptibility that

760
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:14,039
you may not have in a smaller more

761
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:15,480
diverse context but then on the other

762
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:17,309
side of the coin that smaller more

763
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:21,210
diverse context opens you up to further

764
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:24,630
disease issues potentially as well so

765
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:26,909
it's a great question and we've been

766
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:29,280
really we've been really fortunate slash

767
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:32,159
have learned a lot about what to grow

768
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,710
what not to grow and when we do have

769
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:43,379
disease how to identify it and what to

770
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:44,550
do next son can you tell that story oh

771
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:47,820
I'd love to

772
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:51,480
Michael Mazurek is the beginning of many

773
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:54,720
of our stories and when we started

774
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,880
fruition seeds and met Michael he was

775
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,980
like hey you guys want some watermelon

776
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,380
and we like oh we love some watermelon

777
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:04,250
so he gives us 16 different packets that

778
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:07,110
are all different lines from this

779
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:09,199
initial cross they were the f3

780
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:12,450
generation and it was really fun to grow

781
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:15,539
watermelon I had never seen the

782
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:16,799
diversity potential in watermelon like I

783
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:18,239
never realized that you could have

784
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,280
really sweet watermelon that doesn't

785
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:21,719
taste like watermelon and then you can

786
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,350
have watermelon that tastes so much like

787
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:27,899
watermelon but isn't even sweet and

788
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:30,929
everywhere in between and you know super

789
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,910
thick rinds and some have huge seeds in

790
00:38:30,929 --> 00:38:35,129
some of small seeds and some are more

791
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:37,589
fibrous and some of course mature

792
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:40,110
earlier than others and yeah some of

793
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:42,539
them have more so I was really fun to

794
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:44,820
see all of that diversity in those

795
00:38:42,539 --> 00:38:47,070
initial parent lines and then we've just

796
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:51,720
been playing with them ever since very

797
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:55,050
just phenotypic Lee saying wow I think

798
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:57,969
you're beautiful and delicious and oh

799
00:38:55,050 --> 00:39:01,269
you're productive and early maturing

800
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:04,059
and we're gonna save your seat and so we

801
00:39:01,269 --> 00:39:07,000
we had a number of different lines that

802
00:39:04,059 --> 00:39:09,159
we've just been chasing for the last for

803
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,760
the last handful of years and this last

804
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:18,129
year we we've been kind of eyeing these

805
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:19,869
two as our up-and-coming new varieties

806
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:22,180
and we decided to call it

807
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:24,490
August ambrosia is a variety we're

808
00:39:22,179 --> 00:39:27,539
releasing this next year it's from that

809
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:32,229
initial cross that Michael made and it's

810
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:36,369
between 3/4 and like 6 7 pounds this is

811
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:38,530
the small ovular beautiful it has a

812
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:40,358
color a skin coloration I've never seen

813
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:42,880
before it's like lime green with the

814
00:39:40,358 --> 00:39:45,130
silver lattice over it and it's very

815
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,990
early even in this season we were eating

816
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:50,349
watermelon the first week in September

817
00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:52,569
pardon me in August which kind of blew

818
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:56,590
my mind last year I would have been like

819
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:58,150
yeah here's show off but you had the

820
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:59,890
year to do it in but this year I'm

821
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:02,680
genuinely bowled over that there was a

822
00:39:59,889 --> 00:40:05,710
watermelon that we were eating the first

823
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:06,219
week in August and it has a nice thin

824
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:08,050
rind

825
00:40:06,219 --> 00:40:11,259
the seeds are really small and are

826
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:14,320
delightful to crunch on and so we're

827
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:15,730
really and we had a wonderful party we

828
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,099
have lots of wonderful parties by the

829
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:21,550
way because if we have all this

830
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:24,280
watermelon and we just need the seeds I

831
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:26,560
hope you come enjoy our byproduct with

832
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,700
us I just eat watermelon all day that

833
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,949
was about a month ago

834
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:32,799
and so we had a couple hundred people

835
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:35,529
come to the farm and wander around

836
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:40,930
spitting watermelon seeds and our

837
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:42,910
dahlias and we asked everybody to name

838
00:40:40,929 --> 00:40:45,159
it as well which was incredibly fun and

839
00:40:42,909 --> 00:40:47,769
the grand prize was you named a

840
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:51,399
watermelon and we got all these

841
00:40:47,769 --> 00:40:55,000
wonderful submissions and the one that

842
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:56,588
the one that we liked there was one that

843
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,650
was August and I actually forget what

844
00:40:56,588 --> 00:41:01,239
the second word was and I was like

845
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:03,940
August I like where you're going with

846
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:06,759
this and one of our we have five farms

847
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:10,059
and one of our five farms we call

848
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,250
ambrosia from which is another wonderful

849
00:41:10,059 --> 00:41:13,710
story

850
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:16,050
but it's been one of our isolations for

851
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:18,119
this watermelon for for the last three

852
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:21,900
years so we decided to call it August

853
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:23,490
ambrosia and I don't know what else you

854
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:28,079
have to say except that you'll find it

855
00:41:23,489 --> 00:41:30,029
at at fruition seeds calm as well as at

856
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,900
green star you'll find our seeds and

857
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:35,519
that green tree at home green home and

858
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,500
at the AG way we'll probably have our

859
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:39,509
seeds this next year as well and you'll

860
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,159
can find August and brojo as well as

861
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:43,920

862
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:48,149

00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:05,070
to have a local land-grant university

868
00:42:00,539 --> 00:42:08,460

869
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:14,010
in our backyard and to play this tiny

870
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:38,119
tiny role in giving access to people to

871
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:38,119
