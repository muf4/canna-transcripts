1
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:18,679
thank you Jenny it's great to be here

2
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,039
there we go so thank you all for joining

3
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:24,439
us in this webinar on this rather chilly

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:27,480
January day um as you can see from the

5
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:29,118
BIOS that didn't get read Bora and I

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,320
have been doing Environmental Education

7
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:35,640
for a long time time and Bora this isn't

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,439
on presenter mode yet it's not okay

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,719
that's what I was worried about we're

10
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,000
both going to be sharing back and forth

11
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,719
in this presentation so this isn't a

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,840
typical one where one person talks and

13
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,198
then you figure out your questions and

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,399
then the next person talks we're just

15
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:52,280
going to be going back and forth and

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,039
what I'd love for you to do as we get

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,920
started is to use the chat to tell us

18
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,879
what state you're coming from and what

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,519
your program area is I used to work in

20
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:06,319
extension and so I know that there's a

21
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:08,400
huge range of programs out there from

22
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,239
livestock and agriculture

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,520
to oh I don't know energy and Community

24
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:17,560
Development but let's see who all is

25
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,078
represented out there and that may tell

26
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,280
us how to work some

27
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:25,599
examples great well we've got some 4 AG

talking so as we mentioned the title of

32
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,478
this is Civic engagement for climate

33
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:44,599
action and what we're really talking

34
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:47,359
about is this document there we go that

35
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:49,759
is part of the guidelines for excellence

36
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:52,799
series Bora is going to give you some

37
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,438
background on that Series so you know

38

bit of time telling you about the nwe

43
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:12,079
guidelines for excellence program um

44
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:14,719
that this publication is part of before

45
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,160
we jump into a more detailed discussion

46
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:21,000
of of what you will find when you go in

47
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:23,719
and explore um the the guidelines I

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,680
should mention this is important that

49
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:27,479
the guidelines for excellence is an

50
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,319
initiative of the North American

51
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:31,518
Association for Environmental Education

52
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,598
or

53
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:38,439
nae and I encourage you to uh

54
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:42,238
investigate Nae it's a great great

55
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:46,318
organization um we've had amazing luck

56
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:49,200
to be part of the e360 plus partnership

57
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:52,399
um and also to receive funding from the

58
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:55,439
US EPA Office of Environmental Education

59
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,879
for this project pretty much throughout

60
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:02,280
its its whole history um but we've also

61
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:05,158
had amazing amazing other partners over

62
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,959
the years who help us to develop these

63
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:12,399
guidelines and to help us disseminate

64
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:15,519
them widely um to folks out there so in

65
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,920
the series there are seven

66
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,439
Publications um and just to give you a

67
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:24,479
little bit of a a thumbnail for each one

68
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:27,959
of them the first one is basically K12

69
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:30,798
learner exp expectations that lead to

70
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,039
environmental literacy um they're

71
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:37,959
equivalent to our national standards

72
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:40,919
like ngss or the C3 social studies

73
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,560
standards or the you know Common Core

74
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,719
that kind of thing and they're

75
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,080
benchmarked at fourth grade eighth grade

76
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:50,840
and 12th grade so they help map out how

77
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,799
you might help Learners get towards

78
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,360
environmental literacy and environmental

79
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,400
literacy is core for Environmental

80
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,239
Education we've also um developed a set

81
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,400
of guidelines that's really all about

82
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:07,400
what makes good quality instructional

83
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,519
materials so all of those activity

84
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,519
guides out there that we give to

85
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:16,798
educators of various Elks to help them

86
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:20,358
do activities lessons with their

87
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:22,719
Learners so this set of of of guidelines

88
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:25,279
helps people think about what are good

89
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,360
quality inst Structural Materials for

90
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:32,279
the developer to use but also for the

91
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,319
user user to sort of be able to say well

92
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:37,559
should I adopt these materials or not we

93
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:40,240
also have a a set of guidelines that's

94
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,360
really environmental educator

95
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,560
competencies so what is it that we need

96
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,000
to know and be able to do to be good

97
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,199
environmental Educators there's

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,160
guidelines to help um with program

99
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,079
development process from needs

100
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,080
assessment to program design and

101
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:01,800
implementation to evaluation guidelines

102
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:04,519
for early childhood Environmental

103
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,199
Education and a set of guidelines that

104
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:11,478
looks at how do we go from taking our

105
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:14,800
programs to the community and how do we

106
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:17,240
actually work collaboratively with

107
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,079
communities and then finally our newest

108
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,680
set of guidelines which are the ones

109
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:24,439
that focus on climate action and action

110
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,360
and Justice and we'll get into those

111
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:30,439
more deeply in just a minute or two but

112
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,720
I want to give you a bit of back about

113
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:35,319
how these guidelines are developed

114
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,440
because it's kind of important to to

115
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:41,080
what we do and why we do it all of the

116
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:42,639
guidelines are rooted in research and

117
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:46,159
practice the very

118
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,800
first activity once we've identified a

119
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,880
general topic is we search the

120
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,160
literature we look at practice to try to

121
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:57,959
identify sort of what the big issues are

122
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,520
we form a writing team and once that

123
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:03,680
writing team has a draft ready to share

124
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:07,038
we use a broad-based critique and

125
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,319
consensus process uh where we've

126
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:10,959
literally involve thousands and

127
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:14,560
thousands of individuals and

128
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:19,279
organizations to shape this Suite of

129
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:22,478
sets of guidelines as important um

130
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:25,758
however to development of these sets of

131
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:28,120
guidelines is that we believe that by

132
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,639
involving professionals we're

133
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,720
encouraging real discussions about the

134
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,759
theory and practice of Environmental

135
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,160
Education these discussions often have

136
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:42,439
gone way beyond the topic of the

137
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:45,160
guideline set of guidelines but they

138
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:47,680
basically the Educators had a chance to

139
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,360
reflect on what it means to be an

140
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,280
environmental educator and what we're

141
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,360
trying to accomplish and how we're

142
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:58,239
trying to accomplish and finally we kind

143
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:02,439
of believe that this set of guidelines

144
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:05,478
or having guid lines of and in general

145
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:08,959
um that are based on this critique and

146
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:12,000
consensus Collective wisdom of the field

147
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,120
that we're collecting and documenting

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
effective

149
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,560
practices and this is the first step in

150
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
building a strong professional identity

151
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,519
and a strong profession of Environmental

152
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,839
Education so I'm going to hand that over

153
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:28,359
to

154
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:30,239
Martha and all that brings us to our

155
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,879
latest guideline which is is this one

156
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,639
educating for climate action and Justice

157
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:38,240
we started this whole development

158
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:41,759
process just like Bora said by doing the

159
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,079
research and interviewing about 20 folks

160
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,840
across the field from a variety of

161
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,680
organizations and backgrounds we wanted

162
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:50,758
to know what they thought about this

163
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,038
topic and I think initially the topic

164
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:56,120
was climate change and what makes it

165
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:57,598
effective we also asked them for their

166
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,120
recommendations of what could be

167
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,240
included in the guidelines and who we

168
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,199
should else we should contact

169
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,720
particularly thinking about that writing

170
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:10,360
team so that work led to the development

171
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,879
of a really fantastic writing team made

172
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:17,280
up of 12 folks they all brought

173
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:20,199
different expertise in climate Justice

174
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:24,119
climate education climate change youth

175
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:26,439
engagement a variety of things they met

176
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,720
several times online and several times

177
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:32,278
in person over the course of about two

178
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:36,080
years to develop the guidelines respond

179
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:38,679
to the comments that came in and just

180
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,080
keep thinking and mulling and working

181
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:44,599
out what these things should be we also

182
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,959
formed an Advisory Group that provided

183
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,639
additional insight and helped steer us

184
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:52,559
into a direction that would be useful

185
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,399
throughout the whole process we involved

186
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:58,039
at least 800 individuals and

187
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:01,159
organizations in providing information

188
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:04,480
reviewing drafts giving a feedback and

189
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:07,078
loads and loads of comments not all of

190
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,320
which were were opposite but some of

191
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:11,719
them

192
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,879
were so our product after all this is a

193
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,920
set of

194
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:17,320
guidelines and these are really

195
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:19,639
suggestions for program

196
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,000
development so I thought we'd start in

197
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:24,838
the beginning by asking you to go back

198
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,440
to that chat

199
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:31,480
and think about what it is that you try

200
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:35,440
to remember when you start to design and

201
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:38,039
then Implement a climate program now

202
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,640
some of what we do as extension

203
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:42,679
Educators is the same for any kind of

204
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,120
program so some of that generic stuff is

205
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:47,719
relevant to climate too but is there

206
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,000
anything specific that might be unique

207
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:54,120
to climate that you would keep in your

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,399
mind as you try to develop a climate

209
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:00,078
program and I'll wait a minute for you

210
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,078
to do some typing

211
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:06,240
great thanks Raz right out of the box

212
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:07,120
with ice breakers because you got to get

213
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,560
people

214
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,799
engaged hope is

215
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:16,559
essential and that that draws attention

216
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:18,679
to emotions and the aective domain which

217
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,159
might be important to think about with

218
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:22,599
climate David suggests we think about

219
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:24,159
who is the audience and what do they

220
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,560
care about because it's got to be

221
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,559
relevant and that relates to what Jenny

222
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:31,319
says about community members and their

223
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,319
experiences

224
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,039
interpretation principles are helpful

225
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,278
not just

226
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:42,439
education and Hands-On engagement it

227
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:45,078
some of that might be age specific but

228
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,720
how we engage people is certainly always

229
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:52,159
relevant meeting them where they're at

230
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:56,200
yes all this is important and and what I

231
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:58,278
think is that you all know an awful lot

232
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,278
I mean you're you you're climate

233
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:03,919
Educators you're doing this work and so

234
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,559
we don't want to say oh we know more

235
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:09,000
than you do because you know exactly

236
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:12,078
what we know um and in some ways the

237
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,278
guidelines are going to duplicate and

238
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:17,879
reinforce what you already know but I'm

239
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:20,200
hoping that there could be a few things

240
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:22,360
in the guidelines that you're not

241
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,839
currently doing that might provide you

242
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:28,039
some ideas about how you might extend

243
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:30,639
what you're doing and maybe think about

244
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:33,039
something new and different so these are

245
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,519
ways that might enhance what you're

246
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:38,599
already doing the good thing about the

247
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:42,000
way naae puts together these documents

248
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,639
is that they also include references

249
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,159
that you can use to justify your

250
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:47,839
programs examples and case studies of

251
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:49,399
other things that are out there so if

252
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,120
you need to convince somebody to work

253
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:52,679
with you you can say oh here here's

254
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,159
where they've already done this we can

255
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:56,879
do it too so the guidelines have a lot

256
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:58,480
of resources that you can use even

257
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,278
though you're already doing climate

258
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,959
education

259
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:03,559
so Bora is going to tell us more about

260
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:07,359
what's in this

261
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:10,078
document okay thank you very much so

262
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,560
from the very beginning of our effort to

263
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:16,919
develop this set of guidelines we had a

264
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:19,319
a really big broad guiding notion we

265
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:22,159
wanted to provide recommendations and

266
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:25,680
resources that support using education

267
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:29,679
as a tool for addressing climate change

268
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:31,919
so that was our starting point big Broad

269
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,479
we also went really broad when we

270
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:37,679
thought about who the Educators might be

271
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,959
that we were hopefully going to speak to

272
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:43,399
with this set of guidelines so we

273
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:48,078
thought in terms of teachers extension

274
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:51,159
agents Museum staff Librarians weather

275
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:54,359
broadcaster Faith Educators youth

276
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:57,439
Educators all sorts of different people

277
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,120
within formal and nonformal and informal

278
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,920
education programs working with

279
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,120
everything from the very youngest all

280
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:07,799
the way through adults we have somebody

281
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,759
on our writing team team who's an early

282
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:13,240
childhood educator so even though a lot

283
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:16,639
of environment a lot of climate

284
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,879
education doesn't really apply to that

285
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,639
three-year-old we were still always

286
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:26,720
mindful of like well how might we start

287
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:29,600
the process within that early childhood

288
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,040
age we also began the process process as

289
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,199
a writing team focusing on sort of what

290
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:38,679
we saw as four foundational pillars that

291
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:41,799
would guide all of our work um so the

292
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:44,159
first was frankly a recognition that

293
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:47,319
there is a climate crisis I don't think

294
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:49,600
that probably surprises many of you um

295
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:52,800
and that Earth Systems and human systems

296
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,920
are intertwined so that was just that we

297
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:59,240
put it out there we said that's that's

298
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:02,078
where we're starting from but we also

299
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,639
know the importance of addressing

300
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:07,599
Solutions otherwise people become

301
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,560
hopeless and depressed and

302
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,079
anxious um and we know that there are

303
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:15,838
things communities and industries and

304
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:18,319
individuals are currently doing and that

305
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,759
there's much more that people can be

306
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:25,519
doing from the very beginning we decided

307
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:29,399
that given the urgency of climate change

308
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:32,560
these guidelines needed to focus on not

309
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:35,159
just on climate change or reflect

310
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:38,879
current climate science both of those

311
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:41,679
things are incredibly important but that

312
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:46,240
we also wanted to focus on these climate

313
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:49,679
Solutions we wanted to explicitly avoid

314
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,919
a message that was heavy on gloom and

315
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:56,078
doom and make sure that people sort of

316
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:59,879
had that hope within them that notion

317
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:03,599
that there were Solutions

318
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:06,198
the third pillar um really focuses on

319
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,159
climate action and it's again quite

320
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:12,078
purposeful the guidelines could focus

321
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:15,559
again on education about climate science

322
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:18,479
and how to do that really really well um

323
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:21,559
incredibly important how to engage

324
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:25,759
people in learning about climate change

325
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:28,198
again incredibly important but the team

326
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,759
following the research literature

327
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:34,159
decided that we wanted to be more

328
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:37,600
specific and we wanted the guidelines to

329
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:40,759
focus on educational efforts that Foster

330
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:44,399
climate action um this includes

331
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:47,360
identifying a process to learn about and

332
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,519
select an action and building the skills

333
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,240
that will be

334
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:54,560
necessary um to take that

335
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:59,240
action and finally our fourth

336
00:15:54,559 --> 00:16:01,838
pillar is that we knew that any effect

337
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:06,079
climate change education effort needed

338
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:08,800
to address climate Justice um just as

339
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:11,599
much as it needed to address any of the

340
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:14,240
other pillars in the guidelines

341
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:18,319
introduction we make the argument that

342
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,278
effective climate education requires an

343
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:23,159
understanding and a centering on climate

344
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:25,639
justice as well as a willingness to work

345
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:27,719
towards solutions that address the

346
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:30,919
impact of climate

347
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:34,360
change um in order to get to climate

348
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:37,278
Justice you need climate action though

349
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:40,199
and that action needs to be developed

350
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:43,278
through a process and lead to an outcome

351
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:46,879
that promotes climate justice so we saw

352
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:49,278
all of these four pillars really um

353
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:52,759
interacting intertwining with one

354
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:55,958
another and supporting one

355
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:58,480
another so based on those pillars and

356
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:00,559
that sort of thinking through what was

357
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,159
important important and why were we

358
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:05,240
doing this this work and what type of

359
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:09,240
set of guidelines did we actually want

360
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:12,279
to develop we created uh what we call

361
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,439
key characteristics so we created five

362
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:19,759
key characteristics that basically

363
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:22,798
outline a framework for Effective um

364
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:25,400
education climate action and

365
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:28,400
Justice um there are many different ways

366
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:31,400
that we could have diced and sliced

367
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,880
those four four pillars um you know you

368
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,640
can always have many more key

369
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,880
characteristics or fewer key

370
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,600
characteristics the cross cutting of

371
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:44,640
them is always you know a question but

372
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:46,719
we decided that over the two years and

373
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,120
hearing the feedback from people of what

374
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,880
seemed to make sense and resonate with

375
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:56,038
um with folks out in the field we ended

376
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,000
up with these five um big key

377
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:59,440
characteristics one of the things that

378
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,558
you will notice

379
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:06,000
right off is that there is not a justice

380
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,359
key

381
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,558
characteristic um in an early draft our

382
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:14,599
first draft climate Justice was a key

383
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:17,639
characteristic but it seemed artificial

384
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:19,719
to the writing team um it seemed as if

385
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,080
it was pulling it kind of off to the

386
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,360
side when we really felt that it was

387
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,960
something that needed to be infused

388
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:29,079
throughout so we got into that awkward

389
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,038
bit of having it pulled off to the side

390
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:34,839
and but bringing it up in other places

391
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:37,200
and the feedback that we got from people

392
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:40,798
is that they saw it as being awkward

393
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,400
also and artificial so in the end

394
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:46,038
climate Justice is infused throughout

395
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,600
the guidelines and highlighted in each

396
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:51,839
and every key characteristic so each and

397
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:52,678
every phase or step that we outline in

398
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,480
the

399
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:58,600
guidelines so our first key

400
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,200
characteristic um we started with one

401
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:05,158
that suggests how educators should

402
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:07,200
approach climate education by creating a

403
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:08,760
collaborative welcoming and responsive

404
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,558
learning

405
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:13,798
environment basically we think that with

406
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:16,599
all of Environmental Education whether

407
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:18,839
you're taking kids out for a one- day

408
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:21,279
walk in the woods or you're doing an

409
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:23,879
ongoing community-based program down at

410
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:28,319
the library or working with fifth

411
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:30,440
graders throughout the year um and it's

412
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,678
important important to ensure inclusive

413
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,159
learning environments engaging Learners

414
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:40,320
in open inquiry and working with

415
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:43,320
Learners to explore World Views and

416
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:45,119
perspectives we also felt that it was

417
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:47,798
particularly

418
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,439
important probably because it's climate

419
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:52,679
and because it's

420
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,960
controversial um that the Learners and

421
00:19:52,679 --> 00:20:00,480
the Educators examine climate change

422
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,480
information and misinformation

423
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,360
and one of the things that we wanted to

424
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:08,558
sort of

425
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:11,399
say which may be kind of du uh is that

426
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:13,918
this first key characteristic describes

427
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:17,519
Effective Education whether you're

428
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:20,799
focusing on climate or biodiversity or

429
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:23,599
solid waste um but we felt that it was

430
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:27,400
important to articulate it and lay it

431
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:29,839
out with sort of a focus on climate um

432
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:33,400
climate education

433
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:36,199
so the second key characteristic focuses

434
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:39,120
on Knowledge and Skills that Foster

435
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,519
climate action and Justice so again

436
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,918
we're taking that lens of that

437
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:47,279
everything is about fostering climate

438
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:51,000
action and fostering climate justice but

439
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:54,200
what are those basic the basic knowledge

440
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,640
and those skills that will need in order

441
00:20:54,200 --> 00:21:00,400
to do that kind of work um this key

442
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,720
characteristic puts an emphasis on

443
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,759
understanding Earth Systems and human

444
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:09,480
systems and developing systems thinking

445
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:12,519
skills um it also focuses on the

446
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,200
development of the action strategies and

447
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:18,200
skills and the building of personal and

448
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:22,159
civic responsibility that you need in

449
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:25,759
order to Foster climate action and

450
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:28,640
Justice as we were developing our

451
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:31,839
guidelines we knew that the Federal

452
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:36,000
agencies were revising their climate

453
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:39,599
literacy guide um so we kind of didn't

454
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,599
bother to go into the types of depth

455
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:46,319
that that they talk about um because

456
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:49,798
they did it it was also kind of Handy

457
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:53,158
Dandy um because Frank

458
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:54,960
Neo who was one of the leaders of that

459
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:57,720
process of developing the climate

460
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,240
literacy essential principles for

461
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,440
understanding and addressing in climate

462
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:05,759
change he was on our writing team so we

463
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,798
were able to sort of give some feedback

464
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,200
back and forth and recognize that we

465
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:13,879
were really sort of pretty much on the

466
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:17,120
same same page as we moved

467
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:20,120
along we basically think that every

468
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:22,399
climate education model or set of

469
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:25,119
guidelines typically includes some sort

470
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840
of foundation of climate science

471
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,158
knowledge and may get into a bit of the

472
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:31,558
skills

473
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:33,600
um we're recommending that if you

474
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:35,480
haven't already looked at them because

475
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,719
they're pretty new they were launched in

476
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,880
the fall is that you take a look at the

477
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:45,759
climate literacy essential principles um

478
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:49,679
it's really a great companion piece to

479
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:52,519
our guidelines and as Martha sort of

480
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:55,120
mentioned they're a resource that can

481
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:57,839
give you some you know some background

482
00:22:55,119 --> 00:23:00,359
they could give you an entree into

483
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:04,558
certain group groups of people to

484
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:06,759
basically say not only do I think that

485
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:09,759
this sort of work is important but

486
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:11,240
here's work that has been done by all of

487
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:16,679
these federal

488
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:20,480
agencies um so the intersection between

489
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:23,159
our guidelines and and the essential

490
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,679
principles are you know sort of pretty

491
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:27,880
obvious once you start to play with them

492
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,038
is that in addition to placing an

493
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,559
emphasis on on the science behind

494
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:35,000
climate change and that knowledge that

495
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:37,519
you need which is their essential

496
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,319
principle number two they talk about the

497
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:43,000
impacts which is principle number

498
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:44,319
four they talk about mitigation

499
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,558
principle number

500
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:50,918
seven um they also call out equity which

501
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:53,119
is principle number five and they say

502
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:57,440
basically that climate Justice is

503
00:23:53,119 --> 00:24:01,239
possible if climate actions are

504
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,120
equitable and they call out hope and em

505
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,519
and

506
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:09,119
urgency which is number eight a livable

507
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:11,759
and sustainable future for all is

508
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,678
possible with rapid just and

509
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:16,278
transformable

510
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:20,919
transformational okay that word on

511
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:24,919
climate action so we really see this as

512
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:27,240
being a great complimentary piece to our

513
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:31,440
guide and we certainly hope that they

514
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:35,880
see our guidelines as complimentary for

515
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:39,159
them um key characteristic three calls

516
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:43,000
attention to the importance of climate

517
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:45,520
emotions um we obviously don't want

518
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,759
Learners to increase their level of

519
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:50,839
worry or their curs concerns or their

520
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:53,519
anxiousness or their

521
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:55,918
grief we want them to recognize that

522
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:56,918
people are doing things and that things

523
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,880
are

524
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:03,840
possible um we as Educators need to

525
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:08,039
recognize and acknowledge that climate

526
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:10,480
emotions are real um that we have them

527
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:13,200
that our Learners have them and that

528
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,200
they really need to be addressed one way

529
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,000
or the other in our

530
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:24,200
programs we also call out the need for

531
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:27,319
colle for to cultivate constructive hope

532
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:31,240
and to develop self-efficacy in

533
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:34,119
agency with constructive hope it's a

534
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,839
it's a concept that is based on Research

535
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:39,599
evidence and basically what it tells us

536
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:41,798
is that hope needs to go beyond wishful

537
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:44,319
thinking that that's wishful thinking is

538
00:25:41,798 --> 00:25:46,240
great you know I certainly hope it

539
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:49,240
doesn't rain tomorrow because I really

540
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,919
want to go for that hike out on the

541
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:56,919
coast um yeah wishful thinking we do it

542
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:58,880
all the time but in order for things to

543
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:02,399
Hope really matter

544
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,760
we need Learners to develop constructive

545
00:26:02,398 --> 00:26:09,199
hope where they actively engage with

546
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:10,879
shaping the future with a plan to

547
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,278
achieve a

548
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:17,880
goal where they're actively engaged in

549
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:21,839
taking action so that notion of

550
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:25,120
constructive hope is really key to this

551
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,759
idea of that we need to have attention

552
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,398
on climate

553
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:33,079
emotions Alterna over to

554
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:34,759
Martha thank you so Bora has just gone

555
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:36,480
through the first three key

556
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,000
characteristics I'm going to do the last

557
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,200
two number four and number five with

558
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,440
some examples and so that's just where

559
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,278
we are in the road map so here we are at

560
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,038
number

561
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:50,880
four excellent climate change education

562
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:54,759
is locally focused and community-driven

563
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,919
now by Community we could mean either a

564
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:58,798
geographic Community like a town or a

565
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:01,679
city or a neighborhood

566
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:05,720
or a functional Community like a school

567
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:08,440
or a workplace either one works as a

568
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,679
community and we want good education to

569
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,840
be relevant to that Community those

570
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:15,360
community members which means the

571
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:19,000
educator is going to be making a bridge

572
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:21,959
between the the learner and the

573
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
communities and and having that

574
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,480
Community engaged could also mean that

575
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,119
the educator now has more expertise

576
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,960
available to them um filling in some

577
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:33,719
gaps perhaps in climate science or

578
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,360
climate Justice or climate action

579
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,558
whatever they need and more people are

580
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:40,918
engaged it also means that if the

581
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:44,918
Learners are going to be doing a

582
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:47,519
community project as their action

583
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:49,919
there's a local place for it and it's

584
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,599
just easier to see success when you're

585
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,240
working locally than when you're trying

586
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:57,798
to work at the national or International

587
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,200
level so we're talking about developing

588
00:27:57,798 --> 00:28:02,879
skills that move in this

589
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:06,679
direction there's a number of useful

590
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:11,200
tools that might help you as Educators

591
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:14,320
think about the community and one is EJ

592
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,720
screen Jenny already put the website in

593
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:20,599
the chat so there it is and it's on the

594
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:23,319
screen again um the environmental

595
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:26,079
justice screening and mapping tool is

596
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:28,720
developed by the US EPA and in case

597
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:31,158
you're not familiar with it yet um we'll

598
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,919
just give you an introduction right here

599
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:37,399
one thing I might want to say however is

600
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:41,440
go there soon we don't know how much

601
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:44,079
longer this website will be active um

602
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,919
you we just don't know these things so

603
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:48,119
there's categories on the left that

604
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,360
you'll see when you get to the EJ screen

605
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:52,398
and you can plug in the ZIP code or the

606
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:54,759
community name of where the community is

607
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:57,199
you're looking for so you do that you

608
00:28:54,759 --> 00:29:00,720
get these categories on the left and

609
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:05,600
they're all different kinds of

610
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:07,880
maps um so the environmental justice

611
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:10,519
index so right there in the center is

612
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:13,278
the list of the Justice indexes those

613
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:17,159
are actually a combination of both the

614
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:19,159
environmental burden index and the

615
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:22,360
demographic index so they're already

616
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:24,440
mushed together um showing you the

617
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:27,000
percentage of people by consent by

618
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,759
census blocks that are exposed to each

619
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,079
of these burdens whichever one you've

620
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:33,720
you've clicked

621
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:35,918
on there are maps for climate data and

622
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,440
you can see in the upper right corner

623
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,559
there it's flood

624
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,720
Wildfire flood plane sea level rise and

625
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:46,200
extreme heat but there is not an overlay

626
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,759
between the climate data and the

627
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:52,440
demographic data so you have to do that

628
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:54,960
by eyeball so here's an example of flood

629
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,960
risk in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania because

630
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,759
you got to pick somewhere and of course

631
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,278
Pittsburgh has Rivers running through it

632
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:02,359
and next to the rivers it's where

633
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:04,880
there's a flood risk but you can also

634
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:08,278
see that it's sort of spotty as you go

635
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:11,360
beyond that and if you take the

636
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:13,599
demographic data from the housing burden

637
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:16,519
which happens to be where people earn

638
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:19,038
less than median income and spend more

639
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:22,278
than 30% of it on

640
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:25,278
housing that's the census blocks of

641
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:28,278
where that's showing up um so you can

642
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:30,759
see there's some overlap between housing

643
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:35,599
burden and flood risk so if you're

644
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:38,599
looking to do a workshop for example on

645
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:41,079
climate climate issues and you want to

646
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:43,558
pick one of those places you might want

647
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:45,759
to emphasize flooding as an impact of

648
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:48,639
climate because that could be relevant

649
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:51,599
to them so you can also look at other

650
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,960
kinds of maps and align those to climate

651
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:56,480
change you can grab any of the

652
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,880
socioeconomic indicators which could

653
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,079
suggest Justice issues of some sort um

654
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,960
people of color unemployment limited

655
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:08,199
English Etc this one happens to Show Low

656
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,319
Income along with flood risk so you can

657
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,480
see you can see who you're talking to or

658
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:15,918
if you're talking to a community from

659
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,960
you know somewhere on the Hills outside

660
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:22,159
Pittsburgh and they're interested in

661
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:24,840
doing an activity around Justice then

662
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,840
they need to go to these we this website

663
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:28,439
and and figure out okay here's a

664
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:30,158
community that

665
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,558
we could think about doing something

666
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,960
with and then organize how you

667
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:38,278
communicate with that community and

668
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:41,798
everything else so that's the EJ

669
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:44,319
screen the fifth characteristic is Civic

670
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:45,798
engagement for climate action it sounds

671
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:48,240
kind of similar to what we were just

672
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:49,759
talking about and we went around mushing

673
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,720
these together and pulling them apart

674
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:55,359
several times and decided that no first

675
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:59,120
people need to learn about the community

676
00:31:55,359 --> 00:32:01,439
and second people need to think about

677
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:03,599
action and there's many different kinds

678
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,679
of actions of course you can plant trees

679
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:08,480
you can clean up streams you can do all

680
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,559
sorts of things but we're saying you

681
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,679
know what is excellence in Environmental

682
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:15,720
Education and climate education and

683
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:18,200
Excellence we thought we're recommending

684
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:22,600
is moving towards Civic engagement as

685
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:25,679
the kind of action so it's it's not just

686
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:29,158
doing something but it's learning about

687
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:31,519
policy and power and who makes decisions

688
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:34,200
and who influences those decision Mak

689
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:37,798
makers and what are the systems in my

690
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:40,759
community for making a change and then

691
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:43,398
that becomes the action working toward

692
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:46,200
making a change sometimes it just may be

693
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:47,719
asking for a change sometimes it may be

694
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,120
telling the newspaper we're going to

695
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,038
make a statement and getting the

696
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:53,359
newspaper to help encouraging people to

697
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:56,038
make a change there's all sorts of ways

698
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:58,798
you can make change um and so we're

699
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:01,240
suggesting think about Civic

700
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:03,918
engagement um it's

701
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:06,159
empowering and people can see that they

702
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:10,038
could be making a change in policy for

703
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:12,200
the long term not just for the length of

704
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:14,679
time this particular maintenance person

705
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:19,000
is willing to keep this particular

706
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:22,720
Garden in its location but for the long

707
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,720
time um so that's

708
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,600
important so yeah I'm just checking to

709
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:29,759
see that I've said everything I wanted

710
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:29,759
to

711
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,919
say it's a process and that's what we

712
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,519
wanted to

713
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,480
say I think there are several extension

714
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:41,839
programs around the country that are

715
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,480
using the exact same series and process

716
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:46,319
of learning information making a

717
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,880
difference in your community and those

718
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:50,558
are all the climate stewards programs

719
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,639
that there's probably people from

720
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:55,678
Cornell and California and Oregon and

721
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:58,319
Illinois on this on this webinar and so

722
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:01,399
yes you've got programs and there's

723
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:03,158
more in the common denominator seems to

724
00:34:01,398 --> 00:34:05,678
be that participants get information

725
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:08,280
about climate and climate impacts apply

726
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,720
them to their local area work together

727
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,399
to figure out what they can do to either

728
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:17,279
increase Community resilience or reduce

729
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:19,838
greenhouse gases and this is the one two

730
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,200
3 four five across the the middle there

731
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:25,918
are the objectives from the Cornell

732
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:28,559
program and what I've done is to add the

733
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:31,039
arrows on the bottom that suggest the

734
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:34,519
key characteristics in the naae

735
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:37,878
guidelines that relate to those four

736
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:40,719
objectives for example Bora suggests

737
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:43,000
Bora said that guideline number one has

738
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:45,559
to do with welcoming atmosphere and

739
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,239
engaging people and doing a good job of

740
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:50,679
running a program that's number one so

741
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:53,398
I've got number one spread out through

742
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:55,559
one two and three of the objectives

743
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:57,440
because whenever the educator is leading

744
00:34:55,559 --> 00:35:00,838
the group that's that's how they're

745
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,000
going to do it Knowledge and Skills and

746
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:05,279
characteristic two seem like they're

747
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,639
really presented in objective two

748
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,560
because you're developing the confidence

749
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,239
and

750
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:11,759
skill the success stories and examples

751
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:14,919
that build hope which is our

752
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:18,200
characteristic three seem to be embedded

753
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:20,720
in objective number two and as they

754
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:23,199
create their own activity it comes up in

755
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,118
objective number four and then the local

756
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:28,799
community is engaged in number three and

757
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:31,200
number four so that's our characteristic

758
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,880
four and finally the action is the

759
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:35,559
activity that they do in objective four

760
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:38,480
and that's characteristic five so

761
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:41,480
there's a close correlation these

762
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,159
guidelines are nothing dramatically

763
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,400
new we're just thinking that it's a

764
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:49,960
resource that's out there that might be

765
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:52,800
useful to you another example is that we

766
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:56,480
believe youth also can follow these

767
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:59,359
guidelines and do climate action and

768
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,159
Justice uh the cap program is Community

769
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:02,639
Action projects for the environment

770
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:06,199
developed out of the University of

771
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:08,519
Florida it was developed for 4 but we've

772
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:11,639
had groups in museums and zoos and

773
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:14,119
schools use it as well in fact this

774
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:16,318
summer we're going to Pilot this cap

775
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:19,358
program with senior citizens to see how

776
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:21,239
that works um and it's basically a

777
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,719
process where the group goes through

778
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:25,759
brainstorming and exploring developing

779
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:28,559
and implementing an action project and

780
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:32,160
then reflecting on it the action in this

781
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:36,078
case is that they identify a decision

782
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:38,399
maker and make a request for a change

783
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,000
that benefits everybody related to

784
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,880
whatever issue it is that they've chosen

785
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,838
to

786
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,760
explore

787
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:52,318
and Jenny's GNA put up

788
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:54,960
another URL for

789
00:36:52,318 --> 00:36:58,920
Cape and that's that's the end of our

790
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:04,280
orientation to the program itself

791
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:07,079
laa okay so um just to let you know that

792
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,640
these materials are available for free

793
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:13,800
download from the naaa website so you

794
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:17,440
can click on the URL or I put the uh URL

795
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:19,800
in the chat and that you can also get to

796
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,639
all of the sets of guidelines that I

797
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:26,760
mentioned um they're all available for

798
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:28,879
free download um up on the NAA website

799
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:33,400
and then finally finally we just wanted

800
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:37,240
to point out that nwe has developed um a

801
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:41,000
climate change education Hub that you

802
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:44,439
can find information about education

803
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,239
policy and research about effective

804
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:50,599
climate change education strategies

805
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:54,358
climate Justice resources and much much

806
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:57,240
more so please you know visit that that

807
00:37:54,358 --> 00:38:00,559

00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:24,800
naae um does workshops around these

838
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:28,119
guidelines and has a trainers Bureau

839
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,560
that is full of people who are capable

840
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:33,240
and interested and available to do those

841
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:35,799
workshops in local areas extension

842
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:38,959
Educators may be interested in becoming

843
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,880
a trainer for the climate guidelines or

844
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,358
for any other guidelines and if you are

845
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,680
you need to talk to Bora because she

846
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:49,279
runs that program but each of these

847
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:52,679
guidelines now has a series of

848
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,800
activities for presenters to use in

849
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:58,358
workshops so those are resources that

850
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:01,599
are available too yeah just to just feed

851
00:39:58,358 --> 00:40:04,519

set up so this is the n website um and

867
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:50,719
there's just a ton of stuff on here uh

868
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:53,759
if you have a boring rainy snowy day

869
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:55,078
someday go in and investigate it's

870
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,720
almost

871
00:40:55,079 --> 00:41:01,200
all well in fact it is it's almost all

872
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:04,279
free it's almost all accessible without

873
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:07,799
you know being a member you sometimes

874
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:12,680
have to sign up for like the E Pro stuff

875
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:14,720
and have a have a password but you don't

876
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:17,598
have to pay anything but and then you

877
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:20,078
have access to everything so under

878
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,400
programs you just as just say I should

879
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,760
do that I should say under programs this

880
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,920
is how you could also get to the

881
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,280
guidelines for excellence so we're under

882
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,200
program

883
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,200
whoops whoopsie we're under the climate

884
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:35,799
change

885
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:39,919
education and you know so there's been a

886
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:44,480
lot of work being done on climate policy

887
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:47,639
there's a call that is done I think

888
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:51,199
monthly of people looking at advocacy

889
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:54,759
issues around uh climate education and

890
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:57,000
Environmental Education in general um so

891
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:59,720
there's just all sorts of there's this

892
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,079
Co Coalition that puts things together

893
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:06,679
you can join it again for free um Na is

894
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:10,880
really great in terms of really trying

895
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:16,358
to make things accessible to everybody

896
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:18,920
um so it advertises different you know

897
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:21,480
surveys that have been done with

898
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:25,240
Educators so they've done this series of

899
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:27,240
of surveys of uh administrators and

900
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:31,358
classroom teachers and I believe the

901
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:35,399
newest one is um with non-formal

902
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:38,880
Educators so there's just a ton a ton of

903
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:42,760
stuff on here uh different resources

904
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:45,318
including policy uh information about

905
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:48,520
policy just basic stuff what is it

906
00:42:45,318 --> 00:42:51,000
climate literacy you know getting into

907
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:54,199
what's happening out there linking to

908
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,400
webinars that are being done um we're

909
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:58,879
doing another well I'm doing another

910
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,960
webinar tomorrow tomorrow that is a

911
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:04,240
shortened version talking about this set

912
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,800
of guidelines but also with Frank Neo

913
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:10,078
talking about the climate literacy

914
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,200
principles and someone from uh MIT

915
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,640
talking about some re uh service

916
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:17,439
learning resources that they have so

917
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:20,920
there's just you know a lot of stuff out

918
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:24,838
there and available to folks it just

919
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:28,400
takes some time I know time um to dig

920
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:28,400
into it all

921
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:32,239
that's great Bora I just wanted to

922
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:35,119
mention that the name North American

923
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:38,598
Association for Environmental Education

924
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,640
implies that it's perhaps equally Mexico

925
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:42,880
Canada

926
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:45,759
us but it isn't um

927
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:49,280
unfortunately uh we welcome Mexicans

928
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:53,040
Canadians and us people to join but it

929
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,559
is primarily driven by the United States

930
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:57,838
membership

931
00:43:54,559 --> 00:44:00,720
and resources

932
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:02,318
yeah that's just the way it goes um we

933
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:05,358
have had conferences in Canada and

934
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:06,880
Mexico and the the cost of translating

935
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:09,838
to French and

936
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,400
Spanish is really really challenging for

937
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:15,119
small professional associations to

938
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:18,280
manage um so there's a question about

939
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,960
how naae is supported and funded and the

940
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:23,720
demographics oh well I just started to

941
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:27,679
do that didn't I um membership

942
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:30,679
organization it's um members can join

943
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:33,598
and pay a small fee uh the conference

944
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:37,279
usually generates small income to help

945
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:39,160
support staff there are staff um I used

946
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,000
to say in Washington DC but they

947
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:43,399
actually work from home in a variety of

948
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,599
places so it's not just Washington DC

949
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:50,760
anymore um and they get grants big

950
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:53,160
grants lots of Grants supports from Noah

951
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:56,119
for climate education support from US

952
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:57,920
EPA for training and that's part of the

953
00:44:56,119 --> 00:45:01,119
support that has

954
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:06,720
generated the guidelines for excellence

955
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:09,838
um just lots of Partnerships and lots of

956
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:11,879
support um Bor do you want to say

957
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:13,358
anything more about support and funding

958
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,200
and demographics well I think about

959
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:18,000
Paul's

960
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:21,399
question um yeah other than you know one

961
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,960
of the the challenges that NAA has is

962
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:27,559
that you know like many small not for

963
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:30,240
profits is that a lot of our funding

964
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:33,200
comes from the federal government and so

965
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:34,879
that's always precarious and we're right

966
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:37,639
now in a

967
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:41,640
precarious point we're supposed to start

968
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:43,639
our fifth year of that e360 plus um

969
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:46,598
grant that we have with eepa we're

970
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:48,960
supposed to start that June 1st well the

971
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:51,119
papers haven't been signed and they

972
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,119
normally aren't signed by this time but

973
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:55,358
we don't know what the new

974
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:59,800
Administration will do uh with EPA in

975
00:45:55,358 --> 00:46:03,519
general uh and so we're at a we'll see

976
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:07,318
uh so funding is a real issue but we do

977
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:10,599
get funding from uh private foundations

978
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:12,838
we get funding from donors we get

979
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:16,720
funding from basically whoever will give

980
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:18,599
us money uh to do the the work we do and

981
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:21,078
so a lot of the attention I mean

982
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:24,720
Martha's spending a lot of her time now

983
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:28,119
writing or helping the staff uh and the

984
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:30,919
executive director write proposals so

985
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:34,280
that we can keep doing the work that we

986
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:36,519
do but getting the funding to be able to

987
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,720
to do it so all of you who do who write

988
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:42,280
proposals you know that it's it's a

989
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:44,439
challenge um it's always a challenge um

990
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:48,319
in terms of the demographics of the

991
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:50,358
membership most are what I would Pro I

992
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:53,639
would put into the big bucket of

993
00:46:50,358 --> 00:46:56,960
nonformal Educators a lot of agency

994
00:46:53,639 --> 00:47:01,039
people state agency people natural

995
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:03,920
resources kinds of folks um the people

996
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:06,318
who sponsor things like project Learning

997
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:11,000
Tree and project wet and project wild at

998
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:15,119
the state level um university people so

999
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:17,559
but again most of our members are us we

1000
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:21,000
do have a program that we're the

1001
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:24,000
Secretariat of that's called Jeep which

1002
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,079
is the Global Environmental Education

1003
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,760
partnership and that uh that brings in a

1004
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:34,480
lot of members from other parts of the

1005
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:37,400
world um so we're we're a weird a weird

1006
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:41,119
mix and now you can think about the next

1007
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:45,119
question yes thank you uh good old Paul

1008
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:48,039
um of course we all have challenges

1009
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:50,240
extension is driven by state Politics as

1010
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:53,159
much as it is driven by national

1011
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:55,759
politics and extension agents are

1012
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:59,519
sensitive to politics both at the state

1013
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:02,720
level and their community level so I

1014
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:05,679
think the letter grades range from not

1015
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:08,679
doing very much at all in a livestock

1016
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:14,199
and Range Community where

1017
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:17,879
people think one thing and to very high

1018
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:19,598
in urban communities where they're on a

1019
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,400
coast and the sea level is rising and

1020
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:24,480
they're talking about making adaptation

1021
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,599
to climate change in Florida I think the

1022
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:30,159
seagrant folks are doing a phenomenal

1023
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:32,240
job job of climate literacy in their

1024
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:34,920
Coastal communities because the

1025
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:36,719
communities want to know what's going on

1026
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:39,519
and how they can protect themselves and

1027
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:41,318
how can they be more resilient until we

1028
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:44,000
get to that point where everybody in a

1029
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:46,318
community wants to know

1030
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,760
um extension agents are going to have a

1031
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:51,000
harder

1032
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:54,280
time we're we're currently investigating

1033
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,880
how it is we talk about climate change

1034
00:48:54,280 --> 00:49:00,720
when people don't want to hear those two

1035
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:02,680
words close together and so I I think we

1036
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:05,159
need to do some research on motivated

1037
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:08,519
reasoning and what are

1038
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:10,078
those buttons that we want to avoid

1039
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:13,079
getting people upset

1040
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:13,079
about

1041
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:20,798
and I think these questions are good for

1042
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:24,960
everybody Paul should Educators

1043
00:49:20,798 --> 00:49:29,400
be be do their work without any kind of

1044
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:31,798
politics or not how do how do we make

1045
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,798
sure we're doing a good job when

1046
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:36,039
education is

1047
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:37,639
political I I'm not the one to answer

1048
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:39,480
these I think everybody should think

1049
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:42,759
about

1050
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:46,358
them so how are we com com working

1051
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:46,359
through Dei stuff these

1052
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:52,838
days it's a good

1053
00:49:49,798 --> 00:49:55,280
question my personal sense is is that

1054
00:49:52,838 --> 00:49:58,318
people will pick these set this set of

1055
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,079
guidelines up and just as Martha was

1056
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:02,960
saying the people in

1057
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:06,119
Florida respond to the people that

1058
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:09,400
they're working with you don't

1059
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:11,400
necessarily if if you're doing some sort

1060
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,960
of Workshop or you're doing some sort of

1061
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:18,200
work or you're developing curriculum

1062
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:20,760
materials or whatever offering a

1063
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:22,519
program typically you're not going to

1064
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:25,880
give them the set of guidelines unless

1065
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:28,159
you're training them in these guidelines

1066
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,640
so it becomes part of the work part of

1067
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:31,318
the work becomes knowing your your group

1068
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:33,879
and

1069
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:36,119
knowing uh the language they use and

1070
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:39,880
knowing what are you know things that

1071
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:43,160
are they're going to see as being

1072
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:45,720
political or you know whatever we were

1073
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:48,159
told while we were developing these that

1074
00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:49,639
in certain communities it's like nope

1075
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:52,480
we're not going to be able to use them

1076
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:54,318
and it's like yeah okay but can you talk

1077
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,920
about resilience can you talk about

1078
00:50:54,318 --> 00:51:00,838
Community resilience can you talk about

1079
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:02,599
well we know that the sea level is

1080
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:05,519
rising in certain places and there's

1081
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:09,440
flooding can we talk about that and what

1082
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:12,679
what to do about it so it's I I think it

1083
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:16,720
becomes a bigger challenge um with the

1084
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:19,879
current Administration but um I stand by

1085
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:22,318
our work and I stand by our language I

1086
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:24,960
just think that with as with most

1087
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:27,159
education you have to know your your

1088
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:30,000
audience and there was a question about

1089
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:34,759
my use of nonformal Educators this is an

1090
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:37,159
e thing goes back to like the 60s um but

1091
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:40,280
basically we think of nonformal we we

1092
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:44,078
put a basically a a flip between formal

1093
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:47,319
Educators our K12 Educators maybe

1094
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:50,960
University um and non-formal Educators

1095
00:51:47,318 --> 00:51:52,558
or zoo and Museum and nature centers and

1096
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,599
all of those things I would put

1097
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:57,599
extension agents as non-formal Educators

1098
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:00,838
in our sort of

1099
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:04,000
division of the world um you know

1100
00:52:00,838 --> 00:52:06,759
nonformal Educators and what the science

1101
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,880
Community calls informal educators are

1102
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:12,000
really very much the same thing so don't

1103
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:15,000
get hung up on

1104
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:19,199
it so I tried to answer raza's question

1105
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,679
about Dei um and this is just as a

1106
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:23,960
hypothesis I'm putting this out there

1107
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:25,679
for you all to think about in my head it

1108
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,798
makes sense to think about climate

1109
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:30,719
Justice work in three different

1110
00:52:27,798 --> 00:52:32,719
categories one is who are the Learners

1111
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:35,959
and if I'm specifically targeting a

1112
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:38,399
title one school then then then my

1113
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:41,960
audience is coming from a certain

1114
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:44,519
clientele that counts as

1115
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:46,960
Justice no matter who the audience is

1116
00:52:44,519 --> 00:52:49,719
the second bucket is the content I can

1117
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:52,838
teach about how climate change is

1118
00:52:49,719 --> 00:52:54,598
variable and the impacts are variable

1119
00:52:52,838 --> 00:52:56,960
and some people get a bigger burden than

1120
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:58,480
others and they are already have a

1121
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,280
bigger burden in some ways

1122
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,920
socioeconomically than others and so

1123
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:05,240
there's Justice and Injustice going on

1124
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:09,119
that's the second bucket the third one

1125
00:53:05,239 --> 00:53:13,199
relates to that climate action piece and

1126
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:14,760
helping people make change so no matter

1127
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:18,798
who it is that's making change the

1128
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:21,280
change shouldn't make injustices more it

1129
00:53:18,798 --> 00:53:23,798
shouldn't aggravate the Injustice and so

1130
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:27,119
we want the change to work toward

1131
00:53:23,798 --> 00:53:29,639
creating more Justice in any

1132
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:33,760
Community um and

1133
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:37,159
so you can think about doing Dei work in

1134
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:39,280
any of those Dimensions I think and feel

1135
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:41,879
like you're helping to move the world in

1136
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:44,040
the right direction and you can call it

1137
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,559
whatever you need to call it based on

1138
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:50,519
your administrator and your

1139
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,519
state at least that's what I

1140
00:53:51,639 --> 00:53:58,199
think okay I I have totally enjoyed this

1141
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:02,680
conversation today thank you so much

1142
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:06,399
Bora and Martha for sharing um you're

1143
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:08,960
thoughtful and inspiring and um I'll

1144
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:12,400
also say warm

1145
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:15,358
approach um to thinking about how we can

1146
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:18,440
all work together to build Equitable

1147
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:21,119
futures for all so I think um I just

1148
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:23,798
want to give a warm thank you to Bora

1149
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:26,880
and Martha for sharing your time today

1150
00:54:23,798 --> 00:54:32,960
and then I want to just add um that I

1151
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:35,798
recently saw a a a big sign that said um

1152
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:40,358
no justice no peace and it was spelled

1153
00:54:35,798 --> 00:54:43,280
KN n o w KN n o w if we know Justice we

1154
00:54:40,358 --> 00:54:47,318
know peace and I think it's a very

1155
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:50,440
constructive way of thinking about um

1156
00:54:47,318 --> 00:54:54,519
you know in a a certain way Justice is a

1157
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:58,838
very profound word um and one that is at

1158
00:54:54,519 --> 00:55:02,039
the Forefront of our whole culture and

1159
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:05,078
within that Justice um we can find

1160
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:08,798
Equity so I just want to say thank you

1161
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:10,359
again for a wonderful presentation and

1162
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:13,960
for folks

1163
00:55:10,358 --> 00:55:16,719

policies for uh research and duplication

so you can see what other states are

1177
00:55:52,039 --> 00:55:57,319
doing or what your state is empowered to

1178
00:55:54,358 --> 00:56:00,679
do um in order to think about how to

1179
00:55:57,318 --> 00:56:03,279
mobilize behind those current policies
