1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,359
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,359
University

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,089
thank you thank you so much for the kind

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:16,089
introduction and for was importantly for

5
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:20,559
having me here on this beautiful campus

6
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:22,329
I if you ever visit texas a man and you

7
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:25,390
would like to see fall colors you will

8
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:28,238
never see that not now not later it's

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,099
going to be all the same gray is it

10
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,259
vintage fine it's so pretty here I

11
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:34,060
wished more when they fly back to that

12
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,710
since I will take a picture from the

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,500
plane to throw my wife because she

14
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,329
misses for the fall colors

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,000
I

16
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:45,160
have quite a bit of slides but the

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,768
journey to the slides are simple so I

18
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:49,599
will go through the past and they are

19
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:52,000
showing a bunch of different phenotypes

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,170
and that's the point of my participation

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,420
today is to convince you that

22
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,969
there is life beyond just mana gated

23
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,739
just one occasion it's just one of the

24
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:04,019
acceleration reduced by the plants and

25
00:01:02,738 --> 00:01:06,670
plants produce

26
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,770
hundreds of different and other level

27
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,950
species of silicones and I would like to

28
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:15,250
leave you with a strong conviction that

29
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:17,500
other absolutement in plants have a

30
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,689
quotient physiological array of

31
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,640
functions in the worst resort achill

32
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:24,370
processes and especially in defense

33
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,750
against pathogens and insects and even

34
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,329
interaction with beneficial

35
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:31,150
microorganisms organisms called

36
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:32,799
colonizing roots so i would like to show

37
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,740
this picture simply because i'm really

38
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,049
proud that texas A&amp;M decided to build a

39
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:39,879
new building for plant pathology and

40
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:42,390
microbiology department is going to be

41
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:42,390
right here

42
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:49,000
so this is my lab my lab is

43
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,670
quite large simply because we do a lot

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,040
of freedom in the field and i will

45
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:56,129
explain you how backwards and so these

46
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,900
are all great your students here

47
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:01,369
kiss her there's another graduate

48
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:04,890
students and all of the gradient

49
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:06,900
ok so I collaborated with a lot of

50
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,199
different planetary of people in the

51
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:12,689
world I was funded by the National

52
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:16,500
Science Foundation for ten years in a

53
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:18,389
row and that funding came to collaborate

54
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,270
with Nancy color if you were sick

55
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:25,769
wisconsin madison to study attention a

56
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:28,800
fox lakers a in maize and of sleep is

57
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:31,280
produced by the fungal pathogen produce

58
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,590
legs i

59
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,810
collaborated a lotta skibo Forstner in

60
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,900
at university of göttingen beds until i

61
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:43,439
went there in 2010 sabbatical leave and

62
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,420
i now am capable of running all the

63
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,909
biochemical analysis that you taught me

64
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:50,309
how to do while in his lab and now i'm

65
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:52,979
your dreams that in my life and in fact

66
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,900
we do not I'd not vibrating longer and

67
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:56,609
input I collaborate is these people but

68
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,189
they do not need the services any longer

69
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,739
to run fight hormone analysis for

70
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:03,979
volatile organic compounds analysis or

71
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:07,230
out of all the tools

72
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:10,109
used by the plans I started

73
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:12,569
collaboration this group here mr. Becker

74
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,519
Nelson and Jenna Coleman and they are

75
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:17,009
testing our buildings for assistance to

76
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,079
local Connelly flight which is a big

77
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:21,419
problem here in the north of the United

78
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:23,340
States but other problem in taxes at all

79
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:24,929
that's has its own problem in deserts

80
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,090
for Joe's famous in my thoughts and

81
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,090
contamination

82
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:31,590
by by the front way that hummus I

83
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,420
collaborated you struck candidly if you

84
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,879
work some trichoderma Venus as you may

85
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:37,738
know and the role of technical

86
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:41,519
appearance trigger no more games is it

87
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:44,628
at the root colonizing n to fight that

88
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,969
induces induce systemic in the above

89
00:03:44,628 --> 00:03:49,578
ground organs and we just got funded by

90
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:53,568
USDA to study signaling events between

91
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:56,239
the two organisms and clever it is a

92
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:59,089
story and to myself it was primarily for

93
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,549
fuel based testing for mycotoxin

94
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,530
contamination and more recently I

95
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:06,560
collaborate with rezian st. Pearson and

96
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:09,079
Beth's to study effect of pseudomonas

97
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,560
fluorescens which also gives an end to

98
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:14,840
fight of beet and corn that can do

99
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,660
systemic resistance and promotes growth

100
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,959
and fortunately we're not had time to

101
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:23,300
talk about this research

102
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,788
so I will give it a brief for you of

103
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,100
what we want to do in my lab and what

104
00:04:25,788 --> 00:04:29,389
the idea is behind all of these

105
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,550
different projects that we have in the

106
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:34,430
lab

107
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:37,520
we primarily work is to gene families

108
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:40,038
sleep oxygenases and pokes a vital 1808

109
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,750
interfaces and these genes are required

110
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:43,849
for são paulo just one occasion

111
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,370
biosynthesis but production of other

112
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,020
oxer limits

113
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:50,259
then I will talk you put focus primarily

114
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:53,538
on what we have found so far

115
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:56,569
in terms of the role that absolute mins

116
00:04:53,538 --> 00:04:58,788
play in maize interactions views design

117
00:04:56,569 --> 00:05:01,009
which severely reduces reminiscent and a

118
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:01,959
specialist claims that produces a fat

119
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:05,649
ass

120
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:08,569
and then it will finish up Wiz

121
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:11,719
showing you the data the suggestion to

122
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:14,779
the boxes units and oxalate things that

123
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,990
are expressing eludes have a strong

124
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:20,409
where are the positive or negative role

125
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:23,418
in the interaction you started erm

126
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,830
appearance and conferring in you

127
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:29,269
systemic resistance in above-ground

128
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:31,478
audience that's also a new project so

129
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:34,728
what are also lateness of

130
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:38,180
solutions simply stand for oxygenated

131
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:40,550
lipids that are implants derived from to

132
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:44,389
polyunsaturated fatty acids we delay it

133
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:46,129
contains two double bonds 82 with elana

134
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:49,699
case contains three double bonds to the

135
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:52,939
tribute speech in safe the resulting

136
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:56,329
products of this primary oxygenation of

137
00:05:52,939 --> 00:06:00,740
variances is production of a vast array

138
00:05:56,329 --> 00:06:02,889
of oxidants not sure this scheme or

139
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,389
biosynthesis of his machinations and

140
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:08,209
they are suspected in addition to just

141
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:10,519
Monica severe suspected was as potent

142
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:14,629
signaling tivities strong antimicrobial

143
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:17,269
and insecticidal activities however we

144
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:19,850
know very little to put small kids are

145
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:22,189
doing in the plants we know what they do

146
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,620
in animal systems let me show you will

147
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:27,800
they do in any system

148
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:30,949
this is an inspiration for my lab so I

149
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,259
show only here there is several reviews

150
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:36,500
you will never find a review that will

151
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:38,269
show you what oxa lipids to in mammalian

152
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,279
system simply because they don't even

153
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:43,939
call them usually obsolete as they call

154
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:46,009
them by the class of hormones and so one

155
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:49,370
of these classes of moments is called

156
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:52,639
prostaglandins there are six other large

157
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:54,800
groups of hormones play the toxins from

158
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,719
books and so on that are produced by the

159
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,810
melon systems I will only show you an

160
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,110
example for prospect rankings because

161
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:05,030
this molecules are diverse again in use

162
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:08,810
a reduced from arachidonic acid which

163
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:13,129
has 20 carbon chain fatty acids that has

164
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:15,589
four double bonds they produced a subset

165
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:18,379
of prostaglandins all of these letters

166
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:20,839
and numbers indicate a different

167
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:22,639
molecular species of this prostaglandins

168
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:25,219
and each of this prospect landings is

169
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,620
produced specifically in specific cells

170
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,390
and

171
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,250
transported to a specific servants

172
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:35,349
quarters and perceived in other

173
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:37,939
different cells by a number of different

174
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,620
g-protein coupled receptors so if you

175
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:42,360
think about this morning case just one

176
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:45,439
in case it as a single to center in land

177
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,009
both Corey one dose and duration so

178
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,930
prostaglandins different molecular

179
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:51,030
species of prostaglandins and melon

180
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:53,550
systems have different g-protein coupled

181
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:55,378
receptors and different functions that

182
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,030
they convey and if you look at the list

183
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:59,789
of all the different physiological

184
00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:02,188
processes across the grandest regulate

185
00:07:59,788 --> 00:08:03,509
it's amazing they seem to regulate every

186
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:04,909
resource for processing the new

187
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:08,400
mammalian systems

188
00:08:04,908 --> 00:08:11,038
it aspirin is known to all of you

189
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:16,500
because it's the mode of action of

190
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:19,348
aspirin or us is to prevent biosynthesis

191
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,709
of this oxalates by binding to cycle

192
00:08:19,348 --> 00:08:25,079
oxygenases and inhibiting activity of

193
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:27,299
lipoxygenase and the result of that is

194
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:29,339
down regulation of some of this

195
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,348
absolutely so and i will show you some

196
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:33,689
of the data showing that when you know

197
00:08:31,348 --> 00:08:36,598
how assembly oxygenated genes in maize

198
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,700
and all of a sudden instead of increased

199
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,729
susceptibility to pathogens they

200
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,550
displays don't increased resistance so

201
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:47,930
you should think of them as or that

202
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:51,359
effect as effective of salicylic acid or

203
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:53,609
aspirin winding to inhibit a dispenser

204
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,990
so sometimes overproduction of this

205
00:08:53,610 --> 00:09:00,500
molecules lead to array of physiological

206
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:03,448
disorders

207
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:06,179
so this pathway is so well understood in

208
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:08,458
mammalian systems sixty percent of the

209
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:11,309
drugs currently available on the United

210
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:13,739
States market target asbestos of course

211
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:16,469
not only sentences but also transport

212
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,690
but also to specific perception in fact

213
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,670
my proposal is calculated because

214
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:23,579
existing data from this science paper

215
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:26,278
into sultan monte calculated what is

216
00:09:23,578 --> 00:09:28,769
current number of drugs in regulating

217
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:31,470
specimen and here is estimated 85 of

218
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:34,440
fda-approved drugs target dispensaries

219
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:37,050
in mammalian system so that's how much

220
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,449
you know more than mammals so what do we

221
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:41,979
know about plants Lance produced a bunch

222
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:45,099
of this of Sullivan's and they reduce

223
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:47,259
remember by the oxygen is passing so

224
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,440
what I've oxygenators do is oxidized

225
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:53,289
fatty acid to different positions 9 or

226
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,150
szczecin and it's very important that

227
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:58,839
you discern these two types of the gods

228
00:09:55,149 --> 00:10:01,360
it is because only 13 lipoxygenase is

229
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:04,060
capable of producing eventually just one

230
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,450
just one in case it lineups lipids can

231
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:08,979
not take part in ox alypium in interest

232
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:12,360
more negated by sentences they produce

233
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:15,190
what we call line of some intensity so

234
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,570
that reaction seems to be simple only

235
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:18,970
for different products that producer

236
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:21,730
your brother Bob seaman's yet the

237
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:24,100
problem is the box is the best day and

238
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:26,710
the complexity comes when you take into

239
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:29,320
account that this primary results by the

240
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:32,230
probe straight asses are converted by

241
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,290
seven different sub branches of the vote

242
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:38,409
Spencer to produce

243
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:42,250
tons of different of celebrites right

244
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:44,110
and some of the superiors right I talk

245
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,000
to you a poisoner who knows best of

246
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,789
slipping field in the plants I ask you

247
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,440
one passion so you know how many ox11

248
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:52,240
spread plants produce collectively

249
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,490
because we measured then in many

250
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,799
different species he is to make it six

251
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:59,529
hundred and now people this is probably

252
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:02,139
more 27 hundreds of solutions and every

253
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:05,679
year there is about four to six reports

254
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:10,149
of a new clip is being investigated in

255
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:11,859
plants so the best understood absolutely

256
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:13,720
implants of course is just more negates

257
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,930
it is produced by that Allen oxide

258
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,279
synthases branch of the pathway and

259
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:20,079
involves also fight to the innovator in

260
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:22,059
the cases only few of them not all of

261
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,879
them to make just more negation and

262
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:26,679
eventual just one against our sewers now

263
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,320
you can measure most districts olivion's

264
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:31,269
in my lab imagine about 75 different or

265
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,110
two living species and then it's because

266
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:34,240
we

267
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,190
we purchase this liquid

268
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,079
chromatography-mass spectrometry

269
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:40,420
instrument we are not capable of

270
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:43,989
measuring unfortunately all 700 of them

271
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:48,490
I wish we could but we want to measure

272
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:50,589
what we can get standards water so my

273
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:53,289
long term goal of my lab is to design a

274
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:55,839
function so wats lipids in maize and

275
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:59,110
whatever those functions are we are

276
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,630
after what they specifically limits are

277
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:04,990
doing for plant responses to stress

278
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:07,120
including a buyer expects so and the way

279
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:10,028
we do it is to generate hospital

280
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,560
insertional mutants in the oil contains

281
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:15,370
of those living voice synthesis pathway

282
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:18,369
if those jeans are known and so it means

283
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:21,100
there are certain lipoxygenase genes are

284
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:23,078
quite illegal sites in tight jeans there

285
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,000
are eight occupied today United

286
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:27,399
reductases and there are two

287
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,409
hydroperoxide lasers of course in RB

288
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:32,679
Dodson these numbers are about half of

289
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:35,019
that for each of these defendants and so

290
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:37,989
the way we generate these mutants is by

291
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:40,360
taking advantage of that so-called tried

292
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,769
to shield the system for corn available

293
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:46,209
at pioneer because that's where it

294
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:48,339
worked as opposed up and so pioneer has

295
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:51,189
paid long time ago couple dozen years

296
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:53,350
ago did this huge population about

297
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,060
48,000 pleasant each one in fish

298
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,699
yourself that was produced by the

299
00:12:55,059 --> 00:13:00,278
crossing and new at Japan increase

300
00:12:57,698 --> 00:13:03,399
diversity in brake lines so that

301
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:05,189
resulted in this collage mutagenized

302
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:08,629
population basically

303
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:11,030
and what they do it pioneer is you

304
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:14,049
specific primers and potato specific

305
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:17,000
primers cleaning pools of this

306
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:19,490
plant I don't actually know how many

307
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,120
plants are in that pool and they

308
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:25,250
identify plants or pools and individual

309
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,720
plants and individual families that

310
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:32,090
containing insertion of the gene in your

311
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,700
insertion your chain of interest so it

312
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:38,149
takes about two to three weeks Bob feel

313
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:41,600
is very good at that and it takes my lab

314
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:44,449
both sample back crosses and about ten

315
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,340
years and to the three generations for

316
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:49,100
graduate students to produce near such

317
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:51,470
an opponent's it back for seven states

318
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:55,850
that are now Apple to Apple comparison

319
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:57,529
and honestly because of how long does it

320
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:00,379
take to generate is Newton's he only

321
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:02,629
published maybe five percent of the

322
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:04,159
Newton's that we have generated so it's

323
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:06,110
a great time to be in my life because

324
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,779
mutants are generated you just come in

325
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:10,180
the lab for graduation and do the

326
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:13,639
research

327
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:15,620
ok so my genome contains sixteen

328
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:17,929
lipoxygenase 'as they can be grouped

329
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:21,379
grouped roughly into large to large

330
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:24,169
subgroups this our city lipoxygenase and

331
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:26,419
those jeans are required for just more

332
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:28,579
negated by a synthesis or relatable

333
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:31,009
purpose in this is my personal belief

334
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:33,889
that all these regions are producing

335
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:36,799
gops but in different organs I will book

336
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:38,990
today only both walks 10 and book seven

337
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,769
eight and nine are likely to be involved

338
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:45,200
in Jade biosynthesis

339
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:46,809
besides two teen boxes they mention our

340
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,700
encodes a

341
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:52,159
69 lip oxygen is one of each is very

342
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,320
unique to mana codes call it looks well

343
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,740
and i will show you data for this gene

344
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,910
this gene somehow Oh regulates

345
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:02,090
biosynthesis of just motivated by this

346
00:14:58,909 --> 00:15:04,449
type of such this is a huge potential

347
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:08,259
for crossroad between the nine boxes

348
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:10,900
versus it evolves so this is unusual

349
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:12,539
lipoxygenase it doesn't even use fatty

350
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:15,850
as it is a substrate it uses

351
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:17,799
hydroperoxide of areas which is produced

352
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:20,310
by another lipoxygenase and what it does

353
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:24,399
it please or fatty acid into unusual

354
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:26,769
effect CA chien and c5 and could see

355
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,399
five main if you've not heard of Antonov

356
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:32,649
so this lot size of one is likely to be

357
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,909
involved specifically in biosynthesis of

358
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:38,860
this volatile fentanyl so today I will

359
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:41,259
so we generated mittens for all that

360
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,180
matter what fun or whatever reason we

361
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:45,519
tried many times to identify putative

362
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:47,319
insertion in different places in Cold

363
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,799
Spring Harbor in pioneer the premiere

364
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:53,070
came and we all this fail to identify

365
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:56,109
insertion of a mutator in lots of energy

366
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:59,580
so it's only one that for us to go

367
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:02,740
octave and I will talk today about the

368
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:06,339
phenotypes and a bunch of the function

369
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:09,339
of the end block three looks fine and

370
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:11,200
look stand and look strap alright if you

371
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:12,670
want to know about any other the

372
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,390
partition is that I can talk to you

373
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:18,669
personally some of them like looks too

374
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:22,569
and Vaughn are involved in salt stress

375
00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:25,120
tolerance and drama tolerance looks for

376
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:27,460
appear to be required for defense

377
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,049
against anthropos sleep like a stalker

378
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:31,450
but they will not mention well that

379
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:34,019
looks why Sheree ninety percent identity

380
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:37,150
to look for as complete opposite

381
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:39,939
functions resistance against me sex and

382
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:42,088
in fact when you look out that gene this

383
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:44,820
plant are more resistant or the children

384
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:48,010
and

385
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:52,600
oak stan is involved in in difficult or

386
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:54,309
biosynthesis okay so somehow insertion

387
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,240
of potato elements results in unstable

388
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:59,559
are they that gets decree so we rarely

389
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,440
see any

390
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:05,529
the trans confusing northern part or RNA

391
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,250
signal if insertions happen to be in its

392
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:11,379
own the genes

393
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,759
so let me tell you what we have found so

394
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,430
far for the function of the car

395
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:18,160
situation to be an amazing tractions

396
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:21,240
alien pretty ladies and aspergillus

397
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,759
lives so Astrid Osiris produces

398
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:28,390
important carcinogen in fact aflatoxin

399
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:33,069
is number one the most potent carcinogen

400
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:36,850
produced by naturally by microbes okay

401
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:40,659
its most potent carcinogen so it's it

402
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:42,579
causes cancer development in liver it's

403
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,790
a mutagen and it also pinnacles

404
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:47,819
immunosuppression in handles so if you

405
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:50,470
said in British Lloyd's produces another

406
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:52,319
mic the box can hold few Morrison and

407
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,900
she wants

408
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:57,490
induces or consult as

409
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,980
inhibits a single lipid by synthesis in

410
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:02,109
fact that's how program cell death is

411
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,660
used by three models invite their

412
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:06,459
binding to

413
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,470
ceramide synthase and preventing suva

414
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:11,940
lipid synthesis in accumulation of the

415
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:16,029
cursor sort of single limits and

416
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:19,360
so the idea about lipoxygenase is having

417
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:22,210
a something to do with the regulation of

418
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:24,549
mica toxin production came from nancy

419
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:28,029
kelly research where she showed when she

420
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:31,240
disrupts and of slipping by synthesis

421
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:33,599
genes in juice they called sifang

422
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:38,039
co-producing oxygenated

423
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:40,689
this arc length by nancy SP BOS

424
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:43,420
lipoxygenase are also producing there is

425
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:45,759
one leap oxygenases various flavors

426
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:48,039
produces an other subset of excellence

427
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:51,910
and this side factors when you know them

428
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:54,430
out they were shown to either inhibit or

429
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:55,650
promotes for Genesis depending on what

430
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:59,560
sports are

431
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:01,330
regulated sexual or asexual and they are

432
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:04,089
put and regulates like regulators

433
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:06,460
mycotoxin biosynthesis so when you shut

434
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:08,789
down basins the sign factors might be

435
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:12,220
after study what assistant in

436
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:16,359
aspergillus nidulans for aflatoxin is

437
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:18,069
inhibited and if you and they were also

438
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:20,889
shown to be involved in quorum sensing

439
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:24,159
danger so if you look at the chemical

440
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:26,259
structure of plenty right and humble

441
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,700
direct observations you can clearly see

442
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:32,799
the resemblance okay and that's

443
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:35,680
suggested that is potentially a lipid

444
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,960
mediated coastal so the absolute is

445
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:41,610
produced by the fungal species can be

446
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:44,380
perceived by the plant to modulate a

447
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:48,099
limited metabolism in the plant and

448
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:51,910
plant direct box elements may affect the

449
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:54,129
physical processes of the pharmacy we

450
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:56,410
have published in Newport rating 2011

451
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:59,680
schedule is very complex to show their

452
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:03,340
schemes from baby booties really hairy

453
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:05,830
on detail so let me tell you what we

454
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:08,319
found so far towards testing that

455
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:11,230
hypothesis that absolutely is produced

456
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:14,079
by the planet may in fact have two

457
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:16,599
different effects of mitosis or if I

458
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,699
think induced micro toxin synthesis by

459
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:21,519
the fungus or suppress my clubs and

460
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:24,160
synthesis so in this particular case

461
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:26,470
when you know how it looks three what we

462
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,680
had we have seen right away when his

463
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:31,990
team seed in production growth

464
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,120
see if we found that ninth agency is

465
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:38,380
produced from Lee Nolin decades linoleic

466
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:40,989
acid and 90 youjizz were reduced and 98

467
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:43,690
UT it's an obsidian derivative from

468
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,509
linoleic acid is completely gone in this

469
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:49,480
luxury for

470
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:52,059
mutant alright so they are good line of

471
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,789
silicon deficient so what three is not

472
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:58,450
involved in just more negation directly

473
00:20:54,789 --> 00:21:00,819
cannot be it's my lip oxygenates so when

474
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:04,960
we tested how the fungi grow on the seat

475
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:07,960
is very Buddhist we found no difference

476
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,910
whatsoever so fans I don't care in terms

477
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,240
of vegetation pros they don't care about

478
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:14,040
the presence of locks sweet gene in the

479
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,710
course

480
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:21,789
but big surprise came when we measured

481
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:22,829
humans in b1 see all of a sudden the

482
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:25,720
mutant

483
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:29,129
when fungus is wrong or Lotus erosion

484
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:32,170
they produce about 200 a full last

485
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:35,380
mycotoxin what they suggest that looks

486
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:38,230
Li is required for induction of my detox

487
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:41,470
and biosynthesis you do not ignore it

488
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:44,110
even now how it works but that is a fact

489
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:47,160
that's what the luxury function is also

490
00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:50,609
without log 3 in the course the

491
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:54,060
facilities we use a lot less spores

492
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:56,229
so for that reason we placed on three at

493
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:58,319
specifically regulating secondary

494
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,789
metabolism and microphones and synthesis

495
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:04,000
and positively regulating where the

496
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:05,980
fungus ends for genesis so and it

497
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,829
appears to have no role in vegetative

498
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:12,279
roads with it fungus only in the

499
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:15,609
Colonel's so when we tested what it is

500
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:19,240
in laxmi mutants that may be responsible

501
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:22,209
for such effect in P monster so we can

502
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:26,730
ran microarray analysis long time ago is

503
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:29,259
then ground of study and bigger see that

504
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:33,450
many other day partition is such as

505
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:35,339
about six books 9 10 11 and appear 78

506
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:38,940
you are in go to jail by scientists are

507
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:43,168
all over expressed in this Locksley see

508
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:45,028
colonized by she say so you have tested

509
00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:47,038
independently some of the scenes for

510
00:22:45,028 --> 00:22:48,538
user-generated Newtons and we should be

511
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:51,179
what I saw that book sleep also

512
00:22:48,538 --> 00:22:54,419
overexpressed looks 10 and looks wife

513
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:56,278
then suggests it looks three SunPower

514
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:59,159
nine Olympic sprinters by Lopes three

515
00:22:56,278 --> 00:23:01,288
suppress expression both these are the

516
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:04,679
lipoxygenase and I will tell you about

517
00:23:01,288 --> 00:23:06,869
the phenotypes of dis mutants in this

518
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:09,720
post of fusarium and aspergillus legs

519
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:12,239
and later on we'll come back to the same

520
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,940
gene to show you how overexpression of

521
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,359
these two genes in the rules impact

522
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:20,399
interaction respect to her mentor

523
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:23,449
ok so when we testicles five minutes

524
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:26,969
remember looks remittance a colonized

525
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:29,880
equally well reported on drone and

526
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:32,308
either wild-type or the mutant if you do

527
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,350
subscribe it's clear that was five

528
00:23:32,308 --> 00:23:36,950
million see it's much more susceptible

529
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:39,240
to physically see Louise and

530
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:41,399
probably corresponding to the increased

531
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,409
by a massive loads by mutants we see

532
00:23:41,398 --> 00:23:45,569
also increased number of cornelia

533
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:48,269
produced but what was shocking to

534
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:51,599
discover that it had not no effect

535
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:57,120
whatsoever on few Manas embody synthesis

536
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:58,949
so that place looks wide as regulated by

537
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,408
regulating vegetative growth and

538
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:04,080
probably due to confuse educated rules

539
00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:06,510
increase Canady Asians so looks like as

540
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:08,759
specific effect productive talks like a

541
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:10,490
specific effect on the vegetative growth

542
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:14,849
of the promise

543
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:16,888
logs Daniel came contrast to the log

544
00:24:14,849 --> 00:24:19,949
three movements books 10 meters are

545
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:22,319
heavily colonized by the fungus and in

546
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:24,960
this case it's humanism that was

547
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:28,528
increased the public responds well to

548
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,930
his own growth and comedian Rosen is but

549
00:24:28,528 --> 00:24:33,029
not the strongest

550
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:35,490
suggestions look Stan has more specific

551
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:37,349
effect on few months in their synthesis

552
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:39,569
unlike absolute looks like because the

553
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:42,419
phenotypes of Fox 5 meters in 10 in

554
00:24:39,569 --> 00:24:44,819
terms of colonization are set so that

555
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:47,250
places look stand together it looks wide

556
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:50,069
as controlling vegetative growth books

557
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:52,549
10 potential against most stronger

558
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:56,089
effect or inducing

559
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:56,089
mycotoxin synthesis

560
00:24:56,269 --> 00:25:01,379
so this differently passages we have

561
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:03,689
just finished a rating just published a

562
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:07,170
little audible puppeteers will be have

563
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:10,230
found that looks 12 again another night

564
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:12,450
like oxygenase monitored specifically

565
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:17,480
oxygen is no lo dico to contain this

566
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:20,220
gene has a very specific attack on

567
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:24,180
on defense against various Hillary's

568
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:26,130
Wyatt just warning acid regulation so

569
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:30,690
let me show what the console expelled is

570
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:33,060
here so it's not as it involved but not

571
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:36,000
be involved in jail by synthesis so

572
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:38,759
looks well Milton similar between five

573
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,279
and ten is also heavily colon infection

574
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:43,980
saying and in this case if they

575
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,710
introduce a lot more of those spores and

576
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:48,509
few models in view on probably what the

577
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:51,319
function of books 12 the right

578
00:25:48,509 --> 00:25:55,279
absolutement is to regulate and

579
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:56,809
vegetative growth so how does looks 12

580
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,879
okay

581
00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:02,039
early papers we were not able to met up

582
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,770
with his house sells you know that so we

583
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:07,039
had to send his hands to Germans but now

584
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:09,869
we can do that analysis so we did a lot

585
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:13,859
greater analysis of syllables produced

586
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:15,839
right by this mutant and so in addition

587
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:19,649
to see it looks when minutes are a lot

588
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:23,039
more susceptible in Mexico toes to

589
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:24,840
fusarium organization and so when we

590
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,240
measured up syllables we found that

591
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:30,819
several of the line of slippers purchase

592
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:33,069
even some szczecin are absolutely 15 she

593
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:36,308
not statistically significant though but

594
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:39,240
mine kg is specifically reduced in the

595
00:26:36,308 --> 00:26:43,509
box 12 moon just that this morning maybe

596
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:45,630
the one involved in resistance in

597
00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:49,990
providing assistance against the

598
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:51,970
Tsarevich eluates so when we tested this

599
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:54,940
morning education loosened levels would

600
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:56,039
be the found that in the world that it

601
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,330
can

602
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:00,808
see if you're not inoculated by fusarium

603
00:26:58,329 --> 00:27:03,668
just mana casing is increased

604
00:27:00,808 --> 00:27:06,869
dramatically however not in box 12

605
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:10,299
mutants so somehow it is nine blocks and

606
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:12,298
potentially 9kg regulates just more

607
00:27:10,298 --> 00:27:15,009
negated biosynthesis

608
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:16,750
so the question was there so it's really

609
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:19,210
debated just like that suggesting

610
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:21,308
control and then three we're say well

611
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:23,650
since you have republished just j

612
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:25,928
division Newton see hope your seven

613
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:28,509
eight double mutants why not test the

614
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:30,429
role of just folic acid in resistance to

615
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:33,460
freeze any resource which was a very

616
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:35,470
valid question except that looks 12

617
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:38,590
mutants are so susceptible to various

618
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:41,740
facilities that every time we planted in

619
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:44,558
the field it doesn't germinate well

620
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:46,990
because it's homes to representing and

621
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:49,269
potentially other soil borne pathogens

622
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:52,179
it's extremely susceptible it took us

623
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:53,769
one year to quite as this mutant to grow

624
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:58,330
it in such a way that it doesn't have

625
00:27:53,769 --> 00:28:00,490
any fusarium recolonize plants so but

626
00:27:58,329 --> 00:28:03,909
you are able to do it when we tested a

627
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:06,190
diffusion mutants as well by the way

628
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:08,080
they're also i will show you this data

629
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:10,090
they are not able to survive on this

630
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:14,048
view conditions due to extreme

631
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:16,558
susceptibility to beijing so what we

632
00:28:14,048 --> 00:28:19,629
test it is this of your 78

633
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:22,539
w infants you have to knock out both of

634
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:25,179
these genes in order to get rid of your

635
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:28,119
activity that is required from from for

636
00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:30,870
converting sis vga the natural substrate

637
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:34,469
for j bias it's into just morning is

638
00:28:30,869 --> 00:28:36,639
this father of yours and six of them

639
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:39,039
don't know what they're doing we do not

640
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,470
know what they produce because they use

641
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:43,779
Cesar PDA as a substrate and convert it

642
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:46,450
into some profit yet unidentified

643
00:28:43,779 --> 00:28:49,240
unknown absolutely potential it's with

644
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:51,220
instances in all five even talk

645
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:55,809
simplification of the beauty unsaturated

646
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:58,509
carbonyl so when we tested those mutants

647
00:28:55,809 --> 00:29:01,109
for resistance against you saying it was

648
00:28:58,509 --> 00:29:05,259
really shocking so we infected the plans

649
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:06,969
before we left work it poach six or

650
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:08,789
seven you come in the morning at eight

651
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:11,289
o'clock and they already

652
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:13,659
macerated two days later they just

653
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:17,409
completely collapse so that suggests

654
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:19,900
that just mana case is clearly required

655
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:22,590
for defense against desire it's Louise

656
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:27,220
no doubt about that

657
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:28,990
so guess that potentially people who

658
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,990
work with deserving salut ages and as

659
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:34,660
the jewel slave still are you we don't

660
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:37,269
be are not confident what these the

661
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:38,830
lifestyles of these two passages are so

662
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:41,619
we still argue whether they are neck

663
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:43,480
across any white rose or not documented

664
00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:46,359
by toast but we do not know if they hang

665
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,549
but crossover or negative so it's a

666
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:50,109
chest because the requirement of G of

667
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:52,720
defense against this pathogen that

668
00:29:50,109 --> 00:29:55,029
fazaia which solaris is likely to be

669
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,180
either an actor probe or please the

670
00:29:55,029 --> 00:30:00,160
chemical and roll

671
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:02,470
okay Oh beyond seven eight new double

672
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,779
mutants you took my book to generate his

673
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:06,569
double mutants about two years because

674
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:09,399
he would plant a large field of

675
00:30:06,569 --> 00:30:11,769
segregating one in 16 population and

676
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:14,200
none of the plans that he didn't play

677
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:17,289
for double minutes instead of I mean

678
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:19,720
talking to me he says we failed so next

679
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:22,690
year he plans instead of 200 individuals

680
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,610
he plans five solve an event his cleans

681
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:27,200
them all and none of them are double

682
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:29,269
defense and then I don't

683
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,250
you cannot fail two years in the room

684
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:33,288
what happened it says well I don't know

685
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:35,119
what happened but there is no no double

686
00:30:33,288 --> 00:30:36,648
mutant said well you were supposed to

687
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,778
think well that might mean of course

688
00:30:36,648 --> 00:30:41,538
what that means that this plant there

689
00:30:38,778 --> 00:30:45,849
are Alyssa so they died for some reason

690
00:30:41,538 --> 00:30:48,679
and sure enough you can only guess oh

691
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:53,678
damn thing off sorry thank you so much

692
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:53,679
and dumpy off seems appropriate to

693
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:59,480
so I guess we did identify that the

694
00:30:56,869 --> 00:31:01,489
culprit in this case was pleased him at

695
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:04,038
least the sperm invest what we saw in

696
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:06,769
Texas fields will the tiny or

697
00:31:04,038 --> 00:31:09,710
commercials also also have pity and so

698
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:12,288
it dries really fast if you terminate

699
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:13,940
the plants in style soil and then

700
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:16,638
transplant them in the field like this

701
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,558
and I don't even know why he didn't work

702
00:31:16,638 --> 00:31:20,750
because i know they died from fishing

703
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:22,609
but he want you to see how fast i said

704
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:25,119
okay various whatever it is he was

705
00:31:22,609 --> 00:31:27,888
excited about it and look how fast they

706
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:29,989
prompted infection takes all about 10

707
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:31,819
days to kill hundred percent of these

708
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:34,370
plants so they explain this acceptable

709
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:36,678
so what was really surprising when you

710
00:31:34,369 --> 00:31:38,898
started testing for existence against us

711
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:41,419
produce things and also thoughts because

712
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:43,689
that's what Texas farmers careful they

713
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:47,419
don't care what you say believes our

714
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:48,788
problem is our thoughts and that's when

715
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:52,399
I lost funding

716
00:31:48,788 --> 00:31:55,250
because Locksley mutant that was

717
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:57,459
characterized by extremely low level of

718
00:31:55,250 --> 00:32:00,349
contamination perfume arneson are

719
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:03,230
extremely susceptible to aspergillus lay

720
00:32:00,349 --> 00:32:06,199
beside the colonel acid is raising the

721
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:10,009
field basalt they produce all this a

722
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:12,700
much greater level of aflatoxin so few

723
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:15,048
months in town of a toxin is not

724
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,720
colonization percolating is down there

725
00:32:15,048 --> 00:32:19,418
is no change

726
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,548
flavors just love this

727
00:32:19,419 --> 00:32:23,120
so the desk there is other boxes that

728
00:32:22,548 --> 00:32:25,279
are

729
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:29,058
test in loxley mutants and Sheree not be

730
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:31,190
so exact opposite so in contrast of

731
00:32:29,058 --> 00:32:34,299
screen opens looks fine movements were

732
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:38,058
contaminated by foot dachshund about

733
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:40,009
fivefold Max and in epigenetic

734
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:41,200
background that we have tests including

735
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:44,299
that

736
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,580
check the breeders used for resistance

737
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:49,430
to also tops so it's really amazing

738
00:32:46,579 --> 00:32:52,009
effect we danced it looks tan and it was

739
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:54,230
the same so the sick since 2007 weekend

740
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:55,940
every year retention we still being

741
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:58,279
published because I don't stand how it

742
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,769
works because I wanted to get the

743
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:02,990
Matthews but we showed that

744
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:05,150
long-standing Europeans are there barely

745
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:07,910
cool about his body produces a whiskey

746
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:10,630
Colonel can see and think whatever's for

747
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:13,519
Jules in fact produces very little

748
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:18,350
aflatoxin so these two genes appear to

749
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:20,679
be helping the pathogen to colonize

750
00:33:18,349 --> 00:33:24,619
helping the pathogen to reduce megabucks

751
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:27,679
so in case of hooks while I still do not

752
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:29,659
cannot pinpoint what exactly it produces

753
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,269
in terms of what of slipping it reduces

754
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:35,600
however I do know for sure that looks

755
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:37,849
tan is the sole lipoxygenase in the

756
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:40,099
National is possible for Greenlee too

757
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:42,789
volatile voice synthesis when you go to

758
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:46,250
leave a while type you see a

759
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:48,589
spike in the emission from this world

760
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:51,529
because it is the external d3x and all

761
00:33:48,589 --> 00:33:54,019
external acetate all of them go up but

762
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:56,089
you cannot identify any traces of this

763
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:57,950
halitosis about 10 Newtons suggestion

764
00:33:56,089 --> 00:34:01,339
box tank is the only gene required for

765
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:03,529
govt I wonder now where the jail if had

766
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:06,939
anything to do is making plans

767
00:34:03,529 --> 00:34:11,360
susceptible to schedule slaves and to

768
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:11,360
contamination is slaves

769
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:16,289
so let me switch gears and tell you what

770
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,730
we have found for some of these mutants

771
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:19,940
in terms of the interaction with

772
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:23,338
beneficial microorganisms

773
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:26,398
yeah so you can publish a paper before

774
00:34:23,338 --> 00:34:28,289
this vintage I was invited to publish a

775
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:31,980
paper or long-distance igloo route to

776
00:34:28,289 --> 00:34:35,190
shoot okay it's some projects it died

777
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,858
long time ago in 2007 and program and I

778
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:40,679
never figured out why Locksley mutants

779
00:34:37,858 --> 00:34:42,809
are more existent in to enter possibly

780
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,820
apply it seldom to live like and they

781
00:34:42,809 --> 00:34:46,739
will show you this data so if you plan

782
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,838
to experience in the field they have

783
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:51,500
always searched on the same team title

784
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:54,539
they're much more resistant to solving

785
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:57,588
leaf blight they are more resistant to

786
00:34:54,539 --> 00:35:00,989
enter closely employed they are more

787
00:34:57,588 --> 00:35:04,949
resistant to enter co-star crowd of Zion

788
00:35:00,989 --> 00:35:08,039
Brazilian stork wrote and what was

789
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:10,858
really surprising that when we tested

790
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:14,009
expression of these genes in response to

791
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:16,619
fungal infection to all the leaves in in

792
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:18,690
this cases the conductive amigos the

793
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:21,900
same is true for bubbles and restaurants

794
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:24,119
this gene is not induced it doesn't want

795
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:26,099
it doesn't matter how long you imagine

796
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:28,800
expression of this gene after infection

797
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:31,440
this gene is not expressed in the play

798
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,690
in the place where it has effect right

799
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,750
the leaves are resistant to this pasture

800
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:39,150
so you would suspect that at least it

801
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:41,550
has to be expressed some house lit

802
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:44,039
during infection it's not it's not a

803
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:46,050
gene that is expressed in leaves period

804
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:48,318
where it's expected it's expressed in

805
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:51,660
news that

806
00:35:48,318 --> 00:35:53,818
pointed to as potential significance of

807
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:56,009
food expression of these genes or on

808
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:59,840
what is happening in the above ground

809
00:35:56,010 --> 00:36:02,800
pools in terms of resistance

810
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:05,390
increase resistance so

811
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,730
the hypothesis then walls o'clock three

812
00:36:05,389 --> 00:36:10,190
militants produce some signal in the

813
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:12,619
rules that are consorted from the roots

814
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:15,769
into the lesions in stocks and induced

815
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:17,389
increased resistance so how to test of

816
00:36:15,769 --> 00:36:19,039
course if you've worked with dye pots

817
00:36:17,389 --> 00:36:21,259
you know what to do in this case okay

818
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:23,980
three minutes ago well that you would

819
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:26,660
you will do the crafting experiment

820
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:29,809
unfortunately for those of you who work

821
00:36:26,659 --> 00:36:33,170
with monocots it's not possible and it's

822
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:37,150
a huge problem so then we had to come up

823
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:40,389
with a new massive how to do it is

824
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:42,829
theft bike experiment so

825
00:36:40,389 --> 00:36:44,839
one time I both work was cutting this

826
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:46,489
plant because he was done his end when

827
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,240
you look at them or my brother you're so

828
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:51,979
much silence sad that you can collect

829
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:54,619
milliliters of it within a single day

830
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:56,750
and it's oh wow this that would be a

831
00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:59,239
very firm you to know if reason is taken

832
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:02,719
as different present being silent here

833
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:05,239
so but how to apply when you make a tiny

834
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:09,189
incisions once inches away from each

835
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:12,500
other all these siblings and apply twice

836
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:15,530
diluted silence and only 10 micro litre

837
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,570
six hours before infection and then in

838
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:20,090
fact

839
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:23,750
mystical Grameen ego and what we saw is

840
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:26,750
was really interesting so when you

841
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:28,670
collect silencer from wild-type and

842
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:30,920
apply to implants they are normally

843
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:33,050
infected for equally protocol normal

844
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:36,409
vision however when you take the same

845
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:37,970
plan the same genotype and a half their

846
00:37:36,409 --> 00:37:41,179
vocational valence and collected from

847
00:37:37,969 --> 00:37:43,219
box three militants this plans for much

848
00:37:41,179 --> 00:37:45,799
more resistant to pull the documentation

849
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:48,558
supporting the eight-year the runes of

850
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,960
luxury produced the Sun signal and you

851
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:54,109
can collect it and we can bash it and

852
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:57,470
apply to that while the plants and you

853
00:37:54,108 --> 00:37:59,739
see this event so then also suggested

854
00:37:57,469 --> 00:38:02,029
that potentially

855
00:37:59,739 --> 00:38:05,029
this gene is regulated particular

856
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:07,490
appearance prognosis wounds so remember

857
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:09,440
when you get rid of locks three the

858
00:38:07,489 --> 00:38:11,598
plants are more resistant in background

859
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,000
orders but box key is not expressly so

860
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,818
it's expressed in root log 3 is a

861
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,579
negative regulator then a very sorry and

862
00:38:16,818 --> 00:38:21,858
if so then trichoderma may or may not

863
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:24,519
not have effect on this gene or the

864
00:38:21,858 --> 00:38:27,049
mutant so if you treat it trichoderma a

865
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:29,150
restricted number means roots of wild at

866
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:31,339
all those three miracles and of course

867
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:33,619
in world up what you see rapid or making

868
00:38:31,338 --> 00:38:37,750
uses technical assistance so the lesions

869
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:40,579
are much smaller however in the normal

870
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:42,588
actually compared a violent violet here

871
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:44,210
to convert my juices in business

872
00:38:42,588 --> 00:38:45,949
business invokes limit they ready

873
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:47,389
resistant doesn't matter how much like

874
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:50,989
the derma they have on the roots they

875
00:38:47,389 --> 00:38:53,358
already resistant to take a turn so then

876
00:38:50,989 --> 00:38:55,608
because of this was in order protected

877
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:59,719
or much to have and I oh sorry amusing

878
00:38:55,608 --> 00:39:03,199
activity it must suppress locks free

879
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:05,750
expression endurance and hope valley

880
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:08,210
it's easy to propose this hey boss I

881
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:09,889
remember like now and they weren't doing

882
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:11,869
my students were doing this experiment I

883
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:13,848
thought oh my god what if it's not going

884
00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:16,880
to work I will never be able to submit

885
00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:22,280
this paper and I was shocked how

886
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:25,369
beautiful it work so then and what we

887
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,890
did it we used a delta s amount of

888
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:30,380
liquid or without this small peptide

889
00:39:27,889 --> 00:39:33,949
it's a sweet pad line when you know

890
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:37,130
about that gene for sm one these plants

891
00:39:33,949 --> 00:39:38,838
are not able to induce secure smokeout

892
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:41,930
movements they were not able to reduce

893
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:44,869
systemic resistance in the leaves when

894
00:39:41,929 --> 00:39:48,618
you overexpress there is worse more so

895
00:39:44,869 --> 00:39:51,180
this SF on seed protein is required for

896
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:53,280
induced systemic resistance easily so we

897
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:54,440
use this mutant and prepare it to the

898
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,210
effect of

899
00:39:54,440 --> 00:40:00,179
expectation vs. wild type on expression

900
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:02,929
for three nodes and what we saw that

901
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:05,569
while that indeed like I

902
00:40:02,929 --> 00:40:08,940
really hoped it would happen

903
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:11,359
and what the hypothermic effects roots

904
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:14,309
books read expression is repressed

905
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:17,909
however looks we cannot be repressed

906
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:21,420
when you use this is artificial movers

907
00:40:17,909 --> 00:40:25,199
so that places look sweet as one of the

908
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:27,960
targets for sm 11 function of sm one

909
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:29,969
fumble energy and from the protein is

910
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,250
the suppress expression for floats the

911
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:34,139
stream

912
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:36,329
then the question was what it is it

913
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:38,608
looks with makes it so crazy that you

914
00:40:36,329 --> 00:40:41,400
could use this is our signal all the

915
00:40:38,608 --> 00:40:43,559
time so we can test expression of all

916
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,630
all the lipoxygenase from each week a

917
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:48,210
mutant or some other genes and what we

918
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:50,130
saw is incredible so if you look at nine

919
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:52,949
lipoxygenase pressure in the roots

920
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:54,349
compared to welcome there is 420 full

921
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:57,210
induction

922
00:40:54,349 --> 00:40:58,580
overexpression of logs for in the log

923
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:01,588
three minutes

924
00:40:58,579 --> 00:41:04,348
as it looks fibers of Express looks

925
00:41:01,588 --> 00:41:09,630
available to express and bunch of other

926
00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:14,609
look at this HTC sir james or or hope

927
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:16,289
you are they for example 22 424 424 Alan

928
00:41:14,608 --> 00:41:18,630
oxide cyclist who r e8 for

929
00:41:16,289 --> 00:41:21,179
overexpression interviews so the roots

930
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:23,300
of look-see overexpressed whole bunch of

931
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:26,419
this pod of silicon biosynthesis and

932
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:29,460
ethical investment decisions he

933
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:33,150
suggested just one occasion nine ox

934
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:35,099
lipids and actually maybe the reason why

935
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:37,829
this mutants are more resistant to fully

936
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:40,150
investigate and that signal is produced

937
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:43,840
in books units Constitution rather it

938
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:46,510
then in inducible man so we tested it

939
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:48,579
doesn't look Stan just because we knew

940
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:50,680
exactly what is with it is doing in

941
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:53,440
terms of their chemistry is required for

942
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:55,389
gob by sentences but also because we

943
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,760
found something really unique about dog

944
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:58,349
stand

945
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:02,380
behind

946
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:05,980
a project to localize sub seldom

947
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:08,470
variables NP is in Compton cell so we

948
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:11,139
used on Jenny plants is a help of Dave

949
00:42:08,469 --> 00:42:15,519
Jackson from cosmic carbon and he they

950
00:42:11,139 --> 00:42:17,920
produce Jenny plant that express quietly

951
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:19,989
type of Stan and they look everywhere

952
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,530
one looks them ears and found that book

953
00:42:19,989 --> 00:42:25,000
stand spawning be found this was founded

954
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:26,650
for a blessed and they also identify

955
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,019
some other organelles still do not know

956
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:31,809
where what it is but what was really

957
00:42:29,019 --> 00:42:35,139
surprised intercedes will expand seems

958
00:42:31,809 --> 00:42:37,210
to stream in BOS florin in silent

959
00:42:35,139 --> 00:42:40,599
because if it moves with opposite

960
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:42,929
directions so extend directly as a

961
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:46,239
protein secreted in

962
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:48,839
24 mins I'm so that may look stand a

963
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:51,579
perfect candidate to be

964
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:56,110
relevant to long-distance signaling

965
00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:57,869
right so when then we test book ten

966
00:42:56,110 --> 00:43:01,570
Milton's

967
00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:04,630
44 I saw in response to prep adorable

968
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:06,190
musician so when you in fact and you

969
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:08,470
have wild that you think you see in this

970
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:11,019
case is out regular they are normally

971
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:13,569
susceptible the addition of trichoderma

972
00:43:11,019 --> 00:43:16,000
to the roots makes it more resistant for

973
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:18,760
the total protection looks 10 Newtons

974
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,099
arbitrate surprising this gops are

975
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:23,590
believed to be required for defense

976
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:25,960
against pathogens we did not see in fact

977
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:28,180
his mutants were more resistant not only

978
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,789
in the leaf looks 10 mutants were

979
00:43:28,179 --> 00:43:32,829
resistant is a strength to get accosted

980
00:43:30,789 --> 00:43:36,650
by two

981
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:39,130
the so-called Azalea stop we were

982
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:43,970
resistant to everything we tested but

983
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:46,610
immediately after you treat box Daniels

984
00:43:43,969 --> 00:43:48,709
mr. could learn this plants become all

985
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:49,760
of sudden completely susceptible to

986
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:52,070
attributed to call each other

987
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,440
communication not only they have both

988
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:57,350
induced systemic resistance eight league

989
00:43:54,440 --> 00:44:00,050
in some interesting phenotype I quality

990
00:43:57,349 --> 00:44:01,759
juice systemic susceptibility because

991
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:05,180
remember these plans are resistant

992
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,710
result regularly however they are a lot

993
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:09,319
more susceptible than regular beads

994
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:10,849
around so that suggestion box 10 is

995
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:14,120
relevant to eat and we tested all the

996
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:16,579
mutants in that list and at least before

997
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:18,889
exactly the same time for a box 12

998
00:44:16,579 --> 00:44:21,440
mutation so look scrawny opens are

999
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:24,170
normally they there is no change in the

1000
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,210
resistance levels but one plant is cole

1001
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:29,079
mize with epidermal they become a lot

1002
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:32,539
more society so here now

1003
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:35,299
funded by used a to identify his own

1004
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:37,099
business signals in theory utilizing to

1005
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,769
silent said that we can collect collect

1006
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:41,779
massively

1007
00:44:38,769 --> 00:44:43,820
profiling ox Olympians hormones and

1008
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,620
other metabolites if you already have

1009
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:48,289
several candidates needs to be tested

1010
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:50,980
and those candidates are whether they

1011
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:54,019
are not just mana cases

1012
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:55,519
it's totally against the grain because

1013
00:44:54,019 --> 00:44:58,039
just mana case it is believed to be

1014
00:44:55,519 --> 00:45:02,119
required for virus are in tight let's be

1015
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:04,369
she's not in men's when we used a pair

1016
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:06,529
seven eight JD few minutes they are

1017
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:08,599
still capable of responding to check the

1018
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:11,690
door mobilization by increased

1019
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:15,469
resistance in the stem and in the leaf

1020
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:17,990
so J is not the long-distance thing is

1021
00:45:15,469 --> 00:45:21,439
some other movement produced by

1022
00:45:17,989 --> 00:45:24,219
nine up oxygenases or precursors oj that

1023
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:27,349
are required for induces

1024
00:45:24,219 --> 00:45:29,469
so then I would like to invite your

1025
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,469
questions

1026
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:40,510
this has been a production of Cornell

1027
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:40,510
