1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:07,660
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,660
[Applause]

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,519
University okay just to let you know the

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,000
reason I don't use PowerPoints is so

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,600
many of my colleagues have been telling

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
me that when I use them they just get in

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,800
the way

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,160
so so uh uh there are a couple of places

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,199
where PowerPoints would be useful but uh

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,920
you all have good imagination so we'll

11
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,759
uh we'll we'll work on that so let me to

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,039
start with um

13
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:37,600
I want to share with you uh What uh one

14
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:39,600
of my major concerns are now as we think

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,039
about uh the future in food and

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,039
agriculture issues and um as you

17
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,120
probably gathered from the introduction

18
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,120
uh I've been involved in sustainable

19
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:53,238
agriculture now for 40 years of my life

20
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:54,519
and during uh that whole time uh and

21
00:00:53,238 --> 00:00:57,399
even today

22
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,000
still uh most of my colleagues who are

23
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,679
engaged in sustainable agriculture are

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,518
thinking about it in terms of how do we

25
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:07,200
make the current system a little less

26
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:09,438
bad and you know whether you're uh into

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,400
sustainability thinking about that in

28
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:14,079
terms of uh simply intensifying what

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,520
we're currently doing more which is of

30
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,519
course one school of

31
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:21,640
sustainability or if you're uh feeling

32
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:23,399
that everybody should go organic or if

33
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,680
you're feeling that what we really need

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,799
to do is become more environmentally

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,320
sound

36
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,560
Etc uh it's it's still all operating

37
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,398
under the notion that the basic system

38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,000
we have out there the you know modern

39
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:40,599
industrial system is okay we just have

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,359
to fix it a little bit and uh my point

41
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:45,280
of view is that as we really think about

42
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,319
sustainability we have to think about

43
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,840
future

44
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,679
challenges and that approach to

45
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,600
sustainability is not going to work for

46
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,840
reasons that I'll go into uh in some

47
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:58,199
detail here in a bit but um one of the

48
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,520
resources that also helped me really

49
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,039
think about this uh and this kind of

50
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:05,359
transition that we need to think about

51
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,200
um is you know the world watch Institute

52
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,439
now publishes a state of the World

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,439
Report every year and uh in each of the

54
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:17,000
they they choose a different theme and

55
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:20,318
the stateof the world report in uh

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,439
2013 uh was entitled is sustainability

57
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:26,119
still possible and the lead essay the

58
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:28,318
lead chapter in that collection of essay

59
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,480
and the collection of essays in my view

60
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,639
are always really quite good those

61
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:34,079
usually diversity of group of people

62
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:35,039
that contribute to to each of these uh

63
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,879
annual

64
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,318
reports um and U and and all of the

65
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:40,959
essays in that report were good but the

66
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:43,560
lead essay was written by Robert

67
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,719
Eagleton who at that time was the uh

68
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,158
president of the world Welch

69
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:52,759
Institute and uh he coined the phrase

70
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:56,759
for his lead essay Su stain a

71
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:58,840
Babel and um and and the title of thee

72
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,439
was beyond sustainable Babble how do we

73
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,640
get Beyond sustainable of babyon I

74
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:04,919
always thought that was a really good

75
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:08,439
way to frame this but then he pointed

76
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:10,199
out that uh you know we now have all

77
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:14,479
these different views of

78
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:17,238
sustainability which he says uh uh it uh

79
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,959
reflects a cacophonous profusion of the

80
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:22,719
uses of the word sustainable to mean

81
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,959
anything from environmentally good to

82
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:28,959
cool and he points out that this is an

83
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:31,719
approach which has a high cost because

84
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,759
frequent and inappropriate use lulls us

85
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:37,158
into dreamy belief that all of us and

86
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:39,679
everything we do and everything we buy

87
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:42,120
and everything we use are enable to go

88
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,480
on forever Without End

89
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,438
Amen and I think that's a really good uh

90
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:51,238
statement about where we are today and

91
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:52,878
so this uh state of dreamy belief is

92
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,799
what we have to get Beyond and we have

93
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:58,878
to really address um some of the key

94
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,959
issues that we're facing so one of the

95
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:03,199
uh things that has helped me a lot to

96
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,799
frame this how do we now begin to think

97
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:10,560
about sustainability in a more

98
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:12,280
appropriate uh defensible way and um one

99
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,478
of the resources that's been helpful to

100
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,519
me in uh in thinking about this is um uh

101
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,000
an anthropologist uh who published a

102
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,478
book back in

103
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,240
1989 uh by the name of Ernest shusi and

104
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:28,000
the title of the book that he published

105
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,600
is called culture and agriculture an

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,600
ecological introduction to traditional

107
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,639
and modern farming systems and as you

108
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,320
would expect from an anthropologist what

109
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,120
he does is asks the questions how have

110
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,560
we as humans fed ourselves ever since

111
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,720
we've been on the planet and here's

112
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,000
where a PowerPoint slide would be useful

113
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,960
I actually have one but you know gearing

114
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,600
everything up for that uh and you all

115
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,839
have good imagination so what I'd like

116
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,000
to have you think about now is a

117
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:56,638
timeline of human history so if you see

118
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,560
the timeline of human history all the

119
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,879
way across the screen here and uh and

120
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,519
you know shusi points out that as

121
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:09,519
full-fledged human beings we evolved on

122
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:11,120
the planet about 200,000 years ago now

123
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,478
you know you can take it farther back

124
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,439
than that if you want to go back to the

125
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,599
Neanderthals Etc you know a million

126
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:18,240
years million and a half years whatever

127
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,560
but if you want to think about it in

128
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,680
terms of when we were what we see

129
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,439
ourselves as today as full-blown human

130
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:29,360
beings about 200,000 years ago so he

131
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:32,519
points out that for the first uh 200,000

132
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,800
years or the first 190,000 years we fed

133
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:36,318
ourselves as hunter gatherers so if you

134
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,520
think of this timeline of human history

135
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,039
you have to go at least about halfway or

136
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,240
a little better than halfway across the

137
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:44,519
screen right so we fed ourselves as

138
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,439
hunter gatherers and he points out that

139
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:49,719
feeding ourselves as hunter gatherers

140
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:52,199
was the most efficient Energy System

141
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,680
food system we ever had that we were

142
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,600
producing about 20 KOC calories of food

143
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,680
for every one kilo calorie of the energy

144
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,439
that we invested in making that food

145
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,959
available to us

146
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:06,439
and then about 10 or 12,000 years ago he

147
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:08,719
argu is when we we the ne the Neolithic

148
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:11,478
Revolution started in which we started

149
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,080
to do Agriculture and then instead of

150
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:15,879
Simply going out into nature and hunting

151
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,758
and Gathering what nature provided to

152
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:20,879
feed ourselves we started to manipulate

153
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,560
nature we started to do uh cultivation

154
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,759
we started to domesticate plants and

155
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,360
animals and started to feed ourselves

156
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,560
from that and as he points out this was

157
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,120
a very land intensive kind of

158
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,639
agriculture because we relied first of

159
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,160
all on the natural fertility in the soil

160
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,400
and then in addition to that we

161
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,120
primarily did the and this is not every

162
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:40,560
not every kind of Agriculture but the

163
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,079
majority of Agriculture was the slash

164
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,800
and burn agriculture where we would cut

165
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,719
down and burn the perennial plants that

166
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,160
were out there and then the ash from

167
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,720
that plus the natural fertility would

168
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,919
provide a fertile uh environments in

169
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,440
which to grow our food for you know two

170
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:59,598
or three or four years and then we would

171
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,319
abandon that and slash and burn another

172
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:05,598
place and raise our

173
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:08,080
food uh and uh he argues that from an

174
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,878
Energy Efficiency point of view this was

175
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,240
much less efficient we were now only

176
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:14,319
getting about 10 kilo calories of food

177
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,439
for every Kil calories of energy that we

178
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,319
invested so if you think of the timeline

179
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:20,879
of human history you go about halfway

180
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,598
across the screen and then probably

181
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,199
another two Ines which is that 10,000

182
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:27,598
years when we started to do Agriculture

183
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:29,759
and then he argues and this is the

184
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,800
important point for the point point that

185
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,038
I want to make here that in the early

186
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,120
1900s we entered into a third era of

187
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,918
Agriculture which he called I think

188
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,959
appropriately the neoc caloric era

189
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,120
because it's entirely based on Old

190
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:46,439
calories and then he argues that this

191
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,840
will of necessity be a very short period

192
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:50,719
of time in the timeline of human history

193
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:53,279
so you can think maybe a half inch or

194
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,199
less on that timeline of human history

195
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,318
and that's the agriculture that with or

196
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,038
that's the food system that we're

197
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:02,639
involved in now and any points out that

198
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:04,598
this NE caloric period is the worst

199
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,918
energy efficient system we've ever had

200
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:09,279
we now only get about 1 kilo calorie of

201
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:10,878
food energy for every 10 kilo calories

202
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,758
of energy that we invest in making the

203
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,479
food putting the food on our

204
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:18,360
tables and so as we think about these

205
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:21,519
old calories which support that system

206
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,400
as they no longer are available to us uh

207
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,799
and we have this terribly energy

208
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:28,359
intensive system we're in serious

209
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,439
trouble so if we really want to be S

210
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,120
serious about sustain ability this is

211
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:34,320
the picture we have to think about so

212
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,759
that's what I want to uh address with us

213
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,320
in the few minutes uh that we're going

214
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,559
to have uh together uh today I should

215
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,640
also mention that you know when you when

216
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,639
you read uh uh Ernest shi's view you

217
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:47,439
could kind of like you know so we were

218
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:48,720
hunter gatherers and then one day we

219
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,640
woke up and said oh let's be

220
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,320
agriculturalists now and then one day we

221
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:58,639
woke up and said you know let's be neoc

222
00:08:52,320 --> 00:09:01,399
coloric producers now and uh as uh uh uh

223
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:03,919
uh colon uh tudge points out in his book

224
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:06,320
neanderthals bits and Farmers how

225
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,799
agriculture really began that that's not

226
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,600
the way it happened you know it happened

227
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,479
over a period of time that even when we

228
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,159
were hunter gatherers we started to do

229
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,079
some manipulations you know of nature to

230
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:19,600
try to produce more Etc and even when we

231
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:21,838
shifted from the Neolithic period to the

232
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,560
neocolor period you know that didn't

233
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,959
just Farmers didn't just wake up one day

234
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:27,399
and say oh we're going to start using

235
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,838
all these inputs now uh that that

236
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:31,839
happened over a period of time probably

237
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:33,560
really started in 1840 when eustus liik

238
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,800
you know published his paper about how

239
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:39,278
we didn't need to uh involve ourselves

240
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,719
in the laborious process of maintaining

241
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,159
the health of our soil anymore all we

242
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,639
needed to do is put in the three inputs

243
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:48,600
the nitrogen phosphorus and and uh

244
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:51,600
potassium and then we could produce all

245
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,959
the food that we needed uh and uh and

246
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,200
then it it really took us uh you know

247
00:09:53,958 --> 00:10:00,039
about half a century to really fully

248
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,320
adopt the uh uh neocolor uh period

249
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:06,639
but in any case this the system that we

250
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,360
have now is based on a paradigm which is

251
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,679
really true of all of the industrial

252
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,680
economy and that's maximum efficient

253
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:15,879
production for short-term economic

254
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:18,838
return and every farmer knows that

255
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:22,480
that's what the the Paradigm he has he

256
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:24,519
or she has to operate under and um so

257
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,240
what that means is that you have to

258
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:27,959
think about this in terms of how you

259
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,720
accomplish that maximum efficient

260
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:32,119
production for short-term economic

261
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,879
return and of course the way you do that

262
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,440
is you specialize because that's more

263
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:40,799
efficient you simplify your management

264
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,959
and you go for economies of scale and uh

265
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:45,879
an individual who was very much at the

266
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:48,239
heart of this was Henry Ford and some of

267
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:49,879
us probably didn't know that Henry Ford

268
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,159
actually grew up on a farm just outside

269
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:55,159
of Detroit and he had already been a you

270
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:57,559
know adopting those principles in the

271
00:10:55,159 --> 00:11:00,278
farming operation and then took those

272
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:04,518
principles uh when the EST L the first

273
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:06,120
uh automobile uh uh assembly line uh so

274
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,799
he once famously said that people could

275
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,240
buy any car they wanted as long as was a

276
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:10,759
black Ford Model T because that was the

277
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,600
only one he was going to produce because

278
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:14,240
that was more efficient and then of

279
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,639
course he didn't teach every one of his

280
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,879
employees to put a whole a whole

281
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:19,720
automobile together taught each one to

282
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:21,639
just do a simple piece of it and it came

283
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,639
through the assembly line and then he

284
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,200
was insistent on producing enough cars

285
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:26,799
so that even all of his employees could

286
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,079
afford to buy one that was the economies

287
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,639
of scale and then that concept became

288
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,919
adopted in

289
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:36,919
agriculture uh and especially after the

290
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,719
second world war and uh you know when

291
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:41,000
you drive through Iowa now for example

292
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,600
you don't see 40 different varieties of

293
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,200
crops the way we used to grow back in

294
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,519
the 1940s it's just two now just corn

295
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,959
and soybeans and that's it and that's

296
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,720
that again that

297
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,759
specialization uh management

298
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,879
simplification one of the reasons that

299
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:59,078
uh uh GMO crops became so popular

300
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:01,439
especially in things like soybeans is

301
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:03,919
that that when you use Roundup Ready

302
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,760
soybeans you don't have to have all that

303
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,439
complex management of trying to figure

304
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,799
out exactly when the weeds are coming

305
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,000
how you're going to control them you

306
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:12,319
just go out there and you plant your

307
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,759
soybeans you wait till the weeds come up

308
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,839
one spray of Roundup and the weeds are

309
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:18,759
gone and the soybeans grow on their own

310
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,880
that's the simplification and then of

311
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:23,879
course the economies of scale uh you

312
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:27,039
know average Farm sizes you know used to

313
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:29,399
be uh about a th000 acres in Iowa now we

314
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:31,599
actually have one 40,000 Acre Farm a lot

315
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:35,078
of the Farms are five and 10,000

316
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,240
acres so uh the question we really need

317
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:39,759
to ask is whether or not this direction

318
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,360
that we've taken and this kind of

319
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:45,000
specialization um simplification and

320
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,039
economies of scale uh continue to be

321
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
sustained into the future as we meet

322
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,759
these uh these new challenges that we're

323
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,720
uh that we're going to be facing so what

324
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:55,759
are some of those challenges well the

325
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,399
first challenge obviously is energy uh

326
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,198
our current system not only in

327
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,198
agriculture but our whole Industrial

328
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:03,278
economy is absolutely dependent on cheap

329
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:05,479
energy you know the amount of energy

330
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,759
that we're currently using is

331
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,879
unprecedented and uh we've had this

332
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,679
cheap energy because we've had stored

333
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:14,000
concentrated energy primarily in the

334
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,759
form of fossil fuels when you have

335
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,198
stored concentrated energy all you got

336
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:22,240
to do is you expend the energy uh to dig

337
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:23,958
into the Earth and extract that energy

338
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,440
and then process it and make it

339
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:31,439
available and uh you know back in the in

340
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,480
the uh 19 1930s and 40s we sometimes

341
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,720
forget I think that the first oil well

342
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,839
in this country was in 1859 and Titus

343
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,720
old Pennsylvania so about 150 years ago

344
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:43,240
and then we didn't go to the oil economy

345
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,120
the next day you know it took about a uh

346
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,879
you know 40 or 50 years to really get

347
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,399
fully into the oil economy so we've

348
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,639
really only been in an oil economy for

349
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,278
about a 100 years again a very short

350
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,600
period of time but during that period of

351
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:58,078
time uh it's been these cheap fossil

352
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,320
fuels that have driven not only our

353
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:04,078
whole economy of the especially our food

354
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,920
system so now and and you know right now

355
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:07,399
as we all know the oil prices have gone

356
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,198
down but I don't need to go into detail

357
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:10,919
of why that's happening you know it sort

358
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,198
of didn't work out that well for Saudi

359
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:15,559
Arabia anymore so they started producing

360
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:18,278
as much as possible so this is a short

361
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:20,679
period of time in the you know in the

362
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:22,799
energy uh picture and at some point

363
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:25,599
these oil prices are going to go up uh

364
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:31,599
torn Pickins who's an oil guy uh he told

365
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:34,440
us uh uh uh uh about eight years ago uh

366
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,079
uh that uh we should expect that uh

367
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,720
crude oil will hit $350 a barrel within

368
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:43,758
10 years um so uh we got a couple more

369
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,720
years uh to get to that point now uh he

370
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,480
probably didn't anticipate you know the

371
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,278
additional oil from fracking and all of

372
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:53,320
that and uh even if you discount uh some

373
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:55,198
of the ecological damage from that Etc

374
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,079
uh that can't that can't continue

375
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:01,879
indefinitely into the future so at some

376
00:14:57,078 --> 00:15:03,919
point the oil will be $350 a barrel and

377
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:06,198
the question I like to ask and I spend

378
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:08,599
most of my time talking with farmers and

379
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:10,240
I really prefer to talk to a mix of

380
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,040
farmers you know some conventional

381
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,198
Farmers some organic farmers some CSA

382
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,759
Farmers some Market Farmers Market

383
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:20,559
Farmers Market Farmers uh around the

384
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,240
same table and then uh instead of

385
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,599
getting into an argument about who's

386
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,560
right and who's wrong what I like to do

387
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,120
is to say okay let's imagine that 10

388
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:31,559
years from now crude oil would be $350 a

389
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,759
barrel and let's imagine that uh

390
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:35,359
fertilizer prices are 10 times what they

391
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,759
are today because we're also drawing

392
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,560
down all of our natural resources and if

393
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,800
you want to read a really important uh

394
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,359
book on that uh Ugo bardy who's now

395
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,639
published a new club of Rome report

396
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,480
called extracted in which he goes into

397
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,000
great detail about all of these mineral

398
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,759
resources and these other natural

399
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
resources on which we've absolutely

400
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:57,120
depended where our industrial economy

401
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
are now essentially becoming

402
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,360
distracted and then um Michael CLA also

403
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,078
published a book called The Race for

404
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,560
what's left in which he also goes into

405
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:07,318
great detail on all of these resources

406
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:09,518
that we've been absolutely dependent on

407
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:13,519
in our industrial economy are now

408
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:15,679
becoming depleted and he presents a

409
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,480
scenario which is very convincing that

410
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,159
we could end up going into a series of

411
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,319
resource Wars to grab those last ones

412
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:25,120
that are left so we would use the

413
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:27,240
remaining resources to fight over the

414
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,879
resources and we still want to call

415
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,680
ourselves Homo sapiens but um but

416
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:34,078
nevertheless these are all possibilities

417
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,039
that we have to think about and then in

418
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:37,399
addition to that you add the fact that

419
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:40,679
we're drawing down our Fresh Water

420
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:42,799
Resources all across the planet and uh

421
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:45,198
and of course water is essential we're

422
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:46,559
currently we're using 70% of our fresh

423
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:47,639
freshwater resources just for

424
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:49,679
agricultural

425
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,039
irrigation um and part of that is

426
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,239
because of course we haven't paid

427
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:54,958
attention to what so Albert Howard

428
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,560
reminded us we needed to do and that was

429
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,359
pay attention to the biological health

430
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:01,719
of our soil so our soils don't absorb

431
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,360
uh right most most of our soils now have

432
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,038
become so degraded they only absorb

433
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,360
about a half inch of half inch of rain

434
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:11,599
water an hour uh and um so the rest of

435
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:13,318
the water runs off uh and so we have to

436
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,159
use more irrigation but we're drawing

437
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:16,918
down a fresh reader Fresh Water

438
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,279
Resources all across the planet then of

439
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:20,640
course we have to add the big elephant

440
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:23,639
in the room and that's climate change

441
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,240
and uh and all of these are connected

442
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,000
because climate change to some extent is

443
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,480
the result of the fact that we haven't

444
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,400
managed our natural systems and ways

445
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,599
that are self-renewing and

446
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,759
self-regulating uh and so we have to

447
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:41,359
begin thinking now about a future um in

448
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:44,079
which we uh uh you know uh take all of

449
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:47,199
those uh kinds of things into

450
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:48,960
consideration so uh now you can probably

451
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,640
come to the conclusion pretty quickly

452
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,200
and a way I said oh God it's all going

453
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,080
to hell there's nothing we can do about

454
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:58,360
it so I want to spend uh the next uh 15

455
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,798
minutes or so uh talking about a

456
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:03,798
different kind kind of future which I

457
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:06,200
think U is possible for us and um one of

458
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:08,000
the things that we have that's useful to

459
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,558
us that we do have some wisdom from the

460
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,839
past about how to do things differently

461
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:15,720
in a more sustainable way that actually

462
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:16,879
can accomplish a kind of sustainable and

463
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,798
again we're going to concentrate

464
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,039
primarily on our Agriculture and food

465
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:23,798
system and one of those uh uh pieces of

466
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:25,839
wisdom from the past is from Sir Albert

467
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:27,798
Howard you know sir Albert Howard

468
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,798
already uh and he published this book in

469
00:18:27,798 --> 00:18:33,158
agriculture Testament back in

470
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:36,798
1943 and he already understood back then

471
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:39,320
that this direction that ustus V liek

472
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:41,639
put us on of Simply going back to using

473
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:43,639
these few synthetic inputs instead of

474
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,200
paying attention to biological soils was

475
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,559
the wrong direction in fact he referred

476
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,960
to what he called the NPK mentality he

477
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,240
referred to that as a form of banditry

478
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,200
because it was going to steal

479
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,599
biologically healthy soils from future

480
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,679
generations and this this was not

481
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:02,558
consentable and so in his book on page

482
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:05,519
four and and his idea his alternative to

483
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:07,440
this was to farm the way nature does and

484
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,639
on page four of the agriculture

485
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,000
Testament he puts that concept into a

486
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,038
summary paragraph which is a very short

487
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,079
paragraph which I've always thought is a

488
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:20,839
great concept a great statement for how

489
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:22,599
we need to think about how we're going

490
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:25,839
to redesign our food system for the

491
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:28,038
future and here's how he put that he

492
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:30,558
said uh you know we we can we can we can

493
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:32,400
summarize this in a in a few words and

494
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:35,279
uh what we need to do is to partner with

495
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,080
nature uh rather than to subdue or

496
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,038
ignore nature with the way West Jackson

497
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:40,879
would put it and so here's what he said

498
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,359
he said Mother Earth never attempts to

499
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,039
farm without livestock so animals are

500
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:48,359
always a part of a self-renewing

501
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:50,599
self-regulating system she always yees

502
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:53,199
mixed crops there are no monocultures or

503
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:55,240
at least very few monocultures in nature

504
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,080
great pains are taken to preserve the

505
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,839
soil and to prevent erosion that's how

506
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,960
nature functions

507
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:04,519
the mixed vegetable and animal waste are

508
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:07,200
converted into humus and there is no

509
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:09,720
waste everything gets recycled back into

510
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,480
the system in nature the processes of

511
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,400
growth and the process of Decay balance

512
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:19,079
one another ample provision is made to

513
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:21,120
maintain large reserves of fertility and

514
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:23,839
uh again even since we started to do

515
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,719
agriculture 10,000 years ago it was that

516
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:28,158
those reserves of fertility that we

517
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:31,159
depended on for uh you know for raising

518
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:34,039
for producing our food U the greatest

519
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:35,840
care is taken to store the rainfall and

520
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:38,599
both plants and animals are left to

521
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,599
protect themselves against disease now

522
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:42,119
some of my colleagues take exception to

523
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:44,279
that last statement you mean we just

524
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:45,798
ignore plants and animals we don't you

525
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:47,359
know we don't attend to their health

526
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:48,839
anymore well this is not what he's

527
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,558
saying what he's really saying in his

528
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:54,199
view is that if you manage our your

529
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:57,119
farming systems the way nature does then

530
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,240
the natural uh immunities and health of

531
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:00,558
the animals and the plants will pretty

532
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,599
much take care of themselves so you

533
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:05,678
don't need to bring in resources from

534
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:08,079
outside to to do that now the one piece

535
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,120
that's missing from his analysis which

536
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:11,960
I'm sure West Jackson would want to add

537
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:15,519
is that nature operates on the basis of

538
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,919
perennials not annuals um and so if we

539
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:20,319
were to think about this concept of

540
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,038
Agriculture and how do we with all of

541
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:24,960
our resources that we have at our

542
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:27,200
disposable today in our modern world how

543
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,480
could we use those resources to create a

544
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,360
farming system that that operates under

545
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,599
this principle of farming the way nature

546
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,278
does that I think is a is a huge

547
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:38,639
challenge for us and it's a challenge

548
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:40,278
that I think uh is uh is one that we can

549
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,960
address and one that we can come up with

550
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:44,759
and I'll mention a few details on that

551
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,480
in a bit here a second wisdom from the

552
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:48,599
past is somebody that's all known to you

553
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,558
here at Cornell and that's Liberty Hyde

554
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:54,759
Bailey and among his many Publications

555
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:56,879
was his book the holy Earth in which he

556
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:58,919
said what we need to do now in our

557
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,960
agriculture system is to come up with

558
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:05,200
this new hold we have to have this new

559
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:07,880
internal motivation that helps us to

560
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,919
recognize that nature isn't just a

561
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,840
resource out there for us to exploit and

562
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,759
use but we have to treat it as kind of a

563
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:16,879
sacred resource a holy Earth and we have

564
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:19,879
to learn to relate to that Earth in a

565
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,080
way uh that sustains its health and and

566
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:25,278
it and its Vitality uh and uh the holy

567
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:27,639
Earth is is uh again I think one of

568
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:30,319
those resources uh that most of us

569
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,278
should go back and uh this year 2015

570
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,439
this the 100th anniversary of the

571
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:36,759
publication of that and my understanding

572
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,558
is that uh Counterpoint press is going

573
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:41,440
to publish a a new uh edition of the

574
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:43,720
Holy Earth and Wendel Barry is going to

575
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,240
write the introduction to that so we

576
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,038
might want to take a look at that as a

577
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,120
new resource you know for our students

578
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:51,640
Etc and have some conversations about

579
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:53,678
again that wisdom from the past and then

580
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,360
you can also add to that list uh Alder

581
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,720
Leopold who's one of my heroes and you

582
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:59,439
know Alder Leopold was actually

583
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,759
influenced by the writings of Liberty

584
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,919
Hyde Bailey but even more so influenced

585
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:08,079
by his own observations of Nature and

586
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:10,480
how nature functioned and um you know he

587
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:13,079
came up with this notion that we now

588
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,360
have to think about the land not so much

589
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:17,960
as a commodity belonging us but as a

590
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:19,879
community to which we belong and that we

591
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,880
humans are simply plain members and

592
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:25,440
citizens of this biological community

593
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,120
that makes up this Dynamic Land

594
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,080
Community um and then he developed out

595
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:31,519
of that concept he developed his land

596
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:33,879
ethic but you all know so I don't need

597
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:35,720
to repeat that but then he ended up

598
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,679
saying so how are we going to implement

599
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,360
this land ethic and a land ethic isn't

600
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,120
something that's just written it's

601
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,399
something that has to be internalized in

602
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:45,678
us and so he came up with this concept

603
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,480
of we have what we have to do now is to

604
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,360
develop an ecological conscience you

605
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,679
know a conscience in which we all

606
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:55,599
recognize that land health is an issue

607
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,320
that has to be as important to us as any

608
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:59,439
other kind of ethical consideration and

609
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:00,918
but but how do we develop the

610
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,600
psychological conscience and that's

611
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:04,679
where he realized this was a difficult

612
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:06,879
task and that you couldn't simply do

613
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:09,000
this you know by writing about it or by

614
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,360
talking about it that this had to be a

615
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,240
product of social

616
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:16,038
Evolution but an ecological conscience

617
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,679
is a conscience about land health and

618
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:20,359
land Health in his view was the land's

619
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:22,679
capacity for

620
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:25,038
self-renewal so how do we begin to

621
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:26,720
relate to the land in a way and by again

622
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:28,798
by the land he doesn't just mean the

623
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,759
fields out there he meant the entire

624
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:33,038
biotic Community how to relate to the

625
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:34,119
biotic community in a way that it is

626
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,558
self-renewing

627
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:38,000
uh that it and and again this is

628
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,599
critical to how we think about the

629
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,679
future of our food and agriculture

630
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,199
system so the there's some others you

631
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,919
know that we could talk about let me let

632
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,600
me just leave with those three but there

633
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:49,480
we do have this wisdom in the past and

634
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:51,519
then we have the science of ecology and

635
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,919
evolutionary biology and

636
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:57,038
unfortunately in agriculture we have

637
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,919
applied almost none of the insights and

638
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,278
resources and research

639
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,320
from the science of ecology and

640
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:05,119
evolutionary biology and Agriculture and

641
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:07,319
in my view if we married that wisdom

642
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:08,599
from the past with what we've learned

643
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:10,879
from the science of ecology and

644
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:14,480
evolutionary biology I think we could

645
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,679
come up with Incredible new design uh

646
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,159
systems for a future food and

647
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:22,240
agriculture system and that's what I'm

648
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:24,200
trying to encourage uh you know the land

649
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,278
grant University that I'm involved with

650
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,798
and and others of us who because I think

651
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:31,839
this is a critical role um which our

652
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:34,079
university community uh uh can

653
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,798
address and when you think about it in

654
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:37,519
terms of the science of ecology and

655
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:39,839
evolution of biology a couple of things

656
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:41,558
stand out not only from that science but

657
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:44,439
also from some of the things that we're

658
00:25:41,558 --> 00:25:47,839
learning uh at the Practical level now

659
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:50,038
is that critical in this in in this new

660
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:52,240
uh design of our food system is

661
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:55,440
restoring the biological health of our

662
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:59,079
soil and you have here uh great

663
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:02,480
resources in that uh uh in ter terms of

664
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:04,960
uh vaness who has been working with Fred

665
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,079
magof and others and developing actually

666
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,038
some metrics for how we major soil

667
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:12,519
Health uh but we need to really begin to

668
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:15,599
address that and figure out how we apply

669
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:17,759
that and how we uh begin to work with

670
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,240
farmers and not only farmers but other

671
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:20,679
people in the food system because if

672
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,759
we're going to if we're going to restore

673
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:25,240
the biological health of our soil we

674
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:26,879
can't continue to do maximum efficient

675
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,839
production for short-term economic

676
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,480
return we have to come up with a new

677
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:32,519
paradigm and Farmers can't do that on

678
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,759
their own we have to all become involved

679
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:36,278
in that because we have to create a new

680
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:38,679
food system and that new paradigm is

681
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:42,440
more a regenerative resilient food

682
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:44,480
system for Reliable long-term return

683
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,360
that's an entirely different Paradigm

684
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,960
but we can do that and we know how to do

685
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:50,000
that and if we redesigned our food

686
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,399
system it would encourage Farmers to

687
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,159
move in that kind of Direction and so

688
00:26:52,398 --> 00:26:56,319
that's uh that I think is part of what

689
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,640
we need to uh what we need to address

690
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:00,359
and again we have some interesting

691
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,840
resources here you know and again I I

692
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:04,359
don't have time to go into all them but

693
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:07,119
but one that had really uh inspired me

694
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:09,278
over a long period of time is uh an

695
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:11,639
essay that Joe Lewis and his colleagues

696
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:13,398
and Joe Lewis was the leading Pest

697
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,960
Management specialist in the agriculture

698
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:19,479
research Service uh for uh I think

699
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:22,640
almost 50 years and in 1997 he and his

700
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:25,599
colleagues published an article in the U

701
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:28,759
uh National Academy of Sciences uh mag

702
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:31,199
proceedings and um there point in their

703
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:34,200
article was after 50 years of experience

704
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,440
he said we now know that single tactic

705
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,240
therapeutic intervention strategies for

706
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,038
solving pest problems are not

707
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,440
sustainable because as they pointed out

708
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:45,158
if you come if you have a pest problem

709
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,000
and you have this single tactic you know

710
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:49,640
you come in with a with a pesticide the

711
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,880
therapeutic intervention to get rid of

712
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,640
the pest that that's not sustainable

713
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,320
because what happens is you never get

714
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,240
rid of all the target pests so you

715
00:27:55,319 --> 00:28:00,839
create pest resistance and you not only

716
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,038
harm the target pest but you also harm

717
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:05,678
other biological organisms some of which

718
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:07,480
previously served to help suppress pest

719
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,360
emergence so you're actually causing

720
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,000
pest Resurgence so this is not a

721
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,278
sustainable

722
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,798
approach and then they point out in the

723
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:16,278
middle of that article they have about

724
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:18,158
three paragraphs and they said we should

725
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:21,038
not expect any other different results

726
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:23,640
from genetic engineering than we do uh

727
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,919
from uh uh chemical technology because

728
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,399
it's the same Paradigm we're still doing

729
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,759
single tactic therapeutic intervention

730
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:32,479
uh to solve a problem rather than what

731
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:35,879
they said what we have to do now is to

732
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,519
transition to Natural systems management

733
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,399
and they finally end up at the end of

734
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:41,278
that article with two questions which

735
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:43,439
I've always loved they said instead of

736
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:46,440
asking how do I get rid of the pest what

737
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,558
we have to ask is why is the pest a pest

738
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,960
then that leads us to redesigning the

739
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:52,278
system in a way that suppresses pest

740
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,480
emergence and that's the direction we

741
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:55,919
have to move in and then they argue also

742
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,519
in there that we aren't just talking

743
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,240
about Pest Management we're talking

744
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:03,640
about you know all of our systems that

745
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,079
you know whether you're uh uh a farmer

746
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:08,799
or whether you're a school teacher or

747
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,398
whatever if you're addressing your task

748
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:12,558
as a single tactic therapeutic

749
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:14,319
intervention you're really not enabling

750
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:16,319
people to understand what's going on in

751
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,918
the system that's causing the problem in

752
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:20,639
the first place and that's the direction

753
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,320
we have to move in so I think this is a

754
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,679
brilliant article that I hope everybody

755
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:29,119
uh and it's still uh all you got to do

756
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,480
is uh Google Joe Lewis and uh uh and and

757
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:32,639
and the article will come up and you can

758
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,038
download it and U and read

759
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,600
it uh one of the other things that has

760
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:40,000
inspired me recently is uh uh Dan Barber

761
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:42,038
who's a good friend of mine who is a

762
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,960
chef actually and many of you I'm sure

763
00:29:42,038 --> 00:29:46,640
know him or know about him uh he has two

764
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,798
restaurants in New York now actually one

765
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:52,360
at Stone Barnes where where I spent part

766
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:54,558
of my time and one in town and uh Dan's

767
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:55,398
published a new book now called uh the

768
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,558
third

769
00:29:55,398 --> 00:30:03,000
plate and he argues as a chef now based

770
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:05,240
on his experience that uh the farm to

771
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,359
table direction we went from you know

772
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,599
industrial food production to farm to

773
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:11,879
table food production and that was an

774
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:15,278
important transition but we need to go

775
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:17,559
beyond that now because what he

776
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:19,640
discovered is that uh as a chef of

777
00:30:17,558 --> 00:30:21,558
course what he's primarily concerned

778
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,320
about is getting that kind of quality of

779
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:27,079
food which has this exceptional taste

780
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:29,240
that satisfies his customers and along

781
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:31,000
the way he discovered that as a chef the

782
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,440
easiest way to accomplish that is to

783
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
find the farmers who manage their soil

784
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,200
for soil health because if you grow food

785
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,798
on soil that has healthy that's healthy

786
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:44,360
soil then you have food that has this

787
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:46,398
incredible uh taste quality and then as

788
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:47,959
a chef all you need to do is prepare

789
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:49,798
this food in a way that allows the

790
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,798
natural flavors to express themselves

791
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:52,558
you don't have to do all the

792
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:53,759
manipulation to get the food to do what

793
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:56,839
you want it to

794
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:59,440
do and then of course and Dan is also

795
00:30:56,839 --> 00:31:02,359
very interested when a farmer farms in a

796
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,840
way that gets this kind of biological

797
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:06,918
healthy soil What does the farmer have

798
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:09,519
to do so he starts to visit the farms

799
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:11,480
and one of the key relationships that he

800
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,599
had was uh to Claus Martins who's

801
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:16,639
actually pretty close to you here and oh

802
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:18,439
and K Claus Martins was producing a

803
00:31:16,638 --> 00:31:20,558
variety of Emer wheat that was out of

804
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,759
this world and this is what Dan wanted

805
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:24,558
and so he went to Claus's Farm to see

806
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:26,599
what klous was doing in order to produce

807
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:28,440
this emmer wheat and he discovered that

808
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:30,798
klous had to grow some cover crops from

809
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,278
which he got no income he had to have a

810
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:35,440
crop rotation which included Millet and

811
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:37,159
barley which there was no Market in the

812
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,919
food market so he had to sell that as

813
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:41,440
animal feed which he got less money for

814
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,200
and then suddenly Dan realized what he

815
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,399
was doing is simply cherry-picking this

816
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,720
one product from his farm for his own

817
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:48,918
benefit just like going into a

818
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,720
supermarket and just cherry-picking some

819
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:52,919
things and that was not the future of

820
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,600
the food system what we have to learn

821
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:57,399
now is he what he called eating from the

822
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:59,079
whole farm so he started to work with

823
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:01,839
Claus and they figured out ways that

824
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:03,519
they could Harvest some of the leafy

825
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:05,439
material from the cover crops which he

826
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:09,200
could use in his salads in the

827
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:11,798
restaurant and he started to design some

828
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,519
uh menus or some some items in his menu

829
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:15,079
made from the Millet and from The Barley

830
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,399
so he could actually buy those as food

831
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:19,158
props from from klus and this then

832
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:21,959
suddenly put Claus into a much better

833
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:23,880
economic situation and this concept now

834
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,558
of eating from the whole Farm is

835
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,919
becoming popular even in Iowa where some

836
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:29,480
people say you know we got to deal with

837
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,120
with Farmers differently here we got to

838
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,880
think about what Farmers have to do what

839
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:34,719
we want them to do and then how do we

840
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,840
reward for them for that in the

841
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,038
marketplace and this is a whole new

842
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:40,959
concept which is going to take some time

843
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:42,720
I'm sure to catch on everywhere else but

844
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,000
if it's catching on in Iowa it can catch

845
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,759
on anywhere

846
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,759
so so these are the kinds of uh

847
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,960
directions and again we could uh there's

848
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,519
all let me also add one other little bit

849
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,399
of good news here that's happening and

850
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,480
that's actually in the business world

851
00:32:55,398 --> 00:33:00,239
because obviously uh uh people in the

852
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,599
business world have to begin to

853
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,839
transform their operations as well and

854
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:07,558
um there are two resources I want to

855
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:08,720
call to your attention and one is an

856
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:10,960
article that was published in the

857
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,440
Harvard Business Review a January

858
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,360
February uh 2011 issue uh by Michael

859
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,840
Porter and Mark Kramer who are two of

860
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:20,278
our leading economists which is

861
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:22,119
important to keep in mind here and they

862
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:25,079
wrote this article entitled creating

863
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:27,158
shared value and that article was

864
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:29,359
written to the business community and

865
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:32,480
basically what they said in the article

866
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:35,000
of creating shared value they said the

867
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,519
if we if people in business continue to

868
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,278
operate by what they call the old

869
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:40,440
Playbook you're not going to be

870
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:42,839
successful in the future and operating

871
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,840
by the old Playbook is getting your

872
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:46,678
labor and your raw materials as cheaply

873
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:48,678
as possible so you can increase your

874
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:50,320
profits in your company and

875
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:52,080
externalizing as much of your

876
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:54,240
environmental cost and your social cost

877
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:55,480
as possible to increase your profit in

878
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,240
your own company and if you're going to

879
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,639
continue to operate by that old Playbook

880
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,278
you're not going to be successful in the

881
00:33:58,638 --> 00:34:03,119
future the reason is because our labor

882
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:04,798
and raw materials are now becoming so

883
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:07,079
degraded you're not going to have the

884
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:08,838
quality of those labor and raw materials

885
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:10,639
for to continue to be successful in your

886
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:12,918
business and if you continue to

887
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,760
externalize your environmental costs and

888
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:17,638
your social costs then your social and

889
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,399
natural capital in your community is

890
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,480
going to deteriorate to a point where

891
00:34:19,398 --> 00:34:22,559
you're not going to be able to have a

892
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,159
successful business in those communities

893
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:25,639
so you now have to figure out how you're

894
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,079
going to do business on the basis of

895
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:29,679
shared value taking all of these

896
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,879
consideration these issues into

897
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,639
consideration in your business plan and

898
00:34:31,878 --> 00:34:36,440
they make a very compelling case for

899
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:38,240
this and I know that uh Michael Porter

900
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,760
at least is now doing some workshops

901
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:42,000
around the country with people in the

902
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,159
business Community trying to help them

903
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,039
understand why they need to make this

904
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:46,878
kind of transition and then there's a

905
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:50,159
second resource which I think is in many

906
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:54,679
ways is equally important and um this is

907
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:56,760
a u uh a u his name is Andrew Winston he

908
00:34:54,679 --> 00:35:00,039
has started his own company which he

909
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:02,280
uses as a consulting firm uh to work

910
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:05,119
with uh major corporations especially in

911
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:08,640
the Agriculture and food system and the

912
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:11,119
title of his book is the big pivot and

913
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:13,960
the subtitle is radical practical

914
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:17,240
strategies for a hotter scarcer and more

915
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,720
open world and his point in his book is

916
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:21,399
that if you're in business and you want

917
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:23,919
to be successful in the future you can't

918
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:26,000
just kind of you know make things a

919
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,079
little less bad and hope that you can be

920
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,159
successful because we're not in a

921
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,680
situation where we have a hotter world

922
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:33,000
that's the effects of climate change

923
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:35,159
which are already affecting our

924
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,358
businesses and we continue to do so for

925
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:39,078
in the future we're living in a scarcer

926
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:40,639
world where many of these resources that

927
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:42,200
I talked about are no longer going to be

928
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,679
there so you have to figure out how

929
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:45,598
you're going to redesign your business

930
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,719
to operate under the circumstances and

931
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,280
it's a more open world so if you think

932
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:51,279
you can work your way through this

933
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,200
simply with a better job of messaging

934
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,800
you're on the wrong side of History

935
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:57,439
because there are now the social media

936
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,079
and if you if you put out that kind of

937
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,440
mess message and it's not true somebody

938
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:03,280
will come up with a 10-minute video to

939
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,760
expose you and then it's going to hurt

940
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,560
your business so you now have to make a

941
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,280
big pivot turn and fundamentally rethink

942
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:12,679
and reorganize your system the guinea

943
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,800
makes a very compelling case for this so

944
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:17,078
these things are happening in the

945
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:21,079
business world as well as uh uh in the

946
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:23,920
um uh you know in the uh uh uh uh

947
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:25,039
physical world and I think you there

948
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,280
there's some other things we could talk

949
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:27,719
about here but we can maybe we'll get

950
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,079
into them my question answer but I want

951
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:31,118
I want to end with one other thing and

952
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:33,960
that is I think the role that the Arts

953
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:37,039
can play in all of this because if we

954
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:39,838
can't imagine a different way of doing

955
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:42,800
things in a better future and become

956
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:44,440
emotionally energized to do that it's

957
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,960
going to be very difficult to see how

958
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,119
we're going to make these big pivot

959
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,039
turns and I want to give you just one

960
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:51,000
example of the way in which the Arts can

961
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:54,039
be so

962
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,119
effective um Kathleen uh Dean Moore who

963
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:58,239
is the head of the philosophy department

964
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:00,318
at uh Oregon

965
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:01,598
University and she told me once that

966
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:03,800
when she got into the field of

967
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,599
philosophy she began to realize that

968
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,079
philosophers often use such dense

969
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,640
language they don't even understand each

970
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:09,839
other let alone the general public and

971
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:13,039
she didn't want to be a part of that

972
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:15,400
world so she started to translate these

973
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:17,880
important philosophical concept into

974
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,720
stories and in her book The Pine Island

975
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:23,280
Paradox at one point where she talks

976
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:27,078
about the difficulties and challenges

977
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:30,119
and and um and uh uh damage that were

978
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:31,920
doing uh with our Wars and with the way

979
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:35,160
in which we're treating our environment

980
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,599
Etc uh this simply can't go on so she

981
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:39,279
decides to imagine her daughter her

982
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,880
granddaughter writing her a letter from

983
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,359
a hundred years in the future and what

984
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,480
would she say to her and here is here's

985
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:47,400
the story here's the imaginary letter

986
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,119
that she puts out which I think is a

987
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,760
great example how the Arts can be used

988
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,838
in such a powerful way she imagines her

989
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,160
granddaughter saying how could you not

990
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:58,400
have known what more evidence did you

991
00:37:56,159 --> 00:38:01,440
need that your lives your comfortable

992
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,240
lives would do so much damage to ours

993
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,079
did you think that you could wage war

994
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:07,439
against Nations without Waging War

995
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:09,160
against people and against the Earth

996
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,760
didn't you wonder what we would drink

997
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:13,440
once who had poisoned the ERS didn't you

998
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,480
wonder what we would Breathe once who

999
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,720
had poisoned the air did you stop to ask

1000
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,639
how we would be safe in a world poisoned

1001
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:24,118
by war did you think that it all belong

1002
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:26,239
to you this beautiful Earth you who

1003
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:28,200
loved your children did you think that

1004
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:31,078
we could live without clean air in

1005
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:33,000
healthy cities you who loved the Earth

1006
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:36,359
did you think that we could live without

1007
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,119
bird song and swaying trees and if you

1008
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:41,119
knew how could you not care what could

1009
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,920
matter to you more than your children

1010
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,000
and their babies How could a parent

1011
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,440
destroy what is lifegiving and

1012
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,519
astonishing in her child's world and if

1013
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:57,000
you knew and if you cared how could you

1014
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:59,358
not act what excuses did you make and

1015
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,079
now what would you have us

1016
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:05,598
do and I think this is a powerful kind

1017
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:07,960
of statement which can serve to energize

1018
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,480
us you know because it's our

1019
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,880
grandchildren that's going to inherit

1020
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,039
the world that we're creating and so we

1021
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,559
need to begin to take seriously these

1022
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:17,119
kinds of transitions that we have to

1023
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:18,679
make not only in our food and

1024
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,838
agriculture system but of course that's

1025
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:22,239
critical because we can do without a lot

1026
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:25,400
of things in the future but we can't do

1027
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:26,919
without food and water and so uh so this

1028
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,160
is uh what I wanted to leave with you

1029
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,480
today and

1030
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:33,879
uh go to uh some uh i' love to you know

1031
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,920
have your concept and I always say to

1032
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,838
people I'm especially interested if I

1033
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,480
said something you disagree with because

1034
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:42,000
I'm a Russian German so I haven't had an

1035
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,880
argument I haven't had a good day yet

1036
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,559
so but anyway uh let's open it up and

1037
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:50,838
then Matt's GNA repeat the question so

1038
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:50,838
sure everybody hears

1039
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:01,079
let's the concept of

1040
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,960
uh changing farming and on a very um

1041
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:05,839
what I personally partook was like on a

1042
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,159
very local scale like it's on us to do

1043
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:10,279
um more sustainable farming or go to the

1044
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:12,078
farmers what do you think the role that

1045
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,560
does the corporate farming play in the

1046
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:15,560
United States how does that haveen to

1047
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:17,480
change in the future because essentially

1048
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:19,759
part of the problem is Corporate farming

1049
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,838
and they manipulate the

1050
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,040
farmers yeah well that's part of one of

1051
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:26,480
the things that I didn't address which

1052
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:27,960
uh we can talk about if you want is

1053
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,440
you've got a culture

1054
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,920
isue uh because we've all become a part

1055
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,760
of the industrial economy the culture

1056
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,760
which sustains that and you know Paul

1057
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,800
Roberts uh C recently called the impul

1058
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,560
society in which he makes a very

1059
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,400
compellent case for the fact that the

1060
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:48,799
kind of culture that we live in now is

1061
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:52,160
all about mine and now um and of course

1062
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:55,440
our corporate world also lives by that

1063
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:58,480
culture and that trans and so you know

1064
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,318
so we have this kind of uh uh economic

1065
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,240
system now in which each of us feel we

1066
00:41:01,318 --> 00:41:05,639
have to you know capture as much for

1067
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:09,439
ourselves to the short term shortterm

1068
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:11,440
brand is and uh and of course

1069
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,000
corporations corporations just don't

1070
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,079
wake up one day and say I'm going to do

1071
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,440
business that say how can I you know how

1072
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,880
can I create my business in a way that's

1073
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:24,039
going to give me the most profit and

1074
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,640
that means you have to play out to that

1075
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:29,480
kind of culture that's out there people

1076
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:32,199
want to have the shortterm for

1077
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:34,519
themselves so how do we make cult how do

1078
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:36,879
we change cultural issues and that's a

1079
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:38,239
you know that's a huge problem I don't

1080
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,280
think that's going to happen from the

1081
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:42,838
top down I think this these are changes

1082
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,880
that have to come from the bottom up and

1083
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:45,920
again one of the things that's

1084
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,960
encouraging to me is there's a there's a

1085
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,480
body of literature now that's coming out

1086
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,480
which is helping us to understand that

1087
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,960
these cultural transitions need to take

1088
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,599
place and U Paul Roberts does a much

1089
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,800
better job describing the problem he was

1090
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,000
coming up with an answer but

1091
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,920
nevertheless he points in these

1092
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,559
different directions but marjerie Kelly

1093
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,119
uh who published a book a few years ago

1094
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:09,880
called owning our future she makes a

1095
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:11,440
very compelling case that this economy

1096
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,318
that we're in now what she calls the

1097
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,519
extractive economy where each of us try

1098
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:17,960
to grab as much for out possible that's

1099
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:19,519
now increasingly becoming dysfunctional

1100
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,920
again you don't have all the resources

1101
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:24,280
to keep that working and you've got

1102
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,200
these concentrations of wealth that

1103
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,839
leave so many people out that it doesn't

1104
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:30,480
serve the common in our community and

1105
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:32,759
then what's starting to evolve now is

1106
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,599
what she calls the generative economy

1107
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,839
where people in communities are starting

1108
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:39,838
to work together for what she calls the

1109
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:41,838
common flourishing of life and uh she

1110
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:42,960
gives some practical examples of you

1111
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:45,078
know the kinds of things that are

1112
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,039
starting to happen in various places so

1113
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:50,599
I think if we can begin to point to some

1114
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:52,558
of these generative economy

1115
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:55,039
emergence and and some of them are

1116
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:57,760
happening actually in agriculture she

1117
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:01,679
points out that uh you know where groups

1118
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,599
of farmers uh pool their production and

1119
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,759
have their own brand and establish these

1120
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:08,119
relationships with their customers you

1121
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,079
know like organic valley and Shepherd's

1122
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:12,960
grain and N branch and natural country

1123
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:15,039
Beach you know the number of of mountain

1124
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,880
they're actually now economically much

1125
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:22,920
more successful than the corporate uh

1126
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:26,240
you know individual trying to grab his

1127
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:28,240
much and uh just as one example the

1128
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:30,838
average age of fers now is

1129
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:34,399
58.3 the average age of the farmers in

1130
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:36,480
each of these uh I call the values based

1131
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,480
value chains is in the mid 40s are

1132
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,480
getting younger so we I think as we

1133
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,440
start to see that there is a success

1134
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:47,119
pattern that moves in this other

1135
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,480
direction that actually is more uh based

1136
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,680
on the common good and the this

1137
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:53,559
generative economy this common fishing

1138
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:55,480
flight that that actually works better

1139
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:57,359
than where each of us credit gra for

1140
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:00,159
ourselves and that could begin to to

1141
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:02,358
take us in the direction of uh changing

1142
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:04,639
changing our culture that I'm not saying

1143
00:44:02,358 --> 00:44:08,078
that's going to happen tomorrow but at

1144
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:08,078
least it's already happening at some

1145
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,920
placage I'm not trying to be cynical I

1146
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:16,519
agree with everything you're saying but

1147
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:20,159
I I just wonder about the political

1148
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:23,559
economy you has power and influence to

1149
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:26,199
do this at scale and I don't see the

1150
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:29,680
incentives for business or the

1151
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:31,879
politicians that fun to really change

1152
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:35,558
our complete food system even though

1153
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:37,880
it's necessary so we've seen all of the

1154
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:39,640
indicators about climate change for

1155
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:42,640
example we know it's coming it's

1156
00:44:39,639 --> 00:44:44,679
imminent and yet we're really struggling

1157
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:47,879
to actually make significant policy

1158
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:49,919
changes to reverse course there's a huge

1159
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,960
momentum to keep everything the way that

1160
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,838
it is related to the food system related

1161
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,280
to

1162
00:44:53,838 --> 00:45:00,759
urbanization and our power structur so

1163
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,559
how how do we grapple with that and yeah

1164
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,839
really important question and I I don't

1165
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:07,119
mean to uh pretend that that's not part

1166
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:09,199
of our

1167
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,240
culture but here's the other thing that

1168
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:16,639
I think we need to pay attention to that

1169
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:18,598
is that um uh you know uh in our in our

1170
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:21,000
in our in our current system which you

1171
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:23,680
know obviously still working for you

1172
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,239
know certain segments of the economy and

1173
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:28,199
uh and if it weren't working for uh

1174
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:30,838
Corporation they wouldn't be doing it

1175
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:34,000
anymore but you know again if you start

1176
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:36,838
to look at the early indicators of some

1177
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,400
changes that are taking place uh let me

1178
00:45:36,838 --> 00:45:41,440
just give you a couple of examples uh

1179
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,960
cargo Corporation has one of been one of

1180
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:47,960
the biggest uh Defenders of uh GMOs in

1181
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:50,480
our food system and have contributed to

1182
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:53,800
not having any labeling Etc they've not

1183
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,480
come out with a non GMO variety of

1184
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:59,079
soil uh the Hershey Corporation made a

1185
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,240
decision here uh a couple weeks ago that

1186
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:03,519
they're going to transition to a total

1187
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:05,639
non why are they doing this they're

1188
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:08,719
doing this because public is their

1189
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:10,239
consuming public is increasingly saying

1190
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:12,838
that we want to see some changes in the

1191
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:14,598
food system now the important thing and

1192
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:17,480
this is where the power part of it comes

1193
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:20,240
the important thing about all of this is

1194
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:23,800
that uh if you're in the food

1195
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:27,039
business you C Food customers have a lot

1196
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:29,079
more power than if you're in uh

1197
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:31,358
automobile manufacturing or computer

1198
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:34,880
manufacturing business because in fact

1199
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:37,558
we had a um U Cooperative Extension

1200
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:40,800
individual in Iowa who did a research

1201
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:43,400
project this was about 10 years ago and

1202
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,800
she made a case for the fact that she

1203
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:49,480
thought that food customers had much

1204
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:51,760
more power than any other customers

1205
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,599
because if you're a company and you're

1206
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,800
producing automobiles or computers as

1207
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,200
she put it and if you lose a couple of

1208
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,200
customers you can always get your

1209
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:01,960
existing customers to upgrade more often

1210
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:03,838
or buy a second car or a second computer

1211
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,720
ET if you're in the food business and

1212
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:08,400
you lose a customer you can't just get

1213
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:10,078
your current customers to eat to so

1214
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,240
people in the food business have a lot

1215
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,760
of power so when she did in the course

1216
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:16,399
that she was teaching she asked her

1217
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:21,280
students to do a research project and

1218
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:24,440
she asked the students to uh go to uh

1219
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,960
supermarkets and um find out how many

1220
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:29,159
people had to go into the supermarket

1221
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,920
and ask the manager for a particular

1222
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:33,558
product that they wanted in the same

1223
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:37,039
week or how long would it take in order

1224
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:39,359
for that Supermarket to start putting

1225
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:41,440
the new part prod in sh and what they

1226
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:43,920
found without exception was that if 15

1227
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,639
students went into the same supermarket

1228
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,960
and ask the manager for a particular

1229
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:49,400
product that product would appear in the

1230
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,559
sh and she used that as an example of

1231
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:54,838
the

1232
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:57,920
power in business so here's my view I

1233
00:47:54,838 --> 00:48:00,199
mean I fully agree with you that today

1234
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,960
uh our political system is almost

1235
00:48:00,199 --> 00:48:03,919
entirely controlled by the vested

1236
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:07,519
interest who the vested

1237
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:10,400
interest Farm groups they're the input

1238
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:12,639
suppliers food processors all who have

1239
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,920
made huge investments in the current

1240
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:16,960
system and they've made huge investments

1241
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,838
in the current system because we all

1242
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,440
said what we wanted to want food fast

1243
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:22,000
convenient and cheap and that's exactly

1244
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,159
what they delivered now after they've

1245
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
invested billions of dollars we want to

1246
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:27,480
go to say you know we'd like to have you

1247
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,960
make some changes here

1248
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:33,199
well it's not going to happen right but

1249
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:34,760
what is happening and can happen is that

1250
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:36,879
instead of us going to them and saying

1251
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:39,520
we like to have you make these changes

1252
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,720
is being working together in our own

1253
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:43,559
communities and as you have more

1254
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:46,118
customers that say this is what we want

1255
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:47,800
in our food system and this incidentally

1256
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:50,200
uh is beginning to happen particularly

1257
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:52,798
in our Urban centers where there is this

1258
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:55,798
Evolution What I Call Food citizens you

1259
00:48:52,798 --> 00:48:59,759
know Bill heern who uh he retired now

1260
00:48:55,798 --> 00:49:02,400
but he was Ro sociology uh professor at

1261
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:05,040
the University of Missouri and Columbia

1262
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,960
University university and he's I think

1263
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:09,599
done more research than anybody else on

1264
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,760
the concentration at the retail level of

1265
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:13,519
food systems and how it's that

1266
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,000
concentration which really controls much

1267
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:17,880
of the food system but then and he told

1268
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,239
me once he said if the industrial food

1269
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:24,039
system were to choose an appropriate

1270
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:24,039
local for itself it would be just e

1271
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:30,798
that but then he said that is rapidly

1272
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:33,519
coming to a close and and I think that's

1273
00:49:30,798 --> 00:49:34,960
very much true now because now it's not

1274
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:36,838
that people are simply passive

1275
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,280
resistance people are becoming active

1276
00:49:36,838 --> 00:49:42,880
engaging in their own communities and

1277
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,880
you have a large number of people in our

1278
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,760
Urban population centers where most of

1279
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,760
these food citizens are that are

1280
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:50,520
starting to say wait a minute you know

1281
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:53,720
we want a different kind of food we want

1282
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:55,480
this we want that um eventually our

1283
00:49:53,719 --> 00:49:57,519
politicians going to have to pay as much

1284
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:59,400
attention to these voting populations as

1285
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:01,280
they do to the best of interest and then

1286
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,160
we'll have the possibility I think

1287
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,200
because some changes taking place you

1288
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:07,279
know at that National level when the top

1289
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:08,719
down in the meantime we've got to be

1290
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,119
concentrating working with people from

1291
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:11,118
the bottom

1292
00:50:11,318 --> 00:50:18,599
of yes um just two two quick comments

1293
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:20,880
one is I think your talk I've really

1294
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:24,160
enjoyed your talk you're talking more

1295
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:27,200
about the US context um I'm work very

1296
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:30,519
much in South Asia where the issu are

1297
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:32,480
just the same but more more of a problem

1298
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:35,358
but one of the people you didn't mention

1299
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:38,240
is that's the farmer and I always put in

1300
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:40,519
my lectures that we we've got to produce

1301
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:43,239
the food using resources more

1302
00:50:40,519 --> 00:50:44,759
efficiently we have to minimize the

1303
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:46,399
effect on the environment but we've got

1304
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,119
to maintain the livelihoods of the

1305
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,519
people actually produce the food and we

1306
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:54,680
all want cheap food cheap Che cheap food

1307
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:57,599
is a political thing and uh if we don't

1308
00:50:54,679 --> 00:50:59,558
pay uh the farmers a fair price for

1309
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,559
their labor um we're going to have more

1310
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:03,559
and more Farmers leaving leaving the

1311
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:06,680
area going to the urban areas like like

1312
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:09,599
you see in India and China and and and

1313
00:51:06,679 --> 00:51:11,519
then what happens now another really

1314
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,599
great question and uh and you're right I

1315
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:16,039
was focusing primarily on our current

1316
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:17,400
situation in the United States Again

1317
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:20,079
part of the good news from my

1318
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:24,160
perspective what's started to happen uh

1319
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:26,720
in the developing world is uh more of a

1320
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:28,318
recognition that for them to adopt

1321
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:31,519
industrial system that we had in the

1322
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:33,759
industrial world is not con serving well

1323
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:36,079
we still got some pressure points trying

1324
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:38,079
to bring that system to uh farmers in

1325
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:40,920
the developing world but there's a

1326
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:43,200
rapidly growing uh phenomenon now where

1327
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:46,240
Farmers themselves are beginning to

1328
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:49,598
recognize that uh way in which they can

1329
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:51,759
be successful in the future is is uh and

1330
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:54,280
and there's also now five un reports

1331
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,760
that confirm this and that is that if

1332
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:58,280
you want to be if you want to really

1333
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,839
address the issu developing grow first

1334
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,640
of all you have to work with women

1335
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:04,798
because 70% of the world Farm is in

1336
00:52:01,639 --> 00:52:07,159
develop are women um secondly you have

1337
00:52:04,798 --> 00:52:11,000
to work with them in terms of their

1338
00:52:07,159 --> 00:52:13,679
local resources and their social uh

1339
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,199
capacity for working together in a more

1340
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:18,358
e eological kind of approach where again

1341
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:21,919
they use you know kind of Nature's model

1342
00:52:18,358 --> 00:52:23,719
as a as a way of producing food andc um

1343
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,798
and so these are these are things with

1344
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:29,399
the v compas v v compas group growing

1345
00:52:26,798 --> 00:52:32,798
pretty rapidly uh I was mentioning some

1346
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:35,599
people here that I'm working with a a

1347
00:52:32,798 --> 00:52:38,480
young man now was just 22 years old and

1348
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:41,599
he lives in New York at the moment um

1349
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:44,280
but he uh he has he has started a

1350
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:47,559
nonprofit organization of his own mind

1351
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:49,760
22 years old and he just got back last

1352
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:53,040
week from spending I think four weeks in

1353
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:55,400
India uh 6 weeks in Egypt and some 8

1354
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:58,279
weeks in Africa and his whole approach

1355
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:00,880
is he knows that there are individual

1356
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:02,760
Farmers each of these countries who have

1357
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,920
already figured this out and already

1358
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:07,920
examples of doing this and so he wants

1359
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,280
to try to connect other Farmers with

1360
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,200
those Farmers so they begin to develop

1361
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:16,040
kind of community approach this new

1362
00:53:12,199 --> 00:53:21,159
Direction and I'm going to

1363
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:23,798
try get support other people with help

1364
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:25,078
bring that movement there so again I

1365
00:53:23,798 --> 00:53:26,679
think there are some things that we can

1366
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:29,240
do

1367
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:31,679
but and then eventually you know Lauren

1368
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:33,679
is saying this is not only the future

1369
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:35,118
for the developing gr it's also

1370
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:36,798
eventually the future from the world in

1371
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:39,160
the us as we go through the challenges

1372
00:53:36,798 --> 00:53:40,880
we faces so you're absolutely right and

1373
00:53:39,159 --> 00:53:42,960
I didn't mean to exclude the farm the

1374
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:46,838
only reason that I put the emphasis

1375
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:49,559
where I did today is that I so often in

1376
00:53:46,838 --> 00:53:51,440
in groups of people who think this is

1377
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,839
simply a farmer problem we simply got to

1378
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,119
convince the farmers they need to make

1379
00:53:52,838 --> 00:53:57,838
these changes and I want to help us to

1380
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:00,000
understand this is social issue

1381
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:01,798
ecological issue that we all have

1382
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,079
engaged in it but working with the

1383
00:54:01,798 --> 00:54:05,079
farmers individually

1384
00:54:06,838 --> 00:54:12,719
La yes so the the focus on obviously

1385
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:15,798
production systems are focused on the

1386
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:18,519
provisioning ecosystem services but the

1387
00:54:15,798 --> 00:54:21,358
other ecosystem services that don't get

1388
00:54:18,519 --> 00:54:23,880
a lot of attention some farmers are

1389
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:26,000
actually supporting those conservation

1390
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:28,358
practices contribute to those so is

1391
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,798
there way to compensate or to

1392
00:54:28,358 --> 00:54:33,558
incentivize those other services that

1393
00:54:30,798 --> 00:54:35,960
that that are often ignored of course

1394
00:54:33,559 --> 00:54:38,240
yeah and we actually have a few small

1395
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:40,159
programs like the conservation programs

1396
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:43,118
Etc we're trying to address that but

1397
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:45,159
it's such a minor part

1398
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:48,480
of the public

1399
00:54:45,159 --> 00:54:50,358
support but you know uh a lot of these

1400
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,760
challenges that I talked about there are

1401
00:54:50,358 --> 00:54:53,880
significant

1402
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:57,000
RS that

1403
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:59,920
the national political system would

1404
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:03,719
address with relatively minor funding

1405
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:08,000
comparing to the system that we current

1406
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:12,480
subsidies but again uh that's in my view

1407
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:14,559
it's going to be uh pretty much uh a

1408
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,838
loss cause of thinking we're going to

1409
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:19,160
get we're going to be able to convince

1410
00:55:16,838 --> 00:55:21,798
people at the national political level

1411
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:23,558
either in Congress or USDA to do that

1412
00:55:21,798 --> 00:55:25,358
because they're under constant pressure

1413
00:55:23,559 --> 00:55:27,440
from the invested interest to keep the

1414
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:29,279
current system going so I think we have

1415
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,079
to bring this about you know to bring

1416
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:34,440
the pressure about from the bottom up

1417
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:37,640
and this is why my point about the power

1418
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:39,280
of uh individual consumers and bringing

1419
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:41,558
about these changes which we're starting

1420
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:46,400
to see already now major companies

1421
00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:46,400
starting to even McDonald's

1422
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:52,798
that

1423
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:56,400
signicant direction so they're hearing

1424
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:58,318
pressure from you know custom

1425
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,519
to pay attention to that so I think

1426
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:03,480
that's that's a better way to move not

1427
00:56:00,519 --> 00:56:06,480
that we should ignore you know USDA or

1428
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:10,760
these other issues and continue to and

1429
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:12,880
uh you know the the um natural uh the

1430
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:15,760
national sustainable agriculture

1431
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,358
Coalition uh which is a lobbying group

1432
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,960
in Washington we're doing some really

1433
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:21,759
good work to exactly what the think

1434
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:24,559
you're talking about and get more

1435
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:27,119
funding for conservation efforts Etc but

1436
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:28,519
they're operating in this CL

1437
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:32,960
what

1438
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:36,920
theyy but I want to see continue to BU

1439
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:40,199
effective and iue support them we to do

1440
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:40,200
that but we shouldn't expect

1441
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:47,400
suddenly wish I had better news for you

1442
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:52,480
on the short term but on the long term

1443
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:52,480
uh the uh issues

1444
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:59,880
on yeah um so a lot of us are scientists

1445
00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:02,119
so we're we're all developing science

1446
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:04,358
that changes the technologies that you

1447
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:07,519
know affect the the the production

1448
00:57:04,358 --> 00:57:08,920
systems that be using uh presumably they

1449
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:12,599
can they can change those production

1450
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:15,519
systems in in ways that you might find

1451
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:18,318
favorable more regenerative or more

1452
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:21,038
extractive I think it's difficult to um

1453
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:23,318
to tell at the outset which which way

1454
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:25,319
we're going I mean so like to my

1455
00:57:23,318 --> 00:57:27,199
daughter from the fut my granddaughter

1456
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:29,759
from the future is writing to me and

1457
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:31,960
asking me why didn't I ask I would say

1458
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,319
well I'm doing my best in trying to

1459
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:36,599
figure it out

1460
00:57:33,318 --> 00:57:38,599
right but so do you have ways of of

1461
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:43,559
helping people to figure out

1462
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:46,519
like or what kind of uh tests

1463
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:48,039
experiments do you propose people in the

1464
00:57:46,519 --> 00:57:50,000
science that they're doing sort of think

1465
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:50,960
about the direction that that their

1466
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,119
science

1467
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:56,720
Le yeah you all have really great

1468
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:58,280
questions and um you know again I think

1469
00:57:56,719 --> 00:58:00,038
again I try to I always try to look for

1470
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:04,798
where are the little pieces of good

1471
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:08,599
news talking about and for me

1472
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:08,599
uh exp a

1473
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:15,119
lot this

1474
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:25,000
new I don't want to romanticize this I

1475
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:28,119
to all of them Jesus resurrection but

1476
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,119
there is a growing

1477
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:40,200
they recognize this is their future this

1478
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:42,318
is their world and so you know example

1479
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:42,318
that

1480
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:52,039
I know the young couple that's

1481
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:52,039
managing operation

1482
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:04,960
years years years they would no more

1483
00:59:00,519 --> 00:59:04,960
think of taking their boys to a shopping

1484
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,760
mall you see these two

1485
00:59:11,159 --> 00:59:17,000
kids big smiles on their faces and

1486
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,000
taking home to

1487
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:26,798
their this is what this is what makes

1488
00:59:21,318 --> 00:59:28,679
them uh feel important and fulfill

1489
00:59:26,798 --> 00:59:29,920
and and it's their parents who are

1490
00:59:28,679 --> 00:59:31,759
really part of this millennial

1491
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,760
generation who recognize that these are

1492
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,680
the values that they want for their

1493
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,079
children because that's what's going to

1494
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:39,239
put them in a better position to meet

1495
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:42,240
the challenges in the future and they're

1496
00:59:39,239 --> 00:59:44,479
not an isolated case and you know I I

1497
00:59:42,239 --> 00:59:46,239
would tell people when I my first

1498
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,519
American history course was when I was a

1499
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:52,159
junior in high school and on the first

1500
00:59:48,519 --> 00:59:54,280
day of our class uh a teacher got up was

1501
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:56,159
a young guy could have been 25 years old

1502
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:58,839
he got up in front of us and he said I

1503
00:59:56,159 --> 01:00:00,440
want you all to understand that only 20%

1504
00:59:58,838 --> 01:00:02,639
of the American colonists were in favor

1505
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:04,119
of the American Revolution and he said

1506
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:05,558
the reason I want you to understand that

1507
01:00:04,119 --> 01:00:07,079
is because the reason you should study

1508
01:00:05,559 --> 01:00:09,359
history is so that you can learn from

1509
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:12,039
the past how you apply the lessons from

1510
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:13,598
the past to your future so he said if

1511
01:00:12,039 --> 01:00:15,319
any of you are interested in bringing on

1512
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:16,359
changes you don't need 100% when you

1513
01:00:15,318 --> 01:00:20,279
need

1514
01:00:16,358 --> 01:00:21,759
20% I've always remembered that and so

1515
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,960
you know as I think about this

1516
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:26,760
millennial generation now with these

1517
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:30,318
different kind of values with they have

1518
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:32,480
they're trying to their children um I'm

1519
01:00:30,318 --> 01:00:34,838
wondering you know do we have 20% up

1520
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:37,599
there yet I don't know surveys as far as

1521
01:00:34,838 --> 01:00:39,960
I know but I do know in my own

1522
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:42,200
engagement and involvement in the

1523
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:44,358
various Enterprises that both I State

1524
01:00:42,199 --> 01:00:46,399
University of sow Center and other

1525
01:00:44,358 --> 01:00:49,199
places that I've been I keep running

1526
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:51,838
into more and more of these young people

1527
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:55,358
who are in there early you late 20s

1528
01:00:51,838 --> 01:00:57,279
early 30s and U there are so many of

1529
01:00:55,358 --> 01:01:00,279
them at least that already in this new

1530
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,798
culture so I take again great insiration

1531
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:07,039
from that and I think part of my

1532
01:01:01,798 --> 01:01:07,038
responsibility is what can I do more

1533
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:12,760
support so I don't have a better answer

1534
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,400
to your question than that but again the

1535
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,640
fact that this is already happening I

1536
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:19,240
think is something we can support and

1537
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:21,038
more that we can do that may be a better

1538
01:01:19,239 --> 01:01:25,159
indicator of the kind of changes we want

1539
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:25,160
to see if you want to see

1540
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,039
so I think we're already over time a

1541
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:37,558
little bit um I think br will be here

1542
01:01:36,039 --> 01:01:39,839
for a couple minutes so if we want to

1543
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:43,640
just break now and thank for it again

1544
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:43,639
and uh and then we'll be around a couple

1545
01:01:47,318 --> 01:01:52,838
minutes this has been a production of

1546
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:55,838
Cornell University on the web at

1547
01:01:52,838 --> 01:01:55,838
