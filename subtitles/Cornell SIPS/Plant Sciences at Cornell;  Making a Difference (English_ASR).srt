hi my name is esther pullen i graduated

4
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,638
in 2004 with a plant science degree from

5
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:17,118
cornell

6
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,399
and when i was in high school and

7
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,679
college i

8
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,679
didn't really know if i could do

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,480
anything with a degree in agriculture

10
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,599
but i knew i loved working outdoors i

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,920
enjoyed plants

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,439
i loved my classes in agriculture when i

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,199
was at cornell

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,200
and i wanted to do something that would

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,760
make a difference that really meant

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,880
something

17
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,000
and what i've found in my year since i

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,320
graduated

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,920
is that agriculture is the foundation

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,719
for so many things that go on in the

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,640
world today

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,640
from food to fiber to energy

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,558
all of these things have a basis in

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,640
agriculture and it touches the lives of

25
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,399
everyone in the world and one of the

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,480
things that i've also found is that i'm

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,320
working for a number of different

28
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,159
companies in the produce industry and

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,679
seeing people from across

30
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,439
the world of agriculture is that there

31
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,959
are many jobs

32
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,399
in agriculture there are companies who

33
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,359
are looking for

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,159
motivated qualified individuals who have

35
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,359
passion

36
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,280
and experience in agriculture so that

37
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,000
they can

38
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,239
make wonderful things happen so if you

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,719
are interested in making a difference

40
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,679
and traveling the world seeing many new

41
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,000
things

42
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,920
then a plant sciences degree from

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,159
cornell would be a great way to start

44
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,159
that

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,240
