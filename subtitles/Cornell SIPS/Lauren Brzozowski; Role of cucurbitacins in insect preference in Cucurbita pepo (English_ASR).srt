1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,120
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:06,708
University all right thank you so today

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,169
I'm gonna be talking about the role of

4
00:00:06,708 --> 00:00:10,189
cucurbit asons in insight preference in

5
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:12,439
cheek our popipo

6
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:14,298
so for those you have heard me speak

7
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:16,429
before you know that or you may remember

8
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:18,198
that I have been working for the past

9
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:20,480
few years I'm trying to understand the

10
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:22,400
genetic and biochemical basis of striped

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,679
cucumber beetle preference and Cucurbita

12
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,959
pepo just like summer squash acorn

13
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:29,928
squash and zucchini and much this work

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,580
has been focused on resistance in leaf

15
00:00:29,928 --> 00:00:33,379
tissue since that is a tissue that

16
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:35,390
matters the most to us here in New York

17
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,609
when we transplant squash into the

18
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,009
ground so it's been looking for

19
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:43,879
preference at that level and much this

20
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:45,799
work has started with looking at screen

21
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,350
injure plasm for a beetle damage and

22
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:50,000
other beetle centric bio assays to try

23
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,270
to understand the genetic basis of

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,710
preference and also identify traits that

25
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,420
are responsible for beetle preference

26
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,939
and do selection for nog referred

27
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,100
varieties unfortunately these beetles

28
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:01,939
are somewhat challenging to work with in

29
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,920
the sense that they have

30
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:06,439
seasonally dependent behaviors like

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,030
mating and aggregation which can really

32
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,159
confound some results and is

33
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,079
unfortunately not led to a lot of gain

34
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,299
in this regard so we're trying a few

35
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,640
other approaches so one of the

36
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:18,590
approaches i'm trying is working with a

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,260
proxy in sight for these beetles that

38
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,810
neither mates nor aggregates and I'm

39
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,790
using this as a proxy for selection for

40
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,590
these beetles as well as using them to

41
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:31,580
identify other chemical traits of plants

42
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:33,170
that impact insect preference and then

43
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:34,969
what another thing I'm doing which is

44
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,849
what to be the rest of my talk is about

45
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:40,280
today is looking at traits implants that

46
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:42,679
we hypothesize may be important for

47
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,079
insect preference mapping genetically

48
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,900
mapping them creating populations with

49
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:50,150
higher low of these compounds and then

50
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,969
seeing how the beetles respond to these

51
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:55,850
plants so that the last person we

52
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:57,829
talking about today and the compounding

53
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,609
question in the title my talk is cute

54
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:00,319
Kermit asons

55
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:02,030
so to start of an overview of what

56
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:05,179
contribute agents are tell you about

57
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,620
some mapping results we have and then of

58
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,890
course talk about what this means for

59
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,959
this striped cucumber beetle so key

60
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:13,789
carbocations are intensely bitter and

61
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,560
toxic try terpenoids

62
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:18,340
there's more than 20 types of cucurbit

63
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,969
Aysen in the Cucurbitaceae family and

64
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,340
everything we know about their

65
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:25,068
biosynthesis so far is from cucumber

66
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,930
another member of the family and the Pat

67
00:02:25,068 --> 00:02:29,089
general pathway and cucumber is that

68
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:32,060
exceed o squalene an output of them a

69
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,979
lot Bev ilanic acid pathway is cyclized

70
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,560
in the cucurbit a die you know by the

71
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:39,828
bitter gene and then there's a number of

72
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,219
other steps of oxidation and to create

73
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:45,799
the final cucurbit a stone product and

74
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:48,439
in cucumber if plants had the functional

75
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:51,799
bittered allele there will be cube

76
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:53,959
basins in the cotyledons and only if the

77
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:56,359
plants have the bitter fruit or bitter

78
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,069
leaf transcription factors is the bitter

79
00:02:56,359 --> 00:03:00,250
gene expressed in those tissues and

80
00:02:58,068 --> 00:03:04,128
cucurbit asons that are in those tissues

81
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:06,019
and then for how big your raisins

82
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:08,358
relates to insects there's kind of two

83
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:11,120
main classifications of how organisms

84
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:13,069
deal if Q carpet Jason's so specialist

85
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,109
beetles light the stripe cucumber beetle

86
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:16,458
have come of all the future bets and

87
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:17,750
they actually see Quester these two

88
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:20,299
kermit eight cents for their own

89
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:23,150
defenses and so they love these hi

90
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:24,200
cucumbers taste them whereas avoid low

91
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,090
cucurbit Aysen

92
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:29,388
plants on the other hand other

93
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:32,060
herbivores like spider mites and us we

94
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:34,430
find high levels toxic and but are fine

95
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,799
with lower levels so i'm going to start

96
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:40,370
with talking about our mapping work in

97
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:44,269
cue carbonate pipo so to curb appeal has

98
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:46,039
four types of cucurbit asons dbi and e b

99
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:49,189
is the most abundant and we measure it

100
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:51,650
with HPLC its highest in the cotyledons

101
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:53,359
and low and leaves so I mentioned

102
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,579
earlier that much my previous work had

103
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:57,200
been in leaf tissue everything I want to

104
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:58,639
talk about for cucurbit a Sens is all

105
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,138
measuring and selecting in the

106
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,239
cotyledons because that's where the

107
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:04,040
compounds are the highest and I'm

108
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,560
thinking about what germ plasm to use

109
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:08,000
for this mapping it's important to know

110
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,000
that in Cucurbita pepo

111
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,128
there are two subspecies Pipo Pipo which

112
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,628
includes pumpkin and zucchini and people

113
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:16,879
chicks Dana which includes acorn squash

114
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:18,469
and summer squash well they look quite

115
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,269
similar they're indeed from separate

116
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,940
domestication events and quite

117
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:25,340
genetically distinct and we know from

118
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:27,540
previous work that beetles really prefer

119
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:30,299
Pipo Pipo and cucumber tasting

120
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,510
aliens are high in people people and the

121
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,660
reverse is true in Peter tixinha so in

122
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:38,370
knowing our two phenotypes are aligned

123
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,800
of population structure we need to make

124
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:44,340
inner sub specific crosses and evaluate

125
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,160
these phenotypes in those so that's what

126
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:49,439
we did is he made a by pencil population

127
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,350
between a high cotyledon cucurbit a some

128
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:56,310
parent from pipa people and a low high

129
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:59,790
Delina cucurbitacin parents from people

130
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:03,120
take Santa and the high parents has

131
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:05,910
again pubertus and B is the highest D

132
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,889
and then followed by de and I expression

133
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,300
of all of these are highly correlated so

134
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:11,189
if you're high and B you'll be high in

135
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,009
the rest of them and well it's hard to

136
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:15,899
see you he Kermit aces en IR appreciably

137
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:19,620
higher in the high parent than the low

138
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:22,199
parent so I looked at 200 f2 individuals

139
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,660
Regina type ton of GBS and phenotype

140
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:29,969
them for all four cucurbit asons

141
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:33,630
and then we did QTL mapping and we found

142
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:36,030
one pretty convincing peak on chromosome

143
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:37,800
5 because it's an f2 we don't have a ton

144
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:39,419
of recombination in the region so it's

145
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,850
about a five hundred kilobases window

146
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:45,360
that we have who are working so fine map

147
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:48,090
that further interestingly this is not

148
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,160
the bitter gene homolog that we know

149
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:52,379
from cucumber that's on chromosome 12

150
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,810
and if you zoom in there's nothing close

151
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:56,069
to significant so that's one line of

152
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,439
evidence that the difference that we see

153
00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:01,550
between these two populations is not due

154
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:04,379
to the bitter gene I also develop PCR

155
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,850
primers in Sanger sequence this bitter

156
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:09,060
gene homolog and there are no

157
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:10,770
indications that protein the protein

158
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,569
product would be any different between

159
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:14,699
these two parents so it seems like

160
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:16,290
there's a single gene making is

161
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:18,300
different and it's not the bitter gene

162
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:22,530
that we know so much about from cucumber

163
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:25,530
I also in this f2 population looked at

164
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:27,359
the highest and lowest producing f2 s

165
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:29,699
with three prime RNA seek to see if

166
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,410
there any genes expressed in this region

167
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:33,599
or elsewhere that would be responsible

168
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:36,150
for this phenotype and our most

169
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,790
differentially expressed gene was indeed

170
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:40,500
in this region on chromosome five and it

171
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,249
was an exceeded reductase which you

172
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,408
remember from

173
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:45,179
pathway for cucurbit Jason's there's a

174
00:06:43,408 --> 00:06:47,728
series of oxidation steps to make the

175
00:06:45,178 --> 00:06:50,008
final product so it seems plausible and

176
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:52,978
it is highly expressed in both the hi

177
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:55,019
parents and the high F 2 s and not

178
00:06:52,978 --> 00:07:00,298
expressed in the low parent and low F

179
00:06:55,019 --> 00:07:02,429
choose so yeah so we think we found

180
00:07:00,298 --> 00:07:04,798
possibly a single gene that controlled

181
00:07:02,428 --> 00:07:07,978
speaker Jason content in Q karbala pipo

182
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:09,628
and then bring this back to what the

183
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:11,128
implicit the motivation for this what

184
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:14,369
the implications for striped cucumber

185
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:15,869
beetles are so I'll remind you again

186
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:18,329
that there's these two subspecies

187
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:20,759
pepomattic Sina if you recall that our

188
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:23,338
high cuddly incubation parent was from

189
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,649
to curb the pepo beetles love both

190
00:07:23,338 --> 00:07:28,288
leaves and cotyledons from the species

191
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:30,288
so we expect that the high parents gonna

192
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:32,938
have a lot of leaf and cotyledon damage

193
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:34,949
and the reverse is true for text a know

194
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:36,778
what I haven't told you yet is that leaf

195
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:38,879
cue Kermit a scents are low in both

196
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:41,459
subspecies that mentioned they were low

197
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,799
they're low across the board and even if

198
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:45,869
we try to induce cucumber tastes and

199
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:47,638
defenses through or bibury by the

200
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:49,619
striped cucumber beetle or other forms

201
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,629
of herbivore II the plant doesn't ever

202
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:55,829
respond by producing more cucurbit a

203
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:58,110
sense so so to answer the question of

204
00:07:55,829 --> 00:08:00,119
what selecting for coddling and cucurbit

205
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,759
asons means for striped cucumber beetles

206
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:05,009
from the FT population I told you about

207
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:08,399
I selected the extreme of twos and I

208
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:11,549
self them to make f2 derived f3 family

209
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:14,369
is about 15 from either extreme and I

210
00:08:11,548 --> 00:08:16,918
measured damage in the field so starting

211
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:19,110
with cotyledons so you can see our high

212
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:21,959
parents gets a lot of I'm sorry much

213
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:27,899
sure why that's like that well it's

214
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:29,579
supposed to be 50 and onward so anyway

215
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:30,959
so our high parent gets a lot of cattle

216
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:32,610
eat and damage and our low parent

217
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,229
doesn't likely would expect because of

218
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,839
the subspecies difference and because of

219
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:39,809
a cute Kermit Jason difference and when

220
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:42,169
we select for cuddling Keuka mutations

221
00:08:39,808 --> 00:08:45,600
we see the same pattern for

222
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:47,759
beetle damage in the high qk rotation F

223
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,040
threes and Loki turbinates and F trees

224
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,019
which is good that's what we would

225
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:54,899
expect based on the evolutionary history

226
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:57,960
of the beetle with this compound

227
00:08:54,899 --> 00:09:01,500
and nice to see that this would work as

228
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:06,060
a selection strategy for defending

229
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:08,429
euchre cotyledons against beetles on the

230
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:09,959
other hands and leaf tissue so again

231
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:11,879
these are these two separate subspecies

232
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,350
so we expect the high parent from the

233
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:16,110
preferred subspecies to have a lot of

234
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:18,690
damage compared to a low parent and we

235
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:21,360
see that again and there's a few reasons

236
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:24,030
why we may believe that selecting for

237
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,000
cotyledon cucumber Tysons may affect

238
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:29,009
leaf damage so for instance beetles

239
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,990
could be attracted to the cotyledons and

240
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:33,210
then move up to the leaves and damage

241
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:36,750
the leaves from there or perhaps there's

242
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:39,120
other related terpenoid compounds from

243
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,700
the biosynthetic pathway that provide a

244
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,460
signal let attracts the beetles to these

245
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,410
plants however we don't see any

246
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:51,990
difference in leaf damage between these

247
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:53,909
two selections so we find that leaf

248
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,519
damage is independent of cotyledon

249
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:58,799
cucurbit asons

250
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,960
so what does control leaf damage

251
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,179
well we've measured I measured a lot of

252
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,160
things including the phloem stat SAP how

253
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:08,549
sticky it is and like the mandibles of

254
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:10,980
beetles leaf nutrition and neither those

255
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:13,620
are is appreciably different between the

256
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:16,080
subspecies um however from some of the

257
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,399
work with the insight proxy I was

258
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,100
telling you about we have some exciting

259
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:22,409
results about volatile deterrents in the

260
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,920
non preferred subspecies and are making

261
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:25,679
progress

262
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:30,509
hopefully in selecting with this proxy

263
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:32,909
insect so in summary we've mapped a

264
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:35,759
kookabura hastened biosynthesis low SIA

265
00:10:32,909 --> 00:10:38,069
and Cucurbita pepo and showed that low

266
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:42,240
cotyledon cucurbit a syns reduces beetle

267
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:44,420
damage Inc yes in cotyledons

268
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:49,049
but leaf damage is independent of that

269
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:51,449
and if that I would like to thank my lab

270
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:55,250
and committee a lot of people in the

271
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:58,310
chemical ecology area and all my funding

272
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:12,799
thank you

273
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:15,849
I don't have any questions wise when

274
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:18,500
you're you think of mapping population

275
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,450
how do you fina tired it's just like you

276
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,230
got beaten by a beetle and you didn't

277
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:26,089
this is just damaged yeah so for this we

278
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:28,220
actually used to be phenotypes the

279
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:30,070
cotyledon for cucurbit tasting content

280
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,330
so we just cut off a cotyledon and

281
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:34,970
extract it from there and then took DNA

282
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:37,520
from the leaf tissue later but in

283
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:40,278
previous mapping work we have yeah just

284
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,419
looked at damage to leaves and then

285
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:43,419
sequence them later

286
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:48,860
yes different classes of insect

287
00:11:47,149 --> 00:12:00,019
predators like the specialize there's

288
00:11:48,860 --> 00:12:02,419
just general ones if you reduce that's a

289
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:04,189
great question so the question was if

290
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:06,139
you are selecting for lowered cucurbit

291
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,150
asons to protect against beetles that

292
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:10,659
can be a problem for other insects and

293
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:13,459
the answer is yes it very well could be

294
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:14,929
but kind of like you were alluding to

295
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,790
actually in New York the striped

296
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:20,659
cucumber beetle is by far our biggest

297
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:22,429
pest problem and it's so it's kind of

298
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:25,459
and we don't have a lot of other pests

299
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:27,679
that we see as important as important as

300
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:36,860
a strike cucumber beetle so may be worth

301
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:40,639
the trade-off in this region that these

302
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:43,129
volatile potentially are sort of

303
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,559
correlated in the parents so

304
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:47,809
carbocations goes with certain follicles

305
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:50,569
in the one parent and not the other

306
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:52,129
parent but then once you want to make

307
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:55,730
thematic population they're they're

308
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:58,159
uncorrelated in the population yeah so

309
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,230
yeah I probably didn't do a great job

310
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:02,449
explaining this so the key here but a

311
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,700
since they're pretty large compounds so

312
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,890
they are not volatile but other parts

313
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,120
like intermediate steps are small enough

314
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:12,240
that they could be volatile compounds

315
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,778
and our hypothesis for why high

316
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,720
cucurbitacin content in the leaves could

317
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:22,860
be due to some of those intermediate or

318
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:24,240
byproduct compounds but the volatile

319
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,149
result I was talking about has nothing

320
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,799
to do if you carbon taste it's we think

321
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:42,149
it's a set we don't know what it is but

322
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:45,729
it seems to be a separate compound yes

323
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:45,730
[Laughter]

324
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:51,949
